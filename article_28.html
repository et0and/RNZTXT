            <p>People are urged not to eat meth-laced pills disguised as white lollies that ended up in food parcels because they could be lethal.</p>
        
            <p>Pills of methamphetamine disguised as Rinda-brand pineapple lollies were discovered in parcels handed out by Auckland's City Mission on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Each contained three grams of meth, which is up to 300 regular doses.</p>
        
            <p>If you're affected, here's what you need to know.</p>
        
            <p>Drug Foundation's Ben Birks Ang said they were concerned there could be more pills disguised as lollies out there.</p>
        
            <p>People who have consumed them reported a bitter, chemical taste.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who may have tried one of these lollies and noticed an unpleasant taste, should spit it out and seek immediate medical help - call 111.</p>
        
            <p>Ang said people who may have consumed the drug should look out for chest pain, racing heart, seizures, loss of consciousness.</p>
        
            <p>It was not possible to get high from touching meth but people who tasted it, even spitting it out quickly, were likely to have felt an impact, he said.</p>
        
            <p>People can also call the National Poisons centre on 0800 764 766.</p>
        
            <p>What are the symptoms?</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who has received a food parcel from the Auckland City Mission recently is being asked to check to make sure it does not contain the meth-laced lollies.</p>
        
            <p>Any such lollies should be kept securely out of reach of children.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who received a food parcel with Rinda brand pineapple lollies is asked to contact police on the 105 phone service quoting the file number 240813/5919, or through Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
