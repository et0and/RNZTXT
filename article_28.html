        <h2>NZ's hardline anti-nuclear policy 'is a mistake' - ex-Trump adviser</h2>
        <p>
An adviser to three US Presidents, John Bolton, says he worries New Zealand could be "spun off on its own" in an increasingly dangerous world. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Former White House National Security Advisor John Bolton said New Zealand "should recognise there's a difference between nuclear weapons and nuclear power - even on naval warships."</p>
        
            <p>Bolton said nuclear technology had come a long way since nuclear disasters like the Chernobyl meltdown reinforced New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance.</p>
        
            <p>"If you want to establish the taboo for nuclear weapons, okay, I get that, but for nuclear power itself, I just think it is a mistake."</p>
        
            <p>Bolton served under the Reagan administration in the 1980s - when New Zealand, under David Lange's Labour government, banned nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships from entering New Zealand waters.</p>
        
            <p>It strained diplomatic relations with the US, leading to a suspension of New Zealand's military obligations under the Australia, New Zealand and United States Security treaty (ANZUS).</p>
        
            <p>Full defence cooperation was reestablished in 2012, but New Zealand's nuclear-free policy remained.</p>
        
            <p>Bolton said that while he disagrees with the policy, the US has "learned to deal with it."</p>
        
            <p>"If it didn't change, we'd still deal with it. It's not disqualifying as the potential interest in AUKUS. It hasn't affected our close relations."</p>
        
            <p>AUKUS is a security alliance between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, announced in 2021 as a response to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>A major part of the agreement allows for Australia to acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered - but conventionally armed - submarines.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's no-nukes stance effectively prevented participation in the alliance.</p>
        
            <p>A potential AUKUS Pillar Two arrangement would not involve nuclear submarines, but progress on this is still at an early stage.</p>
        
            <p>"But going forward in what I think is an increasingly dangerous world, I don't want to see New Zealand, however far away it is from other large bodies of land, I don't want to see it spun off on its own," Bolton said. "Because you'll simply be at greater risk."</p>
        
            <p>"Personally, I wish you would join Pillar One too."</p>

Bolton was the longest-serving of Donald Trump's four National Security Advisors, in the role for about 18 months.

            <p>Bolton, a life-long Republican strategist, served under the Reagan, Bush and Trump administrations.</p>
        
            <p>He was National Security Advisor during the Trump presidency, before being fired by Trump via Twitter following disagreements on foreign policy.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's [Trump] done a lot of damage, certainly to the credibility of our institutions, people's faith in the system and the Constitution. And I think if he's elected to a second term, he'll do a lot more damage," he told RNZ's 30 with Guyon Espiner.</p>
        
            <p>"He's not fit to be president, that's clear. And the damage he will do will cost us a lot to repair."</p>
        
            <p>But he stopped short of following the lead of fellow Republicans in endorsing Democratic candidate Kamala Harris' bid for the White House.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to vote for either one of them. I don't think either one should be president."</p>
