        <h2>What is hurricane season and why is it so dangerous?</h2>
        <p>
Milton is the latest hurricane to strike Florida, coming just weeks after deadly Helene. But why now? Here's what you need to know.

            <p>Milton is the latest hurricane to strike the southeastern coast of the United States, just two weeks after Hurricane Helene caused widespread devastation and killed hundreds in the area.</p>
        
            <p>It is is the ninth hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and the fourth major hurricane (defined as a hurricane forecast to cause devastating or catastrophic damage).</p>

            <p>But why do so many hurricanes form during this 'season'? When does it run until? And how does it differ throughout the world?</p>
        
            <p>Here's what you need to know.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricane season is a time of year when hurricanes (also referred to as typhoons or tropical cyclones) usually develop.</p>
        
            <p>There are seven different hurricane seasons covering different parts of the globe.</p>
        
            <p>The seasons usually run during the summer and autumn months in each area, when warmer seas make it more likely that damaging storms will develop.</p>
        
            <p>The exception to this is the Northwest Pacific typhoon season, which runs all year round.</p>

            <p>The Atlantic hurricane season - which has produced Helene and Milton - is currently in full force.</p>
        
            <p>In Aotearoa, our cyclone season (the southwest Pacific cyclone season) begins in November and ends in April.</p>
        
            <p>Here are the dates for each season, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:</p>
        
            <p>Each season has a 'peak' - when cyclones or hurricanes are most likely to be formed. In the Atlantic, the peak is in early- to mid-September, while here in Aotearoa, cyclone season peaks in late February/early March.</p>

            <p>Hurricanes need a specific set of meteorological ingredients to develop.</p>
        
            <p>According to the US government's National Ocean Service, these ingredients are:</p>
        
            <p>Warm water is crucial to the development of a hurricane, and that is much more likely during the summer and autumn months.</p>
        
            <p>That is also the reason why colder areas, away from the equator, don't have their own hurricane seasons.</p>
        
            <p>The hurricane's rapid intensification to a Category 5 was fueled by unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico. Human-driven warming is linked to stronger and more rapidly intensifying hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Climate change also has something to do with it. Global warming has led to hotter seas, which are linked to "stronger and more rapidly intensifying hurricanes", NASA Earth says.</p>
        
            <p>Milton's rapid intensification to a category 5 hurricane - the most severe - was "fuelled by unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico", it says.</p>
        
            <p>Milton's intensity continues to fluctuate, however, and it has been downgraded to a category 4 at time of writing.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing on NBC News, meteorologist John Morales broke down as he described the likely impact of the hurricane, labelling it "horrific", and its link to climate change.</p>
        
            <p>"The seas are just incredibly, incredibly hot. A record hot," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You know what's driving that, I don't need to tell you: Global warming, climate change, leading to this and becoming an increasing threat."</p>
        
            <p>I debated whether to share this. I did apologize on the air. But I invite you to read my introspection on @BulletinAtomic of how extreme weather  driven by global warming has changed me. Frankly, YOU should be shaken too, and demand #ClimateActionNow. https://t.co/09vxgabSmX https://t.co/GzQbDglsBG</p>
        
            <p>It's unusual, but yes.</p>
        
            <p>Taking the Atlantic hurricane season as an example, about 19 in every 20 hurricanes forms between 1 June and 30 November, but US government statistics show some do fall outside that window - most commonly in May.</p>
        
            <p>In the Southwest Pacific, about 96 percent of all cyclone activity falls within our season of 1 November - 30 April, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Off-season hurricanes or cyclones do not usually make landfall and are usually less deadly than in-season hurricanes - but that is not to say they can't kill.</p>
        
            <p>The deadliest off-season cyclone in the Southwest Pacific was Tropical Cyclone Namu in May 1986, which took more than 100 lives in the Solomon Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The northern parts of New Zealand will be at normal to higher-than-normal risk of a tropical cyclone when the season begins in a few weeks' time.</p>
        
            <p>The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) and MetService say between 0-1 cyclones are expected to affect Aotearoa between November and April.</p>
        
            <p>That represents a "normal-elevated" risk level.</p>
        
            <p>Between six and 10 named cyclones could hit the Southwest Pacific during the season, with nine being the long-term average, the services say.</p>
