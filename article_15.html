            <p>Cadbury made the call to stop making chocolate fish last year, and stock of the 20g treat is nearly finished.</p>
        
            <p>One of the most favourite chocolate treats in New Zealand will soon be swiped from shelves - Cadbury has stopped making 20g chocolate fish.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to end their run was made last year, and stock has been depleting since," a Cadbury spokesperson confirmed in a statement to RNZ on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, they just haven't been as popular with Kiwi consumers over recent years as they had been in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"It became harder to secure shelf-space alongside other bars and snacking innovations in stores and harder for them to find their place on the production runs."</p>
        
            <p>Smaller "sprat" versions would still available in Cadbury Kiwi Favourites boxes, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Or if you're prepared to fork out a little extra for your favourite flavoured fish, local confectionary company Queen Anne sells a single, individually wrapped 50g chocolate fish for $3 and boxes of fish bites.</p>
        
            <p>In other classic sweets to be dropped, earlier this year Whittacker's confirmed it was removing Toffee Bars from the lineup.</p>
        
            <p>Back in 2009 Cadbury caused a kerfuffle when it announced it was binning popular Snifters and Tangy Fruits from its Pascall brand lineup.</p>
