            <p>An Oklahoma judge has exonerated a man who was in prison for almost half a century for a 1974 murder, the longest wrongful sentence to be served in the US.</p>
        
            <p>Glynn Simmons, 70, was freed in July when a judge ordered a new trial.</p>
        
            <p>But a county district attorney said on Monday there was not enough evidence to warrant one.</p>
        
            <p>In an order on Tuesday, Oklahoma County District Judge Amy Palumbo declared Simmons innocent.</p>
        
            <p>"This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offence for which Mr Simmons was convicted, sentenced and imprisoned... was not committed by Mr Simmons," she said in a ruling.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lesson in resilience and tenacity," Simmons told reporters after the decision, according to the Associated Press. "Don't let nobody tell you that it can't happen, because it really can."</p>
        
            <p>Simmons had served 48 years, one month and 18 days in prison for the murder of Carolyn Sue Rogers during a liquor store robbery in an Oklahoma City suburb. That makes him the longest-serving inmate to be cleared, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.</p>
        
            <p>Simmons was 22 years old when he and a co-defendant, Don Roberts, were convicted and sentenced to death in 1975.</p>
        
            <p>The punishments were later reduced to life in prison because of US Supreme Court rulings on the death penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Simmons had said he was in his home state of Louisiana at the time of the murder.</p>
        
            <p>A district court vacated his sentence in July after finding that prosecutors had not turned over all evidence to defence lawyers, including that a witness had identified other suspects.</p>
        
            <p>Simmons and Roberts were convicted in part because of testimony from a teenager who had been shot in the back of the head. The teenager pointed to several other men during police line-ups.</p>
        
            <p>Roberts was released on parole in 2008.</p>
        
            <p>Wrongfully convicted people who serve time in Oklahoma are eligible for up to $175,000 in compensation.</p>
        
            <p>Simmons is currently battling liver cancer, according to his GoFundMe, which has raised thousands of dollars to help support his living costs and chemotherapy.</p>
