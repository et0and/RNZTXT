            <p>Public servants' jobs are on the chopping block as the sector scrambles to meet the Finance Minister's cost-cutting targets. Find out how many jobs are going and where.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis has directed ministries and agencies to slash expenditure by either 6.5 percent or 7.5 percent to help reduce annual public service spending by $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>And with many ministries yet to release their plans for the cuts, that number will only continue to grow. Minister for Regulation David Seymour previously indicated it could hit 7500.</p>

            <p>Here's what we know so far about job losses.</p>
        
            <p>About 130 roles could go at the Department of Conservation, with a number already vacant.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has called for voluntary redundancies, and there could be forced redundancies, numbering potentially into the hundreds, according to the PSA.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE has confirmed 286 jobs were going, or had already gone, at the ministry. Some cuts happened early in the year, before Willis' directives. Others happened during a round of voluntary redundancies in March.</p>
        
            <p>Further reductions were under way in Te Whakatairanga Service Delivery and Digital, Data and Insights Group teams, subject to a consultation process, a spokesman told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry looks set to cut its staff number to 150. This includes 23 are already vacant roles, while 11 will be redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>The agency is proposing to cut about 10 percent of its workforce - between 35 to 40 roles, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 90 jobs were going at Niwa, according to the PSA, with 30 of them currently vacant. Niwa said the cuts would have no impact on its core work, according to the union.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry was proposing to cut 134 jobs in total - some of them already vacant.</p>
        
            <p>A quarter of all positions would be disestablished (271), while 137 new positions were proposed.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation was set to close on 26 April and a final decision made in June.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development has called for voluntary redundancies in the service delivery, Māori communities and partnerships teams, as well as those in human resources, policy, strategy and communications. </p>
        
            <p>The PSA said the move could affect hundreds of workers. </p>
        
            <p>The ministry was proposing to cut around 231 staff.</p>
        
            <p>Employees were informed by email that it wished to reduce staff numbers by an estimated 9 percent, including vacancies but also disestablishing roles.</p>
        
            <p>In total, 384 roles would go, of which 40 percent were vacant.</p>
        
            <p>DIA has announced a first round of job cuts - with 28 jobs set to go at the National Library and its Māori Strategy and Performance team as part of cost cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile it has confirmed the vast majority of the more than 400 staff working on the previous Government's  national water reform will be gone by end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry was set to lose close to half of its staff. The PSA said the ministry informed staff it was considering shedding 63 positions. That included 32 people currently employed and 31 vacant roles.</p>
        
            <p>There has already been a net reduction of 24 roles across the organisation, most of which were vacant, said chief executive Audrey Sonerson.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry made a number of staff redundant and got rid of vacancies it had been struggling to fill and did not intend to make further staffing changes at this stage, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ says there were 29 job losses in December 2023 as part of its change process.  </p>
        
            <p>A product and services review began in February which could result in “further changes” to the organisational structure, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury has proposed axing 50 jobs by disestablishing roles, ending fixed term contracts and closing vacancies. </p>
        
            <p>Final numbers could not be confirmed until budget decisions in May. </p>
        
            <p>Thirty-three Customs staff have accepted voluntary redundancy or early retirement. The service was considering further options to meet the required savings, including reviewing existing vacancies, it said.</p>
        
            <p>At Crown Law, 17 roles will be disestablished. Of those, nine were currently vacant - meaning eight people would lose their jobs, which was about 3.5 percent of its staff.</p>
        
            <p>Crown Law said the new structure would be in place from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has begun consultations about reducing the number of permanent staff by 14 percent and its work out of regional government offices in Hamilton, New Plymouth, Napier, and Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA told RNZ it was not clear how many jobs would be lost, but it could be around nine - with 32 roles to be disestablished and replaced with 23 new ones.</p>
        
            <p>On 8 April, Callaghan Innovation said about 30 FTE science and engineering jobs in its Innovation Expertise Hapū were being consulted on.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment-funded research organisation said it had not been asked to make a specific percentage of savings, but its board had directed a refocus on its original purpose, which was to support industry-led science and technology-based innovation - and its commercialisation.</p>
        
            <p>The agency employed 382 full time staff, meaning the proposed changes could affect just under 8 percent of its workforce. A final decision could be expected in May or June.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe announced in November last year 113 jobs were going. It said there have been no reductions in inspector or investigator roles.</p>
        
            <p>The commission is cutting 28 roles, with the PSA saying they are mainly held by women. </p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association says of the 28 roles, which include administration and clerical positions, nine are vacant.</p>
        
            <p>This week may also be a big one with announcements at large ministries such as the Ministry of Education and Oranga Tamariki. </p>
        
            <p>* RNZ's job loss numbers are based on statements from the ministries and the PSA. Total staff numbers are based on Public Service Commission figures from 31 December 2023.</p>
