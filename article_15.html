            <p>Some 15 million people voted in a symbolic primary organised by Turkey's main opposition CHP in a mass show of support for Istanbul's newly deposed mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the municipality said.</p>
        
            <p>"Out of a total of 15 million votes, 13,211,000 are solidarity votes," the municipality said of the long-planned primary at which Imamoglu was to have been named the party's candidate for the 2028 presidential race.</p>
        
            <p>Observers said it was the looming primary that triggered the move against Imamoglu, widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout Sunday (local time), voters flocked to ballot boxes in 81 cities after the CHP opened up the poll beyond its 1.7 million party members to anyone who wanted to participate.</p>
        
            <p>People turned out in such large numbers that voting was extended by an extra three-and-a-half hours.</p>

            <p>Imamoglu was detained early on Wednesday, sparking mass protests that have spread across Turkey. The ballot took place as an Istanbul court formalised his arrest in a corruption probe.</p>
        
            <p>Several hours later, the interior ministry suspended him as mayor as he was sent to a prison on the megacity's western outskirts.</p>
