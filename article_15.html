            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced plans to visit India next week.</p>
        
            <p>Peters is expected to visit the Indian cities of New Delhi and Ahmedabad between 10 and 13 March, with plans to meet his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, and the chief minister of Gujarat State, Bhupendra Patel.</p>
        
            <p>This is the minister's first visit to South and Southeast Asia since the new coalition government was formed last year.</p>
        
            <p>Upon returning from India, Peters is scheduled to stop in at Jakarta, Indonesia, on 14 and 15 March and then Singapore on 15 March. He lands back in New Zealand on 16 March.</p>
        
            <p>Calling India a "massive economy", Peters noted it's time that New Zealand started to make serious progress in its relations with India.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't paid much time to the relationship in the past," Peters told reporters. "We have to look introspectively on what we have done wrong in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"I am out to set things right. That's why I am also going to Gujarat, which is a huge province in terms of wealth. I believe we can do much better [in terms of relationship between the two countries]."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to significant connections with New Zealand's Indian diaspora, Gujarat is widely seen as an engine of India's recent economic growth.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he will also use the trip to highlight the shared interest that New Zealand and India have in helping the development of the Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>"India is a country with which New Zealand can, should and will be doing more," Peters said. "New Zealand recognises the global and regional leadership role that India plays, and we are determined to build a broader, deeper, mutually beneficial relationship."</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition government is making South and Southeast Asia a priority because it is critical to maintaining and building New Zealand's security and prosperity."</p>
