            <p>Indian citizens have continued to be the largest contributor to the country's population growth, with 41,100 migrants entering New Zealand in the year to July, according to latest figures from Stats NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Returning New Zealand citizens totalled 25,200, followed by citizens of the Philippines (24,600) and China (23,600).</p>
        
            <p>Overall international migration in the year to July increased New Zealand's population by 13 more people for every 1,000 already living here, Stats NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>The government agency categorises migrants as people changing their country of residence, regardless of their country of citizenship or visa status. A 12-month threshold is used to classify migrants from non-migrants, aligned with international guidelines on measuring migration.</p>
        
            <p>Moreover, a migrant's original citizenship is based on the nationality of passport used to arrive in or depart from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Net migration figures of Indian citizens have increased steadily in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Net Indian migration totalling 8,199 was recorded in New Zealand in the calendar year to July 2019.</p>
        
            <p>This number grew to 33,692 in the year to July 2023, rising further to 36,972 in the year to July.</p>
        
            <p>However, net migration figures for Philippines citizens fell to 22,894 in the year to July after touching a high of 33,959 in the calendar year to July 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, net migration figures for Chinese citizens fell to 16,327 in the year to July after hitting 20,457 in the year to July 2023.</p>
        
            <p>It's worth noting that Indian migrant arrival numbers have also declined in the past six months or so.</p>
        
            <p>In the year to January, about 51,000 Indian migrants entered the country, with monthly arrivals from the South Asian nation slipping to 48,000 in the year to April and 43,200 in the year to June.</p>
        
            <p>Turning to migrant departures, New Zealand nationals comprised the largest group (81,000) in the year to July, followed by citizens of China (7,200), the United Kingdom (5,500), Australia (5,000) and India (4,100).</p>
        
            <p>Overall, latest figures showed a provisional net migration gain of 67,200 in the year to July, which included a net gain of 123,000 non-New Zealand citizens offset by a net loss of 55,800 New Zealand citizens.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ figures show that annual net migration gains have been declining from their provisional peak of 136,700 in the year to October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Considering only non-New Zealand citizens, the net migration gain touched 153,800 in the year to July 2023, falling to 123,000 in the year to July.</p>
        
            <p>The net migration rate of 13 per 1,000 in the year to July is significantly down from the rate of 26 per 1,000 recorded in the year to October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has recorded a long-term net migration gain average of 47,700 in the years spanning 2002 and 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand's net migration rate is down on last year, but is still relatively high by historical standards," says Tehseen Islam, population indicators manager at Stats NZ.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand's net migration rate in 2023 was the highest since the late 1870s, when New Zealand's population was under 1 million. The rate was also high in the early 1900s, early 2000s and mid-2010s.</p>
        
            <p>"High net migration rates in 2023 and 2024 mainly reflect the large number of migrant arrivals to New Zealand following the relaxation of COVID-19-related travel and border restrictions, both in New Zealand and overseas, from 2022."</p>
        
            <p>The latest data by Stats NZ for the year to July show two annual records for New Zealand citizens.</p>
        
            <p>The 81,000 migrant departures recorded in the year to July eclipses the previous high of 72,400 recorded in the the year to February 2012.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the net migration loss of 55,800 in the year to July exceeds the previous record of 44,400 in the year to February 2012.</p>
