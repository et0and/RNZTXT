            <p>The Warriors will roll into the start of the NRL season with plenty of momentum after a dazzling display against the Dolphins yesterday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>In their final pre-seaon hit-out, the Warriors downed the Dolphins 34-22, running in six tries at Go Media Stadium with the squad providing coach Andrew Webster plenty of selection headaches heading into round one on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Following a close loss to the Tigers in Chirstchurch last weekend, the 2023 semi finalists bounced back with a statement performance in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The big names stood up and more importantly for Webster came through unscathed ahead of their clash with the Sharks.</p>
        
            <p>The home side struck first through Marcelo Montoya on the left edge, before going back to back as Mitch Barnett steamrolled his way across the chalk.</p>
        
            <p>Dallin Watene-Zelezniak picked up where he left of last season, getting his name on the score-sheet after snaffling an intercept right on halfway, the fan-favourite grinning ear to ear as he streaked away.</p>
        
            <p>The Dolphins pulled one back before the break but the Warriors were in again shortly after oranges, Shaun Johnson finding Rocco Berry running a brilliant line.</p>
        
            <p>Jack Bostock went aerial for the visitor's second, but a Marata Niukore reasserted the advantage with a bulldozing break through the Dolphins defence.</p>
        
            <p>A late brace from the Redcliffe side reduced the damage before Ali Leiataua sealed the win in the 78th, courtesy of a nifty offload from Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will open their NRL season against the Cronulla Sharks in Auckland on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Kick off is at 8pm.</p>
