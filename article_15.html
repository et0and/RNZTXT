        <h2>'Freaking amazing': Ohakune businesses thriving after Desert Road closure</h2>
        <p>
It has been less than two weeks, but Helen Brown from Utopia Cafe said the closure had been "freaking amazing" for business so far.

            <p>Businesses in the small town of Ohakune are thriving after the closure of Desert Road.</p>
        
            <p>SH1 between Tūrangi and Waiouru - including the Desert Road - will remain closed for approximately two months from 13 January while 16 kilometres of road lane is reconstructed, drainage is improved, and about 15 kilometres of road shoulder is cleared.</p>
        
            <p>The deck of the Mangatoetoenui Bridge will also be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>A detour is in place via SH41, SH47, SH4, and SH49.</p>
        
            <p>At the southern end of Tongariro National Park lives the town of Ohakune, with SH49 - or Clyde Street - as the main road.</p>
        
            <p>It has been less than two weeks, but Helen Brown from Utopia Cafe said the closure had been "freaking amazing" for business so far.</p>
        
            <p>Utopia Cafe even put up a sign that read: "Yes! We know the Desert Road is closed. Yes! We are a lot busier! Yes! We love the business!".</p>
        
            <p>Brown said it was so the staff did not have to repeat themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone talks about Desert Road, I just point at the sign," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Utopia Cafe was known for its eggs benedict, she said, selling around 90 meals each day since the closure.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, it's really bloody busy."</p>
        
            <p>Across the road, The Mountain Rocks owner Karl Christensen said it had been "an absolute boon".</p>
        
            <p>While the licensed café had got increasingly busier since the New Zealand border opened in 2022, Christensen said the traffic flow from SH1 had increased the turnover dramatically.</p>
        
            <p>He said the scones - date, cheese, and savoury - made by head baker Joy, better known as Joyalicious, were "flying out the door".</p>
        
            <p>It was not just his business that was thriving, he added, but the entire town of Ohakune.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole area's on a buzz at the moment. It's really good to see. It's really good for business. And everyone is just prospering. It's fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>"And I think people are learning that this route is a viable option, you know, it's not just the Desert Road."</p>
        
            <p>In November, Ruapehu District Council mayor Weston Kirton told RNZ the closure of a section of Desert Road would provide a welcome boost to Ruapehu businesses hit with indifferent ski seasons and the mothballing of the Tongariro Chateau.</p>

            <p>He now believed that tourism would be the future of Ruapehu, with towns like Ohakune humming over the last two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"People haven't really taken much notice in the past, they've gone to the usual route of SH1 and not really considered the options of SH4 and the like."</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said he had spoken to an Ohakune local who said some cafés were staying open longer, enjoying the traffic flow, and breaking "all sorts of records".</p>
        
            <p>One notable example was The Chocolate Eclair Shop.</p>
        
            <p>While the owner declined an interview with RNZ, a customer who visited the bakery earlier this week was told it had sold 1100 eclairs in one day.</p>
