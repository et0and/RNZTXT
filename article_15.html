            <p>Western Springs Speedway is a burden on the ratepayer, and fewer people go there than to the corner dairy, according to Auckland's mayor.</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted to his X account on Wednesday, Wayne Brown responded to "fear-mongering nonsense going around" about his council's position on the Western Springs location.</p>
        
            <p>"To be clear, I think Speedway has a place and I want to see it flourish," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The promoter told us that Speedway at Western Springs just isn't financially viable anymore, and it puts a burden on the ratepayer of $1.2 million a year, for something that only 12,800 people went to last year.</p>
        
            <p>"That's less than go to a corner dairy."</p>
        
            <p>The highly controversial decision to evict the speedway and relocate the club south to Waikaraka Speedway was made under vote by the Auckland Council late last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to get more out of our assets and there's a much better home for Speedway, at Waikaraka Park," Brown said, adding that the Waikaraka option "will give Speedway security of tenure, with better amenities, at a location that is more accessible by public trnsport and has less concern over noise.</p>
        
            <p>"This will make Speedway more commercially viable and give it a much brighter future."</p>
        
            <p>A new football stadium has been proposed for the grounds, though a message at the end of Brown's video said no decisions have been made for the future of the stadium yet.</p>

            <p>A vocal supporter of the speedway, Albany Ward councillor John Watson told Sunday Morning's Jim Mora he's rallying against what he calls an "engineered eviction".</p>
        
            <p>"This isn't over... there are strong grounds for judicial review."</p>
        
            <p>In October, Auckland councillors voted 11-8 to spend $11 million upgrading Waikaraka Park in Onehunga which will now host the event from 2025.</p>
        
            <p>A key document that informed the council decision at the time was an officer's report showing support for the move from stakeholders such Speedway New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>However it was reported last October by Stuff that a letter to the governing body from Speedway NZ general manager Aaron Kirby, said the report was a "misrepresentation" and at no time had the organisation supported the closure of Western Springs Speedway.</p>
        
            <p>Council officers later revealed the majority of stakeholders preferred that the speedway remain at Western Springs, including Speedway NZ and Auckland QT Midget Cub, which were both listed in favour of the move in the original report.</p>
        
            <p>Watson said the Auckland Council have ignored their obligations under Local Government Act, to consult with those affected, including speedway fans.</p>

            <p>"There is also a bit of a steely resolve amongst quite a big section of the speedway fans... real anger, I'd say, at the way they have been treated... like second class citizens."</p>
        
            <p>He also questioned the $11 million estimate to upgrade Waikaraka Park for the new venue.</p>
        
            <p>"Waikaraka Park is in a pretty dilapidated state... in Sydney, where they moved the speedway out from Parramatta Stadium, it cost them over $100 million to relocate."</p>
        
            <p>But while Watson said there was still hope for the 96-year-old speedway, Saturday's Legends Night, headlined as the speedway's final event, was a spectacle typical of the iconic venue, complete with midgets, sprintcars, and other open-wheel categories.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a magnificent occasion... he speedway meets generally, are just a wonderful family atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"You just have a whole cross section of society, old people, young woman, young kids.</p>
        
            <p>"And must be about the only sporting event in Auckland where you'll never see a single policeman or police woman in sight."</p>
