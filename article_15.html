        <h2>Are robots replacing humans behind the coffee machine?</h2>
        <p>
Mechanical baristas are starting to pop up in Auckland. Should we be afraid?
</p>
        
            <p>A constant murmur of machines fills the air in a giant room without lights.</p>
        
            <p>These are China's "dark factories" - fully automated production hubs where AI-driven machines operate without human workers, pushing the boundaries of automation.</p>
        
            <p>Snippets of this technology appear to be slowly making its way to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past two years, service robots have started to pop up in hotels and restaurants, assisting with luggage handling and food delivery.</p>
        
            <p>But who could have imagined that robots would next emerge in one of the country's most-treasured roles, replacing the humble barista to make a takeaway coffee?</p>
        
            <p>With New Zealand's first robotic coffee machines crafting precision-made shots of espresso, cafes are stepping into a new era - where technology and tradition blend in every cup.</p>

            <p>Founded by tech enthusiast Andrew Joo, Folletto Caffé is believed to have introduced one of the country's first robotic baristas.</p>
        
            <p>"From a young age, I've been fascinated by machines and technology, especially those with visually engaging elements," Joo says.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to create something unique, something that would make the process of ordering and waiting for coffee more exciting."</p>
        
            <p>Imported from South Korea and customized for Kiwi tastes, the robot barista operates at two Auckland locations on Karangahape Road and Rutland Street crafting precision-made shots of espresso. Every. Single. Time.</p>
        
            <p>"Making the perfect espresso depends on multiple factors: high-quality, freshly roasted coffee beans; a fine, consistent grind; proper dose; and extraction time," Joo says.</p>
        
            <p>"Our machine is designed to automatically calibrate itself to maintain optimal extraction levels, ensuring that every cup meets our quality standards."</p>

            <p>Since launching in December, Folletto Caffé has attracted a number of curious customers.</p>
        
            <p>Pelvian Borges, 26, calls it a "unique concept".</p>
        
            <p>"I think a lot of places are getting robot. This is just a start," he says. "AI small coffee spots [make] coffee more accessible to people."</p>
        
            <p>Kristine June, a barista at Folletto Caffé, expresses some unease working alongside a robot, especially when new customers enter the store and can be seen deciding between her and the machine.</p>
        
            <p>However, she believes human baristas provide a personalized touch, while robots strictly follow a standardized process.</p>
        
            <p>Joo says robots won't replace human baristas but complement them.</p>
        
            <p>"Coffee is personal," he says. "Automation allows for longer operating hours and consistent quality, but human baristas offer warmth and personality that customers love."</p>

COFE+ in Auckland's CBD serves about 100 cups of coffee every day.

            <p>Marie Fan launched COFE+ Robot Café at Queen's Food Court in central Auckland in January.</p>
        
            <p>Powered by Shanghai Hi-Dolphin Robot Technology, whose machines operate in more than 30 cities worldwide, the mechanical barista at COFE+ is designed with region-specific programming.</p>
        
            <p>"In New Zealand, the robot serves locally preferred coffee beans like the 1960s Vintage and Ken's Choice," Fan says.</p>
        
            <p>An app-integrated system allows real-time monitoring of ingredients such as beans and milk.</p>
        
            <p>COFE+ currently serves around 100 cups of coffee per day, with each cup brewed in just 60 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Building on this success, Fan recently opened a second location in Newmarket.</p>
        
            <p>"Our café targets different customers than traditional coffee shops," Fan says.</p>
        
            <p>"While traditional cafés focus on creating a relaxing atmosphere and a sense of community, we cater to customers who prioritize speed, consistency and quality."</p>
        
            <p>Daisy Willis, an office worker in central Auckland, acknowledges the machine's efficiency.</p>
        
            <p>"These sorts of cafes would be great in places like train stations, airports and inside offices as well - [the] kind of places where you don't have a lot of time to wait in line for a drink," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Zhang, 46, believes robots won't replace human baristas in the short term, but businesses may increasingly introduce them to cut costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Labour costs in New Zealand are high and the economy isn't strong," Zhang says. "More businesses will likely explore this option [in future]."</p>
