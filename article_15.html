            <p>When Bob Innes found the perfect website name for his IT business he snapped it up.</p>
        
            <p>Little did the Californian know he would eventually be responsible for saving dozens of lives and preventing multiple murders.</p>
        
            <p>That's because Bob owns the website RentAHitman.com - he bought it in 2005 without an intention of actually attracting people seeking killers for hire.</p>
        
            <p>"During the process of trying to figure out a business name and a catchy phrase, I kicked around the idea of rent-a-hitman," Innes says.</p>
        
            <p>The play-on-words is a combination of 'rent' as in hire, 'hit' as in internet traffic, and analytics and men for Bob and his three friends.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ Nights host Emile Donovan when the business didn't take off he tried to sell the domain name but there was little interest.</p>

            <p>Everything changed in 2010 when a person called Helen from the UK emailed the website asking to have three of her family members murdered because she claimed they had stolen her inheritance.</p>
        
            <p>After she sent a second email, Bob emailed her back asking if she still required his "services" to which she replied with where she was staying and all her personal information.</p>
        
            <p>"If I didn't get the email, somebody else might have, and the results are obviously going to be different, so I felt I needed to act on this."</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to the information Helen gave him, Bob was able to alert the authorities, leading to her arrest and ultimate guilty plea to soliciting to commit murder.</p>
        
            <p>Since then there has been a steady stream of requests from people wanting someone else's life ended.</p>
        
            <p>In his estimation Bob thinks he's prevented well over 100 murders.</p>
        
            <p>
Despite signs and hints that the website is not legitimate thousands of people still inquire about hiring a hitman though the website .

            <p>One in particular sticks in his mind.</p>
        
            <p>"The one that hit me the hardest is a case out of Miami Florida, involving a 18-year-old mother who wanted her three-year-old son, her own son murdered ... Fortunately, the child is alive and well, living with his grandmother."</p>
        
            <p>Bob runs the website out of his own pocket but he accepts donations and sell t-shirts to help cover some of the costs.</p>
