        <h2>Can tax cuts really address the cost of living?</h2>
        <p>
It's the centrepiece of National's response to rising costs. But what do the numbers say?

            <p>National has repeatedly pointed to income tax cuts as its key response to the rising cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>"Why is that commitment to tax relief so important?" said Prime Minister Christopher Luxon earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>"Because those Kiwis struggling with the cost of living - what I call the squeezed middle - deserve support."</p>
        
            <p>The cost of living has gone up a lot - between 21.5 percent and 24 percent since early 2020, depending on household income.</p>
        
            <p>How much of a dent could the tax cuts to be announced in Thursday's Budget really make into those sorts of increases?</p>
        
            <p>The answer depends on a range of factors.</p>
        
            <p>Brad Olsen, Infometrics chief executive, said household experiences of tax cuts would depend on personal circumstances, in much the same way the experience of inflation had varied.</p>
        
            <p>"Inflation itself we saw peak and start to come down, at the same time we have had interest rates at a much higher level," Olsen said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're a household that rents, you're seeing much higher renting costs over time. Tax cuts will help towards that. If you're a mortgage-paying household, again it will go towards that.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're someone who owns a house outright, you get a bunch of free money for not having to pay any of those housing costs, at least. It depends on what your household is spending money on."</p>
        
            <p>In short: there is no one version of an inflation vs tax cuts story. Rather, it's more like two million different stories - one for each unique household in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>But to help illustrate how things might look for different people, let's take a closer look at the sums through some imaginary households.</p>
        
            <p>Statisticians divide households up into five different income levels.</p>
        
            <p>In the lowest bracket, imagine a single parent household with income from a part-time job of $31,769. Official data suggests this household could have seen expenses go up by $1173 more than income since 2020. This is unlikely to be bridged much by any tax cut. Prior to the election, National suggested a change which would be worth $112 a year to this household, but it's possible there will be no cut at all if National is forced to trim its plan.</p>
        
            <p>Northland woman Manu Johnson Peake works part-time, and her husband is not currently in work.</p>
        
            <p>"[I've] always only rented, work hard, am known for my giving in the community. Don't travel any more, my focus is home, family, community."</p>
        
            <p>She's "always known" New Zealand is more expensive than many other countries.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's got so bad that people are leaving for a better life in Australia. It's a struggle and I'm tired."</p>
        
            <p>What about a household with a bit more income? In the second income bracket, imagine a family of two adults and two children. In 2020, they were living on an after-tax single income of $54,000, and they're now on about $65,000 a year - consistent with the average wage increase of 24 percent over that time. The cost of living would have swallowed all of that. That $11,000 increase in wages would be completely cancelled out by increases to their expenses, just to maintain the same standard of living.</p>
        
            <p>With kids at home, the Working for Families credit would help - and it would have increased by about $2100 over the same period, potentially offering some relief.</p>
        
            <p>The kind of tax cut National was talking about prior to the election would probably mean about another $931 per year for this household.</p>
        
            <p>This is where Luxon and Finance Minister Nicola Willis have promised the greatest relief.</p>
        
            <p>Before the election, National said it wanted to move the income level at which the 30 percent tax rate took effect from $70,000 to $78,100.</p>
        
            <p>Middle income earners might also benefit from changes National has suggested at lower thresholds. The 10.5 percent income rate could apply to the first $15,600 of income, up from $14,000, and the 17.5 percent rate could kick in at $53,500 up from $48,000.</p>
        
            <p>A household with two adults both earning over $78,100 could qualify for $2085 a year if those changes are applied, or $1861 a year if the bottom tax bracket does not increase, as some have suggested might be a possibility.</p>
        
            <p>A household with two adults earning minimum wage (equivalent to $48,152 a year) would qualify for a $38 tax cut if the bottom bracket did not increase, and $262 if it did.</p>
        
            <p>Higher-income households have generally experienced higher inflation, because they are able to spend more - so more of their income is exposed to rising costs. Higher interest rates have also hit home-owning households hard.</p>
        
            <p>A single adult on a $105,000 salary in 2020 would be considered among the top-earning 20 percent of households. Their expenses increased by $13,000 between 2020 and 2024, but their salary would have gone up nearly $17,000 over that same period. They could get a further boost of about $931 per year from tax cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said the return of interest deductibility on investment properties could provide a bigger impact for some higher-income households.</p>
        
            <p>"Those households may be getting a bigger increase in their take-home pay."</p>
        
            <p>When Finance Minister Nicola Willis gave her pre-Budget speech earlier in the month it was revealed that 17 percent of people would not qualify for a cut.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Willis said some of those people would be beneficiaries, because benefits are paid net-of-tax, so personal income tax changes do not affect them.</p>
        
            <p>"There are also some other people who will not benefit from the tax package, simply because their incomes are too low for the tax relief we are providing."</p>
        
            <p>Brad Olsen said the lowest-income earners would probably only ever benefit if a tax-free threshold was introduced, as in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the tax cut benefit was likely to be felt by middle-income households, he said. That was also where the largest impact of "fiscal drag" - inflation pushing people into higher tax brackets - was being felt.</p>
        
            <p>In 2011, the 33 percent tax rate had covered 27.3 percent of taxable income but by 2022 that had risen to 42.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>National had also proposed changing how the independent earner tax credit applies and extending the threshold to $70,000 rather than the current $48,000.</p>
        
            <p>Its coalition partner ACT has previously proposed getting rid of the 10.5 percent tax rate and introducing an extra tax credit for lower-income earners.</p>
