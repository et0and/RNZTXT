        <h2>The 'deep tech' sector dreaming up ways to save the planet</h2>
        <p>
The Detail takes a look inside an Auckland building where more than 20 start-ups are developing products aimed at reducing carbon emissions.

            <p>Sharon Brettkelly gets a glimpse of the future as she ventures inside a building housing some of the biggest brains in the deep tech sector working to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>In a nondescript concrete building in a backstreet of Parnell, some big brains are at work on projects that could help save the world from climatic and environmental meltdown.</p>
        
            <p>The aptly named Future House is home to Outset Ventures, an incubator for more than 20 start-ups that are developing products that are better for the environment, including new types of concrete and pesticides.</p>
        
            <p>They're part of the fast-growing "deep tech" sector, and one of the brains behind it is the man dubbed the "carbon saviour", Sean Simpson, co-founder of LanzaTech, the low carbon biofuel firm that has become a US multibillion dollar Nasdaq-listed company.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson, who has returned to New Zealand after years in the US, chairs Outset Ventures. Its role is to support the start-ups and raise finance to speed their growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We filter the great ideas," says Simpson. "And the model that we have here is quite different to the model you'll see across New Zealand. Here, we take a technology-first and experience-first look at these new ideas."</p>
        
            <p>Outset's investment committee is a 'who's who' of some of the country's most successful technology brains: Simpson, Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck and Mint Innovation's Will Barker.</p>
        
            <p>The Detail was invited to Future House to meet Simpson and some of the start-up founders as Outset embarks on its second round of fund raising. </p>
        
            <p>He says he wants to raise the profile of Outset and get the attention of the new government.</p>

            <p>"Our message to the government is we're here to support New Zealand entrepreneurs and we'd like them to partner with us."</p>
        
            <p>Simpson says Outset currently receives no government funding.</p>
        
            <p>The Detail toured the laboratories of agri-biotech firm Biotelliga with Damien Fleetwood, the chief executive. Started in 2009, the company is focused on cleaner agriculture.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in the business of developing technology that farmers and growers can use to protect their crops from pests and diseases that are biological in basis, clean, green, and biodegradable. </p>
        
            <p>"The intent is that growers can use them in exactly the same way as they use chemical pesticides and replace those unwanted, kind-of dangerous chemical pesticides."</p>
        
            <p>Fleetwood says the company has been funded mainly by the same investors for several years but has struggled to retain safe, secure funding.</p>
        
            <p>Just down the corridor of Future House, we meet NeoCrete co-founders, Zarina Bazoeva and Matt Kennedy-Good, who have grand ambitions to replace polluting cement with their own product, which they say is 95 percent natural and sustainable.</p>
        
            <p>"Concrete is the most-used product in the world after water," Kennedy-Good explains. "The glue that holds concrete together is cement, but the problem with cement is that it is responsible for eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
            <p>"What NeoCrete has done is to find a way to replace cement by activating volcanic ash."</p>

            <p>Bazoeva says NeoCrete is working on perfecting the formula in its laboratory in Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>"We think we are 95 percent ready for commercial production," she says.</p>
        
            <p>The five-year-old company is about to switch on its pilot plant in Auckland to supply the New Zealand market and has received its first export orders.</p>
        
            <p>Bazoeva explains how she developed a love of concrete as a young child, watching her scientist father working on the product in his laboratory in Russia.</p>
        
            <p>"He told me about this amazing building material that connected the land with bridges and tunnels, that allowed us to build vertically, rather than horizontally, and that's where I developed love and excitement for this amazing building material."</p>
