            <p>Dozens of schools are giving their students and some teachers a four-day weekend, choosing not come back to class on Friday after the Waitangi Day holiday.</p>
        
            <p>That is despite Associate Education Minister David Seymour demanding better attendance and calling for teacher only days in term to stop.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Grammar has given its staff and students the day off and principal Tim O'Connor told Checkpoint it made good sense.</p>
        
            <p>"We have boarders on campus as well so just a good opportunity for families."</p>
        
            <p>He was sure attendance would have dropped on Friday if students were required to go to school but also knew families would have tried hard to get their kids there - "because they know we'd hunt them down if they didn't".</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor said the school starts a week before Auckland Anniversary weekend so it could get ahead and get its teaching days in early.</p>
        
            <p>"I also think that having long summer holidays don't help for retention and knowledge."</p>
        
            <p>The school did its calendar a year in advance and took the day after Waitangi Day as a genuine holiday day, not a teacher-only day.</p>
        
            <p>He wasn't in support of schools taking teacher-only days this Friday and thought it was "fudging the system".</p>
        
            <p>"I just wouldn't do that."</p>
        
            <p>He told students they needed to complete their homework before the long weekend and return ready to learn.</p>
        
            <p>"Work hard, play hard," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Schools closing completely Friday include Auckland's Western Springs College, Northcote College, and Browns Bay School. Napier Girls' High School and Hurunui College, near Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Plenty are also having a teacher-only day, among them Northland's Ruawai Primary, Mangawhai Beach School and Rotorua's Glenholme School.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education offered some clarity over teacher-only days.</p>
        
            <p>It said that for the 2025 school year, school boards can close their school for four half days for curriculum related purposes.</p>
        
            <p>These half days don't need to be made up, so long as 6 weeks' notice is given to whānau.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, boards can close their school for another four half days per year - these can be used at the board's discretion and they don't need permission to close</p>
        
            <p>These half days need to be made up, either at the start or end of the year.</p>
