        <h2>India’s space ambitions brighten with success of maiden solar mission</h2>
        <p>
The mission marks the latest success for the space exploration ambitions of the world's most populous nation.

            <p>India's maiden solar mission entered the sun's orbit on Saturday after a four-month journey, marking the latest success for the space exploration ambitions of the world's most populous nation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge achievement for India," says Jan Eldridge, an astrophysicist and head of the physics department at the University of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Eldridge says India is progressing steadily in space exploration.</p>
        
            <p>"For a country that had their first launch only two decades ago, India has achieved a lot, from landing on the moon (and) orbiting Mars to observing the sun," she says.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation's Aditya-L1 was launched on 2 September 2023 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in southern India.</p>
        
            <p>This launch occurred just days after India made history by becoming the first country to land near the moon's South Pole.</p>
        
            <p>After a 127-day journey, the satellite successfully reached solar orbit on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi commented on Aditya-L1's success on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"India creates yet another landmark," Modi wrote on X (formerly Twitter). "It is a testament to the relentless dedication of our scientists in realising among the most complex and intricate space missions. … We will continue to pursue new frontiers of science for the benefit of humanity."</p>

            <p>The Aditya-L1 satellite will continuously observe the sun without any occultation or eclipse, offering the ability to view solar activities without obstruction.</p>
        
            <p>"That's because it is sitting in one of the Lagrange points," Eldridge says.</p>
        
            <p>Lagrange points are specific locations in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies - for example, the Earth and the sun - create stable positions for smaller objects.</p>
        
            <p>There are five Lagrange points in the system, denoted as L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5.</p>
        
            <p>Eldridge says the Indian satellite is positioned to remain at L1 to study the sun.</p>
        
            <p>Aditya-L1 joins four other operational NASA spacecrafts at L1: WIND, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Advanced Composition Explorer and Deep Space Climate Observatory.</p>
        
            <p>"We still don't know a lot about stars and the sun is our closest star," Eldridge says.</p>
        
            <p>Eldridge highlights the mystery of the sun's atmosphere and recognised threat of solar winds.</p>
        
            <p>She believes that missions such as Aditya-L1 will help us learn more about our closest star.</p>
        
            <p>She says the mission will enhance our understanding of solar activity, especially solar winds and flares, and their effects on Earth as well as near-space weather in real time.</p>
        
            <p>To achieve this, the satellite carries seven payloads to observe the photosphere, chromosphere and the outermost layer of the sun using electromagnetic and particle detectors.</p>

            <p>According to the Indian Space Research Organisation, the satellite will spend its entire five-year mission life circling L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit on a plane roughly perpendicular to the line connecting the Earth to the sun.</p>
        
            <p>Sreedhara Panicker Somanath, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, told Indian media that the success of Aditya-L1 was "very satisfying."</p>
        
            <p>"The orbit of Aditya-L1 spacecraft is a periodic halo orbit that is located roughly 1.5 million kilometres from Earth on the continuously moving Sun-Earth line with an orbital period of about 177.86 Earth days," Somanath says.</p>
        
            <p>"This halo orbit is a periodic, three-dimensional orbit at L1 involving the sun, Earth and a spacecraft," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"This specific halo orbit has been selected to ensure a mission lifetime of five years, minimising station-keeping manoeuvres and thus fuel consumption, ensuring a continuous, unobstructed view of the sun."</p>
