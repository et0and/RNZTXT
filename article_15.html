            <p>Football loves clichés. They drive home narratives, deflect from failures and perhaps, best of all, they offer a chance to downplay expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"I keep saying this and I know it sounds a cliché, but we take it game by game."</p>
        
            <p>Those were the words of Wellington Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano, after the Nix went clear at the A-League summit over the weekend with a 2-1 win over the Newcastle Jets.</p>
        
            <p>It's hard to know exactly how you wouldn't take things game by game, given that is the very nature of a fixtured competition but, whatever 'Chiefy' is doing, he should keep it up.</p>
        
            <p>Clichés are born from truth and to borrow another, Wellington are winning like champions right now. Not necessarily at their rip-roaring best but getting the result the hard way. When the Nix were run rampant in the reverse fixture back in December many felt the encouraging early start would, in typical Phoenix fashion, fall off, but game-by-game, their title challenge marches on.</p>
        
            <p>Oskar Zawada's return was timely, even if it looks increasingly likely that this will be a final hurrah for the Pole. Europe, the scourge of A-League longevity, beckons with the 27-year-old out of contract at the end of the season. Firing Phoenix to glory first would be a welcome parting gift.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking of clichés, how about the old adage that you wait for ages for a bus and three come along at once? The Rufe is on fire for Nix captain Alex Rufer, who now has three goals in as many games. This from a man who once waited 107 games and 3269 days to score his first goal for the club in January last year.</p>
        
            <p>From the clichéd to the chaotic, there was nothing humdrum or ordinary about the Wellington Phoenix women's team and their 2-0 win over Canberra United.</p>

            <p>It was pandemonium in Porirua, as goalkeeper Rylee Foster's savage attack on Sofia Christopherson saw her sent off in the second half…but anyone who has seen the incident will recognise the sarcasm. Not to fear, the mayhem at Jerry Collins Stadium continued as sub 'keeper Brianna Edwards saved the resulting penalty with her first touch of the game.</p>
        
            <p>The FA Cup has lost its resonance in recent years. So much so that it appears Chris Wood's Nottingham Forest side and Bristol City both decided to take the night off in a turgid 0-0 affair in the fourth round. The big downside is they will now have to do it all again in a replay.</p>
        
            <p>Plymouth Argyle boss Ian Foster (not that one) left the 'Waine Train' in the station as Wood's All Whites understudy Ben Waine watched his side draw 1-1 with Leeds United. The forward is struggling for minutes under his new coach and must be starting to feel like Shaun Stevenson under Foster's rugby namesake.</p>
        
            <p>Sticking with the FA Cup, Maidstone United produced a little bit of magic in their clash with Ipswich Town by beating the Championship promotion contenders to book their place in the last 16. Ipswich are 98 places above Maidstone in the English Football League meaning this was like the All Blacks (world-ranked 3) losing to Niue Island (world-ranked 101). Well, sort of, but you get the point. The gulf is a chasm and Maidstone's reward is a clash with Sheffield Wednesday or Coventry City in the fifth round.</p>

            <p>Finally, Jurgen Klopp has announced he will step down as Liverpool boss at the end of the season. The German, who gives off immense 'alright-for-a-teacher-energy' will no doubt be missed by fans and players. But spare a thought for another coaching departure, as Ivory Coast boss Jean-Louis Gasset was sacked midway through The Elephants' home tournament in the African Cup of Nations. After a dire group stage in which they only escaped as a lucky loser, it's safe to say the Frenchman will not spark the same outpouring of well wishes that Klopp received.</p>
