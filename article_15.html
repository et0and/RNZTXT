        <h2>Nearly every member of the Comanchero motorcycle gang facing charges</h2>
        <p>
A total of 137 charges have been laid against the gang's members and associates.
</p>
        
            <p>Nearly every member of the Comanchero motorcycle gang in New Zealand is facing criminal charges after a three-year police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said a total of 137 charges have been laid against the gang's members and associates.</p>
        
            <p>These included 17 "office" holders, 10 patched members and 14 gang prospects.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2021, police had seized 206 kilograms of methamphetamine, 1.76 kilograms of cocaine and 2.6 kilograms of cannabis.</p>
        
            <p>Police also recovered $1.275 million in cash, $9.2 million in assets, restrained five properties and 14 vehicles, including motorbikes.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the disruption and dismantling of the gang would make a big dent in the Comanchero's ability to conduct significant serious criminal offending moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"From the very beginning, there has been a multi-agency effort to continuously target, disrupt and enforce criminal activity that has been taking place," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has resulted in significant criminal prosecution cases as well as assets and profits being stripped away from their grasp."</p>
        
            <p>Police worked alongside Customs, Corrections and Inland Revenue as part of the investigations.</p>
        
            <p>The Comancheros gang insignia was taken down from its Christchurch headquarters in Woolston a week after the city's entire chapter was arrested.</p>
        
            <p>It was the culmination of an eight-month investigation, called Operation Avon, that targeted regular cash and drug runs between Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the Comancheros were responsible for the majority of Class A drugs coming into Canterbury, as well as money laundering and a 'commission' scheme to fund military-style training.</p>
        
            <p>The charges were the result of four phases of the investigation.</p>

            <p>In July 2021, the National Organised Crime Group commenced phase one, dubbed Operation Scuba, which primarily investigated money laundering.</p>
        
            <p>"The operation terminated in March this year, resulting in 11 people being charged," Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>In total, $5.8 million worth of assets were restrained, including two properties- one of them being the gang's 'Southside' pad in Weymouth, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The second phase, Operation Brewer, was a joint operation between police and Customs that resulted in 200 kilograms of methamphetamine being found hidden in farm machinery.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Avon, the third phase, targeted regular cash and drug runs between Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>In the investiagtion's most recent phase, Operation Embargo, investigators sought evidence about a directive allegedly sent out to Comanchero members three years ago ordering members to follow rules being set up around the 'commission'.</p>
        
            <p>"This commission processes allegedly raised funds to purchase a gang pad, two businesses as well as purchasing of firearms," Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will also allege that these funds were being used to carry out military-styled training of 15 of its members by a trainer brought into the country for this purpose."</p>
        
            <p>Total results since 2021:</p>
        
            <p>Police said the military-style training took place in Auckland and Northland, but that they could not go into more detail because the matter was before the court.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at the police stand-up, Detective Superintendent Greg Williams said the Comancheros were seen across Australasia as the most dangerous gang, partly because of their propensity for violence.</p>
        
            <p>"[There is a] case before the court right now where we will allege the Comancheros attempted to kill a member of a Comanchero [gang] that tried to leave the Comancheros."</p>
        
            <p>"So it gives you an idea of the level of violence they're prepared to operate in."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said this was also shown by the gang's commandments, which police recovered.</p>
        
            <p>"They say that 'once a Comanchero always a Comanchero' and that if you leave the gang then you will be put in a body bag, unless you find God, but if you're caught operating in the underworld they'll put you to sleep."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said police believed there were about 92 Comanchero members in the country right now.</p>
        
            <p>He said from that group, police believed only 11 were not actively facing some form of criminal charge.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said the Comancheros had used their shiny brand to recruit members, while inflicting misery on people through selling drugs and using violence to intimidate.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was a difference in the way gangs were being policed.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to give them more powers and more tools because we just want to continue to ratchet this up, this is really just the start.</p>
        
            <p>"We're a small island nation, these gang members and organised crime groups are responsible for way too much of the violent crime and organised crime that we see in our country."</p>
