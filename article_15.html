        <h2>Is it okay to ask someone about their disability?</h2>
        <p>
When meeting someone with a visible disability for the first time, people often ask about what happened - but is that okay?

            <p>When meeting someone with a visible disability for the first time, people often enquire about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>How that question is received, said journalist and wheelchair user Olivia Shivas, would depend on the individual.</p>
        
            <p>"For some people, how they became disabled is quite traumatic - so it probably is not a wise idea to do that. But for some people, they're really passionate about educating non-disabled people about disability, so they may be more open to it.</p>
        
            <p>"My advice is get to know the person first and then the other bits of the puzzle in terms of why they're disabled will fall into place."</p>
        
            <p>In the 2021 podcast What's Wrong With You?, Shivas and two friends chatted to fellow Kiwis with disabilities about being asked outrageous questions, and about life in general.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2023, she has been the editor of The D*List - an online magazine with content by and for Aotearoa's disability community.</p>
        
            <p>On The D*List, people share ideas, advice, "disability joy" and "disability rage" and first-person stories about relatable topics like dating and having a love/hate relationship with your teacher aide.</p>
        
            <p>Shivas said the website offers comfort to the many Kiwis living with a disability who find themselves alone in their family, friendship circle or workplace.</p>
        
            <p>Those in Auckland's disability community can even connect face-to-face at The D*List's new physical space in Kingsland.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a space for disabled people that's not associated with a service provider - which is often how disabled people gather - is actually really cool."</p>
        
            <p>In the past, people on the street had asked Shivas if they could pray for her healing and "forced" help on her.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was time New Zealanders moved on from viewing those with disabilities in such a "paternalistic" and pitying way.</p>
        
            <p>The magazine came out of survey run for the Human Rights Commission campaign, which canvassed 200 disabled and non-disabled New Zealanders about what was needed to widen or change outdated attitudes and stereotypes about disability.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of how we form narratives and shift narratives is through storytelling, and how we see ourselves in stories, and how we see ourselves reflected in society.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's what came out of [the survey] - there was nothing for disabled people, by disabled people.</p>
        
            <p>Shivas said the D*List is strongly focused on personal storytelling and sharing ideas: "We're on a mission to celebrate disability storytelling and creativity and community."</p>
