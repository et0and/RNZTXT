        <h2>From drawing during lockdown to $500k animated web series</h2>
        <p>
Charlie Faulks's horror-comedy web series, Bloke of the Apocalypse, is about a father and son who discover a zombie apocalypse on their farm in rural NZ. Video

            <p>A 20 year old from Wellington has been given half a million dollars to write, draw and animate a web series based on his family.</p>
        
            <p>And he's doing it all from the bedroom of his Mount Cook flat, where he lives with two other students from Massey University.</p>
        
            <p>This year, Charlie Faulks will graduate with a Bachelor of Screen Arts with more than four years of experience in the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone drew when they were little - I just never stopped," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But, professionally, I started over lockdown, and I would have been, I don't know, pretty young.</p>
        
            <p>"I started on Fiverr, which is kind of like freelance services, doing character design.</p>
        
            <p>"Since then, I've been able to move off of there, and ... go off my own back, which has been so nice."</p>
        
            <p>
The father in Bloke of the Apocalypse is a 'gruff, macho, farming man who has a lot of trouble showing his emotions', says Faulks.

            <p>Faulks has been designing characters for TV shows all over the world, including the US and the UK.</p>
        
            <p>But now it is his turn to design characters for himself, with his animated horror-comedy web series, Bloke of the Apocalypse, about a father, Bloke, and his son, Oliver, who discover a zombie apocalypse on their farm in rural New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The first three episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, with the rest of the season being released in September or October next year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's based on my dad, and my brother, and my upbringing in rural Gisborne," Faulks said.</p>
        
            <p>"It follows those two characters, who are exaggerated in the show. Bloke is this gruff, macho, farming man who has a lot of trouble showing his emotions, and Oliver is this quite smart kid who struggles connecting with his dad because of the way he is.</p>
        
            <p>"And so it's this almost toxic relationship between them, where they're trying to understand each other but they're almost speaking different languages, and then they're combating a zombie apocalypse."</p>

            <p>Faulks received $472,368 from NZ On Air as part of its $5 million investment in new content for young New Zealanders, which was announced at the end of April.</p>
        
            <p>"My producers, Ben Powdrell and Francesca Carney, who I met through Floating Rock Pitchfest - which is a thing here in Wellington - told me about this funding pool within my reach at NZ On Air," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They thought my idea would be perfect for it, and after a few months of waiting nervously, we got it, and yeah, it's been insane and crazy."</p>
        
            <p>Faulks has amassed a following of almost 30,000 people on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>And this week, he finished the first draft of his feature film - a live-action comedy-horror titled Upchuck.</p>
        
            <p>"I like to have [a number] of projects going at a time, so that's just been something I've been working on.</p>
        
            <p>"I like writing, and it's nice to have a secondary creative force that's not drawing," Faulks said.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope I get to make it one day."</p>
