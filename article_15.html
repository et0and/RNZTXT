            <p>US politicians have called for new laws to criminalise the creation of deepfake images, after explicit faked photos of Taylor Swift were viewed millions of times online.</p>
        
            <p>The images were posted on social media sites, including X and Telegram.</p>
        
            <p>US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the pictures "appalling".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, X said it was "actively removing" the images and taking "appropriate actions" against the accounts involved in spreading them.</p>
        
            <p>It added: "We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed."</p>
        
            <p>While many of the images appear to have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being taken down.</p>
        
            <p>Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in 2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of AI.</p>
        
            <p>There are currently no federal laws against the sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have been moves at state level to tackle the issue.</p>
        
            <p>In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became illegal as part of its Online Saftey Act in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Democratic Rep Morelle, who last year unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act - which would have made it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent - called for urgent action on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>He said the images and videos "can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm - and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted".</p>
        
            <p>Pornography consists of the overwhelmingly majority of the deepfakes posted online, with women making up 99% of those targeted in such content, according to the State of Deepfakes report published last year.</p>
        
            <p>"What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new," Democratic Rep Yvette D Clarke posted on X. She noted that women had been targeted by the technology "for years", adding that with "advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper".</p>
        
            <p>Republican Congressman Tom Kean Jr agreed, saying that it is "clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails".</p>
        
            <p>"Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend," he added.</p>
        
            <p>Swift has not spoken publicly about the images, but the Daily Mail reported that her team is "considering legal action" against the site which published the AI-generated images.</p>
        
            <p>Worries about AI-generated content have increased as billions of people vote in elections this year across the globe.</p>
        
            <p>This week, a fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden sparked an investigation. It is thought to have been made by AI.</p>
