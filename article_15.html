        <h2>If you pay $750 in rent, why can't you get a mortgage?</h2>
        <p>
Here's why a rent payment isn't always enough to prove you can service a mortgage

            <p>It's a common complaint from first-home buyers: If I can pay $750 a week in rent - and have been doing it every week for years - why is that not enough to prove to the bank that I can afford a mortgage at that repayment level?</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple.</p>
        
            <p>A repayment of $750 a week would service a $540,000 loan with a 6 percent interest rate.</p>
        
            <p>A household with two borrowers and two children under 18 would need an income of about $115,000 a year to qualify for that, depending on their expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Data shows that it is generally the areas with the lowest house prices that have the smallest jump from average rent to mortgage payments.</p>
        
            <p>But Jeremy Andrews, from Key Mortgages, said a number of factors would be involved when a bank was assessing an applicant's ability to pay back a mortgage - and there would be extra costs that would be added to the $750 initial payment.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality of owning a home is there are extra costs and allowances to consider both in your budget for buying and the bank's assessment of affordability. Rates and insurance can be significant and easily $100 a week on top of mortgage repayments."</p>
        
            <p>He said maintenance was another expense that was usually covered by a landlord when people were renting but would need to be paid for by the homeowner if they bought their home.</p>
        
            <p>He said banks would also need to see that people could service a loan with interest rates higher than the ones advertised.</p>
        
            <p>"Bank test rates are always higher than the typical offered interest rates at time of application.</p>
        
            <p>A 30-year mortgage will have fluctuating interest rates over time, so banks allow a buffer toward this called 'assessment' or 'test' rates - often this is at least 2 percent higher than current fixed interest rates."</p>
        
            <p>But he said if people were considering buying a home with enough bedrooms, they could count boarder income to help improve their chances.</p>
        
            <p>Another adviser, Glen McLeod, said banks would take all of a borrower's financial commitments and stress test them at a higher level to ensure they could afford the loan over the long term.</p>
        
            <p>He said things like life or mortgage protection payments could also add to costs.</p>
        
            <p>In July, first-home buyers were responsible for 21.2 percent of all new residential lending.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's average weekly rent is 22 percent of the average household income this year.</p>
        
            <p>By contrast, that household earning $115,000 would be spending about a third of their before-tax income on $750-a-week mortgage payments.</p>
