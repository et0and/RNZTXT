            <p>Aotearoa's Melanesian Festival opens in Auckland this weekend and organisers say it's set to be the biggest celebration of culture and unity for the diaspora.</p>
        
            <p>Following its success last year - its second year - the festival attracted more than 7000 people.</p>
        
            <p>Festival director Alipate Traill says plans are underway to work with the various foreign diplomatic missions in Auckland to bring their talented artists and cultural performance groups to join in the celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>He says Waitemata Rugby Club grounds in Henderson will be abuzz come Saturday with the five Melanesia island nations - Vanuatu, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands - set to showcase their rich cultural heritage.</p>
        
            <p>Traill says there is much excitement in the diaspora, given Melanesia's significance in the predominantly Polynesian communities.</p>

            <p>"This festival is a unique opportunity for Melanesians to step into the limelight and celebrate their distinct identities.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to create a space where the Melanesian community can share their food, culture, and stories."</p>
        
            <p>Renowned musicians and bands from the Solomons, Fiji, and PNG will perform on Saturday with the programme kicking off at 9am.</p>

            <p>Fiji will host the 8th Melanesian Arts and Culture Festival (MACFest) in 2026, the government says.</p>
        
            <p>"MACFEST provides an opportunity to showcase and preserve the diverse cultural heritage of Fiji and the Melanesian region," a government statement read.</p>
        
            <p>"This festival is a platform for cultural exchange and celebration of traditional arts, crafts, music, and traditional dances."</p>
        
            <p>The Solomons government says events such as the Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture (FestPAC) and MACFest are important for the country's tourism industry.</p>
        
            <p>Director of Culture Division at the Solomons' Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Dennis Marita, says FestPAC is not only a platform for cultural preservation and exchanges between Pacific Islanders but "more importantly it is an avenue to promote Solomon Islands to the outside world.</p>
        
            <p>"Our participation in previous festivals has connected our country to the outside world and that has attracted visitors to our country to learn more about us and our way of life."</p>
        
            <p>He says some of the Solomons' unique arts and cultures are valuable products, "vital to our tourism sector and it's important that our government maintains its recognition and support to our arts and culture industry".</p>
        
            <p>"Our cultural diversity is our strength, which continuously brings new talents and cultural dimensions at different festivals," Marita said.</p>
