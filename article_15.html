            <p>A man who lost his job and had his car sold because he could not pay its loan - and whose partner left him because he could not provide for his family - has had the amount of money he owed the car lender reduced.</p>
        
            <p>His case is the first that external disputes resolution service Financial Services Complaints Ltd has issued a case note for in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It said that the man and his wife had taken a loan to buy a car and he made the repayments without a problem for 18 months, until he lost his job.</p>
        
            <p>He contacted the lender and said he could not afford the loan.</p>
        
            <p>The payments were deferred for two months while he looked for work.</p>
        
            <p>After that time, he said he could not repay the loan and wanted to sell the vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>He went to a dealer who agreed to pay $30,000 for it. But he still owed $43,000 and the lender said $30,000 was not enough.</p>
        
            <p>He surrendered the car to the lender. It sold it for $26,000 which left him with $17,000 to pay.</p>
        
            <p>He stopped paying the loan and the lender recorded the debt in default with a credit agency.</p>
        
            <p>The man argued it was not fair because the lender could have accepted the offer of $30,000 and he would have only owed about $13,000.</p>
        
            <p>He also wanted the lender to remove his wife as a co-borrower. He said she had limited English and did not understand what she had signed.</p>
        
            <p>The lender agreed it should have looked at the $30,000 offer more thoroughly and agreed to reduce his debt, but it did not agree to release his wife as a co-borrower. She had lived in New Zealand for 20 years and worked in a customer service role.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was not convinced she did not understand.</p>
        
            <p>The man complained to FSCL, and said his wife had left him when he lost his job because he could not provide for his family.</p>
        
            <p>He said she had tried to refinance her home loan, but the car loan default had caused a problem.</p>
        
            <p>He said if the lender would remove her, he would pay the $13,000 at $100 a week.</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said the lender agreed to remove the default listing in the interests of resolving the complaint.</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said if he did not pay the loan back, the lender had indicated his wife's default listing would return.</p>
        
            <p>It said the situation was able to be resolved without FSCL needing to issue a formal decision.</p>
        
            <p>When a car is repossessed and sold, the sale must be commercially reasonable and done by auction, public tender or private sale.</p>
        
            <p>If the item is sold for less than the amount owed, the lender cannot add further interest or fees.</p>
