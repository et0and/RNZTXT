            <p>Sifting through the first six months of TV for the year, there are a few series that stand out to Culture 101 host Perlina Lau. She has picked the five shows that got her thinking, weeping, laughing and talking.</p>
        
            <p>This show has likely graced every TV list but it's a compelling, disturbing and pretty unpredictable story.</p>

            <p>It says it's based on a true story (that's being debated now) but it's a well-acted, slick and stylised production. It's one that stayed with me afterwards for quite a while - although I do not recommend watching before bed. If nothing else - the fallout, the Piers Morgan interview and the potential lawsuit has been fascinating to watch unfold.</p>
        
            <p>This local production puts the spotlight on a part of the country we rarely see on screen - Kaikoura! Set post-earthquake, two best friends and a surrogacy pact gone wrong - it's full of messy and flawed characters which I love! It has a great cast including Morgana O'Reilly and Jarod Rawiri. I hoovered this one up.</p>
        
            <p>This documentary felt like a guilty pleasure - but I was so pleasantly surprised and I wanted more.</p>

            <p>The hacking scandal was such a big news story at the time - and the doco shows it's as outrageous as you think it is. With just three episodes, it doesn't drag on, the interviews are interesting and varied, giving you multiple perspectives of the chaos and constantly makes you think "what would I do?".</p>
        
            <p>I wasn't a big fan of the 2011 film with Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess so I hesitated before watching this series. But boy, the chemistry and performances by Ambika Mod and Leo Woodhall are amazing.</p>

            <p>Both hold their own as two best friends who meet up each year on the same date. Those who've read the book or seen it will know there are devastating moments so if you need a good cry this is the one.</p>
        
            <p>If I had to sum this show up in one word, it'd be joyful. Maya Rudolph (you know her from SNL and Bridesmaids) plays the wife of a billionaire who cheats on her. Suddenly she's heartbroken and alone - but very rich. While she always looks glamorous and has all the material goods, she's weird, insecure and strangely normal which is what makes this show so funny and delightful.</p>
