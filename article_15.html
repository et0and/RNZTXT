            <p>Fiji police are investigating who leaked an explicit video of former cabinet minister Lynda Tabuya.</p>
        
            <p>The former minister for women, children and social protection has lodged a complaint with the police cybercrime unit, saying that circulation of the private video was a grievous form of cyberbullying.</p>
        
            <p>The explicit clip went viral and prompted Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka to dismiss Tabuya from his Cabinet, a decision he said was best for the people.</p>
        
            <p>The contents of the video, said to involve Tabuya and her husband, have caused scandal and a public backlash.</p>
        
            <p>Tabuya, who had been pushing to ban porn sites in Fiji, has described the leak as nothing short of gender-based violence.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the grim reality of what two thirds of women and girls in Fiji face, its gender-based online violence," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a grievous form of cyber-bullying and must stop if we are truly committed to ending violence against women and girls in Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was nothing illegal or immoral about sharing private videos and images between two consenting adults who are in a relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case it was me and my husband." she said.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy police commissioner of operations, Livai Driu, told RNZ Pacific that cyberbullying was a serious crime on many fronts.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to get to the people who have been circulating that because that's against the law, it's a human rights issue and it's an intrusion of privacy.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said Tabuya's case would not receive special treatment, because she was a politician.</p>
        
            <p>"We treat all Fijians the same, no-one is above the law here" he said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite her removal from Cabinet, Tabuya retains her position as a Member of Parliament. She was replaced by her assistant minister Sashi Kiran.</p>
        
            <p>However, calls for her resignation from Parliament have surfaced with critics citing the incident as damaging to public confidence.</p>
