            <p>Residents in Lower Hutt are desperately hoping a "sickening" stench coming from a wastewater treatment plant will stop, following a commitment from authorities.</p>
        
            <p>The smell from the non-compliant Seaview Wastewater Treatment plant has received hundreds of complaints this year.</p>
        
            <p>Exasperated residents at a public meeting on Wednesday night described the smell as vomit-inducing, preventing them from enjoying their backyards and affecting their businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Beavis has lived on Bell Road for 12 years. She said the stink coming from the nearby Seaview wastewater treatment plant was nauseating.</p>
        
            <p>“It smells like your backyard is being used as a toilet. It makes it impossible to sit outside on our deck on a nice evening, have a drink and watch the kids play.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s just impossible to do. Close the windows, sit inside.”</p>
        
            <p>Beavis said when she first moved to the area, there was only a slight, occasional whiff coming from the plant on a windy day.</p>
        
            <p>In recent months, it's become more frequent, and unbearable on a still day.</p>
        
            <p>Jaysen Eveleigh, who manages vehicle transportation business Auto Despatch, said when the stench came it was like being stuck inside a "portaloo".</p>
        
            <p>When it was really bad workers couldn't eat lunch and developed headaches.</p>
        
            <p>“If it was my business that was making this much smell, I would have been closed down.</p>
        
            <p>“Obviously it’s a necessity, we need to have it and all that sort of stuff, but the fact of the matter is, it needs to not smell.</p>
        
            <p>“We need to be able to go to work and actually breathe,” Eveleigh said. </p>
        
            <p>Over the past three years, Greater Wellington Regional Council has issued one abatement notice and eight infringement notices over the smell - totalling 7250.</p>
        
            <p>These have gone to Hutt City Council, Upper Hutt City Council, Wellington Water and the plant operator Veolia New Zealand. </p>
        
            <p>Nearly 150 complaints have been lodged by members of the public this year, and Greater Wellington opened an investigation into odours coming from the plant last month.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water’s group manager of network management, Jeremy McKibbin, said the plant's mechanism to dilute smells, called a biofilter media, was decomposing.</p>

            <p>But the process to replace it, caused an even stronger stench, which hit the suburb in November.</p>
        
            <p>McKibbin said this was likely to continue on and off for the next six weeks.</p>
        
            <p>“We expect the work to be finished in the last part of January, and then from that point on, the odour will gradually taper off.</p>
        
            <p>“But up until that point, it will be higher than it normally was during the earlier part of the year, and that’s unavoidable as we do the work.”</p>
        
            <p>That was of little comfort to Allen Levien, who runs the Wellington Top 10 Holiday Park in Seaview.</p>
        
            <p>He's going into his busy season now with tourists arriving from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Customer reviews have plummeted when the stench blows over to the park and he wanted the remedial work delayed.</p>
        
            <p>“While they’ve been scraping away and doing [the work] it has a big impact on us.</p>
        
            <p>“My attitude in [the meeting] was, why now? Seventy percent of our income comes in in the next three months.</p>
        
            <p>“I’d much rather they push it out to March, April, or May.”</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt Deputy Mayor Tui Lewis said the council was proposing to spend $13 million to improve the odour issues at the plant in the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>“The concern I have is they have put up with it for a long time now, it seems a long time to them.</p>
        
            <p>“It is in their houses, it is bad.”</p>
        
            <p>She said the council was proposing to prioritise the work in the next three years in its draft long-term plan – which will be voted on next year.</p>
        
            <p>Wainuiomata ward councillor Kerri Brown said 65-70 percent of Lower Hutt's entire rates intake went to water infrastructure, but the scale of upgrades required was stretching the capacity of the rating system.</p>
        
            <p>“Every part of water [infrastructure] at the moment - storms, waste, the sewage plant renewals, they are all in desperate need of work.</p>
        
            <p>“They are all at the almost break-down stage.”</p>
        
            <p>Residents say they are determined to see work gets done at Seaview in the hope they will be able to open their windows and sit on their decks once again.</p>
