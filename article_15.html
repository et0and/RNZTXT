            <p>It’s a story about sisterhood and survival against a dark backdrop but Josephine Stewart Tewhiu never set out to make a film about abuse in state care. </p>
        
            <p>The We Were Dangerous director was drawn to the story of the girls.</p>
        
            <p>Set in 1954, Daisy and Nellie are relocated to a facility on a remote island after being caught trying to escape an institution for delinquent girls. There they meet Lou, as they navigate sisterhood and survival under the thumb of a strict and devout matron. </p>
        
            <p>When the trio realise experiments are taking place as punishment, they hatch an intricate plan, railing against the system in rebellion. </p>
        
            <p>“I could see myself in them, I could see my friends in them and that’s what I wanted to tell.” she told Culture 101's Perlina Lau.</p>
        
            <p>It’s written by Maddie Dai, a cartoonist for the New Yorker, produced by Morgan Waru and executive producers include Carthew Neal and Taika Waititi.</p>
        
            <p>It’s Stewart Tewhiu’s directorial debut and there was also a personal connection. </p>
        
            <p>“My dad was raised in boys' homes his whole life. I knew of it and knew how destructive it could be.”</p>
        
            <p>Lake Alice survivor Leonie McInroe listened to a reading of the film script and spoke to the team about her experiences. </p>

            <p>“What she liked about our film was that the work celebrated the friendships and relationships formed in those places and that’s never talked about or discussed.”</p>
        
            <p>Stewart Tewhiu then recalls a story by McInroe. </p>
        
            <p>“They would light their menstrual products in this giant incinerator and they’d all stand around the incinerator lighting their cigarettes off it. That image - there’s something so anarchic about it - it gives the middle finger to the system. It’s very appealing.”</p>
        
            <p>The film, while set against a dark backdrop, aims to be triumphant and hopeful. Balancing that tone between a coming-of-age movie but grounded in a wider reality and truth was a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>“We didn’t want to show these moments of abuse on screen. I wanted to pivot the film and change the lens - and look at resilience and survival within that and finding the joy and humanity in these really dark moments. That’s where the comedy comes from.</p>
        
            <p>“You don’t want the comedy to be so silly that it looks like you’re taking the piss but you also want to authentically explore what a human being looks like and what friendship looks like.”</p>

            <p>The chemistry and energy between the three young actors is central to the film. </p>
        
            <p>In casting the three main girls, the director says she’s always looking for people who can be “authentically themselves”. </p>
        
            <p>“I love it when they feel comfortable enough to bring themselves to the character, to the work and I think that’s what makes the character lift off the page and makes them three-dimensional.”</p>

            <p>Rehearsals included improvising, giving the actors a chance to explore the characters and different scenarios beyond the script. </p>
        
            <p>Each rehearsal, Stewart-Tewhiu would tell Mania Hall, who plays the cheeky and endearing  Daisy, to steal something from one of the other cast members and reveal what she took at the end of each session. </p>
        
            <p>Another part of the strategy was to keep actor Rima Te Wiata, who plays the stern matron separate from the girls during rehearsals, in a different room. </p>
        
            <p>“When I finally brought them together for group rehearsals, they were a bit wary of her and weren’t so chummy straight away.”</p>
        
            <p>
For the soundtrack which is prominent throughout the film, Stewart TeWhiu had a clear vision - choirs. Not a professional choir, but a girls choir so it would give the impression and feeling it was made up from the girls in the film. </p>
        
            <p>“We were looking for this rawness and reluctance at times. We didn’t want them to sound in tune all the time. So we went to UNITEC and I asked the drama school students and eight volunteered.”</p>
        
            <p>Composer Cam Ballantyne worked with the students and Reb Fountain to execute the vision.</p>
        
            <p>“They’re singing in Latin - I will not be a wife, I will be free.”</p>
        
            <p>The percussive elements were the students using their own bodies - with the concept of bodily treatment and autonomy a key theme in the film.</p>
        
            <p>Upon reflecting on her debut feature film, Stewart Tewhiu says it was the most difficult but soul-rewarding experience.</p>
        
            <p>“I’m so proud of the film, I’m so proud of our team. I know we all worked the hardest we could. I can genuinely look back and I know I did my best with who I was and where I was at that time.”</p>
        
            <p>She admits to becoming addicted to peanut M&Ms and listening to Lizzo and Rage Against the Machine daily, but she says she would do it all again. </p>
        
            <p>“I made so many mistakes. I would love to have another go, knowing what I know now.”</p>
        
            <p>We Were Dangerous is in cinemas from 22 August.</p>
