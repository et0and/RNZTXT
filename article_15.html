            <p>WA Premier Roger Cook says he didn't mean to cause offence when he called US Vice President JD Vance a "knob" during a leadership forum in Perth earlier today, insisting it was a "lighthearted" comment.</p>
        
            <p>Cook, who is in the final week of the state election campaign that culminates on Saturday, made the remark to a journalist during a rapid-fire "finish the sentence" game in front of an audience of hundreds of people.</p>
        
            <p>"JD Vance is a … ?", the journalist asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Knob," Cook responded, sparking laughter and applause.</p>
        
            <p>The remarks come during the fallout of Donald Trump and Vance's contentious meeting with Ukraine President Vladimir Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday.</p>

            <p>Leaders in Australia have been tempered in their response to the incident, largely declining to comment on the approach taken by Trump and Vance, but re-affirming support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Questioned by reporters at a press conference later about whether the comment was damaging to the AUKUS relationship, Cook said he didn't believe the White House would have been listening.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think the people in the Oval Office are listening to a sub-jurisdictional CEO in Western Australia," Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a light moment in a formal function and I hope it was taken in the spirit in which it was intended.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a light-hearted and unprofessional moment and I didn't mean any offence by it."</p>
        
            <p>However, he noted that the remark had been applauded by many in the room.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of applause around the room, so perhaps some people enjoyed the fun that came with it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Other people might have been offended and I apologise if there was any offence,' the premier said.</p>
        
            <p>He said that apology extended to JD Vance.</p>
        
            <p>"If any offence was caused to the vice-president or anyone who heard those comments, I do apologise," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Cook's comments, Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers trod a delicate path.</p>
        
            <p>"It's up to Roger Cook to choose his own words. I mean [he's an] absolutely outstanding premier," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would chose different words. But that doesn't … I'm not making any judgements about the words that Roger chose."</p>
        
            <p>But former WA Premier Mark McGowan, who was also in attendance at today's forum, supported Cook's remarks.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought Roger was entirely accurate," he said when asked by reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"He answered a question honestly."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time Cook has been critical of Trump and his team.</p>
        
            <p>In November last year, on the last day of campaigning in the US election, Cook labelled Trump an economic threat to WA and warned of the "dark road" ahead if he was elected.</p>
        
            <p>Beware of any politicians promoting hatred, division and fear in the community." Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>He later told reporters Trump wanted to destroy trade between the US and China, which would have significant implications for WA.</p>
        
            <p>"China depends upon Western Australian iron ore … so in the event we have a Trump government that's obviously a very concerning development," he said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Asked at today's forum whether he still thought Trump represented a "dark road", Cook responded "well I certainly think he represents an uncertain one".</p>
        
            <p>WA Liberal leader Libby Mettam said Cook's comments showed he had his focus wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"They are foolish comments from a premier who has got his priorities all wrong," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The premier needs to focus on his job of fixing our broken health system, ensuring our lights stay on [and] addressing law and order issues across the community."</p>
        
            <p>But director of international and security affairs at think tank the Australia Institute, Emma Shortis, said many people probably agreed with the premier.</p>
        
            <p>"Many Australians are feeling pretty perplexed and concerned about what the Trump administration is doing, particularly what JD Vance did in the Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian president Zelenskyy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So maybe while it [Cook's comment] was a little bit unfiltered, I suspect that there are a few people in Australia and around the world as well who might share his feelings."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Shortis said this was reinforced by a recent survey undertaken by the institute which found Australians thought Trump was more of a threat to national security than Russian president Vladimir Putin or Chinese president Xi Jinping.</p>
        
            <p>WA is set to play a key role in AUKUS, the joint security partnership between Australia, the US and the UK.</p>
        
            <p>The nuclear-powered submarines at the centre of the deal will be maintained in Perth, a project that will create thousands of jobs and see US personnel stationed in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>Perth US Asia Centre chief executive Gordon Flake said Cook was treadling a fine line with his comments.</p>
        
            <p>"In the current environment, we have a US administration that is much less tolerant, and so I don't want to underplay the risk," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is little to be gained by deliberately poking the Trump administration in the eye but there's a balance there.</p>
        
            <p>"On the one hand, to make sure that they give voice to the values of their constituents, and they can advocate for Australia's national interest, and at the same time, seek to protect those interests."</p>
