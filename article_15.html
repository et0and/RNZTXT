        <h2>Tokelau is 'my heart and soul': New head of state</h2>

            <p>Fakaofo's Esera Fofō Tuisano arrived at his first parliamentary session for the year as Ulu-o-Tokelau, or Head of State, with his daughter by boat from his home on Fenuafala.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike the other two atolls, Nukunonu and Atafu, Fakaofo has two islets where the population lives: Falē, where the meeting house is, and Fenuafala, also known as Taī, where the main hospital and school is.</p>

            <p>Tuisano's inauguration was marked with a traditional ceremony called the Fakanofoga and dance or Fatele.</p>
        
            <p>In his previous role as the head of the waste management division, he was known as a "waste champion".</p>
        
            <p>He had also served as a member of the General Fono as a Fakaofo representative before becoming Faipule in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"I came in when Covid hit, the pandemic," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Tuisano was described as a "reluctant" politician by the Administrator of Tokelau, Don Higgins.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that you are a reluctant politician, but I also know that you are more than capable of the task that is ahead," Higgins said at the Fakanofoga.</p>
        
            <p>Higgins has watched Tuisano in action and described him as "a true leader" with an ability to, "always find agreement, to find a way forward, to do it with humour, and to do it in the best interest of Tokelau".</p>

            <p>Tuisano, described as a "humble man", will now be Head of State for the next year.</p>
        
            <p>"This would be my second time [in the role], hopefully my last," he joked.</p>
        
            <p>The Ulu-ship rotates between the leaders of the three atolls annually.</p>
        
            <p>"I am basically here to facilitate the wishes and visions of my people," Tuisano said.</p>
        
            <p>"If I can do that, it would be a huge achievement for me."</p>
        
            <p>For Tuisano, Tokelau is "everything".</p>
        
            <p>"It's my heart and soul," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hold on to our cultures and values, and also to be strong, to be proud Tokelauans. And to carry our tiny nation, through our ride up to the next level, whichever it is," Tuisano urged the next generation.</p>
