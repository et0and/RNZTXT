            <p>A legal challenge to the so-called gang patch ban has compared the controversial legislation to Nazi Germany and the Taliban.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Chris Nicholls is asking the High Court at Wellington to overturn the conviction of a young Māori man called Mana-Apiti Brown - a patched member of the Bad Company chapter of the Nomad gang.</p>
        
            <p>It's believed this is the first time an appeal to the new law, which was introduced in November, has been heard by the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Brown was convicted and discharged by a District Court judge in December for wearing the Nomads cap in the Lower Hutt suburb of Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>The 19-year-old was seen wearing the cap on council CCTV footage, standing on the footpath outside a Naenae cafe on the afternoon of December 7, 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Brown, who lives in Naenae, was in the town centre as part of a community day to celebrate the reopening of the pool, which had been closed for several years while it was earthquake-strengthened.</p>
        
            <p>The council downloaded the footage and reported it to police, who arrested Brown three days later.</p>
        
            <p>Brown told police the cap, which has the words, "YG Easty Mad B.C Nomad" in red writing with a yellow border, was his uncle's name in the gang's writing and colour.</p>
        
            <p>At a hearing in the Lower Hutt District Court, Brown admitted a charge of wearing gang insignia in a public place and sought a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Michael Mika refused Brown's request saying he wasn't satisfied the consequences of a conviction outweighed the gravity of the offending. Brown was convicted and discharged and the cap was seized.</p>
        
            <p>No one denies that Brown is a gang member or that he was wearing the cap.</p>
        
            <p>But Nicholls argues this case runs to something deeper - the erosion of an individual's rights.</p>
        
            <p>Not only does the new law infringe on the Bill of Rights and International Human Rights standards, but it is also inherently discriminatory, given Māori were over-represented in the gang population and therefore were more likely to be targeted with this law, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To tar someone with a criminal conviction, punishable for up to six months' imprisonment, just for wearing a cap is entirely disproportionate and the message needs to be sent to Parliament that it's not okay," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard that in passing the legislation Parliament had considered the implications on gang members' ability to express their identity, but considered these of "low value".</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls said to describe gang patches and clothing as "low value" was inconsistent with what was known about gang culture.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls said the lessons from history should serve as a warning for laws like this, citing international precedents including Nazi Germany, Saudi Arabia and the Taliban.</p>
        
            <p>He said when the Nazis came to power they didn't like the way Jews dressed and presented themselves, where they went to church.</p>
        
            <p>The Nazis wanted to cause maximum damage to Jews just like the Justice Minister Mark Mitchell had said he wanted to inflict on gangs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Previous generations had lost their lives fighting the Nazis so people could express themselves freely, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He also referred to Saudi Arabia and the Taliban in Afghanistan which criminalised women if they didn't adhere to strict dress codes.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls warned that if this conviction is allowed to stand it will set a disturbing precedent, that an individual in New Zealand will be criminally penalised solely for their choice of clothing.</p>
        
            <p>And police may invoke penal measures not for actions, but for expressed affiliations.</p>
        
            <p>George Fitzgerald, representing the police, said it would be inappropriate for the court to overturn Brown's conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament had been clear that the purpose of the new law was to reduce gang operations that cause fear, intimidation and disruption to the public.</p>
        
            <p>He said rather than seeking to overturn the conviction a more appropriate course of legal action might have been to seek a "declaration of inconsistency".</p>
        
            <p>Fitzgerald said Brown could have defended the charge, and didn't. While he accepted the gravity of offending was low in this case, the impact of a conviction on Brown was only speculative.</p>
        
            <p>Fitzgerald said there was nothing untoward about council volunteers passing the footage on to police.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, Fitzgerald said there had been no miscarriage of justice and the consequences of a conviction weren't out of proportion with the offending.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Christine Grice reserved her decision.</p>
