            <p>The latest victim of last week's rioting and looting in Papua New Guinea's capital is the city's top police commander.</p>
        
            <p>National Capital District commander Anthony Wagambie has been suspended for 21 days.</p>
        
            <p>Wagambie's suspension comes after an internal investigation by the PNG police Internal Affairs Directorate.</p>
        
            <p>Acting police chief Donald Yamasombi approved the suspension to "facilitate a thorough and impartial investigation", The National newspaper reported.</p>
        
            <p>"He [Wagambie] will have the opportunity to provide further information to investigators as is required during this [disciplinary] process," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first of potentially several more suspensions with the way in which some police personnel conducted themselves during the mayhem."</p>
        
            <p>The violence broke out in Port Moresby with shops and businesses set alight late last Wednesday, after public servants, including police and army personnel, went on strike over a payroll issue.</p>
        
            <p>As many as 22 people died in the violence, which prompted the government to issue a state of emergency.</p>
        
            <p>Last week the PNG commissioner of police David Manning was suspended alongside the secretaries of Finance, Treasury and the Department of Personnel Management.</p>
        
            <p>When announcing these suspensions last Friday, Prime Minister James Marape said "it's not good enough that operating agencies do not get to work properly that has caused us this stress".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific's PNG correspondent Scott Waide said there was strong public support for Wagambie online.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, PNG's Telecommunications Minister Timothy Masiu has announced that the government could shut down social media if people misused it during the state of emergency.</p>
        
            <p>Masiu, a former journalist, said there was significant evidence people have spread false information on social media sites leading to the destruction of properties in Port Moresby and around the country.</p>
        
            <p>The Port Courier reports him saying people who engage in such bogus activity will lose their social media accounts and could face arrest and charges for fomenting violence.</p>
        
            <p>Masiu said discussions on social media that incite violence, destruction, that spread false information or confidential government information, will be closely monitored.</p>
        
            <p>He said national security, public emergency and public safety is critical for a secure nation and happy and safe country.</p>
        
            <p>The government has already revealed the State of Emergency rules allow draconian measures such as searches of private homes, property, vehicles and phones by government agents.</p>
