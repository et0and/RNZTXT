            <p>Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has brushed off concerns around a rift in his ruling People's Alliance Party.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not see it as a stumbling block," Rabuka told reporters in New Zealand at a community event in Auckland's Māngere at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, he confirmed that "some members" in his party were planning to break away and form a new political party.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, several high-profile members of his party and cabinet have come out in support of him, including the likes of his deputy Manoa Kamikamica, Lands Minister Filimoni Vosarogo, Sugar Minister Charan Jeet Singh.</p>
        
            <p>Kamikamica, in a statement on Thursday, said those who were planning to start their own party should "resign immediately", adding that they had "no respect for the tens of thousands of Fijians that cast their vote because they believed in the Prime Minister and the People's Alliance vision."</p>
        
            <p>However, the prime minister said that raising concerns and listening is "healthy".</p>
        
            <p>"I think it will rejuvenate the party," Rabuka told reporters at a Fiji Day event on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"It will re-energize the party. It's about midway through the first term in government, and it's a time when people ask themselves, 'are they doing what they said they would be doing?'"</p>
        
            <p>The announcement is the latest in a string of scandals following reshuffling ministers, the appointment of a new attorney general and the turn of events in the anti-corruption office.</p>
        
            <p>A Fijian political commentator said the Fijian government's credibility had taken a hit.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury University Pro-Vice Chancellor Pacific Distinguished Professor, Steven Ratuva, told RNZ Pacific there have been a lot of high-profile scandals since Rabuka's three-party coalition came into power.</p>
        
            <p>"That hasn't done much in terms of giving Rabuka a good image," he said.</p>

            <p>"The government has been under a lot of stress, a lot of pressure, especially being a coalition government."</p>
        
            <p>But he said the announcement was not surprising because Fiji politics has always been fluid, with many fractures within parties.</p>
        
            <p>"After the breakup of the FijiFirst party, there's an abundance of, if you like, free agent politicians hanging around, and some of them might go with Rabuka, some might not.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a dynamic area and I think we're going to see some of it playing out in the next election."</p>
        
            <p>Rabuka has wrapped up a two-day official visit in New Zealand with the community event in Mangere to celebrate the nation's 54 years of independence.</p>
        
            <p>He held a private meeting with his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon in Auckland on Friday, was hosted to dinner by Luxon and then wrapped-up his visit with a packed community event.</p>
        
            <p>The two prime ministers discussed key areas of cooperation, including regional security, economic ties, and climate change, as part of the Fiji-New Zealand Duavata Partnership.</p>
        
            <p>While New Zealand and Fiji have stuck together during "hard times" there was a break in the relationship after Sitiveni rabuka's coup in 1987.</p>
        
            <p>"The bridges are being repaired, been rebuilt, and we are now going very well into the future. United," Rabuka told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Rabuka left New Zealand for Samoa for the 27th Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting or CHOGM.</p>
        
            <p>The Pacific island state was suspended from the grouping in 2006 following a military coup d'état.</p>
        
            <p>Rabuka said Fiji is in a very fortunate position as it had been expelled from the Commonwealth and now it's back in the "club".</p>
        
            <p>He hopes everybody will bear in mind that lesson, "behave or be out".</p>
