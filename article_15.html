            <p>The Chinese ambassador has signalled Beijing will conduct further naval deployments close to Australia, saying it's "normal" for a major power to deploy naval assets across the world.</p>
        
            <p>In his first comments since this month's arrival of a People's Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N) taskforce, Ambassador Xiao Qian declared there was no reason for China to "pose a threat to Australia" as both countries remain "strategic partners".</p>
        
            <p>Ambassador Xiao has also insisted the PLA-N does not need to apologise for last week's live-fire exercise in the Tasman Sea which disrupted dozens of commercial flights, saying international law does not specify how much advanced warning is needed.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see there's any reason why the Chinese side should feel sorry about that, or even to think about to apologise for that," the ambassador told the ABC in an interview while visiting Hobart.</p>
        
            <p>"The vessels conducted drills in a way that is in compliance with international law and international practice. They did make prior notification to the public in a way that is in accordance with international practices.</p>
        
            <p>"Different countries have a different practice and based on the nature of the drill, size of the drill, and the scope of the drill - my view is that the Chinese naval certification advice was appropriate".</p>

            <p>The ambassador declined to say whether the deployment of the "pretty disciplined" PLA-N taskforce was designed to send a message to Australia to stop conducting freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea.</p>
        
            <p>"I think our naval vessels (are) present in this part of the world, just like they're present in many other parts of the world.</p>
        
            <p>"They are part of the efforts to train, to practise and to rehearsal [sic], and that is a normal kind of practice for many navies in the world, and there should be no overreading into this."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether the arrival of the three warships was designed to occur just before Australia's federal election, the ambassador insisted Beijing did "not interfere" with foreign democratic processes.</p>
        
            <p>"As a major power in this region, as a country that has so many things to look after, it is normal for China to send their vessels to different parts of the region to conduct various kinds of activities," Ambassador Xiao said.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles urged Australians to take a "deep breath" over the PLA-N task group which is currently being tracked heading west along the southern coastline.</p>
        
            <p>This week in Senate estimates, Australia's Defence Secretary Greg Moriarty said he expected more frequent visits by Chinese warships to the region in future years, as Beijing consolidated its naval power.</p>
        
            <p>"It's claiming certainly regional and global interests as a maritime power, and I expect that they will wish to continue to be present in an increasing number of international waterways in the years ahead," Moriarty told Parliament.</p>
