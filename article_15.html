        <h2>Farmer's fashion line designed 'to last forever'</h2>
        <p>
Country Life - A farmer's frustration about declining wool prices has led her to create a line of designer coats from strong high micron wool, designed "to last… Audio

            <p>A sustainable fashion label was born and now grows on Georgina and Willy Lawson's sheep farm in Otago. </p>
        
            <p>The wool from the their Romdale hoggets is crafted into Atér designer coats and blazers. </p>
        
            <p>"Atér is my grandmother's name backwards" says Georgina, the label's founder, designer and mother to three young boys. </p>
        
            <p>Georgina's grandmother, Rita, was a professional dressmaker who specialised in wedding dresses.  </p>
        
            <p>"I spent lots of time in her sewing room as a child, fiddling around with her. She tried to teach me a thing or two. She was pretty clever. Very clever, actually." </p>

            <p>It was Georgina's inspirational grandmother and also the low value of strong wool, that gave her an entrepreneurial lightbulb moment.</p>
        
            <p>"I was grumbling at my husband about declining wool prices and he said, well, why don't you try and do something with it? And that's how I started finding out what I could do with this great fibre that we grow here on the farm." </p>

            <p>Woollen coats were a natural fit for the budding designer. </p>
        
            <p>"When we were living in London I got a bit of an obsession with coats so I thought, I'm going to start making my own."</p>
        
            <p>A lack of strong wool innovation has been a major frustration for New Zealand growers. Lawson is bucking this trend. </p>
        
            <p>She said her coats require a medium to high micron fibre, for strength and for the weaving of the fabric. </p>
        
            <p>"Strong wool has been used in carpets forever, and I thought, why can't we use that in the fashion industry and make a great piece that is going to last forever?" </p>
        
            <p>
The coats are made from hogget wool grown on the farm.

            <p>One of the biggest challenges she had to overcome was turning the raw fibre into a designer coat within the country. </p>
        
            <p>After much research, she mapped out a manageable production process for the wool.</p>
        
            <p>It's scoured in Timaru, carded and spun in Wellington, then it goes to Auckland to be woven into fabric, before cutters cut the pattern and it's sewn into the end garment. </p>
        
            <p>"It didn't make sense to have this great product here and then send it overseas, and then bring it back and sell it as New Zealand wool."</p>

            <p>"We go for a slightly oversized look, so it's a relaxed fit. We've got patch pockets, so nice and handy for phones and keys. It's a good length and very simple and classic."</p>

            <p>She has several other designs on the rack and is planning to release a new style next year, which she's already working on.</p>
        
            <p>"I still can't believe that people say that I'm a fashion designer. It was sort of a childhood dream that I never thought would actually come true," she says with a big smile.</p>
