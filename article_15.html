            <p>Transgender women have been barred from playing in international women's matches under new regulations from the International Cricket Council.</p>
        
            <p>Any player who has gone through male puberty will not be eligible for women's internationals regardless of any surgery or treatment undertaken.</p>
        
            <p>In September, Canada's Danielle McGahey became the first transgender cricketer to play an official international game.</p>
        
            <p>The new regulations will be reviewed within two years, the ICC said.</p>
        
            <p>Following a nine-month consultation process, the governing body said its new policy, which takes effect immediately, was based on "protection of the integrity of the women's game, safety, fairness and inclusion".</p>
        
            <p>"The changes to the gender eligibility regulations resulted from an extensive consultation process and is founded in science and aligned with the core principles developed during the review," said ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice.</p>
        
            <p>"Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women's game and the safety of players."</p>
        
            <p>Gender eligibility in domestic cricket will remain a matter for individual boards.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022 the world bodies for swimming and athletics both voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they had gone through any part of the process of male puberty.</p>
        
            <p>Cycling toughened its rules on transgender eligibility by doubling the period of time before a rider transitioning from male to female can compete.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby League has banned transgender players from women's internationals.</p>
        
            <p>Most New Zealand sports are going through a review process, while Boxing NZ has previously said they intend to establish an Open category.</p>
        
            <p>Sport New Zealand has guidelines allowing transgender athletes to participate in community sport in the gender they identify with and don't need to prove or justify their identity.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile the ICC says a "stop-clock" will be trialled in men's limited-overs internationals in order to regulate the time taken between overs.</p>
        
            <p>The trial, running from December to April, will require a fielding team to be ready to commence a new over within 60 seconds of the previous one ending.</p>
        
            <p>Failing to meet the time limit on three occasions in the same innings will result in a five-run penalty.</p>
