            <p>A mango gelato that was so good judges questioned if it was really vegan has won New Zealand's top gelato award.</p>
        
            <p>The Mango Lassi Vegan Gelato from boutique ice cream business Little 'Lato was awarded the supreme gelato champion at the NZ Ice Cream & Gelato Awards on Thursday night. The Milk Chocolate Ice Cream from New Zealand Natural took out the supreme champion award for ice cream. The annual event attracted more than 230 entrants from all over the country.</p>
        
            <p>"The perfumed mango and lassi flavours are magnificently displayed with a luxurious textural mouthfeel," said chef and chief judge Geoff Scott, of the flavour that also won the vegan and dairy-free awards. "Are we being tricked here? Is this actually vegan? This gelato really is absolute magic."</p>

            <p>The magic behind the mango lassi gelato is courtesy of Hannah Engelsman who started Little 'Lato in 2017 after she graduated from Italy's Gelato University. The ice cream brand has a handful of gelato bars and retailers that stock its gelato around the country including in Point Chev in Auckland, Timaru and Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Little 'Lato flavours picked up other awards in the competition for its Sour Cream Lemon and Berries Gelato and Hazelnut Chocolate Gelato. The business focuses on unique flavours that caters to various food needs such as dairy allergies.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Natural Ice Cream's Milk Chocolate Ice cream that won the supreme ice cream award "encapsulates the flavours and deliciousness of a childhood first milk chocolate bar experience," said Scott. "The chocolatey richness on the palate with an indulgent creamy texture - you can't stop eating."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Natural has been on the scene since the 1980s, bringing New Zealand's flair for ice cream to more than 30 countries around the world.</p>

            <p>A total of 19 awards were given out at the Thursday night event.</p>
        
            <p>"The ones that stood out for me were the category champions, displaying superb 'honest' flavours, they were well-constructed with perfect mouthfeel," said Scott.</p>
        
            <p>His favourite category to judge was the Invita NZ Open Creative Champion, which doesn't have to be commercially available giving ice cream makers a chance to experiment. Sensient Technologies won the award this year for Cherry Blossom Snowstorm with its "clever use of spritzy acid and floral yuzu," said Scott. "Great texture and flavour. A cooling, soothing ice cream set against a sharp, punchy ripple."</p>
        
            <p>Other flavours entered in the creative category were porridge and brown sugar, avocado, and smoked salmon and cream cheese, which Scott described as "really, really interesting."</p>
