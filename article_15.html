            <p>The Crusaders empire is crumbling.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time since the competition's inception in 1996, the Crusaders have lost their opening three Super Rugby matches.</p>
        
            <p>The defending Super Rugby Pacific champions were beaten 20-10 by the Fijian Drua this afternoon, their second consecutive loss in Latoka.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders skipper Scott Barrett said they simply did not execute the game plan.</p>
        
            <p>"We were not sharp or clinical enough. We were clear on our gameplan, but the greasy ball, we gave little opportunities and give the Drua a sniff and they will punish you."</p>
        
            <p>Things won't get easier for the Crusaders, with three local derbies in the next three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders struck first through their explosive All Black winger, Sevu Reece finishing off a scintillating backline move.</p>
        
            <p>The teams traded penalties as neither were able to gain ascendancy in the Fijian humidity.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Drua managed to string some possession together and a wide ball to Selestino Ravutaumada saw him brush off Chay Fihaki and step Willi Heinz to lock things up at 10-all.</p>
        
            <p>Kamara had the chance to take the lead before halftime but pushed his penalty attempt wide to see the sides head to the sheds all square.</p>
        
            <p>The Drua then took the lead five minutes after the break through halfback Frank Lomani who managed to sneak his way over from the base of a ruck.</p>
        
            <p>Another blistering break from the dangerous Ravutaumada set the Drua away on a stunning movement, just the final pass inching forward to prevent a possible try of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Dom Gardnier let one slip through his fingers as he intercepted a Lomani pass from a line-out five metres from the Drua line, but the blindside spilled the chance.</p>
        
            <p>The errors continued for the Crusaders, Joe Moody bobbling the ball on the deck to end another promising attack.</p>
        
            <p>Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula then pushed his side ahead by a further three points as the crowd began to sense the impending upset.</p>
        
            <p>A chance to pick up a consolation for the Cruaders went begging with a crooked lineout throw, which encapsulated the performances of the defending champions across the opening three rounds.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Drua 17 (Ravutaumada, Lomani tries, Armstrong-Ravula 2 pens, 2 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders 10 (Reece, tries, Kemara 1 pen, 1 con,</p>
