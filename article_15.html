            <p>The government is introducing a new aggravating factor targeting offences against small business owners whose homes and businesses are interconnected.</p>
        
            <p>The reform is one of the items listed in the coalition agreement between National and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after new sentencing reforms that prioritise victims and impose tougher consequences for criminals have passed the first reading in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian business community is likely to benefit from the reforms, as nearly a quarter of aggravated robbery victims in 2023 were of Indian origin.</p>
        
            <p>Data from Victim Support in March revealed that the Indian community was disproportionately affected by aggravated robberies last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty-four percent of aggravated robbery victims referred to Victim Support in 2023 were from the Indian community," the organisation said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Indian community leaders expressed disappointment over the government's response to law and order, despite recent announcements addressing crime.</p>
        
            <p>Recently, South Auckland households shared their growing concerns about safety in the region.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said courts have been issuing fewer and shorter prison sentences despite a 33 percent increase in violent crime, describing it as a troubling trend.</p>
        
            <p>"We must restore confidence in our justice system to denounce and deter criminal activity," Goldsmith said.</p>
        
            <p>Other reforms in the works include the introduction of a sliding scale for early guilty pleas and the offer of a maximum 25 percent sentence reduction for early pleas, decreasing to 5 percent if entered upon trial.</p>
        
            <p>These amendments aimed to prevent excessive discounts for late pleas and, in doing so, avoid costly, stressful trials for victims.</p>
        
            <p>The principles of sentencing will also be amended to require courts to consider any information provided about victims' interests.</p>
        
            <p>The government is encouraging the use of cumulative sentencing for offences committed while on bail, in custody or on parole to denounce behaviour that shows a disregard for the justice system.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, judges will be limited to a 40 percent cap on sentence discounts, except in cases where it would result in manifestly unjust outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>Another reform aims to prevent repeated discounts for young offenders and expressions of remorse.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said lenient sentences were failing to deter offenders, many of whom rely on their youth or expressions of remorse without a genuine attempt to reform their behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Two new aggravating factors are also included in the bill," he says.</p>
        
            <p>These targeted adults who exploited children and young people by encouraging them to offend, and offenders who glorified their crimes by livestreaming or posting them online.</p>
        
            <p>"Communities and hardworking Kiwis should not be made to live and work in fear of these offenders who clearly have a flagrant disregard for the law, corrections officers and the general public," Goldsmith said.</p>
        
            <p>"These reforms will help ensure there are 20,000 fewer victims of violent crime by 2029, alongside a 15 percent reduction in serious repeat youth offending."</p>
