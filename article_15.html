            <p>The building and construction minister is criticising councils for "stopping the clock" on building consent applications, after data showed 64 percent were paused so authorities could request further information.</p>
        
            <p>Annual data published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment shows a total of 146,655 applications were processed, with a median processing time of nine days.</p>
        
            <p>Building consent authorities (usually local or district councils) have a statutory obligation to process consents within 20 working days of receipt.</p>
        
            <p>However, after receiving an application, an authority can make a Request for Further Information (RFI) if essential information is missing. This 'stops the clock' on processing work until the response is received.</p>
        
            <p>The MBIE data showed an estimated 64.3 percent of applications had RFIs. Of those applications, the median time it took applicants to respond was 11.6 working days.</p>
        
            <p>In terms of time from start to finish, applications with an RFI had a median elapsed time of 25 working days.</p>
        
            <p>Building and construction minister Chris Penk said there was a "staggering cost" to the delays.</p>
        
            <p>"Time is money for our tradies, and officials estimate a 12 working day delay because of an RFI could cost around $4000 per dwelling," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every unnecessary delay affects real people - builders, businesses, and families waiting for their homes to be completed. That's why this government is pushing ahead with the most significant building consent reforms in a generation."</p>
        
            <p>MBIE's analysis suggested applications with higher building complexity categories were likely to have RFIs, spend longer responding in the RFI stage, and took longer overall to progress.</p>
