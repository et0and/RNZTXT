            <p>New Zealand-born Samoan Charm Tuala says it still feels surreal that he's on his way to prestigious Ivy League school, Brown University in the USA.</p>
        
            <p>Born and raised in South Auckland, Tuala graduated from De La Salle College where he was head boy in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island has an acceptance rate of about five percent. The application process is extensive requiring multiple essays.</p>
        
            <p>Tuala opened the congratulations email surrounded by his family at home last month.</p>
        
            <p>"It just felt like out of a movie; it didn't feel real. [It] still feels surreal," Tuala said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of nerves throughout the week but I trusted in God, knowing that he has a plan for me and whatever the outcome is, I'll be fine with it."</p>
        
            <p>Tuala said going to an Ivy League school "wasn't on the table" in high school and when he applied, he kept it under wraps.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't really something that seemed attainable, going overseas, especially going to an Ivy League school.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't think I'd be where I am today."</p>

            <p>Tuala looked into the idea of going while attending the University of Auckland last year.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought, wow, that would be such a great thing going there, not only for me but also my community."</p>
        
            <p>Tuala said the response from family and friends has been very positive.</p>
        
            <p>"Not just my parents, but a lot of people who acted like my parents who stepped in," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of people in my life who impacted me positively and just telling those people and just seeing the smiles on their faces.</p>
        
            <p>"They're just really proud of me and I think that's something that I always work towards, just to make them proud and make them smile. I'm glad that I could achieve that."</p>
        
            <p>Tuala is a keen sportsman and liked Brown's rugby program.</p>
        
            <p>He puts managing sports with academics down to his parent's influence.</p>
        
            <p>"They always told me to manage my time wisely and keep a balance."</p>
        
            <p>But he said school is always the number one priority.</p>
        
            <p>Tuala said at this stage he's interested in studying and a business career.</p>
