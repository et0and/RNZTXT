            <p>Two large saltwater crocodiles living in litter-filled caged pits behind a café in Solomon Islands are about to be rehomed by a New Zealand animal charity with a hand from Australia Zoo who will do the "crocodile wrangling".</p>
        
            <p>The "Kokonut Café Crocs" in Honiara have been living in the pits for their entire 12-year existence at the property, which is located behind the Office of the Prime Minister.</p>
        
            <p>Helping You Help Animals (HUHA) founder and chief executive Carolyn Press-McKenzie was in Honiara for a dog desexing campaign when they came across the crocs after being tipped off by a local.</p>
        
            <p>"When we found them, it was absolutely devastating," Press-McKenzie said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no water in there; there was litter and garbage everywhere.</p>
        
            <p>"We were told that locals weren't particularly fussed with them, so they'd get things thrown on them they'd get poked and they were quite far down in the pit, maybe about six foot down and they were big crocs."</p>
        
            <p>
New Zealand animal charity Helping You Help Animals (HUHA) is moving the crocodiles from behind Kokonut Cafe to a private sanctuary with help from Australia Zoo.

            <p>Press-McKenzie said they were living in small concrete pits about five by four meters only relying on rainwater.</p>
        
            <p>She said the crocs were owned by the elderly landlord of Koconut Café who used the site when he was younger to raise and sell baby dolphins and eagles.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole thing was very old school and not appropriate at all but the crocodiles, they're robust, and they survive anything apparently, so they've hung on and they were still there.</p>
        
            <p>"The elderly owner who owned the property, I don't think he wanted them anymore, he didn't want to be liable for anyone being hurt by them, so he was just keeping them in the pits."</p>
        
            <p>Crocodile attacks happen quite frequently in Solomon Islands and one of the duties of the local police force is to hunt and put down problem reptiles.</p>
        
            <p>Press-McKenzie said the landlord signed over ownership of the crocs to HUHA.</p>
        
            <p>She said Australia Zoo were excited to be part of their rehoming, having previously visited the crocodiles but were unable to get ownership signed over at that time.</p>
        
            <p>"They're going to do the crocodile wrangling, get them onto the back of a ute, and then travel them to their new location."</p>

Carolyn Press-McKenzie, Founder and CEO of Helping You Help Animals (HUHA) says the crocs are relying on rainwater and are living in litter filled pits.

            <p>The crocs will stay in Solomon Islands but will move to a private sanctuary of someone who already owned three crocodiles.</p>
        
            <p>"His place was actually great, and I just told him maybe he'd like to take these ones on, if we could pay for new enclosures. So, we're fundraising at the moment to get these habitats built."</p>
        
            <p>HUHA has set up a givealittle page asking for NZ$45,000 to cover the cost of the new habitat, they have currently fundraised just under NZ$3000.</p>
