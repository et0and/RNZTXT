            <p>When it comes to meal planning, Jordyn Hammond, a 21-year-old student nurse, takes thrift to the next level.</p>
        
            <p>She's in her final year of study and has a part-time job, but is on a limited income and manages to feed her household of two on $80 week. She's sharing her tips in the second episode of RNZ's new podcast Thrift.</p>
        
            <p>Follow and listen to Thrift on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, iHeart, YouTube Music or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>
        
            <p>It helps that she loves to cook, inherited some good housekeeping skills from her parents, and honed her budgetary skills flatting with three blokes at university.</p>
        
            <p>"They ate like horses, and I got a knack for being able to meal plan on a really low budget."</p>
        
            <p>Now she shares her tips on a blog where she posts sample weekly shops for budgets of $40, $70 and $80.</p>
        
            <p>Recipes are part of the mix too - Hammond lists the ingredients she uses and includes before and after shots.</p>
        
            <p>She strings out the vegetables, sometimes only using one or two in a dish. The meals are things like beef stroganoff, red Thai curry and chicken and bean tacos.</p>
        
            <p>Here's how she does it.</p>

            <p>A lot of us have had a repertoire of regular meals, but now more and more people are starting with the specials, adapting how they shop to use what's cheap.</p>
        
            <p>Hammond uses online shopping to hunt down the deals.</p>
        
            <p>"I look at what's on sale. So, for this week, it was broccoli for 99 cents"</p>
        
            <p>She searches up broccoli recipes online and checks out Uber Eats so she can find tasty dishes and then make them much more cheaply herself.</p>
        
            <p>"All the food on Uber Eats looks so good and so yum, but you don't want to pay like $30."</p>
        
            <p>To make her salads and other meals go a bit further, Hammond bulks them up with beans and lentils, because they're a good source of protein that keeps you fuller for longer.</p>
        
            <p>She uses the online shopping order form as a budgeting check list.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm over my budget for this week, what can I cut out and what can I substitute?"</p>
        
            <p>Veggies are a top priority, then meat. Hammond goes for what's on special every week.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's say I had fast fry beef, and then I thought okay, stew would be good."</p>
        
            <p>She'll spread the beef across a couple of meals to make it go further.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got pasta, so what can I make with pasta and beef steaks? Stroganoff. I can use yoghurt instead of sour cream. So basically, all I need is maybe a couple of mushrooms."</p>
        
            <p>Her weekly shopping list is ever-changing - the only thing she buys every single week is milk and bread.</p>
        
            <p>"Always, because then you can make toasted sandwiches, you can have a coffee."</p>
        
            <p>
Jordan Hammond: "You can make a pretty basic meal and have it taste really luxurious."

            <p>"If you season anything well enough, it'll taste good. You can make a pretty basic meal and have it taste really luxurious."</p>
        
            <p>Hammond's pantry is also super organised, she doesn't want to be buying anything she already has in the larder.</p>
        
            <p>When Hammond wanted to make French onion soup ("what I would class a fancy meal") she did some clever substitutions to make it cheaper.</p>
        
            <p>The soup required expensive cheese, which she swapped out for cheddar, and wine, for which she found a surprising alternative.</p>
        
            <p>"So, what's wine, it's fermented and acidic. What in my pantry is fermented and acidic? Marmite! So, I ended up mixing a little bit of Marmite with water and slowly added it to the soup. And it worked quite well."</p>
        
            <p>Hammond loves to bake and so despite the tight budgetary controls, life is not without treats, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"It might be flour, sugar, I always keep that replenished so when I do feel like having something I have the resources to go and make it.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing beats home baking - I love making brownies."</p>
