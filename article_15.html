            <p>The seven people hospitalised in Fiji with suspected severe alcohol poisoning are reported to be in a stable condition, Tourism Fiji chief executive Brent Hill says.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people, including four Australian tourists and one American, and two other foreigners who live in Fiji, had been drinking cocktails at the 5-star Warwick Resort in the Coral Coast before they fell ill.</p>
        
            <p>All have now been transferred to the larger Lautoka Hospital from Sigatoka Hospital because of the severity of their condition.</p>
        
            <p>Hill told RNZ Pacific they are all now in a stable condition and there had been improvement in some symptoms.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want to speculate on exactly the cause; we don't know that yet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But what we do know is that it was limited to only seven tourists at one resort and only at one bar in that resort as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Talking to the management they're quite perplexed as to how it's happened, and certainly there are no accusations around that something's been put into their drink or been diluted or using a foreign substance."</p>
        
            <p>According to DailyMail Australia, who first reported about the incdent, one resort guest who was there said, "All the victims were ladies."</p>
        
            <p>"The people who drank the pi√±a colada became unwell,' the guest told the news outlet.</p>
        
            <p>"My friend was the worst of the lot."</p>
        
            <p>The guest, who requested anonymity, said when they went to check on their friend and get ready for dinner, "She wasn't responsive. She was having severe seizures and foaming at the mouth."</p>
        
            <p>Hill said the tourism industry was very conscious of the recent tainted alcohol incident in Laos, where several people died, but said it's "a long way from that".</p>
        
            <p>"The resort has certainly given us assurance that there's no indication around substituting substances in beverages and so on. So it's a little bit of a mystery that a nice resort would experience something like this."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if tourists needed to be careful ordering cocktails in Fiji, Hill said people needed to be careful anywhere around the world, including at home.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk is very, very small, but at the same time, we don't want to diminish for these seven people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously been a really unfortunate experience and we certainly are trying to work out what's caused that and our investigation is continuing."</p>
        
            <p>Brent said he has never heard of anything like this happening in Fiji before.</p>
        
            <p>He hopes it would not affect Fiji's reputation as a tourist destination.</p>
        
            <p>"I do understand, of course, based on recent events in Southeast Asia that people want assurance that they can be safe, and certainly from our perspective it's a really isolated case."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Warwick Fiji told RNZ Pacific that they have "nothing to disclose".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific was told the general manager of the high-end resort will not front for an interview because the suspected poisoning was still under investigation.</p>
