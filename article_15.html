            <p>Auckland athlete Yanhao (Dwayne) Li has created history, winning New Zealand's first ever ice figure skating medal at any form of Winter Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>The 15-year-old was clinical in his free skating performance at the Gangwon 2024 Youth Olympic Games, landing a triple axel for the first time ever in competition.</p>
        
            <p>He also performed a triple lutz, triple toe loop, and triple lutz double axel-double axel combination to secure the podium spot.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really proud of myself for being here and performing in front of such a big crowd," Li said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the first time I'd ever done a triple axel in competition and I was really pleased to stay on my feet. It was pretty exciting."</p>
        
            <p>The performance earned Li a combined total of 208.84 points following his short programme performance two days earlier. The score securing him the bronze medal behind Adam Hagara from Slovakia who took silver, and South Korea's Hyungeyeom Kim who won gold.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a very special moment for me and it's so great that all the hard work leading up to this has paid off.</p>
        
            <p>"After getting a taste of what this feels like, I'm really excited to reach for the main Winter Olympics. I'll be too young for Milano Cortina so I'm aiming for 2030."</p>
        
            <p>Li's coach Bess Cao broke down in tears when the medal was confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"It was such an amazing moment, everyone can see he's very special," said Cao. "I truly believe this is only the beginning, this wont be our only Olympics, we will do much more."</p>
        
            <p>Li was born in Beijing, China where he began skating aged four before his family immigrated to New Zealand aged eight.</p>
