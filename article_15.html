            <p>A medical advisor from New Zealand's Immunisation Advisory Centre says dengue is expected to increase with climate change and urbanisation.</p>
        
            <p>In its report for the period of 1-14 April, Samoa's Ministry of Health said the country had 216 laboratory-confirmed cases from November 2023 to the end of that two-week reporting period.</p>
        
            <p>There were 82 new cases reported in the two weeks to 14 April.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Joan Ingram said cases of dengue have increased more than six-fold since 2000.</p>
        
            <p>"It is expected that cases will continue to increase with climate change and urbanisation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Between 2012 and 2021 there were 69 outbreaks of dengue fever among the Pacific Islands."</p>
        
            <p>She said after an infected mosquito bite there was an incubation period of 5 to 7 days (maximum 10).</p>
        
            <p>Dengue infection may be unnoticed, a mild illness or significant illness with fever, pain behind the eyes, bone, joint and muscle pain, and sometimes rash, vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
        
            <p>"In up to 5 percent of infections - most often after a second infection - serious complications such as bleeding or shock can arise.</p>
        
            <p>"There are four different dengue viruses, and infection with one gives long-term protection from that virus, but may make the illness following one of the other three dengue viruses more serious."</p>
        
            <p>World Mosquito Programme director of global delivery Cameron Simmons said Samoa, like most other countries in the Western Pacific, had a long history of being impacted by dengue outbreaks.</p>
        
            <p>He advocated for the Wolbachia method, developed by his organisation, which gave mosquitoes the bacteria to reduce their ability to transmit dengue, Zika and other viruses.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that insecticides and environmental clean-up campaigns can help a little to control the outbreak, but they are short-lived interventions that will not stop future outbreaks in Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>"This most recent surge in dengue case numbers is troubling because the case numbers will inevitably increase, stressing the health system and hurting the wellbeing of patients and their families."</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's Ministry of Health recommended cleaning up stagnant water sources, wearing clothing to minimise mosquito bites, and using mosquito nets and repellants.</p>
        
            <p>Half a day on Friday would be dedicated to the dengue-related clean-up of public spaces and government buildings.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry's acting director general Dr Glenn Fatupaito said the clean-up was an effort to eradicate mosquito breeding grounds.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea is the different ministries surrounding the areas just clean up areas and waterways, any place that holds water, potential breeding grounds and such," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He also said pot plants can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes, as certain plants hold water.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one thing that was also discussed - people love Bromeliads, especially in Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're going to plant such plants, keep it at least 100 yards from your household to reduce potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes."</p>
        
            <p>The health ministry was also urging households to look out for their high-risk family members.</p>
        
            <p>"We're mindful of our very old, our very young, our pregnant women as well," Dr Fatupaito said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want any complications, and if you're sick: the supportive treatment, bedrest, lots of fluids, paracetamol, and come see a doctor if things are getting worse."</p>
        
            <p>He said with numbers expected to rise, the ministry would release weekly online updates starting on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Safe Travel website was suggesting anyone travelling to, or living in, Samoa have comprehensive medical and travel insurance policies.</p>
