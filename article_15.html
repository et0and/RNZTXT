Analysis: New Zealand is being urged to spend 2% of GDP on defence, but is that possible and would it make a difference?

            <p>Analysis: The 2 percent GDP spend on the military that New Zealand is being urged to match has had its share of detractors recently.</p>
        
            <p>RAND, the corporation that defined the term "think tank", went so far as to give the US government a whole new way of measuring if countries were pulling their military weight - the "burden-sharing index".</p>
        
            <p>"The world will not suddenly become a safer place if every ally hits that magic number," it said in January, as it promoted the index.</p>
        
            <p>Weeks later, at the February Munich security conference, the Trump administration staged its turnabout on Europe and laid down the GDP spending law: 2 percent was now no longer enough, and at least 3 and even 5 percent was the goal, Donald Trump declared.</p>
        
            <p>But RAND pointed out: "Asking them, 'How much do you spend?' is a poor substitute for asking, 'How much are you doing?'"</p>
        
            <p>Other analysts have been here before. In 2020, the Atlantic Council, another leading US think tank, ran an article headlined: Rethink and replace 2 percent.'</p>
        
            <p>"Trump uses the fact that most member states have not yet met the 2 percent target as proof that the United States is being taken advantage of by its allies," it said towards the end of his first term.</p>
        
            <p>"Beyond the political challenges, the metric remains an arbitrary and inefficient tool for defence planning. It does little to indicate ... effectiveness."</p>
        
            <p>After NATO set the 2 percent target in 2014, it became the proxy "indicator of the political resolve of individual allies".</p>
        
            <p>The closest New Zealand's resolve got in the ensuing decade was 1.34 percent of GDP in 2020. It was particularly low before 2016.</p>
        
            <p>The spend had to rise, said Dr Juhn Espia - a research fellow at Christchurch's Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs - but 2 percent was beyond reach for now.</p>

            <p>"I don't think that this [is] realistic in the short-term," he told RNZ on Friday. "Prime Minister [Christopher] Luxon was wise in the choice of words here - 'as close to 2 percent as we possibly can' - because he realises how small the pie is."</p>
        
            <p>How the pie will be sliced will become clearer when the defence capability plan is released. But 2 percent poorly spent would not help much.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine two countries," RAND said. "One spends 2.1 percent of its GDP on defence, mostly to maintain aging equipment and pay pensions to military retirees.</p>
        
            <p>"The other spends just 1.9 percent, but it has a well-trained army, modern equipment, and a top-of-the-line military drone industry. The first country satisfies the 2 percenters, but no commander in the world would prefer it as an ally over the second country."</p>
        
            <p>Greece has beaten the 2 percent all decade, peaking at over 4 percent of GDP spent on defence in 2022. But its spending on personnel was so inefficient that Greece scored near the bottom for efficiency, in a 135-page report for the European Parliament just last November about improving the quality of the defence spending, which ballooned on the continent by almost 12 percent last year.</p>
        
            <p>Greece was around 0.2 on several efficiency measures, versus France on 1.0.</p>
        
            <p>The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said when it came to quality, the 2 percent fixation was not helping.</p>
        
            <p>"It masks actual capabilities, contributions, sustainability and effectiveness of spending while also incentivising states to adopt broader definitions of defence spending."</p>
        
            <p>The Atlantic Council said examples "abound of allies that spend relatively little but spend it efficiently and for necessary purposes".</p>
        
            <p>It mattered, too, where a country shopped for weapons. Russia supplied itself in large part, said IISS, so while its military spend last year was less than a third of Europe in actual dollars, it got fractionally more bang for its buck because Europe increasingly relied on higher-priced US imports.</p>
        
            <p>The 2 percent was labelled "arbitrary" by Canada's Ploughshares peace research institute. It was not "was not evidence-based policymaking", it said in December.</p>
        
            <p>Canada has been in the gun for spending almost as little as New Zealand - 1.3 percent of GDP in 2023. But the institute said Canada's non-military contribution to collective security through diplomacy, development and disaster aid, and peacekeeping should count for something.</p>
        
            <p>RAND came up with something similar in its burden-sharing index, in a 2017 report for the Office of the US Secretary of Defence. It updated the index figures in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The index counts the cost to a nation of peacekeeping and enforcing economic sanctions, along with total defence spending. Any score above 1.0 meant a country was pulling its weight: The US on 1.07 trailed NATO as a whole, on 1.10.</p>
        
            <p>About 20 countries scored below 1.0, but RAND did not name them.</p>
        
            <p>The index showed the US taking less of the burden for NATO and other partners, down from 53 percent in 1990 to 39 percent in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not a small number - but it's also not a flashing red sign that we're being taken to the cleaners," RAND researcher King Mallory said in January.</p>
        
            <p>Asian countries, including Oceania, were calculated as taking 13 percent of the burden. Singapore helped with that - it was a small state that New Zealand should look to, said Espia, who is based in the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>"The contrasts are astounding - New Zealand currently has one of the smallest navies in the world, consisting of nine vessels - frigates, patrol vessels, and logistical support vessels. Singapore, on the other hand, with one of the smallest EEZs and shortest coastlines in the world, has 40 warships."</p>
        
            <p>Manning the navy was becoming a problem, so conventional weaponry was now being mixed with emerging tech.</p>
        
            <p>"In its latest set of 10 new surface warships and two new submarines, Singapore has opted to equip these platforms with uncrewed and automated systems," Espia said.</p>

            <p>An 8000-tonne ship could be crewed by 80 sailors. New Zealand's Te Kaha is half that tonnage and has over twice the crew.</p>
        
            <p>This came at a price: Singapore spends about four times more in dollar terms than New Zealand on defence.</p>
        
            <p>How much New Zealand chose to spend, and on what, depended on it "fully opting into the Western alliance (including AUKUS) or retaining a more middle-ground participation that will allow the country to cooperate on an issue-based, contingent basis", Espia said.</p>
        
            <p>But 2 percent, whatever its detractors have said, will still be the measure. In February, round figures - and not indexes - were all Trump was talking about.</p>
