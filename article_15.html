        <h2>ACT stands by referring sexual abuse survivor to lawyer, not police</h2>
        <p>

            <p>ACT leader David Seymour is standing by his party's response to a warning its former president was a sexual predator.</p>
        
            <p>Ex-president Tim Jago sexually abused two teenage boys he knew through a sports club in mid to late 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>He was convicted of eight charges of indecent assault last year and was finally named last Friday when he abandoned a years-long fight for ongoing name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>Jago had been the ACT Party's president for nearly four years when he resigned from the role in late January 2023.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has previously reported the survivor's wife contacted the ACT Party on Facebook three months before Jago was charged, warning that Jago was a sexual predator.</p>
        
            <p>A party staffer initially dealt with the message before ACT leader David Seymour personally responded and advised she contact a lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>He gave the woman the phone number of an employment lawyer and said she and her husband were free to contact them.</p>

            <p>The survivor's wife wrote back to ACT saying her husband had decided to go to the police instead in the hope he could prevent further offending.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Nine to Noon on Monday, Seymour was asked if he would do anything differently, including referring the survivor speak to the police at the outset.</p>
        
            <p>"No, we wouldn't and again, you know, it will be easy for people to speculate without full knowledge of the facts,without having been there," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very confident that facing a very difficult situation, which, as it turns out, turned on some tragic circumstances, we did everything that we could that an organisation in our position faced."</p>
        
            <p>The party first addressed the Jago case last on Friday, saying it had sought guidance from Paul Wicks KC at the time and followed that advice "to the letter".</p>
        
            <p>Last week's statement said there was "no way" ACT could have known Jago was an abuser as the offending occured 20 years before his involvement with the party.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking this morning, Seymour said attempts to link Jago's sexual offending to the ACT party were "shameful".</p>
        
            <p>"The people who are out there trying to somehow drive guilt by association when there were 20 years separating the events, frankly, I think is shameful."</p>
        
            <p>Jago, currently in jail serving a two-and-a-half year sentence, plans on appealing his convictions and sentence later this month.</p>
