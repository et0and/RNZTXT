        <h2>'The lure of money filled my nostrils': $100 a deer in venison boom</h2>
        <p>
I thought this is gold mine. He lent me a rifle, and I went off. And after three trips, I managed to shoot my first deer," remembers hunter and author, Davidâ€¦

            <p>David Miller remembers a time when if he shot and delivered a deer to buyers, he would rake in more than he made in his day job in a week.</p>
        
            <p>He had a good job too, a civil engineer at a local council.</p>
        
            <p>He recalls his hunting days in a new book 'Wow', A Dollar Pound.</p>
        
            <p>He had no interest in hunting until a chat with mate in a pub alerted him to the price venison was fetching, he told RNZ's Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>"He told me he'd just got $100 for a deer, and I scoffed a bit, because I was pretty highly paid at the council, and $100 was more than I was earning in a week. In fact, I was one of the higher paid people, and I was on about $60."</p>
        
            <p>But when he saw the cheque, he realised there was serious money to be made.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought this is gold mine. He lent me a rifle, and I went off. And after three trips, I managed to shoot my first deer, and I became a deer hunter."</p>
        
            <p>He'd never shot a deer before, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Never even seen one. The lure of money sort of filled my nostrils So I became pretty successful at it, and I coupled up with a mate and away we went."</p>
        
            <p>When they delivered the deer there were formalities to be observed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you took a deer and they weighed it they said, 'who shot it?' So sometimes, by mistake, somebody would say, Rob Muldoon, so they would write that down.</p>
        
            <p>"Another big hunter was 'C. Ash' and they would write out a cash cheque for you. And then away you went to the nearest hostelry, and they would cash it for you.</p>
        
            <p>"But unfortunately, sometimes you forgot to pay the tax on it, of course. In fact, I don't think anybody ever paid tax on it."</p>
        
            <p>At the height of the boom 'Rob Muldoon' was a top shooter in New Zealand, Miller reckons.</p>
        
            <p>These days $100 doesn't go far, but in the mid-'60s it was serious money, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It would buy you 170 litres of petrol, it'd buy you about 700 loaves of bread, it'd buy you 200 jugs of beer. So, $100 was a was a lot of money, and 30 deer would buy you a brand-new Vauxhall Velox car."</p>
        
            <p>The price was driven by lack of supply in Europe, he said, and the herds in New Zealand, lacking any predation, had grown rapidly.</p>
        
            <p>"Once they established an export market, I think it was in Germany and Holland mainly. I don't know how they established the market. All I know is it was like a gold mine, and I jumped on the bandwagon."</p>
        
            <p>All good things come to an end however, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The boom time stopped in about 1972 and it just fell to bits, so from over $1 a pound, it went to 23 cents. So, you sort of knocked it on the head then."</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, Miller made hay while the boom was on, he reckons he shot 300.</p>
        
            <p>He believes foot hunting deer should be encouraged today.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is a terrific resource there, real high-quality meat with game animals, and it's a pity we just poison them and leave them to rot on the ground when people could be advantaged by them."</p>
