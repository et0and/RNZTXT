            <p>Thirty-three Air New Zealand employees are challenging the company's Covid-19 vaccination policy in the employment court.</p>
        
            <p>A six-day hearing began in Auckland on Monday morning, with evidence from one of the plaintiffs, Airbus pilot Captain Leif Fredricsen.</p>
        
            <p>Fredricsen declined to get the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in 2021, which he said led him being put on paid leave from 7 January 2022, and then unpaid leave from 17 February 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Fredricsen since received the Novavax vaccine, and resumed work with Air New Zealand in April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was hesitant to get the Pfizer vaccine in 2021 - the only vaccine available in New Zealand at the time - because he believed trying the first of any kind of product inevitably "comes with risks."</p>
        
            <p>Fredricsen said he was concerned it had been developed in response to the Alpha variant, not the subsequent mutations, and that it didn't provide full immunity against the virus.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot said the company's "hard line" vaccination policy was a "terrible surprise" and seemed to be more focused on business continuity and revenue than the health and safety of employees.</p>
        
            <p>He claimed it was abundantly clear his employment contract would be terminated if he did not comply with the rules.</p>
        
            <p>"It felt as if we did not comply, our livelihood would be taken forcibly from us," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Counsel for Air New Zealand Peter Kiely challenged "that was not what happened", and pointed out that Fredricsen had not had his employment terminated.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, about a third of Air New Zealand's workforce lost their jobs in the pandemic by way of redundancy, including many pilots, Kiely said.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing is set down for six days.</p>
