        <h2>Slain police officer farewelled as a life saver and 'fearless' matriarch</h2>
        <p>
Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming, 62, was laid to rest on Thursday following a funeral with full police honours.
</p>
        
            <p>The first policewoman to be killed in the line of duty in New Zealand has been honoured as a "fearless" matriarch of her station who saved the lives of many.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming, 62, was laid to rest on Thursday following a funeral with full police honours, attended by hundreds at Nelson's Trafalgar Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was killed in the early hours of New Year's Day after being struck by a vehicle in central Nelson - as a senior officer it was shift she did not have to volunteer for, but she had done so anyway.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man, who has name suppression was charged with her murder.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's family, friends and police colleagues all described Fleming as a person who was humble and did not like to be the centre of attention, but would be fearless when it came to protecting and advocating for her staff and community.</p>

            <p>Celebrant Diana Strong mentioned Fleming would be "absolutely horrified" to be the centre of attention like this, as she felt more comfortable sitting in a fourth or fifth row away from the spotlight.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, the length of Fleming's service to the police force - 38 years and seven months - and the nature of her death, attracted the attention of the entire nation. Public figures including Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Police Minister Mark Mitchell and Nelson Mayor Nick Smith all attended the service.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of police staff from across the country were also present as well as representatives from Australian and US police forces.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's casket was carried into the centre adorned with yellow and orange flowers, wrapped in a New Zealand flag with her police hat and a korowai on top.</p>
        
            <p>The service began with Strong outlining Fleming's early years, which included working as a nurse before heading into the police force.</p>

            <p>She met her husband, Bryn, who was also an officer, in 1986, married in 1991, and settled in Auckland for a few years before moving home to Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>They had two children, now both adults - Rayna and Aren Olsen - and Fleming became heavily involved with Irish dancing and her beloved netball, Strong said.</p>
        
            <p>"Lyn saved lives... she was the matriarch of the Nelson Police Station."</p>
        
            <p>Both of Fleming's children and her younger brother Michael 'Woody' Fleming, spoke during the service.</p>
        
            <p>Her son said his mum had an "incredible ability to avoid recognition for everything she did".</p>

            <p>"I am sorry for all the fuss I know you would have hated being the centre of attention like this.</p>
        
            <p>"Feel the aroha, the love in this room and beyond. Rest now and let us carry your torch from here."</p>
        
            <p>Fleming had idolised his older sister growing up. He last saw her two weeks before her death while they visited their elderly parents, who were also present at the service.</p>
        
            <p>"When it was time for her to go we hugged and I said 'See ya sis' and she said 'See you little bro' - and then she left.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know it was goodbye."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson College for Girls director of sport Jon Routhan said outside of her work as a police officer, Fleming had been a dedicated netball coach and "mama bear" to her girls.</p>

            <p>"She found a place where she could genuinely help young people. She taught them about respect, humility and how to look after teammates when they were down, she taught them to smile.</p>
        
            <p>"She was the best of us, and she was a pretty damn good netball coach too."</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers mentioned Fleming did not need to work her last shift as she was a senior officer and could have asked not to, but she did anyway.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a senseless and unprovoked act of violence," Chambers said about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>He had looked at Fleming's police file and said it was "full of goodness", with cards and letters of thanks from the community for what she did for them in their times of need.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking directly to her children, Chambers told them their mum had been a "superstar".</p>
        
            <p>"Your mum has paid the ultimate price and for that, I am sorry."</p>

            <p>District Commander Tracy Thompson and Dave Gibson, a former police inspector and long-time colleague both mentioned the fearless nature Fleming had when it came to supporting her team.</p>
        
            <p>"Lyn cared deeply for those in her charge. Rank didn't matter, if something needed to be said for their safety and welfare she would voice it, Thompson said.</p>
        
            <p>Gibson said she would confront commanding officers for her staff if it was needed.</p>

            <p>"She was the matron of the station, the mother figure and the oracle. She went out of her way to help people be the best they could be."</p>
        
            <p>The service ended with Strong urging those present to "seize life with good intention" in Fleming's memory.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking directly to Fleming's husband, Strong said, while he may have taken a backseat at times to her many commitments, he was her "essential backbone".</p>
        
            <p>"The heart of the nation stands with you," Strong told Fleming's children.</p>

            <p>Fleming's casket was carried out by her police colleagues and a number of officers performed a haka, Ko Te Uru Pounamu, in her honour outside.</p>
        
            <p>Bagpipes accompanied the motorcade as it made its way down the road, before the livestream ended with an image of Fleming, smiling, with her arms crossed.</p>
        
            <p>Next to the image were the words, "Lyn Fleming 26 July 1962 - 1 January 2025", and a Huia feather, a symbol of remembrance for those who died in the line of duty.</p>
