            <p>A gaggle of Canada geese that sparked warnings to Auckland motorists have been persuaded to move off the road, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier warned motorists on State Highway 18, near the Constellation Drive on-ramp, to drive with caution while they responded to the bird alert.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have been made aware of a significant number of Canadian geese on the road," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers have been deployed to try and clear the road but, for now, motorists should drive with caution in the area."</p>
        
            <p>A traffic cam image showed more than 50 of the geese wandering along the road.</p>
        
            <p>After careful shooing efforts, "officers managed to shepherd the birds back through the fence alongside the road", they said in an update just after noon on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 18 connects West Auckland with the North Shore.</p>
