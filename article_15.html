        <h2>Wellington gets first glimpse of heritage wall celebrating Indian migration</h2>
        <p>
The installation is part of the Wellington Indian Association's centennial celebrations, marking 100 years since its founding.
</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds attended events in the capital over the weekend to celebrate the Wellington Indian Association's 100th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>A heritage wall showcasing the history of Indian migration to New Zealand was unveiled in the southeastern suburb of Kilbirnie.</p>

            <p>A formal event was also held in Kilbirnie at Bharat Bhavan - home of the Wellington Indian Association - on Saturday afternoon as part of the commemorations.</p>
        
            <p>The association is also organizing a gala dinner in July, featuring special entertainment.</p>
        
            <p>"This heritage wall is dedicated to all those past members of the samaj (community)," said Manisha Morar, president of the Wellington Indian Association.</p>

            <p>Morar, who played a key role in the creation of the wall, said the project began more than a decade ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We looked at how much of Aotearoa's history includes the Indian community, and there isn't much," she said. "This heritage wall has been quite a journey."</p>
        
            <p>She explained that extensive work was required to bring the wall to life, with the team delving into old archives and translating a vast amount of information from Gujarati into English.</p>
        
            <p>"When you really look at the different aspects of the community, it's not just about culture," Morar said. "It's about supporting social work, women, children, learning the language, engaging with the wider community and celebrating those who have made significant contributions to Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>Saira Naran, whose parents have been involved with the association since its inception, described the organisation as an integral part of her life.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like it's home," Naran said.</p>
        
            <p>Naran's father arrived in New Zealand when he was 4 years old, and her mother when she was 8.</p>
        
            <p>Naran said the heritage wall had helped her learn more about her family's history that she missed as a child.</p>
        
            <p>"This wall, at my age now, just cements the fact of what they did to get us to where we are today," she said.</p>

            <p>Third-generation Kiwi Indian Raman Chhima shared a similar sentiment. His grandparents arrived in New Zealand in 1913.</p>
        
            <p>"My family is one of the earliest settlers, and just having something that acknowledges what they have actually achieved here is a great honour," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Dipak Bhana highlighted the importance of celebrating the early settlers and their perseverance.</p>
        
            <p>"[My grandparents] used to collect bottles and sell fruit. My dad, in his early days, unloaded coal from ships along the harbour - they had a really tough life," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But they managed to survive â€¦ it's a real celebration of them, of those who ensured there was a place for Indians to celebrate their religion, language and heritage."</p>
        
            <p>Neeta Bhushan, India's high commissioner to New Zealand, acknowledged and praised the foresight of the association's founding members.</p>
        
            <p>"In 1925, India wasn't even independent, and yet our community was already playing a role in binding our two countries together, participating in various events, and establishing their livelihoods here. That is just fantastic," Bhushan said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Wellington Indian Association is an icon of sorts - it existed even before the Indian High Commission was established," she added.</p>

            <p>Mervin Singham, CEO of the Ministry of Ethnic Communities, also paid tribute to the association's contributions.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to acknowledge a lifetime of work by the Wellington Indian Association in uniting, serving and celebrating New Zealand's Indian heritage," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Singham noted that he had personally witnessed association members collaborating with other communities to support Wellington's growth as a multicultural society.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged the community to continue building bridges across different groups.</p>
        
            <p>He also recognised the Indian community's economic contributions to New Zealand and urged members to use their expertise to strengthen ties between the two nations.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2021, ethnic communities contributed $64 billion to the New Zealand economy - that's about 20 percent of our country's GDP," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Morar said the association had evolved and should be a welcoming space for people from all cultures, not just Indians.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to open the centre up to as many cultures as possible and be grateful for who they are and what they bring to our city," she said.</p>
