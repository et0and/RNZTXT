            <p>Finals footy is in full swing in the NRL as we find ourselves just one week away from the 2024 grand final. Will we see one of the big three in the Melbourne Storm, Sydney Roosters or defending champions Penrith Panthers crowned the kings of 2024? Or perhaps there's an upset on the cards in the way of the fourth-placed Cronulla Sharks, who have fought tooth and nail to find themselves at the business end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>We preview all of the weekends fixtures.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9:50pm Friday 27 September NZT</p>
        
            <p>AAMI Park - Melbourne</p>

            <p>Two absolute powerhouse clubs meet in what will be one of the most anticipated games of finals football in recent times; minor premiers Melbourne Storm have been on cruise control once again as they find themselves in yet another preliminary final, whilst a resurgent Sydney Roosters outfit have streaked into the finals in red-hot form, dispatching everyone that comes their way.</p>
        
            <p>The Storm, who retain the same squad who beat the Sharks an impressive 37-10 two weeks ago, are red-hot favourites and will be looking to make the most of last weekend's rest.</p>
        
            <p>One of the problems with Storm being such a successful outfit is that they rarely find themselves challenged throughout the season - which can put them at a disadvantage when they find themselves coming up against the likes of the Roosters.</p>
        
            <p>While Craig Bellamy's men will back themselves to get the job done at home, they can't underestimate this highly experienced Roosters side who have been here and done it all before.</p>
        
            <p>An epic game of finals football awaits!</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9:50pm Saturday 28 September NZT</p>
        
            <p>Accor Stadium - Sydney</p>
        
            <p>Live updates on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>Defending champs Penrith Panthers are sitting just two wins away from making rugby league history - winning four consecutive premierships, a feat that has never been achieved during the NRL era.</p>
        
            <p>But standing in their way is an extremely resilient Cronulla Sharks side who have been on a rollercoaster ride all season long. With questions floating around about the Cronulla's ability to hold it down with the big boys come finals time, Penrith are the clear favourites - but that won't upset the Sharks.</p>
        
            <p>Despite their poor record, halfback Nicho Hynes and other Sharks are adamant there is no mental block, ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>"If I didn't have the confidence and belief we could break them down, I don't think I would be here right now," Hynes said, adding "everyone is beatable".</p>
        
            <p>The last time these two sides met Penrith absolutely dominated, defeating Cronulla 42 - 0 and sending alarm bells across the Shire. During that match, Hynes was sent from the field with a head knock and did not come back, complaining of calf tightness.</p>
        
            <p>But Craig Fitzgibbon's men held it together and strung enough favourable results together to finish the season inside the top four, proving they do have what it takes to dance with the bigger clubs.</p>
        
            <p>It remains to be seen whether Penrith's dominance will continue past the 2024 season, with a number of players departing, including Jerome Luai (signed with the Tigers) and James Fisher-Harris (Warriors-bound), and rival clubs poaching others. Regardless, the Sharks will be on the hunt on Saturday night.</p>
