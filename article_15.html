        <h2>Historic Wellington landmark continues to sit empty</h2>
        <p>
Work has stalled on a multi-million-dollar restoration of Wellington's historic Oriental Bay Band Rotunda because no tenant is willing to take it on.

            <p>Work has stalled on a multi-million-dollar restoration of Wellington's historic Oriental Bay Band Rotunda because no tenant is willing to take it on.</p>
        
            <p>The council-owned landmark has stood empty for more than a decade, awaiting extensive strengthening work.</p>
        
            <p>Originally built as a bathing pavilion in 1938, the building housed several restaurants and bars from the 1980s until it was found to be quake prone.</p>
        
            <p>Strengthening work began in 2021 after Wellington City Council signed a long-term lease with the construction firm McKee Fehl and its sister company, Cheops Holdings, which specialises in developing historic buildings.</p>
        
            <p>But nothing has happened on the site for more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>Cheops Holdings managing director Maurice Clark said that was because they had not found a restaurateur willing to take it on.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we'll find someone, but not necessarily soon, there is some interest, but I think it's a question of waiting to see."</p>
        
            <p>Clark said 3 to 4 million dollars' worth of work was still needed to finish it.</p>
        
            <p>"There's quite a lot of work, quite a lot of money, whilst the premises are in a great location for a restaurant it's quite a big area, it's nearly 400 square metres of restaurant."</p>
        
            <p>
No restaurateur willing to take on the historic site has yet been found, says Cheops Holdings managing director Maurice Clark.

            <p>Oriental Bay Residents Association President, Andrew Meehan said it was disappointing a solution for the building had not been found.</p>
        
            <p>"We get a lot of visitors, clearly here right through summer and it's not a good look when you've got what is certainly the feature point of Oriental Bay in disrepair as it's been for the last two or three years."</p>
        
            <p>Meehan told RNZ it would be great to transform it from an eyesore to a feature of the area.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no better location probably in the country frankly for a restaurant."</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality NZ Vice President Paul Retimanu said the last few years had been hard on the sector.</p>
        
            <p>"In six to twelve months it could be different, cyclic, everything will start coming back, things will start to normalise," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue with the band rotunda or the rationale behind that not being filled so quickly, right here, right now will just be a simple matter of demand and supply."</p>
        
            <p>He said the building was an important space in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"The Oriental Bay beachfront there is well frequented. It's part of a second way of getting to the airport so a lot of people go down that area."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington residents RNZ spoke to at Oriental Bay thought it should be turned back into a restaurant.</p>
        
            <p>Finn said he would like it to be a restaurant again if it was "a Wellingtonian type restaurant" that protected the culture of the area.</p>
        
            <p>"Why not? Like, what else would we do with it - as long as the upper area with the balcony you can look out [from] stays."</p>
        
            <p>Mike told RNZ he remembered it being a restaurant.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such an iconic spot, it would be lovely to see it done up and restored and be used properly."</p>

            <p>Diny remembered taking her five children to the rotunda once or twice a year for a treat.</p>
        
            <p>"I think another restaurant would be great because it's a beautiful spot."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Wellington City Council told RNZ the restoration was being funded by the developer and had not cost ratepayers any money of note.</p>
        
            <p>It was continuing to work with McKee Fehl but there was no deadline for the completion of the project.</p>
