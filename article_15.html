            <p>The global showpiece of the shortest format will see 10 nations battle it out in the UAE, vying for the 2024 Women's T20 World Cup. Defending champions Australia will once again carry the favourites crown, having claimed the trophy on six occasions, boasting an 80 percent win rate since 2009. The White Ferns meanwhile have had a much more turbulent history at the tournament, going deep in the first three editions before an agonising run of fifth place finishes. Confidence is low for the Ferns, who are riding a 10-match T20I losing streak though will be buoyed by a warm up win over South Africa by eight wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Here is a look at their history at the World Cup: </p>
        
            <p>2009- Runners up. </p>
        
            <p>Soundly beaten by England in the inaugural final, batting first the Kiwis crumbled to 85 all out, Amy Satterthwaite top scoring with 19, England roaring home with three overs and six wickets to spare.</p>
        
            <p>2010-Runners up. </p>
        
            <p>A low scoring thriller in Barbados, the Ferns restricted Australia to 106 off their 20 overs, Nicola Browne taking 2/11 off her four. However needing a six off the final ball to win, Sophie Devine could only manage a single as she finished unbeaten on 38, and the Aussies got home by three.</p>
        
            <p>2012- Semi finalists. </p>
        
            <p>Up against England for a place in the final, Satterthwaite again led the way with 30 as New Zealand posted a sub-par 93/8. Sian Ruck took 2/22 but England cruised to the target in the 17th over, for the loss of just three wickets.</p>
        
            <p>2014- Fifth. </p>
        
            <p>Unable to progress to the semis for the first time despite losing only one game. South Africa would advance at the expense of the Ferns following a five wicket win in the group stage, Devine's 40 helping the Kiwis to 114/8, then taking 2/26 with the ball but it would not be enough with South Africa reaching the target with just four balls remaining. The Ferns went on to defeat Sri Lanka by six wickets in their qualification play off courtesy of 45 off 31 from Bates and 2/16 from Browne.</p>
        
            <p>2016-Semi finalists. </p>
        
            <p>Finishing group stage as top qualifiers with wins over Australia, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Ireland, but their dominance came to an end in the semi against the West Indies who set the Ferns 144 for a place in the final after Devine claimed 4/22. Despite a brave 38 from Sara McGlashan, New Zealand fell six runs shy.</p>
        
            <p>2018- Fifth.</p>
        
            <p>Two wins from four for the Ferns, with losses to India and Australia despite scores of 67 and 48 from Bates. Other highlights were Jess Watkin taking 3/9 against Pakistan and a blazing half century from Devine in a big win over Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>2020-Fifth.</p>
        
            <p>A carbon copy of the Fern's finish two years prior, with Australia and India again proving two barriers too far for New Zealand to progress. It was a gut wrenching defeat to the Indians as Amelia Kerr required two boundaries off the final to balls to force a super over, scooping the first over third man for four but unable to get bat on a superb yorker to close it out. Some late fireworks from Katey Martin brought them within four of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>2023- Fifth.</p>
        
            <p>A third year on the trot which saw the Ferns get close, but not close enough. Australia once again crushed kiwi hopes with a resounding 97 run win, before South Africa sent them packing after rolling New Zealand for 67.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns Squad- Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.</p>
        
            <p>There is a familiar feel to the White Ferns squad chasing T20 glory. The big three in Devine, Melie Kerr and Bates will once again carry the weight of expectations for New Zealand. The trio have consistently been at the forefront of Ferns success, with Bates and Devine having played in every edition of the World Cup since 2009. Should all three fire, New Zealand could well bring home a first ever title, though the side will need to overcome a significant form slump to do so. The tournament will mark the last for Devine as skipper, as she is set to step aside at the conclusion but continue on as a player.</p>
        
            <p>White Ferns Fixtures: </p>
        
            <p>vs India 3am October 5th in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>vs Australia 3am October 8th in Sharjah.</p>
        
            <p>vs Sri Lanka,11pm October 12th in Sharjah.</p>
        
            <p>vs Pakistan, 3am October 14th in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>Hosts- Originally scheduled to be hosted in Bangladesh, the tournament was moved to the United Arab Emirates due to political turmoil. A number of participating countries had issued travel advisories for Bangladesh, effectively preventing the country from hosting the tournament. Matches will be played in Sharjah and Dubai with the final set for October 21 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Prizemoney- The tournament winners will receive $3.7 million with the runners up receiving $1.6m as part of a total prize pot of just under $12m. It marks a 225 percent increase from 2023 and sees cricket become the only major team sport to have equal prize money for its men's and women's World Cup events.</p>
        
            <p>The Teams: </p>
        
            <p>Group A: Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>Group B: Bangladesh, England, South Africa, West Indies, Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>Australia </p>
        
            <p>2023- Champions.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Alyssa Healy. Having taken the captain's armband from Meg Lanning, Healy is one of the most destructive batters in the world, with a top T20 score of 148no and a career strike rate of just under 130, Healy is the lynchpin of a formidable Australian lineup.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- It would be a brave punt not backing the Australian dynasty for a seventh title.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa </p>
        
            <p>2023- Runners Up.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Tazmin Brits. A former Javelin thrower, Brits had her Olympic dreams shattered following a severe car crash which saw her switch sports. With a dozen half centuries to her name, expect the resilient opening batter to be consistently among the runs.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- The Proteas fell just 19 runs short in 2023's final and are again title contenders in the UAE.</p>
        
            <p>England </p>
        
            <p>2023- Semi-finalists.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Sophie Ecclestone. Becoming the highest-ranked T20I bowler in the world at just 20, the left-arm finger spinner has taken 126 wickets in 86 internationals with an economy of 5.85.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- England are chasing their first title since 2009, having won the very first World Cup, and with a settled and experienced side fresh off a big series win over New Zealand, it could well be coming home.</p>
        
            <p>India </p>
        
            <p>2023- Semi finalists.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Smriti Mandhana. Boasting a wealth of experience with 141 T20 International appearances, Mandhana has the second highest run total in T20's and at 28, has yet to reach her peak.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- It's been a quiet build-up fro india who have not played any international matches for nearly two months but will be a significant threat as they look to avenge their Asia Cup final loss and claim a maiden World Cup title.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan </p>
        
            <p>2023- Eliminated in Group Stage.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Fatima Sana. Sana's career was forged on the streets of Karachi, making her debut at 18, she poses a huge threat with both bat and ball.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects-Pakistan come into the tournament off the back of posing a record total of 181 against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka </p>
        
            <p>2023- Eliminated in Group Stage.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Harshitha Samarawickrama. Averaged over 60 in T20Is last year and made an unbeaten 69 in the Asia Cup final triumph, Samarawickrama has been putting up numbers on par with her idol Kumar Sangakkara.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects-Won this year's Asian Cup in a major pre tournament psychological blow to India, Sri Lanka will be a dangerous prospect in Group A.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh </p>
        
            <p>2023- Eliminated in Group Stage.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Nahida Akter. Will be hunting a 100th T20I wicket in the UAE, Akter can be lethal on her day with career best figures of 5/8.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- The Tigresses pipped Pakistan in a warm up match this week which will have their tails up, but have suffered heavy losses in recent times to both India and Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>West Indies </p>
        
            <p>2023- Eliminated in Group Stage.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Hayley Matthews. The best allrounder and arguably player on the planet, Matthews could have just as easily gone on to be a star of the athletics world, but instead has been breaking records on the cricket pitch since her debut at 16 years old. Her performances will be imperative if the Windies are to succeed.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- The most egnimatic side at the tournament, the West indies can beat any team on their day should things click for them. Enjoyed a come from behind series win against Sri Lanka back in June.</p>
        
            <p>Scotland </p>
        
            <p>2023- DNP.</p>
        
            <p>One to Watch- Kathryn Bryce. One of two Bryce sisters in the squad, kathryn was named the Associate Cricketer of the Decade and has accumulated a career average of 39.90.</p>
        
            <p>Prospects- Making their first ever appearance in a T20 World Cup, the Scots made a strong statement in Dubai with an eight wicket warm up win over Pakistan.</p>
