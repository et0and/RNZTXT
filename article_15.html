When Geoff Crawford started trapping for pests on his farm, he was catching 70 possums a week. </p>
        
            <p>Now he's lucky if he gets seven.</p>

            <p>While Geoff says he only started trapping 18 months ago, the self-proclaimed "townie's" journey into farming started a bit longer ago, at the ripe age of 17. </p>
        
            <p>"I grew up in quite a poor area where we had four siblings. We were in a rural town and looked out over the farmland and I thought, well, 'that's what I want to be'," reminisces Geoff.</p>
        
            <p>Out of school, Geoff started work on a dairy farm, before he got an opportunity to take over a contracting business spraying weeds.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, that catapulted Geoff to be able to move into farm ownership at the age of 20.</p>
        
            <p>And he has never looked back. Now Geoff owns seven properties.</p>

            <p>Over 30 years he's built a farming business of three dairy farms totalling 505 effective hectares and 1400 cows plus two beef-rearing and finishing farms integrated with the dairying.</p>
        
            <p>As he stands on a high point of the farm, just outside Whangārei, he can reflect on the transformation that has taken place over 30 years since he first purchased it. </p>
        
            <p>"The farm was rundown to start with. That helped with the decision-making, but we were very poor. </p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the original fencing was secondhand materials."</p>
        
            <p>The commitment to the environment is evident in the farm's rejuvenation. New pastures, fencing, native planting, drainage systems, and even a wedding venue now grace the landscape. </p>
        
            <p>The farm's transformation is not just about aesthetics - it's a testament to Geoff's philosophy of leaving the land better than he found it.</p>
        
            <p>
Geoff says on average he catches seven possum a week, after catching 70 a week when he began trapping.

Geoff has a range of different traps to ensure he doesn't miss a catch.

            <p>As Geoff checks the pest traps with Country Life, he drives around acres of mature bush hugging multiple waterways that snake through the farm. </p>
        
            <p>"We never had a plan on measurement," he says. </p>
        
            <p>"We just fenced it for what we thought was right for the paddocks. It's really come up nice."</p>
        
            <p>However, Geoff's commitment to the environment extends beyond the boundaries of his farm. </p>
        
            <p>A staunch advocate for conservation, he initiated the Pest-free Parakiore Program, bringing together 30 to 40 neighbours to trap possums and mustelids, paving the way for the reintroduction of kiwi. </p>
        
            <p>"We've only started trapping probably 18 months now. So we're starting to see the rewards," Geoff shares, highlighting the success of the community-driven initiative.</p>
        
            <p>For Geoff, farming is not just a livelihood; it's a commitment to future generations. </p>
        
            <p>"If you've got generations of family coming through, you want to leave something that everyone's proud of," he says. </p>
