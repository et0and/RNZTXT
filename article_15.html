            <p>Award-winning journalist Barbara Dreaver said finding out that her name was included in the New Year Honour's list was surreal.</p>
        
            <p>Dreaver has been made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to investigative journalism and Pacific communities.</p>
        
            <p>She has been a champion of Pacific stories and voices for more than 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just the telling of our stories, it's also getting a result and we do this job to make a difference," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And if you can do an investigative journalism story that will change people's lives and that's got to be a good thing, and that's something I feel hugely privilleged to have been able to do."</p>
        
            <p>Dreaver said her parents have been such an inspiration and helped her over the years, always cheering her on from the sidelines.</p>

            <p>"And also humbled, because not many of us make it into the tertiary sector, and I know all Pacific people who make it into the tertiary sector work really hard to get more Pacific people there."</p>
        
            <p>She moved from the Cook Islands to Porirua when she was young. It is where she completed all her primary and secondary schooling.</p>
