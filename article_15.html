        <h2>Cook Islands not qualified for UN membership, says PM</h2>
        <p>
The Cook Islands will not pursue membership in the United Nations and the Commonwealth, Prime Minister Mark Brown says.
</p>
        
            <p>By Talaia Mika, Cook Islands News</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands will not pursue membership in the United Nations and the Commonwealth due to its inability to meet the criteria for UN membership and existing relationship with New Zealand, which fulfils Commonwealth membership requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Mark Brown has clarified that the Cook Islands is not qualified for UN membership, a long-standing government proposal that has remained uncertain.</p>
        
            <p>In an exclusive interview with Cook Islands News, Brown was asked to provide an update on the government's plans for a UN membership.</p>
        
            <p>"That's old news now, I mean we've been around the block with that a few years, and a few times," the Prime Minister said.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's again another one, we haven't pursued that. There are a number of criteria that the UN requires for membership and according to them, we don't meet those requirements."</p>

            <p>Cook Islands has maintained diplomatic ties with the UN since the 1990s. It is not currently a member of the UN.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, the Cook Islands government applied for membership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a first step on the road to becoming a member of the UN.</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands Minister for Foreign Affairs Tingika Elikana then told RNZ that the decision to become a UN member would ultimately need to be decided by the general population of the Cook Islands through a referendum.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands is part of the realm of New Zealand, which makes Cook Islanders also New Zealand citizens. If the Cook Islands joins the United Nations as a separate member to NZ, it would potentially forfeit its citizenship rights under the current treaty which binds the nations.</p>

            <p>"I don't think short-term elected politicians should decide on that. I think a referendum would need to be run and then we will enter into discussions with New Zealand," Elikana then said.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the possibility of joining the Commonwealth, an international association of 56 member states, primarily comprised of former British territories, Brown said the government would not be making another effort to try and become a member.</p>
        
            <p>"We did enquire a number of years ago about it, but the understanding was because we're part of the realm of New Zealand, that is considered our membership in the Commonwealth, even though we don't have any place at the table, and we don't speak at the Commonwealth," Brown explained.</p>
        
            <p>"So, they consider that our realm relationship is where we are in terms of Commonwealth membership."</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands News understands the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration has written to the Commonwealth Secretariat about the country's membership.</p>
        
            <p>Brown confirmed that a letter had already been submitted to the Commonwealth for that purpose, but he was uncertain whether a response had been received.</p>
        
            <p>"But from what I understand, that is the response that we've had from officials at the Commonwealth, is that they consider us through New Zealand as part of the realm of New Zealand as already being covered in the Commonwealth, even though we don't have a seat or a voice there."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if this would be considered the government's final attempt to gain Commonwealth membership, the Prime Minister responded "yes".</p>
        
            <p>"I think so, I mean I've got to weigh it up as well with what benefit we get from being part of the CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting)," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown added that there are areas where the Cook Islands do receive support from the likes of the Commonwealth Secretariat.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had support from the likes of the Commonwealth Secretariat in the past with things like technical assistance that they provided for us in the early stages of our development of our Seabed Minerals Authority office."</p>
