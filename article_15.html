            <p>Team New Zealand skipper Peter Burling was a little stunned after winning the 37th America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders beat Britannia by 37 seconds in race nine on Sunday morning to take the series 7-2.</p>
        
            <p>It is a record third successive win for Team New Zealand and Burling.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is still sinking in a little bit for me, but what a surreal feeling," Burling said after returning to dock.</p>
        
            <p>"To know that we've now won the America's Cup again, and seeing the crowds cheering us on - it'll sink in a bit more when we lift the trophy."</p>
        
            <p>Burling was first involved when Team New Zealand lifted the trophy in 2017 and then was on board when they defended it in Auckland in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The 33 year old former Olympic champion said all three Cup victories have been special and he couldn't distinguish between them.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all just so incredibly different and every one is special for another reason.</p>
        
            <p>"Every campaign seems to have little curves in the road, and to know we've now won the America's Cup again, the same outcome, it makes them hard to split.</p>

            <p>The British got back into the regatta during the week by winning races five and six, and Burling feels the way Team New Zealand responded to that was significant.</p>
        
            <p>"Putting down such a dominant performance (in race seven) - it really felt like the critics were starting to shout at us after getting off to such a strong start and then losing two in a row, but to really be able to stamp our authority from there was something I'm really proud of."</p>
        
            <p>Britannia skipper Ben Ainslie conceded they were beaten by the better team.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew coming into this just how tough Team New Zealand were going to be.</p>
        
            <p>"They're an unbelievable organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"We came through a really tough challenger series and we knew it was going to be a step up against the Kiwis and it really was. They sailed an amazing America's Cup and deserved the victory."</p>
        
            <p>The British team had reached the final for the first time in 60 years by beating Italy in the Louis Vuitton challenger final last month.</p>
        
            <p>There is no indication yet on when or where the next America's Cup will be.</p>
