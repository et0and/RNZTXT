            <p>A Papamoa resident has been left smarting after an altercation between himself and a group of women at a skate park ended in the police being called.</p>
        
            <p>Bradley Goudie, known online as ScooterBrad, said he picked Gordon Spratt Reserve skatepark in Papamoa to practice in as it was quieter than other parks in the city, but found it filled with children.</p>
        
            <p>He said he asked for them to move on, but it did not end well.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to implement my standard procedure, which is basically just say, 'hey guys, what's up, like in 15 minutes I'm going to be blasting around the park real fast, doing some stunts and stuff'. I'm chasing the Olympic dream, so I have to consistently train, and obviously I'm at the one place that is dedicated to doing that thing.</p>
        
            <p>"From there the lady in question, I wouldn't be able to say her name. I don't know it. I don't know her, but yeah, she just instantly sort of freaks out and is throwing a lot of things around, nasty things."</p>
        
            <p>According to the video Goudie posted on social media, the woman told him to go to another skate park and remarked only homeowners and ratepayers could complain about public facilities.</p>
        
            <p>He said he could go to other skate parks, but the problem remained.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the quietest skate park. There's a new one down at the Mount [Maunganui] that she's referring to...</p>
        
            <p>"But the problem there is tenfold, you know the amount of kids there is just... there's there's no way [to skate] and it's not really appropriate at a newly opened skate park to try and, what they would call, kick people out the the problem's too intense to confront at that skate park."</p>
        
            <p>He wanted to warn people because he was worried about safety at the park.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the kids in question aren't wearing shoes or safety gear, helmets, etcetera. We're talking, you know, 6,7,8-foot ramps rails with jagged edges, squared metal coping - like, this is a dangerous place to be."</p>
        
            <p>In the video posted on social media the woman involved in the altercation contacted the police, and they can be seen talking to Goudie and telling him he was welcome to skate in the park.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ contacted Tauranga City Council about the incident. It said it was a matter for the police.</p>
        
            <p>It said in a statement all users of skate facilities should share with care, be patient and respect others.</p>
        
            <p>It strongly recommended anyone using city parks concerned with safety should contact the police.</p>
        
            <p>Western Bay of Plenty prevention manager Inspector Zane Smith said officers responded to two "disorderly behaviour" incidents at the park on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Police spoke to members of the parties involved," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was determined that both parties have the same right to use the park."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said all parties moved on after officers attended.</p>
