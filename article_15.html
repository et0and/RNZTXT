            <p>Analysis - Darleen Tana is going to be a media target when Parliament sits next week, David Seymour tells Pharmac to disregard the Treaty of Waitangi and Te Pāti Māori calls for his resignation, details of the lead-up to the ferry saga are revealed and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump prompts a look at how well our politicians are protected.</p>
        
            <p>Darleen Tana is expected to show up when Parliament sits on Tuesday and she'll be hounded by media wanting an answer to the big question - is she going to stay?</p>
        
            <p>The Greens, her former party, this week released the executive summary of the report which it commissioned into what she knew about allegations of migrant exploitation at her husband's e-bike business.</p>
        
            <p>Tana resigned after being suspended from the Greens' caucus and is now an independent MP.</p>
        
            <p>Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick repeated her call for Tana to also resign from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"It is in the best interests of everyone that she resigns. This executive summary makes it very clear that Darleen has failed to meet the standards we expect - not only of MPs within our caucus but across Parliament entirely," the Herald quoted her as saying.</p>
        
            <p>But Tana disputes the report's findings, and made her position clear in an interview with TVNZ political editor Maiki Sherman.</p>
        
            <p>"Natural justice wasn't served in that report," she said. "It was not comprehensive, it did not include the voices of key witnesses who were directly involved in the situations.</p>
        
            <p>"Two of the people related to the initial complaints were not interviewed, even though one of those came forward two months later and said they wanted to be heard - the Green Party said no to the investigator."</p>
        
            <p>The report summary is a lengthy document, and Stuff published it in full when it was released on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Reporting on its release, RNZ said it obtained a copy earlier this month and it found Tana "likely" knew about allegations of worker exploitation at her husband's business.</p>
        
            <p>As previously reported, the Greens could use the waka-jumping law to force Tana out of Parliament but they've strongly opposed the legislation in the past.</p>
        
            <p>They haven't ruled it out though, as Swarbrick told Morning Report on the day the report summary was released.</p>
        
            <p>"I am not precluding any possible outcome… the point that I have made time and again is that Darleen Tana has an opportunity to reduce harm and collateral damage, and to take accountability and responsibility and to resign," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Should that not occur then you can expect that absolutely there is a number of New Zealanders out there who are frustrated, but particularly frustrated Green Party members, and we've got our AGM coming up in about a fortnight."</p>
        
            <p>It's being assumed the question of whether or not to use the waka-jumping law will be put to members at the AGM.</p>
        
            <p>Tana hasn't given any indication that she going to leave Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald's Thomas Coughlan said last week money could come into it, with Tana needing her $170,000 salary while her husband sorted out his business.</p>
        
            <p>The financial imperative may now be even more important - RNZ reported on Thursday that the business was in liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Companies Register shows insolvency, forensic accounting and consulting firm Khov Jones has been appointed as liquidators of E Cycles NZ Limited," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"According to the New Zealand Herald, a notice in the window of Bikes and Beyond in Newmarket said the store was temporarily closed.</p>
        
            <p>"A second Bikes and Beyond shop on Waiheke Island has been advertised on Trade Me since 2 July with a list price of $0.00," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Tana was at Parliament on Wednesday, Stuff reported, and staff from the Parliamentary Service relocated her office.</p>
        
            <p>Media opinion is behind her deciding to stay on.</p>
        
            <p>"The Greens are naturally hoping she will do the honourable thing and resign," Sunday Star-Times editor Tracy Watkins said in an editorial. "History suggests it's unlikely. Turkeys don't vote for an early Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister David Seymour shook up Pharmac this week with a letter of expectation which asked the drug buying agency, among other things, to stop considering the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>"The associate health minister has told Pharmac it is inappropriate for the agency to keep considering the Treaty of Waitangi's place in the health sector," RNZ reported.</p>
        
            <p>His letter to Pharmac board chair Paula Bennett said: "Pharmac's role should focus on delivering improved health outcomes underpinned by robust data and evidence.</p>
        
            <p>"They should serve all New Zealanders on actual need, without assigning their background as a proxy of need."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said Pharmac had "burned a lot of energy" considering the Treaty when it wasn't directly tied to its core role of purchasing drugs and medical technology.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour, who has responsibility for Pharmac, also asked the agency to update its decision-making and evaluation models. And he wants more transparency and timeliness as well as increased patient input.</p>
        
            <p>It was the Treaty reference that drew the most attention, and Te Pāti Māori called for Seymour's resignation. Co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said Seymour was unfit to serve, the Herald reported.</p>
        
            <p>"It is absolutely rotten to the core for a minister to be asserting his bias, prejudice or influence over a board in that way," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Seymour thinks it is inappropriate for Pharmac to consider the Treaty - I say it is inappropriate for a racist to decide the Treaty's place in the health sector."</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said Māori were more likely to die from cancer and preventable illnesses but were the least likely to receive medical treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour responded in a statement: "[Te Pāti Māori] speak for perhaps one in six Māori. The vast majority of New Zealanders, including the vast majority of Māori, want nothing to do with their race fanaticism."</p>
        
            <p>Boot camps were in the news again this week with RNZ reporting mentors alone could cost $100,000 per young offender.</p>
        
            <p>A boot camp pilot involving 10 boys is due to begin at the end of the month, one of National's campaign promises.</p>
        
            <p>Documents obtained by RNZ which were given to organisations interested in providing the intensive mentor service - a critical part of the 12-month programme - show the potential costs.</p>
        
            <p>One option is a fixed, all inclusive $100,000 per person while option two is an hourly rate with capped monthly hours.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot is costing approximately $5.1 million. The teens will spend three months in what the government calls a military-style academy near Palmerston North and then be intensively mentored in the community for nine months.</p>
        
            <p>They've been chosen from those already in youth justice residences who had been convicted of two crimes with a sentence of at least 10 years - the criteria for the young serious offender category the government is seeking to write into law, the Herald reported.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force is involved, but it's not clear to what extent.</p>
        
            <p>"Children's Minister Karen Chhour remains unaware of the finer details of the pilot, despite her and the government coming under persistent questioning for information," the Herald said.</p>
        
            <p>A must-read for anyone interested in the ferry saga is an analysis of what went on before the government canned the iReX project, written by RNZ's Russell Palmer.</p>
        
            <p>It's headlined https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/522335/interislander-officials-mistrust-of-kiwirail-led-push-to-scrap-project 'Officials' mistrust of KiwiRail led push to scrap project'] and is based on a study of 44 documents revealing the advice and information given to the previous and current governments.</p>
        
            <p>One document from the Treasury showed officials were worried that KiwiRail would "view ministers as eventually accepting the project largely in its current form as a fait accompli".</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"Officials' suspicions of KiwiRail's claims were nothing new," the report says.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in June 2021 - before the ferry contract was fully signed off - officials said that while it was 'responsible asset management' for the company to replace the ferries, they were concerned about the information they had been getting.</p>
        
            <p>"By mid-March 2023, ahead of that year's budget - Grant Robertson's last as finance minister - the concerns about KiwiRail's approach did not seem to have improved."</p>
        
            <p>There's much more to it, the analysis is a hefty piece of work.</p>
        
            <p>Another interesting analysis was published this week - Stuff's investigation of the cost of consultants for the previous government's Three Waters project.</p>
        
            <p>"The Labour government paid consultancy firms a whopping $64 million for work establishing the now defunct Three Waters reform project - money that ultimately went down the drain," Glenn McConnell's article said.</p>
        
            <p>It reveals that multinational professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the biggest winner, paid $35 million.</p>
        
            <p>"Fellow 'big four' companies EY (9.3 million), Deloitte ($532,000) and KPMG ($352,000) also raked in cash as the government worked to hand control of water management to four big regional authorities," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"All up, the controversial Three Waters - axed by the National-led government - cost $1.3 billion, of which about $800 million was given to councils and other organisations to spend on infrastructure."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Internal Affairs, the lead agency for Three Waters, said it had to hire consultants because it didn't have the skills and expertise in-house and it was a complex reform programme.</p>
        
            <p>The attempted assassination of Donald Trump prompted RNZ to look at how well New Zealand politicians are protected.</p>
        
            <p>The article lists assaults on MPs, and refers to a recent University of Otago study which said 98 percent of 54 MPs who took part said they had experienced harassment ranging from disturbing communication to actual physical violence.</p>
        
            <p>In the US the Secret Service is responsible for protecting the president. In New Zealand the Dignitary Protection Service (DPS), a division of the police, protects the prime minister and other figures.</p>
        
            <p>"The specifics of security are kept under a pretty tight veil of secrecy," the article said, and went on to quote former intelligence worker Paul Buchanan, the director of a strategic assessment consultancy.</p>
        
            <p>He said the DPS was nowhere near the scale of the Secret Service. It was much smaller and lacked autonomous resources of its own.</p>
        
            <p>Police serving in the DPS would get special training, Buchanan said.</p>
        
            <p>They would have to be fit, observant, discreet and good at multitasking and would need to be "cool, calm and collected" in a crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"No Rambos or John Wicks. Low-key professionalism, in other words."</p>
        
            <p>Buchanan said that generally New Zealand protection followed the form set in other nations.</p>
        
            <p>"VIP protection provided by the NZ Police DPS and uniformed officers is much looser (than the Secret Service) but follows the format of concentric circles - close personal protection surrounding the VIP and then wider circles of police and other security officers."</p>

            <p>The last word this week goes to Richard Prebble, writing in the Herald. He's touting Barbara Edmonds as a future Labour Party leader and thinks she could handle the job:</p>
        
            <p>"Being the mother of eight is more challenging than being the chief executive of Air New Zealand."</p>
