        <h2>Devastatingly frank F1 fan favourite Guenther Steiner quits team</h2>
        <p>
Steiner became a hit thanks to docu-series "Drive to Survive", and for his outbursts of swearing and unfiltered assessments.

            <p>Formula One tail-enders Haas have announced the shock departure of colourful team principal Guenther Steiner and promoted long-serving Japanese engineer Ayao Komatsu as his replacement.</p>
        
            <p>The U.S.-owned outfit, who slumped to 10th and last in the 2023 constructors' standings with only 12 points, said in a statement that the 58-year-old Italian-American had left with immediate effect.</p>
        
            <p>There was no comment from Steiner.</p>
        
            <p>Sources told Reuters that technical director Simone Resta, who previously worked for engine providers Ferrari, had also left the team.</p>
        
            <p>Steiner became a fan favourite thanks to the Netflix docu-series "Drive to Survive" in which he features prominently with outbursts of swearing and devastatingly frank and unfiltered assessments.</p>
        
            <p>The departure of a cult hero, unless he pops up again elsewhere in the paddock, will be a blow for many of those recently attracted to the sport.</p>
        
            <p>Steiner led Haas into Formula One on their debut in 2016 and ranked as the third longest-standing principal after Red Bull's Christian Horner and Mercedes' Toto Wolff.</p>
        
            <p>Team owner Gene Haas ultimately called the shots, however, and made clear that his team's current performance was not acceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"Moving forward as an organization it was clear we need to improve our on-track performances," he said in the statement, thanking Steiner for his work and wishing him well for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"In appointing Ayao Komatsu as team principal we fundamentally have engineering at the heart of our management."</p>
        
            <p>Komatsu, 47, has also been with the team since the beginning after previous stints at British American Racing (BAR), Renault and Lotus.</p>
        
            <p>He will take responsibility for overall strategy and track performance.</p>
        
            <p>The team said a European-based chief operating officer will be appointed to manage all non-competition matters and departments.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had some successes but we need to be consistent in delivering results that help us reach our wider goals as an organization," said Gene Haas.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be efficient with the resources we have but improving our design and engineering capability is key to our success as a team.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to working with Ayao and fundamentally ensuring that we maximize our potential. This truly reflects my desire to compete properly in Formula One."</p>
        
            <p>Haas have yet to win a grand prix and their best season was 2018 when they finished fifth overall.</p>
        
            <p>"We obviously haven't been competitive enough recently which has been a source of frustration for us all," said Komatsu. "We have amazing support from Gene and our various partners and we want to mirror their enthusiasm with an improved on-track product."</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 season starts in Bahrain on March 2 after testing from Feb. 21-23.</p>
