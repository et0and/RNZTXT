        <h2>CHOGM success for Samoa but what’s in it for the Pacific?</h2>
        <p>
Applying CHOGM outcomes on climate change, oceans, blackbirding offers new secretary-general shot at relevance, writes Tess Newton Cain.

            <p>Opinion - As CHOGM came to a close, Samoa rightfully basked in the resounding success for the country and people as hosts of the Commonwealth leaders' meeting. Footage of Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa swaying along to the siva dance as she sat beside Britain's King Charles III encapsulated a palpable national pride, well deserved on delivering such a high-profile gathering.</p>
        
            <p>Getting down to the business of dissecting the meeting outcomes - in the leaders' statement and Samoa communiqué - there are several issues that are significant for the Pacific island members of this post-colonial club.</p>
        
            <p>As expected, climate change features prominently in the text, with over 30 mentions including three that refer to the "climate crisis". This will resonate highly for Pacific members, as will the support for COP 31 in 2026 to be jointly hosted by Australia and the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>One of the glaring contradictions of this joint COP bid is illustrated by the lack of any call to end fossil fuel extraction in the final outcomes. Tuvalu, Fiji and Vanuatu used the CHOGM to launch the latest Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative report, with a focus on Australia's coal and gas mining. This reflects the diversity of Commonwealth membership, which includes some states whose economies remain reliant on fossil fuel extractive industries.</p>
        
            <p>As highlighted ahead of CHOGM, this multilateral gave the 56 members a chance to consider positions to take to COP 29 next month in Baku, Azerbaijan. The communiqué from the leaders highlights the importance of increased ambition when it comes to climate finance at COP 29, and particularly to address the needs of developing countries. That speaks to all the Pacific island nations and gives the region's negotiators another drawcard on the international stage.</p>
        
            <p>Then came the unexpected, Papua New Guinea made a surprise announcement that it will not attend the global conference in Baku next month. Speaking at the Commonwealth Ministerial Meeting on Small States, PNG's Foreign Affairs Minister Justin Tkatchenko framed this decision as a stand on behalf of small island nations as a protest against "empty promises and inaction."</p>
        
            <p>As promised, a major output of this meeting was the Apia Commonwealth Ocean Declaration for One Resilient Common Future. This is the first oceans-focused declaration by the Commonwealth of Nations, and is somewhat belated given 49 of its 56 member states have ocean borders.</p>
        
            <p>The declaration has positions familiar to Pacific policymakers and activists, including the recognition of national maritime boundaries despite the impacts of climate change and the need to reduce emissions from global shipping. A noticeable omission is any reference to deep-sea mining, which is also a fault line within the Pacific collective.</p>
        
            <p>The text relating to reparations for trans-Atlantic slavery required extensive negotiation among the leaders, Australia's ABC reported. Whilst this issue has been driven by African and Caribbean states, it is one that touches the Pacific as well. South Sea Islander "blackbirding" is one of the colonial practices that will be considered within the context of reparative justice. During the period many tens-of-thousands of Pacific Islanders were indentured to Australia's cane fields, Fiji's coconut plantations and elsewhere. The trade to Queensland and New South Wales lasted from 1847 to 1904, while those destinations were British colonies until 1901. Indeed, the so-called "sugar slaves" were a way of getting cheap labour once Britain officially abolished slavery in 1834.</p>
        
            <p>The next secretary-general of the Commonwealth will be Ghana's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey. Questions have been raised about the quality of her predecessor Patricia Scotland's leadership for some time and the change will hopefully go some way in alleviating concerns. Notably, the CHOGM has selected another woman to lead its secretariat. This is an important endorsement of female leadership among member countries where women are often dramatically underrepresented at national levels.</p>
        
            <p>Whilst it received little or no fanfare, the Commonwealth has also released its revised Commonwealth Principles on Freedom of Expression and the Role of the Media in Good Governance. This is a welcome contribution, given the threats to media freedom in the Pacific and elsewhere. It reflects a longstanding commitment by the Commonwealth to supporting democratic resilience among its members.</p>
        
            <p>These principles do not come with any enforcement mechanism behind them, and the most that can be done is to encourage or exhort adherence. However, they provide another potential buffer against attempts to curtail their remit for publishers, journalists, and bloggers in Commonwealth countries.</p>
        
            <p>The outcomes reveal both progress and persistent challenges for Pacific island nations. While Apia's Commonwealth Ocean Declaration emphasises oceanic issues, its lack of provisions on deep-sea mining exposes intra-Commonwealth tensions. The change in leadership offers a pivotal opportunity to prioritise equity and actionable commitments. Ultimately, the success of this gathering will depend on translating discussions into concrete actions that address the urgent needs of Pacific communities facing an uncertain future.</p>
        
            <p>But as the guests wave farewell, the question of what the Commonwealth really means for its Pacific members remains until leaders meet in two years time in Antigua and Barbuda, a small island state in the Caribbean.</p>
