            <p>Former elite cyclist Kate Wightman was just 29 years old when she was diagnosed with three types of gynaecological cancer.</p>
        
            <p>Two years later she's walking the [Te Araroa Trail https://www.teararoa.org.nz/] to raise awareness and money for gynaecological cancer research and education.</p>
        
            <p>Wightman spoke to First Up from Colac Bay and said at times she questioned whether tackling the walk was really a good idea.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a lot of scrambling up really steep hills ... all the lovely plants that cut you up. A lot of difficult terrain and bush bashing which I didn't expect."</p>
        
            <p>She said the thigh-deep mud in Longwood Forest, in Southland, was also not much fun.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a couple of parts where I questioned my sanity."</p>
        
            <p>Walking was the only exercise Wightman could manage while undergoing cancer treatment and she wanted to set herself a goal, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was something to really just take my mind away from being a patient, being in the hospital, and think about walking the Te Araroa was what kept me going everyday, so yeah it was a really nice goal to have."</p>
        
            <p>She had been walking an average 8-10 hours a day and had just two days left before she reacheed Stirling Point in Bluff.</p>
        
            <p>She invited people to come along on Saturday afternoon to celebrate.</p>

            <p>"I've been very very surprised, in a nice way, just the generosity and the kindness of people on the trail but also people that up their homes, or just give you a hot meal, or a shower.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just been incredible and something that I think I'll remember more than the landscapes to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>Wightman said the five types of gynaecological cancers had lots of different symptoms, including irregular bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating.</p>
        
            <p>She urged everyone to take note of changes in their body and be comfortable talking to a health professional about them.</p>
