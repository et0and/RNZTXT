            <p>David Warner's baggy green cap has been found after he announced it had gone missing ahead of his final Test appearance for Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Warner took to Instagram on Friday morning to confirm he had received the missing cap.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pleased and relieved that I have got my baggy (green cap) back in my hands," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any cricketer knows how special their cap is and I'll cherish this for the rest of my life."</p>
        
            <p>"Very grateful to all those involved in locating it: the Qantas team, the freight company, the hotel and our own team management.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a load of my shoulders â€¦ I really appreciate it, so thank you all."</p>
        
            <p>Warner did not reveal any further details on how the cap was located and returned.</p>

            <p>He made a public plea for its return on Tuesday after it went missing in transit between Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Cricket Australia (CA) is expected to give an update on how the cap was located.</p>
        
            <p>Warner had played in a replacement baggy green during Australia's first innings in the third Test against Pakistan at the SCG.</p>
        
            <p>He made 34 and is likely to have one more chance to bat for Australia in the second innings of his 112th and final Test.</p>
        
            <p>Warner's farewell is not going to plan</p>
        
            <p>David Warner arrived at the SCG with designs on one final shining moment to cap a career, but on day two in Sydney that dream might have been taken away from him.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Warner issued a video message on Instagram announcing his cap had gone missing.</p>
        
            <p>"A couple of days ago, our bags got freighted via Qantas. We've gone through CCTV footage, they've got some blind spots apparently," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We spoke to the Quay West Hotel, who we absolutely trust and have gone through their cameras. No-one's come into our rooms.</p>
        
            <p>"But unfortunately, someone has taken my backpack out of my actual luggage, which had my backpack and my girls' presents in there, inside this backpack was my baggy green.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sentimental to me, it's something I would love to have back in my hands walking out there come this week."</p>
        
            <p>CA chief executive Nick Hockley asked anyone with information to come forward so Warner could "proudly wear his cap for a final time at the SCG".</p>
        
            <p>Australian internationals receive the baggy green cap, usually from a former player, on the morning of their test debut and wear it with pride even as it deteriorates over the length of their career.</p>
        
            <p>The baggy green cap of Australian cricketing great Shane Warne sold for A$1,007,500 at an auction in January 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among those who joined Warner's appeal for the return of the rucksack</p>
