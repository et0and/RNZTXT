            <p>American voters have spoken, and they decided to rehire Donald Trump as president of the United States.</p>
        
            <p>But he won't take office until 20 January, 2025, and there are multiple things that will happen between now and then. Throughout November, December and January, there will be a transition between the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden and the incoming Trump administration. The transition has been complicated by Trump blowing through multiple deadlines in that process, which is laid out in law.</p>
        
            <p>Before he became president-elect, Trump became a convicted felon this year. A jury in New York found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to an adult film star before the 2016 election. His sentencing in that trial is set for 26 November.</p>
        
            <p>But the judge, Juan Merchan, could decide to throw out the conviction as soon as 12 November because of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling. The conviction could theoretically carry prison time, but the president-elect is not going to be given jail time. The judge could also give Trump probation or fine him.</p>
        
            <p>There's a much larger universe of court cases that could be affected by his election. Trump also faces federal prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling classified data, although it's likely that those cases will somehow be sidelined or ended.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps more complicated is the fact that Trump is liable to pay hundreds of millions in damages as a result of separate business fraud and defamation civil cases. He also faces multiple lawsuits, including from Capitol Police officers injured on 6 January, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>American voters cast ballots on and before Election Day, 5 November, but that was only one step in the process. States have until 11 December to confirm their election results with what's known as Certificates of Ascertainment.</p>
        
            <p>Then, on 17 December, slates of electors from the 50 states and Washington, DC, meet in their capitols to officially cast the 538 Electoral College votes.</p>
        
            <p>A temporary government funding bill passed before the election only lasts through 20 December. Lawmakers will need to meet during what's called the "lame-duck" session to make sure the government can stay open.</p>
        
            <p>It's not yet clear which party will have the majority in the House of Representatives, but Republicans will take a majority in the Senate. All the new lawmakers will take the oath of office and kick off the 119th Congress on 3 January.</p>

            <p>On 6 January, 2025, the new House and Senate will convene in the House chamber and Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the counting of Electoral College votes that make Trump president. No vice president since Al Gore in 2001 has had to preside over their own defeat.</p>
        
            <p>At noon on 20 January, 2025, Trump will be sworn in on the west front of the US Capitol. On 20 January, 2029, a new president will succeed him.</p>
