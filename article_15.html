            <p>A new sporting trophy marking the historic Tangiwai Disaster will be played for, for the first time when New Zealand and South Africa contest the first cricket test in Tauranga this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The most poignant chapter in the long history of New Zealand and South African cricket was officially recognised with the unveiling of the Tangiwai Shield in Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the opening Test between the Black Caps and the Proteas, the teams will now play for a trophy that commemorates the tragic events of 70 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>On Christmas Eve 1953, 151 passengers on the overnight train from Wellington to Auckland, including Nerissa Love, the fiancée of New Zealand fast-bowler Bob Blair, lost their lives in the country's worst rail disaster.</p>
        
            <p>The tragedy was particularly relevant to the New Zealand and South African teams of the day as it coincided with the second Test at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, where Blair was opening the bowling for his country.</p>
        
            <p>Just 21, he was woken in the early hours of the second morning of the Test to be told he'd lost the love of his life.</p>
        
            <p>He stayed at the hotel grieving as his team-mates resumed the match, with the flags of both countries lowered to half-mast.</p>
        
            <p>Blair's unexpected appearance out of the players tunnel after New Zealand lost its ninth wicket stunned the knowledgeable Ellis Park crowd into silence, and left players from both sides in tears.</p>
        
            <p>Blair and the great Bert Sutcliffe then proceeded put on a rapid 33, including a world record of 25 off one Hugh Tayfield over.</p>
        
            <p>When they walked from the field shortly after, following Blair's dismissal, the Ellis Park crowd gave them a thunderous ovation.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa ended up winning the Test comfortably.</p>

            <p>Today, his story of tragedy and courage, and the manner in which the South African team, board and public rallied around to support him and his team-mates, remains one of the defining chapters of New Zealand sport.</p>
        
            <p>The late, Christchurch-based cricket writer Dick Brittenden, who covered the tour wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"For Blair, the rest of the tour was a nightmare.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no overseas air passage available in those days and the voyage by sea took 28 days - far too long for him to return for his fiancée's funeral.</p>
        
            <p>"To make things worse, the letters Nerissa had written and posted to him daily from New Zealand, continued to arrive throughout the tour."</p>

            <p>The Shield, created by carver David Ngawati (Ngāti Hine), is made from New Zealand native timber puriri, and includes an in-laid mere made from pounamu sourced from the Tangiwai region.</p>
        
            <p>Tangiwai can be translated into "weeping waters' which is particularly poignant given the nature of the tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>The Shield was blessed and presented to the teams at a Powhiri in Tauranga today.</p>
        
            <p>Blair now lives in Cheshire, UK, with his wife Barbara, and is the only surviving player from either side that played in the Test.</p>
        
            <p>The events of that week have since inspired hundreds of articles, many books - several authored by South African scribes, some by New Zealanders; a TV film produced in New Zealand, and a play called "The Second Test".</p>
        
            <p>NZC chief executive, Scott Weenink, said the Shield was a fitting acknowledgement of what he considered one of the great stories of Kiwi sporting courage.</p>
        
            <p>"The background to this Test match is one of the most sad and moving and heart-breaking stories imaginable," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also an uplifting story of incredible courage and resilience, and in terms of the South African team and public, great compassion and empathy.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm delighted to see this very important part of cricket history properly recognised and acknowledged."</p>
        
            <p>The first match of the series starts on Sunday, at Bay Oval.</p>
