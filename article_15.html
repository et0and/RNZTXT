            <p>There were tense scenes as the two referees for the Christchurch mosque gunman's firearms licence gave evidence at the coroner's court.</p>
        
            <p>It saw one of the referees tell a lawyer to "sit down" and refuse to answer her question while the other threatened to walk out as another lawyer was "annoying" him.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest into the deaths of the 51 worshippers murdered at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre on 15 March 2019 has re-convened for its second phase.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Chief Coroner Brigitte Windley is examining how terrorist Brenton Tarrant obtained his firearms licence.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday afternoon, the gunman's gaming friend and his parent, who were the two referees for the firearms licence application, gave evidence.</p>
        
            <p>The gaming friend said he met the terrorist while playing World of Warcraft online and he had known him about 10 years by 2017.</p>
        
            <p>He told the inquest he had only met the terrorist in person on three separate occasions where they travelled together, and the terrorist stayed at his family home.</p>
        
            <p>He also took the terrorist to a gun club on two occasions and took him rabbit and possum shooting.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by counsel if he was aware of the terrorist's extremist views, he said he was aware he was right-wing and "anti-immigration", but he was well travelled and had spoken positively about the countries he visited.</p>
        
            <p>From his knowledge, such countries included Pakistan, Ukraine, China, India, Japan, Chad and France.</p>
        
            <p>He said on occasion, he would "shit post" online but he did not take the terrorist's posts too seriously as everyone online did similar to try get a reaction from others.</p>
        
            <p>He considered the terrorist a sensible and responsible person as at the time he was a referee, he was not aware he had committed any crimes.</p>
        
            <p>The gaming friend became hostile when asked why his opinion on the importance of being a referee had changed from 2017 to how he felt about it now.</p>

            <p>"Do you know what happened on March 15?" he asked lawyer Kathryn Dalziel before saying he would not answer the question and telling her to "sit down".</p>
        
            <p>Probed further by Coroner Windley, he said he had not fully gauged what could happen, the risks or consequences.</p>
        
            <p>In hindsight, he would have been a lot more vigilant, he said.</p>
        
            <p>His parent gave evidence next, saying he had only interacted with the terrorist on two occasions while he was staying at his home.</p>
        
            <p>He thought he was a "nice chap" and believed he knew him well enough to be a referee.</p>
        
            <p>When questioned on this matter by counsel assisting the coroner Ian Murray, the man became more hostile saying he "obviously bloody thought that" he knew him well enough to be a referee as he acted as one.</p>
        
            <p>The outburst caused Coroner Windley to step in, telling him his behaviour was not helpful.</p>

            <p>In response, he said Murray was "annoying him" and threatened to walk out.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he was aware of any issues the terrorist may have that should have prevented him holding a firearms licence, the witness responded: "In my opinion he was alright to do it, alright? Stop trying to dig a hole."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Thursday, it was revealed that the witness had said during his referee interview that the terrorist was a "good outstanding young man" and a "nice person".</p>
        
            <p>The gaming friend's parent said the terrorist was "outstanding" in what he was doing, uprooting himself to move to New Zealand to "do things".</p>
        
            <p>"I thought he was a nice guy, alright? So that's that."</p>
        
            <p>The second phase of the inquest is set down for three weeks, with about 15 witnesses expected to be called.</p>
