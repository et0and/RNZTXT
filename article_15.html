        <h2>Te Papa makes $750,000 in two months from international visitor fee</h2>
        <p>
Ticket sales are about on track, and are expected to ramp up over summer, the national museum says.
</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa has made $750,000 since it started charging international visitors an admission fee two months ago.</p>
        
            <p>The change came in during September to help fund rising energy, insurance and staffing costs at the museum.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa head of marketing and communications Kate Camp said tickets sales were currently at 97 percent of what Te Papa was expecting.</p>
        
            <p>The museum sold 21,632 tickets between 17 September and 24 November, an average of 314 tickets per day.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course we're just in that shoulder season now, we're not quite into peak season. So that will be even more over the summer."</p>
        
            <p>While the museum gets $44 million from the government each year, it needs to earn at least another $30 million to stay afloat.</p>
        
            <p>Charging international visitors is expected to raise several million dollars per year.</p>
        
            <p>Camp said feedback on the ticketing system so far had been mostly positive.</p>
        
            <p>She said one of the trickiest situations was when New Zealanders came with international visitors and only some of the group had to pay.</p>
        
            <p>That was the case for local Elisa who had brought her Canadian friend Nicole to see the museum, not realising there was now a charge for overseas visitors.</p>

            <p>Elisa had brought her friend to see the exhibitions on Māori culture, but said they would probably stay a bit longer after paying.</p>
        
            <p>Perth visitors Paige and Ryan thought keeping it free for locals was a fair system.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's very valid," Paige said.</p>
        
            <p>"Us coming in as foreigners, I think it's fair that we pay a fee to see everything."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan also thought it was good to keep museums free for locals as it was a place where they could learn about their history.</p>
        
            <p>Romy and Keira were also willing to pay.</p>
        
            <p>"It's common in Germany to pay for museums," Romy said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Americans Linda and Honey were used to a slightly different system.</p>
        
            <p>"I live in Washington DC, our capital in the US and all the national museums there are free," Honey said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I would not expect to pay for the museum, although this is a wonderful museum."</p>
        
            <p>Linda could also go to the museum for free. "I'm from Chicago and each museum has one day a week when it's free."</p>
        
            <p>Camp said Te Papa was watching visitor behaviour closely and making improvements as it went.</p>
        
            <p>"Because obviously this is an experiment. So we're going to be watching that really closely over the summer and just improving things as we go."</p>
        
            <p>Tickets to Te Papa are $35 for all international visitors over the age of 16.</p>
        
            <p>Entry to the museum remains free for all New Zealanders, including those who live overseas, and people living in Aotearoa.</p>
