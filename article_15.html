            <p>A non-binding Auckland "referendum" organised by US-based activists advocating for the creation of an independent homeland for Sikhs within India was discussed during Foreign Minister Winston Peters' meeting with his Indian counterpart in Australia this week.</p>
        
            <p>S Jaishankar, India's minister of external affairs, raised the issue with Peters on the sidelines of the Raisina Down Under conference in Canberra on 6 November.</p>
        
            <p>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson confirmed that Jaishankar raised the issue during the meeting but declined to provide details of the discussion.</p>
        
            <p>India's Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Sikhs for Justice has announced plans to organise a non-official "referendum" on Khalistan in Auckland's Aotea Square on 17 November.</p>
        
            <p>The group, which has previously held similar "referendums" in cities in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, has been a banned organisation in India since 2019. The Indian government has described some of the group's leaders as terrorists.</p>
        
            <p>Sikhs for Justice has denied all allegations of terrorism, calling itself a human rights advocacy group.</p>
        
            <p>Political experts warned the "referendum" could damage New Zealand-India relations, with both New Delhi and Wellington keeping an eye on developments.</p>
        
            <p>"If we saw unrest or any sign that pro-Khalistan groups had any sort of official blessing, then Indian officials would doubtless raise the issue with New Zealand counterparts," said David Capie, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at the Victoria University in Wellington, after an Auckland pro-Khalistan rally in October.</p>

            <p>Tātaki Auckland Unlimited (TAU) confirmed the "referendum" would be held in Aotea Square on 17 November.</p>
        
            <p>"TAU and Auckland Council recognise people's right to peaceful assembly," a TAU spokesperson said. "The right to hold or take part in public gatherings, including protests, is guaranteed under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly).</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that TAU remains apolitical in its own activities, including the venues, events and major cultural festivals it delivers on behalf of Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>"To do that, it must make decisions which might upset some groups - given the many political and human rights causes which people in our community feel passionate about."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said TAU kept "public safety at the forefront in all its civic spaces that are utilised for large groups and gatherings".</p>

            <p>Police in Auckland said they were aware of the planned "referendum" in Aotea Square on 17 November.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand Police recognises the right to protest and is working with the organisers, alongside other relevant authorities, as well as the community," a Police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police is aware of tensions around the referendum and will have a presence at any events. Police is fully briefed and prepared to keep everyone safe."</p>
        
            <p>Several Indian community organisations have called for vigilance "against attempts by foreign influences to disturb peace and foster division".</p>
        
            <p>"The Indian community in New Zealand stands united in its resolve to reject external influences that do not align with the values of community and respect, which are central to the diverse cultures coexisting in this country," said Narendra Bhana, president of the New Zealand Indian Central Association.</p>
        
            <p>United Voice Community Trust, which has been active in reporting hate speech against the Indian community, called for unity.</p>
        
            <p>"By focusing on unity and setting aside political issues, we honour the long-standing relationship the Asian community has built in New Zealand over the past century," said Narinder Singh Warraich, a member and trustee of United Voice Community Trust.</p>
        
            <p>"This approach reinforces that the community's solidarity and shared values are more significant than any external political disagreements."</p>
