            <p>Preview - The Mystics are looking to go back to back for the first time in the franchise's history and it will take a lot to stop them.</p>
        
            <p>The Magic host the Mystics in Hamilton on Saturday to kick off the eighth edition of the ANZ Premiership, and league organisers will be hoping that no one side completely dominates the competition.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics finally lifted the domestic trophy for the first time in 2021 but were hindered in 2022, when star shooter Grace Nweke missed rounds late in the season with an ankle injury.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the Mystics beat the Stars convincingly in the grand final, which also marked the end of the career of Mystics' stalwart Sulu Fitzpatrick.</p>
        
            <p>While the side will miss their inspirational captain, they have retained eight players, including exciting defender Carys Stythe, who is a strong future prospect for the Silver Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from having the country's strongest goal shooter in Nweke, the Mystics also have a strong midcourt between Peta Toeava and Tayla Earle.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics will also have one of the strongest defensive line-ups between Stythe, Pheonix Karaka, and newly named captain Michaela Sokolich-Beatson.</p>

            <p>The Stars are determined to go one better after two runner-up finishes in the past two seasons but they have lost six players, including stalwart Gina Crampton.</p>
        
            <p>That might see a midcourt reshuffle with Mila Reuelu-Buchanan able to play wing attack. Nuggety midcourter Lisa Mather has returned to the side, and Emma Thompson has got her first full contract.</p>
        
            <p>Significant pick-ups include Australian shooter Rahni Samason, who is also eligible for the Silver Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars will have one of the most mobile shooting circles in the competition between Samason, Amorangi Malesala, and Maia Wilson, who might spend more time at goal attack this year.</p>
        
            <p>After two seasons at the Steel, defender Kate Burley returns to the side and will be looking to push her way into a Silver Ferns debut.</p>
        
            <p>While there are many changes to the side, the franchise usually manages to punch above its weight.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The Magic have retained half of last year's squad. The biggest loss is that of former Silver Fern shooter Bailey Mes, who retired at the end of last year, along with midcourter Claire Kersten.</p>
        
            <p>They have recruited well in Saviour Tui, who comes to them after two seasons with the Steel. Tui should flourish in the goal circle, under the guidance of Silver Ferns captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio.</p>
        
            <p>The Magic have also picked up three new midcourters including Australian player Claire O'Brien and Ali Wilshier, who could fill the void at wing attack.</p>
        
            <p>Defensively, the Magic will be boosted by the return of Oceane Maihi, who has come back from a knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>The Magic were guilty last year of conceding too many goals so that's something that will need to be addressed between Maihi, veteran Erena Mikaere and Georgia Tong.</p>

            <p>The Pulse just missed out on the grand final last year by the slimmest of margins. New coach Anna Andrews-Tasola will benefit from having retained seven players and the Pulse look strong across the whole court.</p>
        
            <p>Goal shooter Amelia Walmsley was a revelation last year for the Pulse, which led to a Silver Ferns call-up.</p>
        
            <p>The shooting partnership between Tiana Metuarau and Walmsley will only grow stronger, and an exciting third shooting option is Khiarna Williams, who has returned from serious injury.</p>
        
            <p>Whitney Souness and Maddy Gordon provide a strong engine room in the midcourt.</p>
        
            <p>In defence, they have lost the experienced Kristiana Manu'a but exciting young prospect Parris Mason has served a long apprenticeship and will be eager to make her mark.</p>

            <p>After finishing fourth last year, the Tactix have retained eight players and will be determined to bounce back from a season where the side did not really live up to its full potential.</p>
        
            <p>After a season under their belts, expect the shooting combination of Aliyah Dunn and Te Paea Selby-Rickit to go from strength to strength.</p>
        
            <p>Dunn, however, is under an injury cloud after hurting her knee during the pre-season and will miss their opener against the Steel.</p>
        
            <p>Former Tactix shooter Ellie Bird has been added to the bench for Monday's game to bolster the squad, and Australian player Charlie Bell has been called into the side as cover for at least their opening two matches.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek has got a better balanced midcourt this year, with the return of experienced wing attack Erikana Pedersen.</p>
        
            <p>She is spoilt for choice in the wing defence position, with exciting young guns Greer Sinclair and Paris Lokotui fighting for court time.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Jane Watson's court time had to be managed due to a foot issue. If Watson is fully fit, she and fellow Silver Fern Karin Burger will have one of the county's best circle defence combinations.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The Steel had a miserable 2023 after a serious knee injury ruled shooter George Fisher out of the season, and the franchise was left scrambling for a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Injury setbacks mean Fisher is not available again but the Steel have had time to find a more like for like replacement in Jen O'Connell, who was part of the title winning side in 2017 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>A season-ending knee injury in 2020 put the brakes on her career, but the 1.93m tall shooter has been playing in basketball's Tauihi league so will be a strong presence for the Steel.</p>
        
            <p>The Steel have six changes from last year, including the welcome return of former Silver Fern Shannon Saunders, who will be able to slot back in at wing attack.</p>
        
            <p>They have lost two experienced defenders in Kate Burley and now retired Te Huinga Reo Selby-Rickit but have regained exciting young defender Taneisha Fifita.</p>
        
            <p>Identical twin sisters and Silver Ferns Georgia and Kate Heffernan give the Steel a strong back bone and the Southerners should pick up a number of victories this year, after a winless 2023.</p>
        
            <p>1. Mystics</p>
        
            <p>Star-studded across the court, the defending champion Mystics are obvious title favourites once again. With strike-weapon Grace Nweke back to her powerful best, no other side has such a formidable anchor in its shooting circle. Nweke is already dominating the league in the same way Jamaican Jhaniele Fowler did during her time with the Steel. Captain Mikaela Sokolich-Beatson is out to solidify her late career revival, following her recall to the Silver Ferns last year. After an 18-goal rout of the Stars in last year's grand final, the gulf between the Mystics and the rest of the pack is still significant.</p>
        
            <p>2. Pulse</p>
        
            <p>With the dynamic Silver Ferns midcourt duo of Maddy Gordon and Whitney Souness, the Pulse are serious contenders. Young shooter Amelia Walmsley was a revelation in her breakout season last year. New coach Anna Andrews-Tasola took a conservative approach to starting selections in the pre-season. She will rely on her best seven with defender Kelly Jackson (nee Jury) a mature and clever presence at the back.</p>
        
            <p>3. Stars</p>
        
            <p>It is a toss up between the Stars and Tactix for third, but the Stars get there by a slim margin. If their former Melbourne Vixens shooting ace Rahni Samason can stay injury free and play entire games, they have the talented roster to take third. Defender Kate Burley will be out to prove her worth as she returns to her home court from a winless stint in the deep south. The Tactix deserve a mention but their brittle shooting combination is likely to see the perennial underachievers again fail to capitalise on their potential. A concern for red and black fans is that Tactix shooter Aliyah Dunn is under an injury cloud. Her partner Te Paea Selby-Rickit can likely make a bigger impact if she is left in the back at goal shoot.</p>

            <p>1. Mystics</p>
        
            <p>If Silver Ferns shooter Grace Nweke stays fit, the Mystics will be very hard to beat. After many seasons playing together the Mystics also have a very smooth midcourt, with an invisible connection running between Peta Toeava and Tayla Earle. The Mystics talk about the need to not become too predictable, but for other teams even the Mystics 'predictable' is hard to stop.</p>
        
            <p>2. Pulse</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse have a very strong team across every area of the court. They also have a genuine third shooting option in Khiarna Williams, which can make or break a team. They have got a lot of experience and calm heads who know what it takes to win a title or two.</p>
        
            <p>3. Tactix</p>
        
            <p>We got a glimpse of what the Tactix are capable of when they played their final and best game of the season last year - an extra time loss to the Mystics in enemy territory. If they can play anything like that and stay fit they will be very strong.</p>
