            <p>India needed just a day and a half and 642 balls to beat South Africa by seven wickets in the shortest Test to produce a winner in the history of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Set 79 to win, the tourists got over the line midway through the afternoon session on day two at Newlands to conclude a remarkable match.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa were bowled out for 55 on day one and, despite Aiden Markram's superb 106, they were all out again for 176 by the end of the second morning.</p>
        
            <p>India's win means the series ends 1-1.</p>
        
            <p>The previous shortest Test also involved South Africa, who were beaten by Australia in 656 balls in Melbourne in 1932.</p>
        
            <p>After 23 wickets fell on a chaotic first day in Cape Town, India picked up where they left off with Jasprit Bumrah removing South Africa right-hander David Bedingham in the first over of day two.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first of five wickets in the session for Bumrah, who finished with figures of 6-61, as the hosts collapsed again on a bouncy, lively surface.</p>
        
            <p>The lone resistance came from the impressive Markram as he countered superbly to bring up his seventh Test century from 99 balls.</p>
        
            <p>He eventually fell to Mohammed Siraj with South Africa bowled out for 176 soon after.</p>
        
            <p>India's chase began after lunch and they were intent on finishing the job quickly with left-hander Yashasvi Jaiswal playing in T20 mode at the top of the order.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists were more than halfway to their target by the time he holed out off Nandre Burger for 28.</p>
        
            <p>Although Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli were dismissed as India closed in, Shreyas Iyer thumped the last ball of the 12th over for four to seal a memorable win.</p>
        
            <p>It is a disappointing end for South Africa captain Dean Elgar, for whom this was an 86th and final Test before retirement.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Proteas' victory in the Boxing Day Test at Centurion ensures that India have still never won a Test series in South Africa.</p>
