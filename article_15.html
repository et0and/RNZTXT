            <p>A sign language interpreter from Christchurch is urging the Indian community to learn New Zealand Sign Language.</p>
        
            <p>Originally from the Indian state of Kerala, Rekha Rosario grew up in Mumbai but moved to New Zealand with her family in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>"I grew up watching a deaf family member struggle to access education, services, employment and healthcare because of his unique communication needs," Rosario says.</p>
        
            <p>Previously employed by India's Customs and Central Excise Department, Rosario decided to secure employment in a sign language role in 2004, enrolling in a summer school at Auckland University of Technology before going on to complete a diploma.</p>
        
            <p>Rosario says it was difficult to learn New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) but was able to graduate thanks to the support of her family.</p>
        
            <p>During her studies in New Zealand, Rosario encountered many of the systemic barriers she had previously come across in India.</p>
        
            <p>"This further fueled my desire to work with the deaf community in New Zealand," she says.</p>
        
            <p>In April 2006, NZSL became New Zealand's third official language under the New Zealand Sign Language Act, alongside English and te reo MƒÅori.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation attempted to ensure the country's hearing-impaired community had equal access to government information and services.</p>
        
            <p>Working as a NZSL interpreter in New Zealand with Indian heritage, Rosario acknowledges the challenges she faces.</p>
        
            <p>"I constantly face judgement from clients when I meet them for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to showcase my Indian values," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Rosario was named interpreter of the year at the New Zealand Sign Language Awards in May.</p>
        
            <p>In giving Rosario the award, the committee described her as an "outstanding professional who has a genuine commitment to the role of interpreter and to ensuring deaf people have access to information".</p>
        
            <p>"Her commitment to enhancing communication, whether in medical settings, online meetings or personal interactions, exemplifies the qualities that define an outstanding NZSL interpreter."</p>
        
            <p>Rosario expressed gratitude to the disabled community for recognizing her work over the past 18 years, saying the award motivated her to continue her efforts.</p>
        
            <p>She says South Asian communities have welcomed her with open arms.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been able to provide culturally in-depth interpretation at Indian events such as citizenship ceremonies and weddings," Rosario says.</p>
        
            <p>Younger members of the Indian disabled community have told Rosario her interpretations have helped them feel more connected to their heritage and culture.</p>
        
            <p>Rosario hopes her work will inspire others from the South Asian community to learn sign language and become interpreters.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a huge demand in the field after the Covid-19 pandemic," she says.</p>
        
            <p>According to the 2018 census, about 4600 hearing-impaired people live in Aotearoa, with around 23,000 using sign language in some way.</p>
        
            <p>Rosario feels a sense of accomplishment with her work in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"As an interpreter, I strive to provide precise and clear communication between the hearing and the deaf community," she says. "Every time I do this, I feel fulfilled in my purpose."</p>
