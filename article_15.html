        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific: Is this the most interesting season in a long time?</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - It's hard to know where to start with the latest round: stunning tries, tight finishes and another couple of big victories over the NZ powerhouses. Video

            <p>Analysis - It is hard to know where to start with the latest round of Super Rugby Pacific. It had the trademark stunning tries, a record for the Wellington Bus and a tackle as late as an actual Wellington bus, and the largest winning margin was achieved by the Fijian Drua in their 20-10 victory over the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>That's now two in a row for the Drua at home against the defending champions, who truly have made Churchill Park in Lautoka the graveyard of the Pacific. Hot, sweaty conditions, rickety old stands, tourists over from Denerau mixing with locals and folks watching up trees - it's a one-of-a-kind venue that embodies everything unique about SRP.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders knew full well that the Drua turn into a different side when they return home. The problem is, knowing that in advance doesn't really help you much if you're so banged up you've got a mixture of debutants and guys well past their used-by date.</p>
        
            <p>It was fitting then that the Crusaders' only try was scored by a local, Sevu Reece grew up just down the road in Nadi, but they let two guys who still actually live there - Selestino Ravutaumada and Frank Lomani - score against them.</p>
        
            <p>Panic stations? It certainly starting to feel that way because it's not going to get much easier over the next fortnight. The Crusaders host the in-form Hurricanes on Friday then go to Eden Park to face a hostile Blues team, so the prospect of being 0-5 is very real.</p>
        
            <p>Not that many people outside of Christchurch are minding. At the Aupiki match between the Blues Women and Chiefs Manawa at Bell Park in Pakuranga, news of the Drua's win filtering through saw both sets of rival fans spontaneously celebrate together.</p>

            <p>Congratulations to Julian 'The Bus' Savea, who can finally claim Super Rugby's try-scoring title outright. His effort on Friday night unfortunately couldn't help Moana Pasifika avoid a 29-23 loss to the Rebels, but what was more unfortunate was that literally no one saw it. Moana's forced shift to FMG Stadium Waikato and the scheduling clash with the Warriors meant the stands looked like lockdown rules were still in effect.</p>
        
            <p>Savea has now scored 61 tries in Super Rugby, one more than previous record holder Israel Folau. Even mentioning Folau's name unfortunately brings with it an entirely different conversation, but it is worth noting that he took 57 less games to score his career total, plus he spent the first five years of his pro career playing other sports.</p>
        
            <p>It's safe to assume that had Folau kept his religious views off social media, he would have set a record that would never have been broken.</p>
        
            <p>'Stern' Vern Cotter has quickly forged a reputation as being a no-nonsense presence at the Blues, but his decision to go with a six forward, two back reserve bench backfired spectacularly at Sky Stadium. Failed HIAs in quick succession to Zarn Sullivan and AJ Lam blew Cotter's substitution plan to bits with halfback Taufa Funaki having to play on the wing. The Hurricanes were ruthless enough to send Josh Moorby down his channel straight away to score and establish a decent lead, which they managed impressively for an eventual 29-21 win.</p>
        
            <p>Are the Canes the real deal this year? This match on Friday night in Christchurch is shaping up as potentially season defining for both them and their hosts.</p>

            <p>Maybe taking a bit of inspiration from the Drua, the Queensland Reds repeated their heroics from last year by knocking off a strangely listless-looking Chiefs outfit 25-19 at Suncorp Stadium. Josh Flook became the most appropriately named try-scorer of all time when he cashed in on a ridiculous bounce of the ball to score a crucial try in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>The game was marked by one massive hit by Samipeni Finau on Tom Lynagh, which would have been a perfectly legal tackle had he not laid it on so late it might as well have been in a different game.</p>
        
            <p>That result leaves the Canes on top of the table, but probably more importantly that the average margin of victory over the round was less than six points - a fantastic stat and proof that Super Rugby Pacific is very much alive and kicking as a premier competition.</p>
        
            <p>It's tempting to think that the Crusaders' apparent demise is a big part of that, but really it's more down to teams showing up this season with a willingness to play attractive, entertaining footy.</p>
