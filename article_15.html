            <p>The political fallout from the deadly riots in Papua New Guinea continues, including calls for a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister James Marape.</p>
        
            <p>Six MPs in Marape's government have resigned following last week's riots, in which at least a dozen people were killed.</p>
        
            <p>Belden Namah, representative for Vanimo-Green, is the latest government MP to resign.</p>
        
            <p>Namah is a senior MP and a former captain in the PNG Defence Force. He was involved in removing Sandline mercenaries in 1997 after similar rioting and looting. As such, his resignation is a significant blow to the Marape regime.</p>
        
            <p>Last Friday the Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge, called for an emergency sitting of Parliament to address urgent issues including a vote of no confidence.</p>
        
            <p>Marape still has the majority and may announce a possible reshuffle in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>It is expected that there will be ministries that will be reworked so that the main base of power will still be contained.</p>
        
            <p>Normalcy has returned on the ground the only tension is within political circles where people were preparing for a vote of no confidence or calling for a vote of no confidence.</p>

Papua New Guinea's prime minister declared a 14-day state of emergency in the capital on January 11, after 15 people were killed in riots as crowds looted and burned shops.

            <p>After several days of intense rioting in Port Moresby, Lae and other regions of Papua New Guinea the current death toll reached 22.</p>
        
            <p>However, it is suspected that the actual death toll, as order is restored, will be higher.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Police Commissioner Donald Yamasombi asked people to return stolen property.</p>
        
            <p>Yamasombi told looters to leave stolen items outside their homes for the military and police to pick up, on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>His request was met with reasonable compliance.</p>
        
            <p>A couple in Lae were arrested for abusing police over social media. The couple were "made an example of" for supporting the looters.</p>
        
            <p>There were also videos of looters expressing their dissatisfaction and telling the government why they were looting.</p>
        
            <p>There is a feeling that something needs to happen. There are underlying frustrations among the population like the lack of opportunity for young people and the youth problems not dealt with.</p>
        
            <p>The public's frustrations are mirrored by PNG police, concerning their poor housing, work and pay conditions. Officers are expected to go into tribal fighting zones without body armour for protection.</p>
