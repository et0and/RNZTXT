            <p>As the 2023-2024 NFL season hurtles towards its climax, the Divisional Playoff Round once again proved to be a pivotal juncture of heightened drama and intensified tension.</p>
        
            <p>Now, all eyes are on the NFC and AFC Conference Championship games. The championship round provides us with two solid favourites tipped to make the Super Bowl in San Francisco and Baltimore taking on Detroit and defending Super Bowl champions Kansas City.</p>
        
            <p>The stakes are high as they can possibly be as these matchups will determine who earns the right to compete at Allegiant Stadium on 11 February (Monday, 12 February NZ time) for Super Bowl LVII in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
        
            <p>Generally speaking, having an effective defence and a top-notch quarterback are crucial for playoff survival. The Baltimore Ravens are unique in this sense, finding themselves with the hottest quarterback in the game in Lamar Jackson matching up with their elite defence, ranked number one in the entire league.</p>

            <p>Jackson was the finest player on the field in the Ravens' 34-10 victory last weekend over the Houston Texans, tearing them to shreds in the air and on the ground. The coaching faculty at Baltimore are nothing short of elite themselves with some incredible play calling against Houston that not only racked up a mouth-watering 34 points, but also strangled the Texans and stopped rookie quarterback sensation C.J. Stroud dead in his tracks - a feat no other teams were able to pull off the last few months.</p>
        
            <p>But the Chiefs have a history of rising to the occasion, so there's absolutely no reason to think that they will be intimidated by these circumstances. Patrick Mahomes is scheduled for another tremendous quarterback duel in the championship game, leading the Chiefs against Jackson.</p>
        
            <p>Currently holding a 3-2 record in AFC title games under Mahomes' guidance, the Chiefs have maybe the greatest defence of their dominant era this season, which is a significant difference. They were ranked second in yardage allowed and scoring defence at the end of the regular season.</p>

            <p>Baltimore is also doing admirably on all sides of the ball. The Ravens' defence held solid against Houston, playing especially well against the run, and this protective ability has been present since the beginning of the season. In spite of the Chiefs' widely recognised reputation, this game shows that Baltimore's defence might just be the one to stop the Kansas City dynasty in its tracks.</p>
        
            <p>It has been three long decades since the Vince Lombardi trophy has travelled across the Golden Gate Bridge, when the 49ers last won a Super Bowl back in 1994. The most formidable teams over the past five years not to have brought home the silverware, the Niners are scheduled to compete in their seventh NFC title Game since 2011.</p>
        
            <p>If the team defeats Detroit, head coach Kyle Shanahan will have the chance to tie legendary coach Bill Walsh for the greatest playoff win percentage in the team's history. Meanwhile, after missing the conference championship game of the previous season due to an elbow injury in a crushing defeat to Philadelphia, quarterback Brock Purdy is looking to cement his name in the history books.</p>

            <p>The Lions are endeavouring to create their own history. They've already accomplished a historic achievement by notching up two playoff victories for the very first time in 67 long years, so this accomplishment is unfamiliar territory for most Lions fans.</p>
        
            <p>Notably, the 49ers' outstanding defence faces a serious challenge from the Lions' dynamic offence, creating an exciting matchup where Detroit will be looking to force San Francisco into a shootout.</p>
        
            <p>Guiding the team is quarterback Jared Goff, whose narrative stands out as one of the most compelling tales of the current NFL season. Following a stellar performance in the recent victory against Tampa Bay, the former Rams player now finds himself in a position to reach his second Super Bowl with the Lions. A trip to Las Vegas could potentially solidify Goff's status as a legendary figure in the Motor City.</p>
        
            <p>The Lions do have a noteworthy weakness in pass defence, so the wide range of offensive playmakers in San Francisco is likely to present Detroit with substantial challenges. The 49ers also have a wealth of talented defensive players and a pass rush that can put pressure on the quarterback while still favouring coverage over blitz packages.</p>
        
            <p>But the Lions have a couple of aces up their sleeves. Even though Purdy has guided an incredibly effective offence all season, he has displayed fragility, and any wobbling might present Detroit with a chance to pounce. Second, it makes sense to take advantage of the 49ers' susceptibility to the run.</p>
        
            <p>Even though the 49ers have one of the best pass defences in the league and are particularly good at stopping deep passes, this advantage might not be as significant, as Goff opts to throw very short/mid-range on offence.</p>
        
            <p>Although the Lions may need a little fortune, they could provide one of the biggest upsets of all time against San Francisco and book themselves their first ever spot in the Super Bowl.</p>
