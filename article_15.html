            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's four-day trip to India started on a bright note, with India announcing the start of free trade negotiations with New Zealand on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>However, things turned sour the following day after his Indian counterpart publicly aired concerns about "anti-India activities by some illegal elements in New Zealand" in prepared remarks to media.</p>
        
            <p>While Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was confident the New Zealand government would "take action" against these elements, Luxon later told reporters there was no suggestion the Khalistan movement had broken any laws.</p>
        
            <p>He also said Modi did not specifically ask New Zealand to clamp down on the Khalistan movement here.</p>
        
            <p>But why is Khalistan suddenly hogging headlines on a trip Luxon hopes to hold out as a shining example of the government's ability to clinch a free trade deal with the South Asian giant?</p>
        
            <p>What follows are the main talking points you'll need to know about a fractious issue that has divided the Indian community in New Zealand - as it has in other parts of the world.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian prime minister wasn't specific in his remarks but appeared to be referring to the non-binding Khalistan "referendum" that took place in Auckland's Aotea Square on 17 November.</p>
        
            <p>The event was organised by US-based separatist group Sikhs for Justice, which has held similar ballots in cities in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>Sikhs for Justice organised the "referendum" so the Sikh diaspora in New Zealand could support the group's demand to create an independent homeland for Sikhs in India. In essence, the group wants to carve out a separate country for followers of the Sikh religion in India. The separatists call this state Khalistan.</p>
        
            <p>The referendums organised by Sikhs for Justice follow from the Khalistan movement, which gained prominence in the Indian state of Punjab in the 1970s, turned into a violent insurgency in the 1980s and was subdued by the mid-1990s.</p>
        
            <p>Demands for a separate homeland for Sikhs first emerged in the years immediately following the partition of India in 1947.</p>
        
            <p>In 1973, regional political party Akali Dal passed the Anandpur Sahib Resolution that demanded greater autonomy for Punjab.</p>
        
            <p>Separatists slowly gained traction by the 1980s, and what followed were three of the most consequential events in the history of independent India.</p>
        
            <p>In June 1984, Indian armed forces stormed the Golden Temple - a sacred site for Sikhs - to flush out militant separatists.</p>
        
            <p>In October that same year, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards.</p>
        
            <p>Anti-Sikh riots in the wake of Gandhi's death led to killing of around 3000 Sikhs in New Delhi and beyond.</p>
        
            <p>Over the next decade, India suffered huge losses to life and property as Indian armed forces launched special operations against the insurgency.</p>
        
            <p>By the mid-1990s, the majority of Khalistani supporters had either put down their weapons, joined the mainstream or relocated abroad, and the movement lost steam.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian state of Punjab has grown in prosperity following the prolonged period of peace ever since.</p>
        
            <p>While the Khalistan movement fails to attract a lot of support in the Indian state of Punjab, it has gained some traction among the Sikh diaspora abroad.</p>
        
            <p>An estimated 25 million people claim Sikh heritage worldwide. The majority live in India, where they make up about 2 percent of the country's population.</p>
        
            <p>Canada has the largest share of Sikhs worldwide, with around 780,000 individuals claiming heritage. An additional 500,000 live in both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>Around 200,000 individuals claim Sikh heritage in Australia, with another 50,000 claiming Sikh heritage in New Zealand, according to the latest 2023 Census.</p>
        
            <p>Sikhs for Justice has organised "referendums" in these five countries.</p>
        
            <p>The last "referendum" was organised in Auckland in November, with the next one planned in Los Angeles on 23 March.</p>
        
            <p>India calls Sikhs for Justice a terrorist organisation and has banned it since 2019 for alleged terrorism links and for "propagating anti-national and separatist sentiments prejudicial to the territorial integrity and security of India".</p>
        
            <p>However, Sikhs for Justice denies all allegations of terrorism, calling itself a human rights advocacy group.</p>
        
            <p>The government has repeatedly said that New Zealand recognises India's sovereignty and territorial integrity when asked about the Khalistan movement.</p>
        
            <p>The government has also consistently said that the country was a strong supporter of human rights at home and around the world, including freedom of speech, provided such initiatives were lawful and peaceful.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has also suggested the Khalistan movement had not broken any laws in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, discussed the issue when they met on the sidelines of the Raisina Down Under conference in Canberra on 6 November.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister himself was briefed by numerous agencies a day earlier.</p>
        
            <p>So, it's clear the issue has been discussed at top diplomatic levels before the public remarks by the Indian prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Only time will tell. Modi has now publicly aired about his concerns about anti-India activities in New Zealand. He could just as easily have mentioned it during the pair's private conversation.</p>
        
            <p>But by calling this out publicly, India has put the New Zealand government on notice.</p>
        
            <p>All eyes will now be on how local and central government agencies respond the next time Khalistani separatists want to mobilise support in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>You can be sure that India will be watching that response closely.</p>
