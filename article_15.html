            <p>The fallout from spy-gate at Paris continues with Canadian players taking aim at their former coach.</p>
        
            <p>The drone drama unfolded ahead of the opening match of the Olympic women's football.</p>
        
            <p>Canada found themselves at the centre of the scandal when their analyst was caught flying a drone to spy on New Zealand's team practice.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Bev Priestman, as well as Canada soccer staff members Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, were sent home as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Priestman was banned for a year by FIFA from any soccer-related activities.</p>
        
            <p>Just as the dust was settling, two players have kicked it up again with a scathing assessment of their former coach.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on the Footy Prime podcast, forward Evelyne Viens and defender Gabby Carle did not mince words.</p>
        
            <p>"She told us she was going to take all responsibility. In my opinion, she didn't. I think she kind of went around (the situation) and I don't think that was okay at the end of the day," Carle said.</p>
        
            <p>Carle said they were led to believe the situation was under control by Priestman.</p>
        
            <p>"Then the very next day, we see the press release, and we realise, 'oh, accountability is not being taken' and then, I mean, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse."</p>
        
            <p>The defending champions reached the quarter-finals in Paris, despite a six-point deduction.</p>
        
            <p>Andy Spence took over the coaching role from Priestman for the rest of the games, and both players said they immediately felt more supported than under the previous regime.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I had to learn to see my own value, because I didn't necessarily feel value no matter what I did. Once I was on that field and she was gone, I realised just how much of an impact she had on me. It felt like I was always second-guessing my decisions," Carle said.</p>
        
            <p>Viens concurred.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just, like, go do it. So I think for me, was a little relief in this way that the coach my positive aspect on the field. I believe in me now."</p>
        
            <p>Carle alleges Priestman created an environment where players were not comfortable making mistakes.</p>
        
            <p>"If I messed one thing up, I knew this was going to be brought up, and I knew it was going to be held against me. During these Olympics, was the first time I felt like I could just go out there and be myself."</p>
