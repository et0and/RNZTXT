            <p>It's fair to say Fred again.. is having a moment. The 31-year-old British DJ has captivated global audiences and, in 2024, ascended to superstar status.</p>
        
            <p>With only a day's notice, Fred managed to surprise fans in sold-out stadiums, a testament to his growing influence and magnetic appeal.</p>
        
            <p>Fred's new album, Ten Days, marks a fresh chapter in his career, brimming with melancholic joy. His knack for crafting music that resonates with the masses is evident, and this album showcases his ability to meld emotion with melody in a way that's both accessible and profound.</p>
        
            <p>Despite his immense success and wealth, Fred again.. remains an enigmatic figure, known for forging connections with artists worldwide during his tours.</p>
        
            <p>His commitment to elevating others has endeared him to fans, exemplified by his inclusion of emerging talents like Aotearoa's DJ Messie in his arena tours.</p>
        
            <p>By bridging the gap between artists and audiences, Fred creates meaningful connections through his loyal fanbase.</p>
        
            <p>Before rising to fame, Fred again.. was behind the scenes, writing songs for notable artists like Ed Sheeran, Charli XCX, and BTS. This background is reflected in Ten Days, where Fred collaborates with a diverse range of artists across electronica, hip-hop, and pop. The album features a curated lineup of collaborators, underscoring Fred's expertise in blending different musical styles.</p>
        
            <p>Fred describes Ten Days as a collection of "very small, quiet, intimate moments", with some tracks capturing intensely joyful experiences. However, the album's tracklist of 20 songs is somewhat deceptive. Interspersed with 10- to 30-second field recordings between every second song, it offers brief interludes that create an illusion of length and variety, providing listeners with short, reflective pauses amid the anthems.</p>
        
            <p>The album opens with 'Adore You', a euphoric single inspired by Fred again..'s relationship with his sister. Featuring the undulating vocals of Steven Umoh, known professionally as Obongjayar, the track sets an uplifting tone.</p>
        
            <p>Another highlight is 'Places to Be', which features Anderson .Paak and Chika. The song credits four co-writers, including Fred again.., Anderson .Paak, Benjy Gibson, and Chika Oranika, and the music video of their live performance in a sun-drenched home studio has garnered over nine million views on YouTube.</p>
        
            <p>While 'Glow' - a collaboration with heavyweights Four Tet, Skrillex, Joy Anonymous, Parisi, and Duskus - promised an anthemic track, it ultimately fell short of expectations. Similarly, 'Peace You Needed' evoked a sense of nostalgia but lacked the emotional impact one might have hoped for.</p>
        
            <p>One thing remains clear: Fred again.. surrounds himself with talented collaborators and shares his success generously. While Ten Days does uplift the spirit, it may not be the game-changer some anticipated.</p>
