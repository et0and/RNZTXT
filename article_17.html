            <p>Opinion - In a significant development, the long-awaited Royal Commission report on state care survivors was tabled in Parliament in July.</p>
        
            <p>It shed light on the harrowing experiences of Morehu who endured abuse and neglect while in state care. The report, a culmination of six years of investigation and testimonies, has sparked calls for justice, accountability, and meaningful redress for survivors of historical abuse.</p>
        
            <p>As the findings of the Royal Commission are laid bare, attention now turns to the critical question: What's next for Morehu, the survivors who bravely shared their stories and sought truth and reconciliation through the inquiry process? The road ahead is fraught with challenges, but it also presents an opportunity for healing, empowerment, and systemic change.</p>
        
            <p>For many Morehu, the tabling of the Royal Commission report marks a pivotal moment in their journey towards justice and closure.</p>
        
            <p>The report's recommendations, which are expected to encompass a range of measures aimed at addressing past wrongs and preventing future abuses, hold the promise of meaningful change for survivors and their families.</p>
        
            <p>One of the key priorities moving forward is the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations in a timely and comprehensive manner.</p>
        
            <p>This includes ensuring that survivors are actively involved in the decision-making processes that will shape the redress and support mechanisms put in place to address the legacy of abuse in state care.</p>

            <p>Moreover, there is a pressing need for a survivor-centered approach that prioritises the wellbeing and dignity of Morehu throughout the redress process.</p>
        
            <p>This involves providing survivors with access to culturally responsive support services, trauma-informed care, and opportunities for healing and reconciliation in ways that respect their mana and autonomy.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to individual support, collective healing and community empowerment are vital components of the post-Royal Commission landscape. Morehu have emphasised the importance of creating spaces for shared healing, truth-telling, and solidarity among survivors, families, and communities impacted by state care abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Furthermore, accountability and justice for survivors remain paramount considerations in the aftermath of the Royal Commission report. Calls for holding perpetrators and institutions accountable for past abuses, as well as addressing systemic failures and injustices, underscore the need for a robust and transparent response to the report's findings.</p>
        
            <p>Amidst this complex landscape, a group called Te Aratakitū emerged as a body of indigenous experts advocating for Morehu state care survivors. It comprised of Māori state care survivors, Māori academics, and Māori lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>Aratakitū was established to advise the Royal Commission, contribute to the reports tabled in Parliament, and offer guidance based on their lived experiences in state care.</p>

            <p>Their invaluable insights and expertise played a crucial role in shaping the recommendations and ensuring that the voices of Morehu are heard and honoured in the pursuit of justice and healing.</p>
        
            <p>As the spotlight shifts from the tabling of the report to the implementation of its recommendations, Morehu and their advocates, including Aratakitū, are calling for a holistic and survivor-centered approach that centers on healing, justice, and empowerment. The journey ahead may be challenging, but it also holds the potential for transformative change and a renewed commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of all survivors of state care abuse.</p>
        
            <p>In the wake of the Royal Commission report, the voices of Morehu, amplified by groups like Aratakitū, echo with resilience, courage, and a steadfast determination to ensure that their stories are not forgotten and that their calls for justice are heard and acted upon. The path forward may be uncertain, but the resolve of survivors and their allies to create a safer, more just future for all remains unwavering.</p>
