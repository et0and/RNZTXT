            <p>Analysis - This is a spectacular victory for Labour.</p>
        
            <p>Spectacular given where they came from - the doldrums. Their result in 2019 was their worst since 1935.</p>
        
            <p>But spectacular too by any metric, at any time, in any context, because the challenge they faced to win by a smidgen was Himalayan.</p>
        
            <p>It's "the Starmer tsunami" as one shellshocked opponent put it.</p>
        
            <p>The story of this election is one of an electorate showing a ruthless determination to eject the Conservatives.</p>
        
            <p>In plenty of places that meant electing a Labour MP.</p>
        
            <p>In a fair chunk of others it meant electing a Liberal Democrat MP.</p>
        
            <p>And there are a heck of a lot of votes for Reform UK.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by lunchtime, taking to Downing Street a colossal majority.</p>
        
            <p>Expect his tone, outside Number 10 at around lunchtime, to be magnanimous, understated.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Keir is emphasising the need to return what he sees as stability and civility to politics.</p>
        
            <p>It looks like - despite their colossal win - that Labour's share of the vote isn't colossal, so a pitch from the soon-to-be prime minister that tacitly acknowledges that is probably sensible.</p>
        
            <p>Not least because winning big can create expectations that might be hard to meet.</p>

            <p>Remember that Prime Minister Starmer, Chancellor Rachel Reeves - as they soon will be - and the new government will confront all of the old problems that caused its predecessor so much trouble: the cost of living, the government's finances, the tax burden, a dangerous world - and no majority, however big, can erase them.</p>
        
            <p>This was a night of a thousand stories.</p>
        
            <p>Politics at its heart is about human beings, and their emotions: success, failure, jubilation, anguish, regret.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was a very high profile nocturnal casualty.</p>
        
            <p>Arguably the outgoing government's most able communicator, his voice cracking as he delivered his concession speech.</p>
        
            <p>Jeremy Hunt hung on in Surrey, his voice cracking too as he spoke.</p>
        
            <p>This was a night whose soundtrack was the post mortem beginning in the Conservative Party: from Robert Buckland, Shapps, Penny Mordaunt and others.</p>
        
            <p>There will be plenty more of that to come.</p>
        
            <p>But remember, unlike the circus of Conservative psychodrama in recent years, this will be a sideshow of a tussle - a battle within an opposition party, not a governing party.</p>
        
            <p>It will still matter though because millions of people will want to ensure the new government, with a big majority, is properly scrutinised and held to account, and will want the Conservative Party to play a part in that.</p>
        
            <p>The big picture is this: within hours, the UKK will soon have its fourth prime minister in under two years.</p>
        
            <p>The whirlwind of British politics continues.</p>
        
            <p>We live in a world of unprecedented voter volatility - more people in more places are more willing to change their minds more often and more quickly about politics than ever before.</p>
        
            <p>And it has happened again.</p>
