        <h2>Review: Bird is a 'staggeringly brilliant blend of Ken Loach and a Grimm fairy tale'</h2>
        <p>
Writer-director Andrea Arnold is a one-off. She seems to be rooted in British urban realism - films like Fish Tank and this week's Bird.

            <p>Writer-director Andrea Arnold is a one-off. She seems to be rooted in British urban realism - films like Fish Tank and this week's Bird.</p>
        
            <p>But she also directs hit TV series like Big Little Lies, and surreal features like Cow - I quote - "a close-up portrait of the daily life of two cows." It's an hour and a half long.</p>
        
            <p>My favourite quote of Arnold's is: "I went to film school; you'd just never know it".</p>
        
            <p>My least favourite quote of hers is describing Bird - a staggeringly brilliant blend of Ken Loach and a Grimm fairy tale. "Don't call it magic realism," she warns. But you've got to call it something...</p>
        
            <p>The best I can do is tell you what happens.</p>
        
            <p>We meet Bailey, who's 12.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve going on 30 - she's certainly the most mature person in the film.</p>
        
            <p>She looks at things, mostly birds, through her cheap cellphone. Until her dad, Bug, barges in.</p>
        
            <p>Bug, a heavily tattooed Barry Keoghan, is a hopeless optimist, despite, well, despite everything.</p>
        
            <p>He's got great news for his daughter - Bailey has heard this all before.</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, she hops up on the back of Bug's scooter - no-one has a car or even a bike in Bird - to see what's on his mind.</p>
        
            <p>It won't be a job. Nobody in this film has a job. What's most likely is Bug's girlfriend Kayleigh's having another baby. I know, Kayleigh and Bailey.</p>
        
            <p>Kayleigh already has a two-year-old girl, while Bailey has a slightly older brother Hunter who lives with them, and three far younger siblings, who don't.</p>
        
            <p>But I've not told you Bug's news. He's bought Bailey a shiny purple outfit to wear as his and Kayleigh's bridesmaid. That's right, they're getting married.</p>
        
            <p>And before Bailey can ask. Bug tells her they'll pay for it with his new cash cow. Not a cow, of course, a gigantic cane toad. You lick it to get high. It's money for nothing.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey doesn't want to hear any more. She takes off to join Hunter and his equally delusional gang of friends who see themselves as a sort of Estuary Avengers, going around righting wrongs.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of a long night, Bailey ends up fast asleep in a field, being woken up by horses. And by a strangely-dressed European chap calling himself Bird.</p>
        
            <p>Which is where the story really starts. Now if you're not already an Andrea Arnold fan - unlike movie star Barry Keoghan who turned down a big pay-day on Gladiator 2 for the chance to work with her for a pittance.</p>
        
            <p>Anyway, if you're not already committed, you may be saying "This is where the story starts? What story? This sounds crazy."</p>

            <p>But there's method to Arnold's eccentricity - not least her attitude to script. Most film school graduates lay out their structures carefully, each scene leading to another, every element designed to support the plot.</p>
        
            <p>Arnold's approach is more like a jigsaw. She starts with an attractive piece, then wonders what fits with it - what happens before, what happens later.</p>
        
            <p>She was initially fascinated by the character of Bird who seemed to land in Bailey's world from out of nowhere.</p>
        
            <p>But it soon became clear it was entirely Bailey's story - or at least the story from Bailey's point of view. It's about her reconciling with her family, and in some cases saving them. Who's the real Avenger here?</p>
        
            <p>But it's also about living her life. If Arnold's films are like anyone's it might be Sean Baker of Anora fame. There's no judgement, there's just getting on with it.</p>
        
            <p>And if the solution may be a little unexpected magic - then these are people who deserve a bit of that.</p>
        
            <p>Don't worry, I'm not calling it anything. I'm just going to say it's one of the top two or three films I've seen in an already above-average movie year.</p>
        
            <p>I wonder if that's the key to saving the industry - a string of really good movies. It's an old trick but it might just work.</p>
