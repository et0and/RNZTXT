        <h2>What’s the answer? All Blacks can’t get it going when it counts</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - Another loss sees the All Blacks slump to three defeats in their last four games, Jamie Wall tries to understand why.
</p>
        
            <p>If you're starting an analysis by comparing the All Blacks to their 1949 counterparts, you're already in trouble. That was the last time they lost four consecutive tests to the Springboks, or any opposition team, for that matter. It's regarded as the darkest season in All Black history, but over the last two seasons this side has managed to lose to their greatest rivals in a variety of ways.</p>
        
            <p>The latest was Sunday morning's 18-12 overture at DHL Stadium in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>Last August, the Springboks simply blew them off the park at Twickenham. Then they met again in the World Cup final. Last weekend it was at Ellis Park, and now the All Blacks have lost in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>But how? Aside from the Twickenham disaster, all of those tests fell through their grasp. This is the latest one, and can unfortunately be put down to goal kicking that couldn't deliver when it mattered as well as something that's becoming a common theme because here we are again talking about a poor back end of the game.</p>

            <p>That's now four tests in a row where the All Blacks have failed to score points in the last 20 minutes. At least this time around they put themselves in a position to, however Damian McKenzie shanked on shot at goal and clanked the other off the post.</p>
        
            <p>The rebound fell for a hard charging Jordie Barrett and the All Blacks looked destined to score as they now had the ball on the Springbok five metre line. Despite having a big overlap on the right, the ball went left, then backwards, then backwards again before being turned over.</p>
        
            <p>That really summed up both the All Black attack and option taking throughout the game. They only entered the Springboks' 22 a handful of times and didn't ever really threaten the try line particularly all that hard. Meanwhile, the Springboks were the same but had Siya Kolisi and Malcolm Marx crash over at crucial points, as well as Eben Etzebeth denied by the TMO.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, this was the first time since the 16-9 loss to Ireland in 2018 that the All Blacks have failed to score a try in a test.</p>
        
            <p>Bright sides? Wallace Sititi was so impressive the South African media were quickly trying to find out as much about him as possible post-game, because they'd never really seen him play. The second generation star did what he'd been picked to do: punch holes in the defence.</p>

            <p>Codie Taylor was again immense, staying on the park for all but an HIA. Tupou Vaa'i's awareness is reaping some key penalties for the All Blacks, while Anton Lienert-Brown looked hungry when he was subbed on.</p>
        
            <p>But was the movement of TJ Perenara and Beauden Barrett to the bench a success? Given that once again the drying up of points happened under their watch, you'd have to say no. They were simply like for like replacements of the players they replaced, without adding much different. Sevu Reece and Mark Tele'a played so poorly they fall into the liability category instead of just jersey fillers, while Tyrel Lomax giving away a penalty for an obstruction on Cheslin Kolbe is something that would make a high school coach tear their hair out.</p>
        
            <p>But at least they got on the field. Asafo Aumua on saw a brief glimpse of action due to Taylor's HIA, Fletcher Newell saw only the final four minutes and Sam Darry didn't get on at all. You have to wonder about the perceived drop-off in quality if those players aren't even used, especially since on the other side Rassie Erasmus has been able to put together almost two entire squads to beat the All Blacks - never mind just the bench.</p>

            <p>Now we're starting to get into some uncharted territory for Robertson. He's never had to deal with this kind of scrutiny after a run of losses because he never really had a run of losses as Crusaders coach. Test rugby is a different beast altogether, which Robertson knew full well, but how he can make the necessary adjustments remains to be seen.</p>
        
            <p>Because now, the inevitable narrative is to start comparing the current coaching regime to the last one. Say what you will about Ian Foster, but the fact is his All Black side won the Rugby Championship every year he was in charge and barely ever had trouble scoring points. A lot of the players haven't changed either and we're not seeing the best of them.</p>
        
            <p>These are things Robertson is going to have to address soon, but there is one silver lining: for all the All Blacks' issues, at least they're not the Wallabies right now.</p>
