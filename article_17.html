        <h2>Review: Does the latest Hellboy reboot succeed?</h2>
        <p>
A lower budget adaptation of Hellboy has hit theatres but does it reach the lofty heights of the early 2000s films? Watch RNZ visual journalist Sam Rillstone's…
</p>
        
            <p>By Samuel Rillstone</p>
        
            <p>Directed by Brian Taylor and based on the 2008 comic story of the same name, Hellboy: The Crooked Man follows the titular Hellboy (Jack Kesy) as he is thrust into the Appalachian Mountains with his B.P.R.D. colleague Jo (Adeline Rudolph).</p>
        
            <p>There they discover a coven of witches are terrorising the nearby locals at the behest of a supernatural entity known as The Crooked Man.</p>
        
            <p>I've always been a big fan of Hellboy from the Guillermo del Toro movies that came out when I was a kid. The lore and look of the character always appealed to me a lot so when I heard there was going to be a new Hellboy (following a failed reboot in 2019), I was cautiously excited.</p>
        
            <p>And I'm happy to say I had a lot of fun with this! It's got a much different feel to the del Toro films and the 2019 film, which felt more big picture and dealing with the end of the world.</p>
        
            <p>This feels like a random little Hellboy story in an ongoing comic run. You get thrown right in the middle of an adventure and are drip-fed info. And it's very self-contained. By the end, you feel like a sequel would be like another episode in a TV show, with Hellboy fighting another monster of the week.</p>

            <p>Kesy as the titular demon is pretty good. He has a nice gruffness to him, an interesting physicality and stands out from the previous iterations enough. I really liked how he has these little sayings and a vocabulary that's fun and playful. It shows heaps of personality for the character and is probably indicative of the fact Hellboy creator Mike Mignola had a hand in writing the script.</p>
        
            <p>Adeline Rudolph as Jo, an original character not from the comics, is a good addition. Again, you get drip-fed background info about her which informs her arc across the movie which was satisfying if a tiny bit predictable.</p>
        
            <p>Jefferson White plays Tom, one of the locals who has a history with the Crooked Man. He's an interesting character with an intensity that is played well by White and stands out against the other characters.</p>
        
            <p>This core trio guides the story and was a really fun group. They feel like a Dungeons and Dragons party investigating a mystery in a spooky little town. Tom is the ranger/warlock, Jo is a wizard and Hellboy is a barbarian.</p>

            <p>It definitely leans more spooky and scary than previous Hellboy adaptations so it may not be for everyone. But I enjoyed the macabre, almost Lovecraftian take. The jump scares got old for me personally; they're just a bit cheap.</p>
        
            <p>On a budget of US$20 million, I reckon they did pretty well. It feels pulpy and scrappy. Like a raggedy paperback comic that's been loved and worn.</p>
        
            <p>And everything feels tangible. Don't get me wrong, there's definitely some ropey CGI but the locations and sets feel tactile. Maybe it's just because of a lot of exposure to greenscreen-heavy films, but the human eye knows. It feels like there's lots of texture on screen.</p>
        
            <p>Though it was a bit hard to find a screening since it only got a limited release and is already on streaming overseas, if you get a chance to see it on a big screen I recommend you do for sure. Absolutely worth the price of admission.</p>
