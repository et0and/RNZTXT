            <p>Collectively, they discuss the Australiasian premiere of the Northern Irish theatre show, In the Name of the Son - The Gerry Conlon Story at Q Theatre. The fast-paced, autobiographical one-man show, with at least 30 characters, is based on the life of Gerry Conlon who was wrongly convicted of being an IRA bomber. He spent 15 years in prison before being released. A Hollywood film In the Name of the Father was made about the wrongful conviction, with Conlon played by Daniel Day Lewis. </p>
        
            <p>The theatre show focuses more on the aftermath of prison and the fallout from unresolved trauma, familial guilt, the torture and treatment while in prison which led to a period of alcohol and drugs for Conlon, before he died aged 60 from cancer. </p>
        
            <p>In the Name of the Son: The Gerry Conlon Story will be at Q Theatre’s Rangatira until 17 March.</p>
