"Is it normal that at the end of my lunch, at the last mouthful, I feel a little bit sad that it's over for the day?" - Jesse Mulligan.

            <p>The classic lunch break is no longer what it was with a change in office culture, cafe closures and price increases eating into the precious midday break.</p>
        
            <p>Would you call fried chicken and chips at 10am 'lunch'?</p>
        
            <p>"I try and keep as regular a schedule as I can, but that will translate a bit weirdly when I'm on shift work," says reporter Finn Blackwell, who's often found in RNZ's break room well before noon, feasting on anything from a pastry to chicken and chips.</p>
        
            <p>"I might be having my lunch on an early shift at 10 in the morning, or I might be having my lunch on a late shift at 6pm, and that can raise some odd looks."</p>
        
            <p>Today on The Detail, we look at how lunch culture has changed, and why a good lunch is less about what and when you eat, than how you eat it.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Gray, a chef and food writer who runs a website called Destitute Gourmet, which is dedicated to helping people eat well on a budget, says much of the importance of a lunch break is the break - but for many, that has got harder.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important in terms of workplace culture," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in the last few years as the work from home or hybrid working has really become the norm, it's been much harder for workplaces to create a workplace culture and interaction ... having a break is really important."</p>
        
            <p>Gray encourages people who work in an office with a break room to use it.</p>
        
            <p>"There's interactions that happen, there's conversations that happen around that space that isn't necessarily about work, it's about your life," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a sense that you engage with people over what they've brought for lunch... people engage over food in ways that they simply don't over other things."</p>
        
            <p>But the desk lunch has become the norm for many. Jesse Mulligan, who hosts RNZ's Afternoons show, eats at his desk, a sandwich in one hand, editing audio with the other.</p>
        
            <p>That isn't a reflection of how he feels about the meal though - he keeps a salt shaker and a bottle of chili oil on his desk, just in case he has a bland lunch that needs some help.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm obsessed with lunch. From the moment I get to work in the morning all I do is think about lunch and look at the clock to decide when I can eat it, and I don't know if this is normal or not but I asked my co-workers the other day, 'is it normal that at the end of my lunch, at the last mouthful, I feel a little bit sad that it's over for the day?'" he says.</p>
        
            <p>Mulligan also has guidelines on the appropriate time to eat lunch.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think you can eat lunch before 11.45am, but anytime that big hand starts approaching the top of the clock I think you're in," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"But it does feel like a personal failure if I don't make it right through til noon."</p>
