            <p>Jordan Popata and Kaahu Birdling are supervisors at Thomas Brothers Orchard in Riwaka.</p>
        
            <p>The 150-hectare orchard has been in operation for over 100 years and grows apples, cherries and kiwifruit.</p>
        
            <p>"During harvest, I'll have a team of about 20 Vanuatuan boys and they'll be picking away on ladders. They're very good workers, so it makes my job a lot easier," Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas Brothers employs about 70 workers through the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme. This season the majority are from Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>Kaahu started working in orchards at 16 and has never looked back. She's been at Thomas Brothers for about three years.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as they saw that I was keen they got me into higher level jobs and just constantly pushed me into things I didn't think I'd be capable of doing... and from that, it's opened up so many different doors," she says.</p>
        
            <p>She's embracing every opportunity to learn about leadership and orchard management.</p>
        
            <p>"We recently did a first aid course and we've got another leadership course coming up this Friday."</p>
        
            <p>"Part of it is learning how to manage my job better and how to manage people better. It's just basically working on yourself to make the crew work better," she says.</p>
        
            <p>The women, who were finalists in last years Nelson Young Grower of the Year competition, believe the horticultural industry has heaps to offer in terms of career opportunities for young people.</p>
        
            <p>"There's so many different jobs that are available. It's not just picking and packing. Just show people that you're keen and you'll be surprised at how far you can go," Kaahu suggests.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan says the first step is to go and talk to someone at your local orchard.</p>
        
            <p>"Family businesses are very welcoming and non-judgemental. You could have a pretty rough past and they'd still welcome you like anybody else. So don't be afraid jump into it."</p>
