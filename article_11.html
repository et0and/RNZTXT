        <h2>How to have a happy vegan Christmas</h2>
        <p>
Most people will have some form of traditional Christmas dinner in mind; often Christmas meats and Christmas cake or pudding, but what do you make when vegan and gluten-free guests RSVP?

            <p>Most people will have some form of traditional Christmas dinner in mind; often Christmas meats and Christmas cake or pudding, but what do you make when vegan and gluten-free guests RSVP?</p>
        
            <p>Alby Hailes, a food writer, doctor and 2021 winner of The Great Kiwi Bake Off, says catering to different diets, whether that's for allergy reasons or personal preferences, is all part of life now.</p>
        
            <p>"[But] Christmas is a time where everyone should be able to enjoy themselves and everyone should be able to enjoy whatever kai you're putting on the table.</p>
        
            <p>"When you think of Christmas, you often think of a meat-based centrepiece, but a lot of what I try to do with my cooking recipes is placing vegetables at the centre of the table and that they can be just as much a showstopper as that leg of roast lamb or that turkey that you've been roasting."</p>
        
            <p>Hailes recommends his Showstopper Cauli with Speedy Satay and Hazelnut Dukkah as a vegan and gluten-free centrepiece.</p>
        
            <p>When placed in the centre of the table, "it almost looks like this alien-like creature as the leaves of the cauliflower unfurl," Hailes says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's perfect as a centrepiece because you can then just dig in with a spoon. Everyone just takes some of the cauliflower. I think it's just as delicious and it's probably easier than having something meat-based on the table."</p>
        
            <p>Sides are also essential, Hailes says, especially ones that incorporate peak summer produce. He says his Grilled Sweetcorn and Nectarine Salad with Miso Dressing is an ideal dish for a busy kitchen because it can be done on the stovetop or the barbecue.</p>
        
            <p>"Essentially, you grill some nectarines and some whole sweet corn cobs."</p>
        
            <p>"Then you add in some herbs and this delicious miso dressing, which gives it that kind of umami-ness which is that really nice savoury quality, which balances with the sweetness of the corn and the nectarines."</p>
        
            <p>He says while some people might be unsure about fruit in salad, he thinks it's a nice counterpoint to some of the richer food often present at a Christmas feast.</p>
        
            <p>Hailes says for many people dessert is the trickiest part to make vegan and gluten-free as the dishes often have flour, eggs or butter.</p>
        
            <p>He says his take on the classic Eton Mess is a great alternative to the classic Kiwi pavlova and trifle.</p>
        
            <p>"We have these beautiful strawberries over Christmas, so it's great to utilise them and something floral like elderflower, as well as the herbiness of the basil compliments it really nicely.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] perfect for someone who's both vegan and gluten-free or anyone. It doesn't even have to be that that's your dietary preference, it's delicious anyway."</p>
        
            <p>Hailes says it's smart to do as much prep in the kitchen the day before, giving you more time to celebrate with friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>He's lucky to come from a family of excellent cooks, who all share the load. This year, however, he might be off the hook.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually having Christmas with my partner's family for the first time. So, I'm not sure. I think I might still do a bit of the cooking.</p>
        
            <p>"I think as I've grown more into my own identity as a cook and gotten more into cooking I think now there's a part of me that that really enjoys that process of being able to make and share kai for my whƒÅnau and so these days I do often take up the mantle of preparing quite a few dishes for the family Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>That includes their own special dish.</p>
        
            <p>"In my family, we actually have this traditional dessert called a turkey pudding, which sounds horrific, but I promise there are no turkeys involved in the making of it. It was my grandma's recipe. She's now passed away and it's a kind of chocolate mousse dome covered in slices of raspberry Swiss roll. And it's pretty special for our family. So I'll probably be making that one this year in her memory."</p>
