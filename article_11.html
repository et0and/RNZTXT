            <p>Imagine being able to remember every single day of your life, all the way back to when you were a newborn.</p>
        
            <p>Australian woman Rebecca Sharrock is one of only 60 people in the world with a highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM), also known as hyperthymesia.</p>
        
            <p>Sharrock can recite the entirety of the Harry Potter books, remember every school lesson she had, and recall what she was doing on any given date.</p>
        
            <p>She told Sunday Morning she was diagnosed with autism at 15 and obsessive-compulsive disorder at 16, but did not realise she had HSAM for another five years.</p>
        
            <p>"I did know that I could remember the vast majority of my past experiences," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just put that down to my obsessive-compulsive disorder, how I just can't let go of certain feelings or thoughts and just can't drop things."</p>
        
            <p>On 23 January 2011 - a Sunday morning - her parents called her into the living room of their home to watch a 60 Minutes segment about people with HSAM, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I turned to my parents and said, 'Why are they calling this amazing? Isn't that normal?'"</p>
        
            <p>That was when they told her they suspected she had HSAM, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Sharrock was diagnosed after undergoing Skype tests with American researchers and flying to California for a brain scan.</p>
        
            <p>Nowadays, she participates in ongoing studies at the University of Brisbane and is in therapy to help her cope with her condition.</p>
        
            <p>Filing memories into mental folders helped her to make sense of them, she said.</p>
        
            <p>For example, she first heard about the Virginia Tech massacre on 16 April 2007, the Boston bombing on 16 April 2013, and the Notre Dame fire on 16 April 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though they're separate memories they do subconsciously link together."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the folders, her mind was "still very chaotic and very cluttered and very busy all or most of the time", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"That does give me many headaches during the day, it does give me a lot of anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm trying to fall asleep at night I do get distracted by all of these flashbacks and all of these recollections that just involuntarily flash through my mind."</p>
        
            <p>Therapy was helping her to think of her condition as "a gift, not a curse", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Sharrock said her very first memory was of being a newborn in hospital. She remembered a cotton blanket and a tag being clipped to her ankle.</p>
        
            <p>She also remembered every dream she had ever had.</p>
        
            <p>While therapy had helped, she could still "get lost in a memory" and lose track of the present moment because the sensation was so intense, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"For an hour or a few hours my mind's just stuck in that past event or past experience. Those experiences are very irritating ... they're a very annoying occurrence."</p>
