            <p>South African New Zealander Tuseka Njoko (artist name Tusekah) grew up in Durban where she remembers music and rhythm soundtracking life on every block in the city.</p>
        
            <p>But then her family moved to Greymouth.</p>
        
            <p>“I ended up losing Zulu which is my language,” Tusekah told Music 101’s Maggie Tweedie.</p>
        
            <p>Her family moved back to South Africa before moving again and settling in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Whilst back in South Africa, Tuseka picked up the Zulu language again and embraced what she thinks makes South Africa so special. </p>
        
            <p>There are so many different ethnicities, she said, plus an appreciation for music and rhythm.   </p>
        
            <p>“It’s just a melting pot of vibrancy and ethnicity.”</p>
        
            <p>Tusekah said music was always playing in her family home which influenced her early sonic explorations.   </p>
        
            <p>“From the moment I could pretty much understand words I was appreciating music.”</p>
        
            <p>“A couple of months ago actually I found a book from when I was a child and it had lyrics written in it.”</p>

            <p>She has plenty of influences but is unsure how to label her own sound. </p>
        
            <p>“People say I have a soulful voice – so maybe I fit into neo-soul.”</p>
        
            <p>Her latest single I’ve Changed reflects the certainty she feels having grown older and knowing music is a realistic path to take.</p>
        
            <p>“I know that I want to do this and I’m the one putting in the effort to do it.”</p>
        
            <p>Tusekah’s I’ve Changed New Zealand tour is underway with remaining dates in Mapua, Onekaka and Dunedin.</p>
