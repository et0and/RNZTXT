        <h2> Celebrity Treasure Island winner's secret is out of the bag</h2>
        <p>
JP Foliaki gathered his friends and whānau together for a finale viewing party. "It's like a surreal feeling ... reliving it through watching the episode last night."
</p>
        
            <p>JP Foliaki has been keeping a secret since March.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday night, the South Auckland-based performer gathered his friends and whānau together at a venue in Kingsland for a viewing party of the Celebrity Treasure Island (CTI) finale. It was also a belated 30th birthday party bash, he said.</p>
        
            <p>His new mates and CTI '24 alumni were there, including comedian and fourth placed Bubbah, New Zealand actress Gaby Solomona, boxing champ Mea Motu (who has recovered from an island injury that sent the strong contender home prematurely) and actor Millen Baird.</p>

            <p>"It's like a surreal feeling ... reliving it through watching the episode last night," Foliaki told RNZ on Thursday morning. It was a chance to finally reveal to friends and family that he was the one to finally dig up the treasure and bag $100,000 for his charity - Child Fund Water Run, a charity that provides clean water to children across the Pacific. It was a record-long dig for treasure going into the night, against fellow finalists former All Black Christian Cullen and Boy actor James Rolleston.</p>

            <p>"They [my friends and family] kind of were suspicious with us watching the final, but they still weren't sure. So to be able to share that moment with them. It was incredible."</p>
        
            <p>The proud Tongan New Zealander was surrounded by the people who he drew inspiration from when it all felt too tough to go on during the reality TV show, which saw him thrust together with a bunch of mostly random famous faces for three weeks in basic huts on the Coromandel coast.</p>
        
            <p>He also drew a lot of motivation from his faith, his community and the power of song to get him through the gruelling challenges, strategic conversations and endless meals of rice and beans.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're in a position where you have nothing to pull on, you know when you can't just rely on the strength that you have yourself, you really have to go to a place where you're able to find some sort of strength," Foliaki said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a Tongan ... song and hymns and just our culture is such a huge part of that."</p>

Foliaki drew on his community, his faith and song over his experience on CTI.

            <p>One of the last scenes we see of Foliaki on Celebrity Treausure Island, is of him exhausted and relieved, dropping to his knees breaking into the Tongan hymn, Teu hiki a hoku le'o.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a big advocate for that, you know, for our culture and everything that comes with it for being a source of strength.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just the reminder that one: it's not just about you, and that two: there's like a whole community backing you. And then, you know, if you have your faith, then you can pull yourself through anything."</p>
        
            <p>Foliaki was picked to go on the show following his lead role of Maka in the comedy film Red, White and Brass. Before that he had worked in threatre, starred on the singing reality show Popstars and popped up on multiple TV shows, ads and music videos.</p>
        
            <p>While he's known about his CTI win since March, Foliaki has been working hard on his other creative pursuits.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm working on some new music that should be coming up in the next month or so," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm working on an EP, music was actually the first thing that kind of got me into the creative arts space and entertainment .. so I'm really trying to get that off the ground though. I can't wait for everyone else to see that."</p>
