Who was it that dropped a stack of racy romantic novels into random mailboxes in a Wellington harbourside suburb? Local painter Richard Dalziel has owned up.
</p>
        
            <p>A Lower Hutt man claims he is the one who has been randomly delivering racy fiction to mailboxes in the harbourside community of Eastbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Titles such as Shirlee Busbee's Midnight Masquerade and Barbara Benedict's Lovestorm had been appearing in mailboxes, leaving the community all a flutter over who was behind the spicy deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>Richard Dalziel, 59, says he'd been working to clear out a space in the home of a family friend and had come across "three to four apple boxes" worth of the colourfully titled books.</p>
        
            <p>He said he often fished in the bays around Eastbourne and had been having fun popping the books into people's mailboxes "for a joke".</p>
        
            <p>
Midnight Masquerade was found in an Eastbourne letterbox last week, while Lovestorm was delivered to Dawn Brannigan's Eastbourne home.

            <p>"I'm not dropping them off thinking 'they might want a bit of something on the side' or anything like that.</p>
        
            <p>"No, it's random and as far away from my house as I can get," Dalziel said.</p>
        
            <p>"People have been guessing 'is he a spoon lover, is he handsome?' this and that. The reality is that it was a prank and I've done it before and nobody said anything," Dalziel said.</p>
        
            <p>Dalziel - a painter and table tennis enthusiast - said he grew up in the area and had recently returned.</p>
        
            <p>He said he enjoyed hearing people in the community discussing who was behind the books.</p>
        
            <p>"Guys were in the coffee shop saying have you seen this about the guy putting these books in [mailboxes] and I said 'that's me!'. I laughed, I went 'Oh my god I've made the news'," Dalziel said.</p>
        
            <p>Dalziel said it took about two or three days to distribute the books around the community.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had no plans on dropping off any more but he might consider popping a few flyers into letterboxes for an informal table tennis league he was hoping to set up.</p>
