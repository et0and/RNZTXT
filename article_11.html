            <p>A 560-metre plain grey seawall has been transformed into the longest mural in the South Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>The seawall, which sits next to Rarotonga's airstrip, features legends and animals from each of the 15 islands that make up the Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>It took 20 months to be completed, well exceeding the expected timeframe of a few months.</p>

            <p>Travelling artist Gonzalo Aldana from Mexico, who is the main painter and mural architect, said he is glad to finally have it finished.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel more relaxed now, it was a really challenging project and it was a very long journey," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel definitely very pleased to see the project totally complete."</p>

            <p>Aldana said despite the challenges - like the weather which delayed the project - he would do it again.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just a mural, it's not just to beautify the concrete and that's it, it's more about all the content, the background and the meaning of this great project."</p>
        
            <p>Aldana had to undergo research into each island.</p>
        
            <p>"I was learning a lot about the culture through the investigation… not everything is online, sometimes it was more about opinions of each island.</p>
        
            <p>"It was nice to discover how beautiful the culture of the Cook Islands is."</p>
        
            <p>The work was sponsored by ocean charity Seacology to showcase Marae Moana, the name of the multi-use marine park which extends over the nation's entire exclusive economic zone, covering roughly the area of Mexico.</p>

            <p>It was created in 2017 with the purpose of protecting the ocean. Since it was implemented, each of the 15 islands is protected by a 50 nautical mile marine protected area that prohibits large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Iro, who spearheaded Marae Moana, said he could not think of a better way to display the nation's ocean.</p>
        
            <p>"The 15 islands, a little bit of our history, talk about our endemic species and obviously our ocean and what unites us as people," Iro said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just an amazing project and we're getting so many people commenting every time you post online."</p>
        
            <p>Aldana got to talk through the mural with the Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown during its official opening last month.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredible how through art we can express a lot of things, we can transform the public spaces, but also we can reach the interest of people that we never thought," Aldana said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really cool to meet the Prime Minister, the leader of this nation."</p>
