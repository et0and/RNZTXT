        <h2>At The Movies: Jackie Stewart</h2>

            <p>Formula 1 racing is undoubtedly exciting, but not particularly dramatic.</p>
        
            <p>There are people driving at incredible speeds, often inches away from each other, for endless hours. There’s the constant threat of sudden death at every bend in the road.   </p>
        
            <p>But it’s also incredibly repetitive and exhausting. It takes a special skill to turn that into a gripping movie.</p>

            <p>Which is what the documentary Senna was, Asif Kapadia’s brilliant account of Brazilian racing driver Ayrton Senna and his less volatile nemesis Alain Prost.  </p>
        
            <p>Senna won the World Championship three times. But so did another driver, Jackie Stewart, the subject of a documentary of the same name.</p>
        
            <p>But unlike Senna, Jackie Stewart falls down in the story department. </p>
        
            <p>I suspect director Patrick Mark was so smitten by the famous Flying Scot he didn’t realise he needed one until it was too late.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Jackie is one of the best-loved people in motor sports, from his early successes in the mid Sixties to now, where he’s regularly mobbed by autograph-hunters at the world’s top Formula 1 events.</p>
        
            <p>The documentary opens on a picturesque village in Scotland where Stewart grew up. He freely admits he didn’t exactly bowl over his teachers at school. </p>
        
            <p>In fact, he was regularly bottom of the class – though back then the concept of learning disabilities was pretty much unknown. They just called him “stupid”, which he clearly wasn’t.</p>
        
            <p>He worked at the family garage, then one day he was given his big break - a trial run at a local car race.  </p>
        
            <p>And then – it really did seem to happen this quickly – he was on the Formula 1 circuit, he was winning regularly, he shortly became one of the most famous people in the country.</p>
        
            <p>It didn’t hurt that this was at the height of the Swinging ‘60s.  </p>
        
            <p>Where his racing rivals Stirling Moss and Graham Hill were establishment types, hanging out with the likes of Princess Margaret, the long-haired Stewart was clearly part of the Mod generation.</p>
        
            <p>Adding to his glamour – as if he needed to – was his none-more-60s wife Helen. </p>
        
            <p>She looked like the girlfriend of every pop star of the time – long, straight blonde hair, a bit posh, staggeringly beautiful and fiercely loyal to Stewart.</p>
        
            <p>So if this was how Stewart started out – and all this happens in the first ten minutes of the film Jackie Stewart – then where’s the drama?</p>
        
            <p>The short answer is “not in this film”.  Add to this the fact that Stewart was, and is, universally loved in a sport with more than its fair share of egomaniacs, and you can see the dramatic possibilities are cut down considerably.</p>
        
            <p>The one dramatic thing that happened all too often was sudden death. </p>
        
            <p>Back in the bad old days of Formula 1, a crash was often fatal.  </p>
        
            <p>Stewart seems remarkably matter of fact about that threat – though he also went to far more trouble to reduce risks than many of his rivals.  But he admitted it was his family who suffered.</p>
        
            <p>The one thing that distinguishes Stewart’s story from that of Ayrton Senna of course is he didn’t die.</p>
        
            <p>He survived, where most of his colleagues didn’t. There’s no-one left who went through what he did.  So that leaves the film scrabbling for a dramatic hook.</p>
        
            <p>I won’t spoil it by revealing Stewart’s secret, other than to say it’s a bit of an anticlimax.  </p>
        
            <p>I wish I could say that one of Britain’s greatest sporting figures got the film he deserved.  One for fans of Formula 1, rather than for fans of a good story well told, I’m afraid.</p>
