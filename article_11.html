Fresh from a year of delivering “a half-hour of power” at international music festivals, indie rock band The Beths spent the summer in Auckland working on their next album.

            <p>They're the New Zealand rock band who've made Obama's summer playlist, played Coachella and next week will rock the main stage at WOMAD Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>The Beths' lead vocalist Liz Stokes and guitarist John Pierce chat to Saturday Morning about delivering "a half-hour of power" at international music festivals, their "very fun but very nerve-wracking" Coachella experience and an exciting year ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The Beths really enjoy touring around, Stokes said, which lately had been mostly to play short sets at international music festivals.</p>
        
            <p>"You get slick pretty quickly because you're thrown into a pretty high-pressure situation.</p>
        
            <p>"We try to do 'a half-hour of power' and just play the most hard-hitting, compelling version of our setlist."</p>
        
            <p>After playing the same songs so many times, it's nice to be able to "stretch out a little bit" during the performance, Stokes said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's this deep satisfaction that comes from doing something over and over again and getting better at it marginally… in a sports way or like a skill, craft way.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like an Olympic sport or something at times where you're just trying to eke out that last centimetre of your toe on the line or something like that," Pierce added.</p>

            <p>This past summer The Beths had been in a "windowless studio" mixing their next album, which was due out later in the year and would be accompanied by "lots of exciting announcements", Pierce promised.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going hard this year."</p>
        
            <p>To Stokes, the songs she wrote for the upcoming album - which together represent "a collage of her last couple of years" - sounded "a lot less optimistic" than previous Beths' records.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if it's a reflection of the general feeling of coming out of COVID. There was kind of an optimism and hm… I don't know if it's there anymore. But anxiety is on fleek."</p>

            <p>Although their music has an edge, Stokes says the front row at a Beths show is usually full of "really engaged and happy faces".</p>
        
            <p>She does have a message for the inevitable "yawning guy", though - "Just don't yawn if you're in the front row. Turn around."</p>
        
            <p>Now an old hand at festival-going, Stokes' hack for legs sore from standing is taking ibuprofen around 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>Her biggest tip for having a good time is don't be afraid to peel off from your mates to make sure you see the artists you like.</p>
        
            <p>When you're interested in watching a certain artist but your friends are more into chatting you've simply got to break away from them, Stokes says.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll regret it if you're just standing at the back and like 'I could be having a much better time'.</p>
        
            <p>"Go right to the front and get amongst the people who are really on the same level as you for that particular artist, and then meet up again afterwards."</p>

            <p>The Beths - whose name comes from Beth, a shortening of Stokes' full name 'Elizabeth' - got together when the bandmates were all studying jazz at Auckland University in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven years later, as they release their sixth album, Pierce's advice to aspiring musicians is to keep churning out the songs.</p>
        
            <p>"The only way to get better at something is to do it a lot so just commit to writing. If you write 20 songs this year I guarantee you one of those songs at least will be good."</p>
        
            <p>Last year The Beths recorded a prestigious Tiny Desk concert at NPR in New York.</p>
