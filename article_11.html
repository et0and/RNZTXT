            <p>Review - You needn't be a fan of Wicked to be clued into the discourse surrounding the long-awaited movie that's been several years in the making - waylaid first by Covid, then by the SAG strike.</p>
        
            <p>You may have heard through the rumour mill about the relationship that has since blossomed between Ariana Grande (who plays Glinda) and Ethan Slater (who plays Boq) while they were allegedly still married to their respective partners. Your feed might be inundated with press tour footage of Grande and her co-star Cynthia Erivo (who plays Elphaba aka The Wicked Witch of the West) crying on one another in every interview.</p>
        
            <p>Whatever your preconceived notions may be, the Wicked Part 1 movie is finally here - and what a breathtaking spectacle it is. Directed by Jon M. Chu of Crazy Rich Asians fame, it's a veritable visual feast of fantabulous sprawling sets, hand-planted rainbow-hued tulips, spellbinding special effects and majestic costuming.</p>

            <p>Somehow combining the old-timey nostalgia of the 1939 Wizard of Ozwith the technological capabilities of our current time, Wicked delivers the same sense of shock and wonder that the stage production does - but with the dial turned up to 11.</p>
        
            <p>The most spectacular sets and outfits would mean nothing, however, without the resonance of the deeply human story at its heart and, on this front, Wicked delivers. Opening with the purported death of the Wicked Witch at the hands of Dorothy, we're transported back in time as Glinda reflects on her friendship with Elphaba and how things came to be the way they are.</p>
        
            <p>Grande and Erivo's palpable chemistry with one another (evidenced by the crying) comes to the fore over the two hours 41 minutes run time. Their initial uncertain negotiation of one another, replete with poisonous barbs and pithy side quips, slowly but surely gives way to mutual respect before morphing into intense adoration.</p>
        
            <p>It's unclear at first if Grande's acting range extends further than wide-eyed, befuddled expressions, but she grows into the role as the movie unfolds. Leaning into the humorous dimensions of Glinda - by far the funniest character in the musical - her curly tresses are a character in themselves as Grande tosses them about, darts around lithely on twinkletoes, and throws amusing childlike tantrums when she doesn't get her way.</p>
        
            <p>Glinda's superb comedic timing and predilection for falsettos are on full display in fan favourite song 'Popular', a hilarious sequence of Grande at her best as she writhes and slithers across the floor orbiting Elphaba.</p>
        
            <p>As the tortured and misunderstood green-skinned Elphaba, Erivo's sombre seriousness and thoughtful introspection is the necessary foil to Grande's playful sense of entitlement.</p>
        
            <p>Capable of conveying a multitude of feelings with a mere flicker of her eyes or purse of her lips, Erivo plays Elphaba with an affecting vulnerability and an astute moral compass. It's a delight watching the character expand to fill every corner of themselves as they gain confidence and surety. Erivo's soaring voice first impresses in 'The Wizard and I', before it reaches untold heights in the climactic showstopper, 'Defying Gravity'.</p>
        
            <p>Jonathan Bailey can do no wrong as Fiyero, the himbo with surprising depth. Armed with a certain Rupert Everett-esque combination of flamboyance and bravado, Bailey lights up every scene he's in - most notably, his striking rendition of 'Dancing Through Life'.</p>
        
            <p>The immaculately choreographed sequence of Bailey and a supporting cast dodging and dancing around cogs of the Shiz University Library wheel is one of the film's highlights.</p>
        
            <p>
Jonathan Bailey did dancing and gymnastics as a child which, he told IndieWire, prepared him well for the role of Prince Fiyero.

            <p>By casting Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard of Oz, the film prioritises vibes over voices - and it mostly works.</p>
        
            <p>Writers Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox adopt many of the malapropisms and beats of the original script, but depart from it in a few key ways.</p>
        
            <p>The underlying story of the Animals of Oz losing their voice and being imprisoned is lent additional heft through a scene never before seen in the musical, where Doctor Dillamond confers with his fellow Animals about the predicament they're in. The distinguishable (and distinguished Peter Dinklage) is perfectly cast as the voice of the plaintive Dr Dillamond.</p>

Jeff Goldblum, pictured here with Michelle Yeoh, told InStyle he "might’ve been intimidated by [Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo], but they were so cordial and sweet".

            <p>Talking animals, a properly levitating witch and the irrepressible thrill of magic being visualised through special effects are an obvious boon that cinema has over theatre. But by homing in on the characters in a way theatre is unable to do, the emotional pay-offs of Wicked also feel heightened.</p>
        
            <p>And with cameos by Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth - the original iconic duo who played Elphaba and Glinda in the stage musical - it's clear the film is determined to pay homage to its storied history and fans.</p>
        
            <p>Could this film, the equivalent length of the entire musical including the intermission, have been shorter? Almost certainly. Will you be entertained throughout with nary a look at your watch? Undoubtedly.</p>
        
            <p>Wicked is showing in cinemas now.</p>
