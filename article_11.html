            <p>When Wellington journalist Sarah Catherall separated from her husband, she couldn't find a book with practical advice to help her family get through.</p>
        
            <p>Now, 15 years later, she and her ex are both happily re-partnered and their three daughters are thriving.</p>
        
            <p>To offer guidance and hope to others struggling through a separation, Catherall shares her own experiences and expert tips in the new book How To Break Up Well.</p>
        
            <p>The book is for men and women who are dealing with a break-up and want insights into how to navigate these tricky, often painful times, Catherall says.</p>
        
            <p>After her divorce, she was "a bit of a sad mum" but sought therapy as women are more inclined to do.</p>
        
            <p>Many "sad dads", on the other hand, seek to fill the void of a break-up by downloading with someone new from a dating app.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got your glass of wine and this guy's moaning about the ex. He should be doing that with a therapist."</p>
        
            <p>After Catherall's divorce, she also jumped into the seemingly exciting world of online dating before she was actually ready. </p>
        
            <p>"You've got to think are you emotionally ready to connect with someone on a dating app? You might have suffered the rejection of your husband or partner and then you have to deal with [ghosting]."</p>
        
            <p>In How To Break Up Well, the Australasian head of Bumble emphasises the importance of being open-minded on dating apps.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're looking for your 6'2" Aries with a holiday house in Queenstown and dark hair, you might not find him exactly." </p>
        
            <p>Now, instead of browsing dating apps, Catherall checks the diary-sharing app she and her ex use for family planning.</p>
        
            <p>She says it's helpful to think of co-parenting as a family business you're running together.</p>
        
            <p>"As one wonderful divorce coach I interviewed said, 'You're both co-pilots. You're flying the plane and you've got to land the plane safely. How are you best going to do that?'"</p>
        
            <p>As a separated parent, handing your kids over to your ex and accepting there will be part of their lives you won't ever get to see is often very difficult, Catherall says.</p>
        
            <p>Christmas is one of the hardest times of year for parents on their own, especially if - like her - you're used to it being a big, fun family day. </p>
        
            <p>On her first Christmas after separating from her ex, Catherall fought back tears driving home to Wellington after handing over the kids at the top of Remutaka Hill. </p>
        
            <p>"It's the most terrible feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Now, though, she feels very fortunate that things are amicable with her ex and their kids are doing well.</p>
        
            <p>"His new wife is lovely, and my kids have been raised by us and also parents have all contributed to their lives."</p>
        
            <p>During and after a separation, children need to know they're loved and supported by both parents, Catherall says, and also be protected as much as possible from conflict.</p>
        
            <p>She attributes her kids' current well-being to their parents' shared belief that children's interests should always be put first.</p>
        
            <p>"It breaks my heart when I see parents who embroil their kids in their own war, and it's not helpful."</p>
