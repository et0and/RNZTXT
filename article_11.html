        <h2>'Everyone just hates tampons' - six teens talk period products</h2>
        <p>
There has been a period product revolution in the last decade - but are NZ teens using them?

            <p>Tampons are dead - long live period underwear.</p>
        
            <p>That was the consensus from a focus group of six New Zealand teenagers recently held by RNZ. The teenagers, ranging from ages 13 to 19, chatted about their hesitancy to try menstrual cups and their desire to speak openly about their periods despite continued societal period shame.</p>
        
            <p>There has arguably been a revolution in period products in the last decade, with washable period underwear and menstrual cups hitting the market. The teens who joined our group have far more choices, especially reusable options, than their parents' generation.</p>

            <p>Tampons have been a staple period product since the 1960s and a cultural icon (think King Charles, Queen Camilla and Tampongate). But those days might be coming to an end, according to the teenagers and sales data from major New Zealand retailers.</p>
        
            <p>Of the six teens, only one said she regularly uses tampons and does so during her heavier days along with period undies. But even then, she uses tampons cautiously.</p>
        
            <p>Maia was referencing research earlier this year that found toxic metals such as lead and arsenic in some major tampon brands. She now only uses organic tampon brands such as Toms.</p>

            <p>But teens in the focus group haven't exactly adopted the new alternative: menstrual cups. These are reusable cups made from silicone that are inserted into the vagina and collect the blood. Menstrual cups can be used during sport and swimming. One menstrual cup holds as much blood as two or three regular tampons. Only one teen in the group said she regularly used one.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland 13-year-old Eleanor was the only one in the group who received period education at school before she got her first period. Tampons and pads were floated as the only options, even though period underwear and menstrual cups were being sold at mainstream supermarkets at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Five out of the six teenagers in the focus group said they regularly used period underwear, which features absorbent padding and a waterproof lining.</p>

            <p>Period underwear has been on the market for more than a decade. Manufacturers claim one pair can have the absorbency equal to three to five pads before being rinsed and thrown in the washing machine to fight another day.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about her preferred period product, 13-year-old Jane from Wellington said period underwear was easier to use and more sustainable.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the popularity of period underwear in the focus group, sales of period underwear have plateaued, according to Woolworths. A spokesperson cited the barrier of a higher initial cost of buying numerous period undies, which cost about $30 each. Multiple pairs might be needed to cover your full cycle.</p>
        
            <p>About 12 percent of year 9 to 13 New Zealand students have difficulty accessing period products due to cost, according to the Youth19 Survey. Almost 100,000 girls say that they miss school because they cannot always afford period products. Māori and Pasifika students are often the hardest hit when it comes to period poverty.</p>

            <p>Pads remain the highest-selling period product at Foodstuffs, the parent company of Pak'nSave and New World. Woolworths is seeing the highest sales growth for pads. Affordability is one reason, as is new technology that allows pads to be thinner and more absorbent, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.</p>
        
            <p>Endo Warriors Aotearoa is a Wellington-based organisation that does period education and supplies free period products. Often, teens don't understand how period undies work, but once they do, that's what they want to use - if they can afford them or get them for free.</p>
        
            <p>"When we give stuff out, period underwear is what teens always go for," Endo Warriors spokesperson Yessinia Sandoval said.</p>
        
            <p>And some parents were learning from their teens on how to use this new generation of period products.</p>
        
            <p>"My mum was like 'I'm going to get some period undies because they seem to be working for you. It seems to be the more sustainable option," Jane from Wellington said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cool but it is also embarrassing when we soak them in a bucket and our [period undies] get mixed up, which is pretty awkward."</p>
