            <p>People in the small farming community of Staveley in Canterbury are hoping their newly upgraded ice rink can stand up to global warming after locals pitched in to pay for a new refrigeration system.</p>
        
            <p>They've been sharpening up their ice skates and dusting down their curling brooms for another season of winter sports on the rink, which has been attracting skaters and curlers since 1951.</p>
        
            <p>It's hoped the upgrade will mean the community gets three full months out of the ice from now on.</p>
        
            <p>Rob Withers of the Staveley Hall Society, which manages the ice rink, says $1.4 million was raised for the refurb - half of that from local donors.</p>
        
            <p>"We had volunteers that did 4000 hours of community work for us too, and a lot of them were local farmers," Withers said.</p>

            <p>Ice skating has always been part of Withers' life. He was born and bred on a nearby farm.</p>
        
            <p>"'We were lucky as kids. My father was a skater and taught us to skate and, yeah, we just wanted to keep it going."</p>
        
            <p>The shady rink is surrounded by native bush and looks towards a snow-skiffed Mount Somers. In a shelter near the ice, a huge fire keeps people warm.</p>
        
            <p>Cooking marshmallows is an après-skate must for most of the younger skaters, and long wire spikes with wooden handles are provided.</p>

            <p>The rink is large enough to accommodate a proper game of hockey and it's proving popular with kids.</p>
        
            <p>"On a Monday afternoon after school, we've got 20 children getting coached for ice hockey, which is going to start next week."</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday and Thursday it hosts the Windwhistle Curling Club and on Friday it's a learn-to-curl night. The weekends are the busiest, though.</p>
        
            <p>People come from as far afield as Christchurch and Ashburton to don boots and get on the ice.</p>
        
            <p>When Country Life popped in, about 150 people were at the rink.</p>
        
            <p> A child falls over and gets up, smiling. It's the first time she's been on ice.</p>
        
            <p>An elderly man does elegant twirls nearby.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to cater for families and I think, just looking out there now, you can see people are very happy," Withers said.</p>
        
            <p>He organises special rink-nights for the local community, too.</p>
        
            <p>"We open the shed up for them to use the curling stones and ice skates and there's no charge. It's a payback for our community, who have put so much into this."</p>
