            <p>Steve Christian believes he was put on this earth to be an artist.</p>
        
            <p>It's what brings him the most joy - fulfilling the dream he has held since childhood of trying to make a living from his creations.</p>
        
            <p>But as Christian puts it "emptying my cup before I could fill it again."</p>
        
            <p>In a relationship where his passion wasn't supported, Christian waited until after his daughter had grown up and left home and then decided to put his dreams first.</p>
        
            <p>He set off on his own to make his art - losing everything along the way. Undeterred, Christian took to living on the street.</p>
        
            <p>Being homeless hasn't been without its scary moments, and he's been living in his car for years now.</p>
        
            <p>But he's happy.</p>
        
            <p>"Most people would say I was doing the worst thing I could possibly do, but it actually turned out to be the best thing."</p>
        
            <p>Christian can be found on the streets of Mount Maunganui selling his art, sharing his talent with an appreciative audience.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people respect me for what I'm doing, most homeless people are just sitting on the ground with a handout. But they see me trying to earn a living, trying to do something about my situation."</p>
        
            <p>Christian will continue to see his art and follow his dream of 'being discovered' and becoming someone who can earn a genuine living from his art. Life on the street isn't easy, but Steve Christian would rather live a life that is true to himself than a comfortable one where he can't express himself.</p>
