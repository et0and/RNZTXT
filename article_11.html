            <p>Eric Fa'anoi has gone from helping farmers protect the environment to being a farmer himself. </p>
        
            <p>A visit to his ancestral village in Samoa also helped this young man from Porirua unearth his interest in agriculture.</p>
        
            <p>Until fairly recently he was an advisor and researcher with Horizons Regional Council, helping farmers plant their waterways and protect native fish.</p>
        
            <p>Now you can find him in the pit of a herringbone dairy shed, milking twice a day, working for contract milker Matthew O'Connell in Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>He recently won Taranaki Dairy Trainee of the Year in the New Zealand Dairy Awards and spoke to Country Life.</p>
