            <p>Kathmandu Coast to Coast competitor Ian Walsh didn't let a high-speed collision with a traffic light ruin his determination to finish the race - on a borrowed, folding bike - last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The 58-year-old was 5 kilometres into the 55km cycling stage of the male veteran two-person team category, when one moment of not paying attention cost him.</p>
        
            <p>"We were doing about 38 kilometers an hour and suddenly, there was a road cone in front of me, because I drifted a bit too much to the left, and I flicked the bike to avoid that and collided with a traffic light temporary tower, so that went flying, I went flying," Walsh told Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>"In a split second, I thought the next thing I'm going to see is the inside of an ambulance, so I was pretty happy when I [was] all good [enough to] pick myself up."</p>
        
            <p>"There were a lot of spectators there because it was at the Kumara Racecourse, where we camped the night before, and I was pretty embarrassed and ashamed of my efforts. So I had my head down and I was just trying to get back on my bike and get cracking again, but the seat handle bars were all twisted around and luckily a guy, Vince, came over and straightened my bike up for me and then I got away."</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't long before the bike malfunctioned while Walsh was going up a hill. So he took matters into his own hands, jogging while carrying the ruined bike on his shoulders.</p>
        
            <p>Along the way, a couple in a campervan were his knight in shining armour, asking if he wanted to borrow a bike.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't get over there fast enough and they opened a locker and had to unload a few suitcases and a bit of other gear and found this folding bike in the back there.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was sturdily built, probably another 15 kilograms heavier than my bike, but I was not about to worry about that.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's what's great about the Coast to Coast. Everyone seems to have a connection and very much an understanding of what it's all about, whether they'd done it or not, I guess it's part of what we are as Kiwis really."</p>

            <p>With adrenaline pumping, Walsh hit the road again and shrugged off a few chuckles from the other competitors.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought actually I'm going alright, I'm keeping up with these people and then I just suddenly felt the toll of it all.</p>
        
            <p>"I looked at the little heart rate monitor on my wrist and it was 170 [beats per minute] and when you're nearly 60, that's getting up there ... [but] a lot of them toward the back of the field, they were kind of taking on the scenery and they were great company."</p>
        
            <p>Walsh says he couldn't afford to let his teammate, Richard Thomas, down.</p>
        
            <p>"I had my niece in the transition and she plays for the Black Ferns and I thought, well, I fell off my bike, but she probably takes two or three hits bigger than that in the games she plays ... So I had to get in, so I was pleased I didn't let the team down."</p>
        
            <p>He still reckons he'll back for the next Coast to Coast. "I wouldn't miss it."</p>
        
            <p>Although his bike is still ruined, the couple got their folding bike back and his team sailed to third place in their category.</p>
