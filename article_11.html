        <h2>Movie review - The President's Wife</h2>
        <p>
The President's Wife sees the unstoppable Catherine Deneuve portray another French force of nature - Bernadette Chirac. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>This week, with the eyes of the world on the Paris Olympics, what better time to learn a bit about recent French politics?  </p>
        
            <p>In France, The President’s Wife is simply called Bernadette. The film’s subject, Bernadette Chirac, wife of former President Jacques Chirac, became just as famous as her husband and a lot more popular.</p>

            <p>And the film’s star is equally a phenomenon.  </p>
        
            <p>Every year the extraordinary Catherine Deneuve makes another film – often two or three films – and always her name is above the title. </p>
        
            <p>She’s been in that unassailable position since her early films in the ‘60s and ‘70s, as the muse of Truffaut and Chabrol, Polanski and Buñuel.</p>
        
            <p>She was stunning then, and she’s pretty stunning now, like a high-fashion, Vogue front-cover version of Britain’s famous Dames – Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren.  </p>
        
            <p>Like them Deneuve manages to find leading roles that do more than simply cash in on their celebrity.   </p>
        
            <p>Jacques Chirac was the bumptious, right-wing President of France in the late 1990 early 2000s. Like his contemporaries Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, he considered himself part of a new, political elite.   Unlike his wife Bernadette, who was - well, just a wife.</p>
        
            <p>But in fact, Madame Chirac was no slouch in the political arena herself, albeit mostly local politics. </p>
        
            <p>And she soon became sick of playing the little woman behind the Great Man - particularly since she strongly suspected that her political instincts were rather more accurate than Chirac and his trendy think-tank.</p>
        
            <p>So, with the aid of her one PR chap – an equally under-estimated public servant nicknamed Micky – Bernadette launched a charm offensive that surprised and delighted the French public.  </p>
        
            <p>Far from being the austere, conservative housewife she’d been presented as, she turned out to be funny, irreverent, even charismatic.</p>
        
            <p>Comparisons were made with Princess Diana, at the expense of her often charmless husband. A Frenchman politician of the old school, Chirac achieved notoriety for his habitual infidelities and financial scandals.  </p>
        
            <p>And France clearly decided they preferred the style of The President’s Wife to Bernadette’s husband.</p>
        
            <p>The film The President’s Wife is aimed more at a local audience than an international one perhaps.     </p>
        
            <p>The political scene in France can be impenetrable to the uneducated.   Some of the most hostile battles seem to be between people in the same party. </p>
        
            <p>But I found it fascinating for both Deneuve’s stylish performance and as an introduction to a smart and unlikely real-life character. </p>
        
            <p>Despite the warning at the start of the film that this was a fictionalized version of real-life events, I have to say I found it totally convincing.</p>
