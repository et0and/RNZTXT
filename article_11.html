            <p>The White Ferns have won the ODI series against Pakistan with a rollercoaster one wicket win in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 221 for victory in the day-night match, the White Ferns overcame early wobbles and late shakes to secure their second win of the series.</p>
        
            <p>After losing captain Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr cheaply, once again it was Suzie Bates who helped steady the hosts' innings.</p>
        
            <p>Bates scored 74 to back up from her century in the first game.</p>
        
            <p>With Maddy Green the pairing put on 142 runs for the third wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Green went on to make 83 runs her second highest ODI score.</p>
        
            <p>Fatima Sana made early inroads into the White Ferns batting line-up as they fell to 13-2 in the third over but it was Ghulam Fatima who helped rip apart the middle order as New Zealand lost six wickets for 49 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Ghulam Fatima finished with 4-47 runs from her 10 overs in a spell of bowling that nearly helped her side level the three match series.</p>
        
            <p>Lea Tahuhu with 21 runs off 26 balls helped New Zealand avoid a total collapse as she guided the team to victory with seven balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealand's decision to bowl first was rewarded with a wicket with the first ball of the innings.</p>
        
            <p>Tahuhu had Muneeba Ali caught by Kerr in the gully as Pakistan were instantly in trouble.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors were two wickets down by the sixth over, three down by the 11th over and 35-4 at the start of the 13th over as four different White Ferns bowlers had taken wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan's middle order fought back as stand-in captain and number six batter Fatima Sana scored an unbeaten 90 off 104 balls to help her side to a competitive total.</p>
        
            <p>Fatima had taken on the captaincy after regular skipper Nida Dar was ruled out of the match after showing symptoms of concussion following the facial injury she suffered in the first ODI game.</p>
        
            <p>The next highest scorer for Pakistan was Natalia Parvaiz on 39.</p>
        
            <p>Devine was the best with the ball taking 3-25 off six overs, including her 100th one-day international wicket off the final delivery of Pakistan's innings.</p>
        
            <p>Molly Penfold and Fran Jonas also took two wickets each.</p>
        
            <p>The final game of the three match series is on Monday in Christchurch.</p>
