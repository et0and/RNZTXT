        <p>
Artist Fiona Hayward explains how her love of painting helped her out of hospice care and overcome stage 4 cancer. Video

            <p>This video is made with the support of NZ on Air Public Interest Journalism Fund. </p>
        
            <p>Fiona Hayward has loved art most of her life.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, that life has thrown a number of challenges at her, many of which would seem insurmountable to most. Few people go into hospice care with stage four cancer and find a happy ending to their tale.</p>
        
            <p>But when she has felt at her lowest, her talent and her passion for painting and other creative outlets have played a crucial part in helping her heal - both physically and mentally.</p>
        
            <p>Hayward shared her courageous and extraordinary journey as part of The Big Idea's video series - and detailed how she found her creative path.</p>
