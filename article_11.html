            <p>"This interview was the most surreal of them all! Talking with the absolute legend Dolly Parton about her new ROCK album was incredible. Dolly was everything I imagined - sweet, generous, a wonderful storyteller. She had a great balance of cheekiness and humour" - Charlotte Ryan.</p>

            <p>"I heard rumours for years the iconic NZ '70s glam-rock band Space Waltz were reuniting, so when their new album and NZ tour was announced to coincide with the band's 50th anniversary I had to interview frontman Alastair Riddell about his flamboyant style and gender-bending performance and... fame" - Charlotte Ryan</p>

            <p>"Music 101 secured the first-ever RNZ interview with Bikini Kill frontperson and feminist icon Kathleen Hannah. She spoke about her musical career, politics, the 'riot grrl' movement and how she has used her feminist notoriety to raise money for charity through her business 'Tees4Togo. The gold in this interview is when I ask about a phrase that Kathleen used to say at all Bikini Kill shows - 'Girls To The Front' - and how that has not translated well throughout the years and intersectional feminism" - Charlotte Ryan </p>

            <p>"Dinah Lee was an absolute treat to interview - she spoke about fashion, her iconic hair-do and dance moves. I'm so happy she has moved back to NZ and fingers crossed for another NZ tour soon" - Charlotte Ryan</p>

            <p>"Lorde joined me in studio and spoke honestly about her life, what touring is really like, and shared her favourite songs that get her in the zone for performing live" - Charlotte Ryan</p>

            <p>"It was an absolute honour to speak to Anohni (formally known as Antony and the Johnsons) about their new album - a tribute to legendary human rights activist Marsha P Johnson, whose striking photograph adorns the album cover. Anohni speaks about human rights and the state of the world" - Charlotte Ryan</p>

            <p>"Joe Talbot, the frontman of Idles, was such a different interview to what I expected. Compared to his music, he was calm and very chill. He spoke very openly about the trauma he experienced - and how he got through. Very inspiring. At the end of our chat, I asked him about a fan's party he attended last time he was in Auckland. He spoke about the party and his friend who took him to the party - Craig the firefighter who died early this year in Murawai" - Charlotte Ryan </p>

            <p>"Rickie Lee Jones was such a wonderful person to interview - she was so generous with her answers, honest - and very blunt at times, especially talking about her ADHD and the lack of money she has these days. I asked her about that song 'Pink Fluffy Clouds' by The Orb who used her vocals, she confirmed, without permission" - Charlotte Ryan </p>

            <p>"The Godfather of NZ Hip Hop DLT spoke to me about his introduction to hip hop - from his beginnings with Upper Hutt Posse to writing the hit song 'Chains' featuring Che Fu. This interview took place around the time that DLT and Che Fu spoke about the song on [the RNZ video series] NZ Hip Hop Stand Up" - Charlotte Ryan </p>
