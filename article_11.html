        <h2>Farming fish out of water</h2>
        <p>
People and livestock gobble so much fish that the seas soon won’t keep up. Is the answer to grow fish on land? Kate Evans meets scientists figuring out the puzzles of how to farm some of New Zealand’s iconic ocean creatures. Audio

In an aquaculture setting, broodstock kingfish – which reach 1.7 metres in length and weigh more than 40 kilograms – must be knocked out before handling. The NIWA team drop a New Zealand-made anaesthetic called Acquiesce into the water, which puts the fish to sleep so they can be monitored for science or moved for tank cleaning.

            <p>Many of our fisheries are under pressure. At the same time people are eating more fish. Could farming iconic New Zealand species be the future? And what are the advantages of growing fish on land?</p>
        
            <p>Ocean Beach used to process lambs, a record of 20 000 in one day, but now it’s gullies and troughs run with seawater, not blood. Home to the New Zealand Abalone company and Manaaki Whitebait it’s become one the frontiers of New Zealand aquaculture – growing fish indoors.  </p>
        
            <p>It’s not an easy task. Growing fish on land means taking responsibility for their needs throughout their life cycle. First you must identify those needs, account for them in an indoor setting, and make the whole process as efficient as possible so you can still turn a profit. It takes trial and error, and patience.</p>
        
            <p>Listen as Kate Evan’s travels the length of the country to learn how a new group of farmers are figuring out the puzzles of how to farm fish on land.  </p>
