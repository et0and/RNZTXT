        <h2>At The Movies: Freud's Last Session</h2>
        <p>
Freud's Last Session is a play about a fictitious meeting between the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the Christian writer, and later creator of the Narnia books, C S Lewis. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>A film and a play may seem similar, but they’re not really.  A film is all closeups and different locations, a play is entirely a wide-shot of often just one room.   </p>
        
            <p>A film is about action, a play is reaction, as characters’ ideas and points of view collide. Like a former off-Broadway hit drama called Freud’s Last Session.</p>
        
            <p>Freud’s Last Session is essentially a two-hander between two great minds – the pioneer of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and academic and author C S Lewis. </p>

            <p>At stake, a debate to the finish over the existence of God.  </p>
        
            <p>And despite the passion with which both Freud and Lewis hold to their positions, there’s also a glee at debate that’s very Oxford and Cambridge, and I’m sure, Vienna too.  </p>
        
            <p>Freud is played – brilliantly, I might add – by Sir Anthony Hopkins, all brash certainty disguising unexpressed doubts.</p>
        
            <p>C S Lewis is played by one of my favourite not-quite stars, Matthew Goode.  </p>
        
            <p>This is another terrific performance – polite deference to an ailing, elderly man, stubborn refusal to back down in the face of expert bullying by Freud, and underneath, the ever-present memory of the First World War.</p>
        
            <p>Freud’s Last Session takes place in the hours before declaration of World War II, a mere 20 years after the nightmare of the first. </p>
        
            <p>Lewis had been in the trenches back then and suffered a breakdown.</p>
        
            <p>Freud and his daughter Anna had recently escaped from Vienna, and he and Lewis are united in their disgust at the Nazis.</p>
        
            <p>But does the existence of Hitler disprove the presence of God, or is he simply proof of the perils of freedom of choice?</p>
        
            <p>These are debates that have been going on for centuries, of course, but what lifts Freud’s Last Session is that it’s very much about these specific characters, not their well-trodden arguments.</p>
        
            <p>And behind the scenes – occasionally revealed in. slightly stagey flashbacks and asides – are the two important women in the men’s lives. </p>
        
            <p>C S Lewis is in a relationship – in all but name – with the mother of a soldier he served with in the trenches. And Freud sometimes treats Anna like a child, demanding she put him before any outside relationship.</p>
        
            <p>This despite the fact that Anna is a respected lecturer in child psychology in her own right, and has been in a relationship with her friend Dorothy for years.  </p>
        
            <p>Freud may be a ground-breaking analyser of the human psyche, but his attitude to lesbians is downright Victorian.</p>
        
            <p>Freud’s Last Session is a debate very much of its time, featuring two characters approaching momentous events from different directions. </p>
        
            <p>Freud, dying slowly and painfully of a lingering illness, is at the end of a career devoted to science at the expense of emotion and superstition.</p>
        
            <p>Lewis’s Christianity also includes the importance of fantasy in a world view. He was a friend and colleague of JRR Tolkien, and later writer of his own fantasy series, the Narnia books.</p>
        
            <p>But during the War he was also able to offer comfort from a Christian point of view in a regular series of radio talks.    Another world, in other words.</p>
        
            <p>Freud’s Last Session is unapologetically a stage play, lightly amplified and beautifully shot by writer-director Matt Brown.  Go to it for the performances – particularly Hopkins and Goode – and for a skilful recapturing of a very specific time and mood.</p>
        
            <p>And for the fact that the nicest person in the film – Anna Freud, played by Liv Lisa Fies - receives a God-given happy ending when so many people didn’t.</p>
