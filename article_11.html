            <p>It resembles a building from Blade Runner. It looks like somewhere the Avengers might assemble. It is, believes Paul Nisbet, the future. "It's innovative, it's groundbreaking, it's something different," says the driving force behind Te Tōangaroa, a new stadium mooted for downtown Auckland. He's spent 13 years dreaming up this moon shot, and it shows. "We have an opportunity here to deliver something special for the country."</p>
        
            <p>Located behind Spark Arena, Te Tōangaroa - also called 'Quay Park' - is Nisbet's big gamble, the stadium he believes Tāmaki Makaurau needs to sustain the city's live sport and entertainment demands for the next 100 years. His is a concept as grand as it gets, a U-shaped dream with winged rooftops that will sweep around fans sitting in the stands, each getting unimpeached views out over the Waitematā Harbour and Rangitoto Island.</p>

            <p>Nisbet calls his vision a "gateway for the world," a structure so grand he believes it would attract the biggest sports teams, stars and sponsors to Aotearoa while offering visitors a must-see tourist destination. Nestled alongside residential areas, commercial zones and an All Blacks-themed hotel, designs show a retractable roof protecting 55,000 punters from the elements and a sky turret towering over neighbouring buildings.</p>
        
            <p>He's gone all in on this. Nisbet's quit his job, assembled a consortium of experts - called Cenfield MXD - and attracted financial backers to turn his vision into a reality. It is, Nisbet believes, the culmination of his 30-year career working in major stadiums, including 11 years as director of Auckland Stadiums. "I've had the chance to travel extensively," he says. "I've been to over 50 stadiums around the world."</p>
        
            <p>Tāmaki Makaurau, he says, needs Te Tōangaroa - urgently. If approved, it will be built over an ageing commercial space and an unused railway yard sitting behind Spark Arena, what Nisbet calls "a dirty old brownfields location that's sapping the economic viability out of the city." He calls it a "regeneration" project. "You couldn't mistake you're in Auckland, or New Zealand, when you see images of it," he says.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks are on board, says Nisbet, and they want Te Tōangaroa built by 2029 in time for a Lions tour. (The All Blacks didn't respond to a request for comment, but former players John Kirwan and Sean Fitzpatrick have backed the team moving to Te Tōangaroa.) Concert promoters are on board too, says Nisbet. He believes Te Tōangaroa would end the Taylor Swift debacle that's seen her and many major acts skip us in favour of touring Australian stadiums. "It will be one of those special places that international acts just have to play," he says.</p>
        
            <p>The problem? Nisbet's made a gamble that may not pay off. In March, a decision is due to be made about the city's stadium future. Building Te Tōangaroa, with an estimated construction time of six years and a budget of $1 billion, is just one option. The other, Eden Park, has 125 years of history, a long-standing All Blacks record and a huge number of supporters behind it - as well as a CEO willing to do anything to win.</p>
        
            <p>Stand in Eden Park's foyer for a few minutes and history will smack you in the face. It's there in the photos framed on the wall from a 1937 All Blacks test match. It's sitting in Anton Oliver's rugby boots from 2001, presumably fumigated and placed inside a glass case. More recent history is on display too, with floor-to-ceiling photographs showing off concerts headlined by by Ed Sheeran and Six60, a pivot only possible since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Soon, the man in charge of all of this arrives. "Very few people have seen this space," says Nick Sautner, the Eden Park CEO who shakes my hand, pulls me down a hallway and invites me into a secret room in the bowels of Eden Park. With gleaming wood panels, leather couches and top-shelf liquor, Sautner's proud of his hidden bar. "It's invite-only ... a VIP experience," says Sautner, whose Australian accent remains easily identifiable despite seven years at the helm of Eden Park.</p>

            <p>This bar, he says, is just one of the many innovations Eden Park has undertaken in recent years. Built in 1900, the Mt Eden stadium remains the home of the All Blacks - but Eden Park is no longer considered a specialty sports venue. Up to 70% of the stadium's revenue now comes from non-sporting activities, Sautner confirms. You can golf, abseil onto the rooftops and stay the night in dedicated glamping venues. It's also become promoters' choice for major concerts, with Coldplay and Luke Combs recently hosting multiple shows there. "We will consider any innovation you can imagine," Sautner tells me. "We're a blank canvas."</p>
        
            <p>Throughout our interview, Sautner refers to Eden Park as the "national stadium". He's upbeat and on form, rattling off statistics and renovations from memory. His social media feeds - especially LinkedIn - are full of posts promoting the stadium's achievements. He'll pick up the phone to anyone who will talk to him. "Whatsapp is the best way of contacting me," he says. Residents have his number and can call directly with complaints. After our interview, Sautner passes me his business card then follows it up with an email making sure I have everything I need. "My phone's always on," he assures me.</p>
        
            <p>He may not admit it, but Sautner's doing all of this in an attempt to get ahead of what's shaping up as the biggest crisis of Eden Park's 125 years. If Te Tōangaroa is chosen in March, Eden Park - as well as Albany's North Harbour Stadium and Onehunga's Go Media Stadium - will all take a back seat. If Eden Park loses the All Blacks and their 31-year unbeaten record, then there's no other word for it: the threat is existential.</p>

Called Eden Park 2.1, Sautner is promoting a three-stage renovation plan.

            <p>Ask Sautner if he's losing sleep over his stadium's future and he shakes his head. To him, Te Tōangaroa's numbers don't stack up. "If someone can make the business model work for an alternative stadium in Auckland, I'm all for activating the waterfront," he says. Then he poses a series of questions: "How many events a year would a downtown stadium hold? Forty-five?" he asks. "So 320 other days a year, what's going to be in that stadium?"</p>
        
            <p>He is, of course, biased. But Sautner believes upgrading Eden Park is the right move. Called Eden Park 2.1, Sautner is promoting a three-stage renovation plan that includes building a $100-million retractable rooftop. A new North Stand would lift Eden Park's capacity to 70,000, and improved function facilities and a pedestrian bridge would turn the venue into "a fortress ... capable of hosting every event".</p>
        
            <p>He's veering into corporate speak, but Sautner sees the vision clearly. With his annual concert consent recently raised from six to 12 shows, he already thinks he's got it in the bag, "Eden Park has the land, it has the consent, it has the community, it has the infrastructure," he says. "I'm very confident Eden Park is going to be here for another 100 years."</p>
        
            <p>Instead of a drink, Sautner offers RNZ a personal stadium tour that takes us through the exact same doors that open when the All Blacks emerge onto the hallowed turf. There, blinking in the sunlight, Sautner sweeps his arms around the stadium and grins. "I get up every day and I think of my family," he says. "Then I think, 'How can I make Eden Park better?"</p>
        
            <p>It is, says Shane Henderson, an argument for the ages. It never seems to quit. How long have Aucklanders been feuding about stadiums? "It began when the dinosaurs died out," jokes Henderson. For the past year, he's been chairing a working group that will make the decision on Auckland's stadium future. That group whittled four options down to the current two, eliminating a sunken waterfront stadium, and another based in Silo Park.</p>
        
            <p>He's doing this because Wayne Brown asked him to. "The mayor said, 'We need to say to the public, 'This is our preferred option for a stadium for the city.'" It's taken over Henderson's life. Every summer barbecue has turned into a forum for people to share their views. "People say, "Why don't you do this?'" he says. Henderson won't be drawn on which way he's leaning ahead of March's decision, but he's well aware of the stakes. "We're talking about the future of our city for generations to come," he says. "It's natural feelings are going to run high."</p>
        
            <p>That's true. As I researched this story, the main parties engaged in a back-and-forth discussion that became increasingly heated. Jim Doyle, from Te Tōangaroa's Cenfield MXD team, described Eden Park's situation as desperate. "Eden Park can't fund itself ... it's got no money, it's costing ratepayers," he said. Doyle alleged the stadium "wouldn't be fit for purpose". "You're going to have to spend probably close to $1 billion to upgrade it." Asked what should happen to Eden Park should the decision go Te Tōangaroa's way, Doyle shrugged his shoulders. "Turn it into a retirement village."</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park's Sautner immediately struck back. Yes, he admits Eden Park owes $40 million to Auckland Council, calling that debt a "legacy left over from the Rugby World Cup 2011". But he denied most of the consortium's claims. "Eden Park does not receive any funding or subsidies from Auckland ratepayers," Sautner said in a written statement. He confirmed renovations had already begun. "Over the past three years, the Trust has invested more than $30m to enhance infrastructure and upgrade facilities ... creating flexible spaces to meet evolving market demands."</p>
        
            <p>Sautner said Doyle's statement was evidence of his team's inexperience. "We are extremely disappointed that comments of this nature have been made," he said. "They are factually incorrect and highlight Quay Park consortium's lack of understanding of stadium economics."</p>
        
            <p>As the stadium debate turns into a showdown, major stars continue to skip Aotearoa in favour of huge Australian shows, with Katy Perry, Kylie Minogue and Oasis all giving us a miss this year. New Zealand music fans are reluctantly spending large sums on flights and accommodation if they want to see them. Until Metallica arrives in November, there are no stadium shows booked; just three of Eden Park's 12 allotted concert slots are taken this year.</p>
        
            <p>Yet, Auckland City councillors will soon study feasibility reports being submitted by both stadium options. On March 24, Henderson, the working group chair, says councillors will come together to "thrash it out" and vote for their preferred option. There will only be one winner, and NZ Herald reports either building Te Tōangaroa or Eden Park 2.1 is likely to cost more than $1 billion. Either we're spending that on a brand new waterfront stadium, or we're upgrading an old one.</p>
        
            <p>"Is that the best use of that money?" asks David Benge. The managing director for events company TEG Live doesn't believe Tāmaki Makaurau needs another stadium because it's barely using those it already has. He has questions. "I understand the excitement around a shiny new toy, but to what end?" he asks. "Can Auckland sustain a show at Go Media Stadium, a show at Western Springs, a show at Eden Park, and a show at this new stadium on the same night - or even in the same week?"</p>
        
            <p>Benge doesn't believe Te Tōangaroa would entice more artists to play here either. "I'm yet to meet an artist who's going to be swayed by how iconic a venue is," he says. Bigger problems include the size of our population and the strength of our dollar. No matter the venue, "you're still incurring the same expenses to produce the show," he says. Instead, he suggests Pōneke as the next city needing a new venue. "If you could wave a magic wand and invest in a 10,000-12,000-capacity indoor arena in Wellington, that would be fantastic," he says.</p>

Would a new stadium really lure big artists to NZ?

            <p>Live Nation, the touring juggernaut that hosts most of the country's stadium shows, didn't respond to a request for comment. Other promoters canvassed by RNZ offered mixed views. Some wanted a new stadium, while others wanted a refurbished one. Every single one of them said that any new stadium needed to be built with concerts - not sport - in mind. "We're fitting a square peg in a round hole," one said about the production costs involved in trucking temporary stages into Eden Park or Go Media Stadium. "Turf replacement can add hundreds of thousands - if not $1 million - to your bottom line," said another.</p>
        
            <p>Some wanted something else entirely. Veteran promoter Campbell Smith pointed out Auckland Council is seeking input for a potential redevelopment of Western Springs. One mooted option is turning it into a home ground for the rapidly rising football club Auckland FC. Smith doesn't agree with that. "I think it's a really attractive option for music and festivals," he says. "It's got a large footprint, it's easily accessible, it's close to the city ... It would be a travesty if it was developed entirely for sport."</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for certain: a decision on this lengthy, torrid and emotional topic is being made in March. One party will celebrate; the other will slink back to the drawing board. Will it finally end the great Auckland stadium debate? That's a question that seems easier to answer than any of the others.</p>
