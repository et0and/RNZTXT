            <p>Rapper Chali 2na sits in his backyard in Los Angeles, smoking a joint and finishing a painting he has been working on for some time.</p>
        
            <p>He uses spray cans on the 2.4-metre wide, 1.2-metre tall canvas - a medium he has used to bring his vibrant creations to life since he was a kid.</p>
        
            <p>Born in 1971, just before the birth of hip hop, Chali 2na has witnessed its evolution firsthand.</p>
        
            <p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of Jurassic 5, the alternative hip hop collective that saw his bass-baritone voice rise to fame. The group's first single, 'Unified Rebelution', released in 1994, launched Chali 2na, Akil, Soup, Marc 7, DJ Nu-Mark, and turntablist Cut Chemist.</p>
        
            <p> This audio is not downloadable due to copyright restrictions. </p>
        
            <p>The group's 2000 album, Quality Control, solidified Jurassic 5's success and unique sound.</p>
        
            <p>Chali 2na explains the art work in front of him: "I wanted to create this big T-Rex stomping through a forest, but it turned into a portrait.</p>
        
            <p>"You see him in profile, with a tree in the background representing Quality Control - before it was cut down. It features the J5 logo, but the tree is still full and alive, which is pretty cool."</p>

            <p>Reflecting on his early days in music, he recalls: "I was born when hip hop was just emerging. When it was born, my mama was teaching me how to use the toilet. I was just a toddler."</p>
        
            <p>The seamless blend of disco, funk, sampled beats, and dynamic rhyme patterns made Jurassic 5 stand out.</p>
        
            <p>"For the most part, we were just having so much fun doing it," he says, reminiscing about how record labels soon chased them for deals, leading to five years of touring.</p>
        
            <p>He is grateful to pioneers like N.W.A and Public Enemy for paving the way.</p>
        
            <p>"It's crazy because we're a crew that pays homage to the old school. These legends created a path for the rap we see today. Growing up in gang-ridden Chicago and then moving to LA was similar - just prettier, with better weather."</p>
        
            <p>Instead of mirroring the harsh realities of their neighborhoods, Jurassic 5 offered a different perspective.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to escape those aspects and bring a fresh way of thinking. I'm not saying we were the end-all, be-all, but we approached the same topics from a different angle."</p>
        
            <p>With a lengthy career in both hip hop and art, Chali 2na earned his name as a young boy in Chicago, where his father gave him the nickname Charles Stewart. When it came time to adopt a hip hop persona, it fit perfectly.</p>

            <p>Moving to Los Angeles was a life-changing experience, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"In Chicago, my thirst for hip hop was quenched by movies and music. Moving to Los Angeles immersed me in West Coast hip hop, where I could truly experience the culture. It was incredible to put my eyes, ears, and hands on it all when I arrived in California."</p>
        
            <p>Soon, the stars aligned. Chali 2na joined rock band Ozomatli and Jurassic 5 to tour the world. But in 2000, J5 was involved in a bus crash that would change the course of his life.</p>
        
            <p>"I smashed my head against a marble table in the back of the tour bus. It cracked my skull and almost killed me. They had to cut a hole in my head to remove small shards of bone from the membrane protecting my brain. They plugged that hole with a titanium plate that has arms like a spider. A masterful surgery, these guys are amazing. That was 24 years ago."</p>
        
            <p>Since that accident, Chali 2na is grateful for his travels abroad. While Jurassic 5 called it a day in 2007, all members continue to release music and tour independently.</p>
        
            <p>On 30 December, 2na will headline the Summer Haze Festival in Tauranga, sharing the stage with The Roots, KORA, Home Brew, and Aaradhna.</p>
        
            <p>Chali 2na promises it will be a good time with his band, The House of Vibe, taking audiences on a journey through his career in hip hop.</p>
        
            <p>"Somebody taught me a long time ago that fun is infectious. If it's sincere, everybody will join in."</p>
        
            <p>He is especially excited to celebrate the start of another year in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I always love watching it turn New Year's there and then calling my mom, saying, 'Hey, I'm calling from the future! Happy New Year!'"</p>
