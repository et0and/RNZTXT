            <p>After a "quite shaky" upbringing, Kayla Schwalger moved through her own teenage mental health struggles by reconnecting with her Samoan heritage. </p>
        
            <p>Now the 23-year-old is empowering other Pacific youth to do the same via the charitable organisation Tapasā.</p>
        
            <p>Kayla Schwalger is one of 25 young New Zealand trailblazers and changemakers in this year's Y25 programme.</p>
        
            <p>As a child growing up in Aotearoa, Schwalger tells Jesse Mulligan she felt quite disconnected from traditional Samoan culture where "the village" raises young people and imparts a sense of identity.</p>
        
            <p>"You have the support system. You have these values embedded in you when you're young. I think with that connection, when it's strong, you're able to ground yourself in who you are."</p>
        
            <p>For her high school years and first year of university, Schwalger lived in Samoa where, in the absence of support services, her mental health declined.</p>
        
            <p>At 20, back in New Zealand studying at AUT, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to get that diagnosis really helped give me validation … I was able to be in a space where I felt safe enough to reflect and work on my healing and wellbeing."</p>
        
            <p>Through that process, Schwalger says it became clear to her that connection to island culture was essential for the general health of young people like her. </p>
        
            <p>She co-founded Tapasā - which loosely translates as 'navigation compass' in Samoan - with her "amazing" mum who also has personal experience of mental health struggles and domestic violence, </p>
        
            <p>'My mom's like my superhero. We do everything together, and we founded it to really uplift our youth, to see culture as their superpower and reconnect back there."</p>
        
            <p>Many kids with Pacific heritage growing up in Aotearoa try to assimilate into Kiwi society and can be uncertain about going "all in" with their island culture, Schwalger says.</p>
        
            <p>Yet when these young people don't feel a connection to their heritage, she says, they can too easily go down the wrong avenues to try and find support, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Today, though, many PI kids being raised in New Zealand have a "massive desire" to better understand themselves via their cultural heritage, Schwalger says.</p>
        
            <p>Social media can be a great tool for this, and her 38,000-word Masters in Communications thesis on navigating mental health in the digital age reveals its potential.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the biggest findings I had in my thesis was that youth are able to come together on social media and see [Pacific Island culture] as a positive thing. </p>
        
            <p>"Evidence shows that it's [also] shifting the mental health stigma in Samoa which is quite cool."</p>
        
            <p>Tapasā also focuses on the transformative power of generational change.</p>
        
            <p>"We really want our oldies to give their knowledge of culture, in a way that suits them, to us now - for the present and for youth in the future to be absolutely strong in their culture, absolutely strong with that connection."</p>
