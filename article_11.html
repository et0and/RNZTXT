            <p>It’s one of the great cultural events of Aotearoa New Zealand – certainly one of the longest established: Whānau Mārama New Zealand International Film Festival.</p>
        
            <p>For decades the midwinter Film Festival has offered us the best new films from all over the world – drama, documentaries, animation, children’s programmes, old classics and the indiscreet charm of Ant Timpson’s Incredibly Strange section.</p>
        
            <p>But now, says RNZ film critic and broadcaster Simon Morris, it seems a shadow of its former self.</p>
        
            <p>The last three years have been a challenge – first the loss of its hugely capable director, the late Bill Gosden, then Covid-19, which decimated the Festival’s income, two years in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the festival has been rocked by a series of major resignations in the last month, including Ant Timpson, who had been with the festival for 30 years. A key programmer stationed in Europe, Sandra Reid, has also left. She was also with the film festival for nearly 30 years. Departing after decades are Malcolm Turner and Nic Marshall - respectively in charge of programming animation and films for a younger audience. Finally, Vicci Ho, the festival's China and East Asia specialist has also resigned.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Timpson, Reid and Marshall posted on social media about their departures and their time at the organisation but the former employees have not spoken publicly.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau Mārama New Zealand International Film Festival's chair Catherine Fitzgerald says "we hugely value these people who have left. They have been there for an extremely long time."</p>

            <p>Following the recording of the interview with Fitzgerald, former animation programmer based in Australia, Malcolm Turner, spoke to Culture 101 saying "it wasn't a resignation in as much as that the confirmation of my role remained unconfirmed while the Board continued to investigate the viability of being able to stage an event."</p>
        
            <p>Turner explains by late February, the outlines of the animation programmes have typically been decided upon and the "down and dirty work" is underway.</p>
        
            <p>"But so far, none of that work has even begun."</p>
        
            <p>Turner says the logistical essentials "don't seem to register with the current governance structure at NZIFF."</p>
        
            <p>In response to Turner's comments, Fitzgerald says "he advised the NZFFT Board and General Manager that due to the programming scope for NZIFF 2024 not yet having been determined he wished to have his name removed as Animation Programmer for the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the work Malcolm undertook with the festival over the past 28 years"</p>
        
            <p>The festival has this week made two major announcements. Firstly, a new Artistic Director for the 2024 festival, Paolo Bertolin a film programmer, writer and producer. Secondly, a severely curtailed programme, which will see the festival play in just four centres over eight venues from 31 July this year. Last year's festival took place in 15 centres, with six venues in Auckland alone. </p>
