"No one got out of the seats at afternoon smoko and the shed was squeezed full" - Gore farmer Cameron Grant. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Last Friday, Gore cousins Megan Whitehead and Hannah McCall shore 1,293 lambs in 8 hours - a new world record for a female shearing duo.</p>
        
            <p>Inside a "chocka" woolshed at Grant Bros farm, locals were riveted by the pair's speed and skill, farmer Cameron Grant tells Lisa Owen.</p>

            <p>The previous world record of 903 sheep shorn in 8 hours was set by a King Country mother-and-daughter team in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>For two people to shear 1,293 sheep in a day "you need a pretty big ticker", Grant says.</p>
        
            <p>"[Whitehead and McCall] have trained and been on diets. probably no sugar and definitely no alcohol. They've put a huge effort into this … These girls shear all day and then theyre in the gym at night, running."</p>
        
            <p>Each of the 12,93 sheep had to be shorn to a very high standard, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"If they are shearing too rough, they get warnings, they get a sheep taken off them. And if they cut one too badly they'll get a reject sheep and that's deducted. They're only allowed five reject sheep for the day and if they go over that the record will be stopped."</p>
        
            <p>Although Whitehead and McCall are "pretty fit", Grant says, they were also "pretty exhausted" after their record-breaking performance.</p>
        
            <p>"They're pretty worn out, they're pretty sweaty. And they're having a wee bit of time to themselves at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>"They both got to a beer straight after so I imagine it's tasting pretty good for them after not drinking in the last six, eight months."</p>
