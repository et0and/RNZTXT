            <p>A Kiwi was on a train in Slovakia when she heard a familiar accent come over the speakers.</p>
        
            <p>It was a New Zealand voice and it belonged to Gavin Shoebridge - the English announcer of the Central Europe country's national rail carrier.</p>
        
            <p>So how did a New Zealander wind up with that job?</p>
        
            <p>Shoebridge was working as a broadcaster for the English version of Slovak Radio, when his colleague who also worked a public transport announcer told him about the job.</p>
        
            <p>"I had like a thousand stations to read out in the microphone, which took me a long time but we got there," Shoebridge told Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"I did a lot at home, I had a studio and a microphone, I'd sit there a couple of hours through the night and read them slowly. You've got to read them slowly, trying and keep the intonation flat, not too excited.</p>
        
            <p>"Like 'the next stop is, pause, Banská Bystrica' in a flat tone so it can be included in a list."</p>
        
            <p>Who is this New Zealander and how did he get a gig doing English voice-overs for Slovakia’s national carrier??? pic.twitter.com/VcWYnn8cG5</p>
        
            <p>Some of the pronounciations of place names were difficult for Shoebridge, but it was even moreso when the train branched out to towns in the Czech Republic.</p>
        
            <p>"I struggled with some of them. Czechs have like this r with a crown over the top of it and I just for the life of me can't do it. It's impossible."</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately though, it appears the Kiwi's voice won't be on the Slovakian public transport system for long as he's been told he will be replaced by AI.</p>
        
            <p>"I still exist on the trains though, and knowing how slow the Slovak bureaucracy upgrades [are] … I'll probably be tormenting passengers for years to come."</p>
        
            <p>He's now taken up a stint as a YouTuber.</p>
        
            <p>"If you get a chance to go to Slovakia, do it, it's just a fantastic place, out of this world."</p>
