            <p>While only a few will go home with the ultimate prize, not all who miss out on a 2025 Oscar award will go home empty handed.</p>
        
            <p>An entertainment marketing company Distinctive Assets has given some seriously luxurious swag bags to Oscar nominees worth a whopping $385,000, according to Business Insider.</p>
        
            <p>So what's inside? Vacations, cosmetics and other prizes from over 60 brands.</p>
        
            <p>The "Everyone Wins" gift bags included several trips, with the most-expensive being a villa in the Maldives worth over $41,000.</p>
        
            <p>Other trips included a five-night luxury wellness retreat in Sri Lanka worth $15,000 and a 3d Virtual Wellness Retreat valued at $6000.</p>
        
            <p>The bags also included $45,000 of body-contouring treatments and Miage's full line of skincare products.</p>
        
            <p>But the most valuable item was $90,000 worth of home renovation project management, which Distinctive Assets said was transferrable to those affected by wildfires.</p>

            <p>In a statement, company founder Lash Fary said while the gift bags were fun, they were also meant to give back.</p>
        
            <p>"While our gifts may be famous for being fun and fabulous, they also serve as a means to elevate small businesses, minority-owned brands, female entrepreneurs and companies that give back.</p>
        
            <p>"This year, on the heels of the historically tragic LA fires, we have found even more ways that our celebrity swag can do good in our community."</p>
        
            <p>Fary said the "incredible" gift bags - going to some of the top 25 acting and directing nominees - were to "brighten someone's day if they do go home empty handed on Oscar night".</p>
        
            <p>"Also including some simple but significant ways for these nominees to give back," he said in a video on social media.</p>
        
            <p>The company has been gifting out the goodie bags at the annual awards ceremony for the last 23 years.</p>
        
            <p>The brands pay for the items to be included in the prize packs.</p>

The Swag bag prizes are worth thousands.
