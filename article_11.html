You don't really cook a Christmas cake as much as dry it out, says the NZ Agricultural Show fruitcake convener. Audio

            <p>Cake convener Christine Beaton has a tip for fruitcake bakers at the New Zealand Agricultural Show, "you don't really cook a Christmas cake, you dry it out."</p>
        
            <p>The sheep farmer from Leithfield in North Canterbury knows what she's talking about.</p>
        
            <p>She learnt about the dark arts of making Christmas cakes from her great-grandmother.</p>
        
            <p>"I still use her old crockery bowl but it's got some cracks in it now, so one day it's going to disintegrate."</p>
        
            <p>Christine has brought the Christmas Cake Competition back into the heart of the Christchurch show, after it was absent for a few years.</p>
        
            <p>"The people that had done it had done their dash and I've got a passion for cooking so I thought, let's give it a go and see if we can start it again."</p>
        
            <p>She's had a great response from home bakers with entries arriving from as far afield as Western Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a cake in competition too, but mine is the lightest cake, so everybody has their own taste."</p>

            <p>All the cakes are cut in half for judging. A ruler is used to ensure the cuts are made exactly through the centre.</p>
        
            <p>"Because if you did go over to one side a wee bit and it was a bit underdone in the middle, they could miss that."</p>
        
            <p>Christine says the judges, former show president Richard Parkes and farmer and Waipara foodie Judith Hoban, were really impressed by Julie Tapp's winning entry.</p>
        
            <p>"The taste was good, the top was nice and smooth and soft and there was no burnt or over-cooked fruit coming up through," she says.</p>
        
            <p>So did the convener get to taste the fruit cakes after the judging was done?</p>
        
            <p>"I did, I cleaned up the crumbs after every cake was judged, so I do not want another piece of Christmas cake for sometime!" Christine admits.</p>
