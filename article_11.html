            <p>Legendary and beloved author, Dame Lynley Dodd, is hoping a new award will give a fellow writer a boost of confidence - similar to a gift she received in the 1970s which changed her life. </p>
        
            <p>The Arts Foundation has announced The Lynley Dodd Children’s Writers Award which will give $30,000 every two years to a mid-career children’s writer. It offers the artist recognition and will support their journey. </p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Perlina Lau of Culture 101, Lynley Dodd says it was early days in her career when she won the Choysa Bursary Award. She had taken a break from teaching to have her children and took up illustrating work having been trained in art. It was then fellow writer Eve Sutton suggested the two collaborate on a children’s book and My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes was born. Dodd went on to write The Nickle Nackle Tree but started to have doubts.</p>
        
            <p>“I didn’t really have courage about writing. Art was still my thing and I thought - I would love to go on writing but I don’t think I’m good enough and it might be a bit hard.”</p>
        
            <p>Winning the Choysa Bursary was a huge motivation for Dodd, telling her perhaps she “could go on writing.”</p>
        
            <p>Since 1978, she has hoped she could one day, manage to do the same for someone else.</p>
        
            <p>“Knowing what an enormous difference it made for me - it was huge. I thought - this is a lovely thing for someone to receive. It’s happened and it’s very exciting for me.”</p>
        
            <p>The award will alternate with the Mallinson Rendel Illustrators Award, which recognises children's illustrators. The winner will be selected annually by independent panels rather than open application. Eligible recipients should have published two or three books and established their identity in the field of children’s literature. </p>
        
            <p>With so many writers and illustrators now, Dodd says it can be financially tough and competitive. </p>
        
            <p>“You’ve got to try and fight your way in. You have to build up confidence - it’s very easy to get knocked back. It’s hard work but very satisfying of course, if it comes off.”</p>

            <p>Had it not been for the bursary Dodd received in the 70s, the world may have never met Hairy Maclary and his friends. First published in 1983, it’s one of New Zealand’s best-selling books, it’s sold more than 5 million copies worldwide and it’s been translated into foreign language editions including Swedish, Japanese and Korean. </p>
        
            <p>”He’s an old dog," laughs Dodd, reflecting on 41 years of the scruffy terrier. Dodd remembers the idea was written on a loose piece of paper which fell out of her ideas book. It was a rainy Sunday afternoon, and by the end of the day, she had almost completed the story. </p>
        
            <p>“One of those rare times when something comes quickly - it’s a simple thing - introducing a dog per page - it’s a simple structure.”</p>

            <p>The literary great was born in Rotorua and grew up in Taupō as an only child. Dodd attributes her sense of imagination to her parents, especially her father.</p>
        
            <p>“There was an awful lot of silly nonsense in our household. We had a great deal of wordplay - we would have competitions making up silly words.”</p>
        
            <p>Her parents were also fans of Dr Seuss books, quoting the words, and there was always encouragement to read. </p>
        
            <p>With children’s books designed to be read aloud, this is a key part of Dodd’s process. She says reading aloud is vital for the rhythm. </p>
        
            <p>“Just as well I live out in the country because it could be concerning. Making all the noises - I do all the barks and the meows.</p>
        
            <p>“I conduct myself actually - because I’m writing in rhyme which is hard to do properly which keeps the rhythm going correctly. It’s all quite a performance!”</p>
        
            <p>While she’s always jotting down ideas and working on new stories, the business of the business takes up most of her time these days.</p>
        
            <p>“I always plan to work on something new - I just don’t seem to get the time to do it. I’m doing a lot of writing but it’s all emails. I do get out the jotter pads and put down things I’ve heard on the news, if something silly has happened in the world.”</p>
        
            <p>Her advice to children has always been to look out for ideas - anywhere and everywhere.</p>
        
            <p>“There are all sorts of places where ideas come from. They fly past your head and you just have to grab them as they come past.”</p>
