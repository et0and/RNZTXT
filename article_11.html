            <p>Marama Moore and James Ionatona Su'a were at a work rugby game when they first locked eyes.</p>
        
            <p>Now the Taranaki couple have built a young family and a Pacific-inspired food business Island Style Kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>In the early days, to test out the quality of their food, Marama and James got feedback from their many Pacific colleagues at Tegal Foods.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes cooking for our own people is the most difficult because they're the most critical, but what better advice to get than from your own people?" she tells Kathryn Ryan.</p>

            <p>James, who says he's always been passionate about cooking, learnt a lot about it from his uncle while growing up in Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't have much, you know, and Mum can just whip something up for eight of us ... Seeing my uncle working as a chef, that's where I started looking at like 'If he can do that possibly can do it as well'. So I started following his footsteps and taking advice and stuff from him."</p>
        
            <p>The first time he and Marama took a food truck to Waitara Night Markets - "just to test the waters" - they didn't know quite what to make or how much, Marama says.</p>
        
            <p>"There were quite a lot of people there and we sold out within half an hour.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys were giving Island portions of course, so the community was getting a pretty decent deal for the price they were paying because we had no idea about that stuff, either.</p>
        
            <p>"To get the positive feedback from people, it was a good indication for us."</p>
        
            <p>With both of them still working full-time at Tegal and young kids to raise, at first, the food truck idea took a backseat to the rest of life, Marama says.</p>
        
            <p>"Trying to do both at that time was pretty hard, especially because our little ones were still very little."</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, though, she and James started purchasing food preparation equipment and decided to give the business a real go.</p>
        
            <p>"We were starting to get to that point of 'if we're not gonna do it, now, we will never do it.</p>
        
            <p>"We also approached our iwi Ngāti Awa … and they helped us purchase the food truck."</p>
        
            <p>James and Marama still use the food truck for catering events and selling their wares at the place where it all began - the Waitara Night Markets.</p>
        
            <p>With young kids to feed, it was "very scary" to take the leap and leave their jobs at Tegal, she says, but last year the couple did that and opened a food shop in the town of Bell Block.</p>
        
            <p>"The shop has been really good because it's in a prime spot on the main road so we do have a lot of workers come through during lunchtime. It's really good having that constant space where people know where we are. We have a lot of customers that travel from Hawera, Patia, and Stratford.</p>
        
            <p>"We do have a couple of guys that are from Palmy so we must be doing something right if people want to drive that far just for a kai."</p>
