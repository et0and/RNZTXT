            <p>A New Zealand geneticist says his research into the minds of sheep may hold the key to curing Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland University's Centre for Brain Research received more than $300,000 of funding from the US-based Cure Alzheimer's Fund earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Professor of genetics Russell Snell said the funding would help expand his research focusing on the development of early-onset Alzheimer's disease in genetically modified sheep.</p>
        
            <p>The goal was to improve the drug pre-screening process for Alzheimer's disease, Snell said.</p>
        
            <p>"By far and away the most value these animals will have is the pre-clinical testing of potential treatments, to throw away the ones that won't work, [and] to refine the list to the ones that do, so that they can then go on into human clinical trials."</p>
        
            <p>Sheep served as excellent models for Alzheimer's disease research due to their longer life span, complex brain structure, and genetic similarity to humans, Snell said.</p>

            <p>Many drugs that performed well in rodents failed in human clinical trials and those trials could cost upwards of a billion dollars to run, he said.</p>
        
            <p>His work would be a game-changer for Alzheimer's disease research globally, Snell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our country's size means we are always close to the people we are working to provide real hope to. We look at things differently here; we ask, 'What can we bring that's unique?'</p>
        
            <p>"This work is truly unique. Our group has a vision for dementia, that it is possible to fix it."</p>
        
            <p>Centre for Brain Research director and research collaborator Sir Richard Faull said the Cure Alzheimer's Fund recognised the importance of their work.</p>
        
            <p>"Our research work has not only a pioneering scientific value to it; it critically also has a human life value. This funding recognises that in the most perfect way."</p>
