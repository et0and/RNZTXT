            <p>Miles From Nowhere is the brainchild of poet, writer and journalist Mohamed Hassan.</p>
        
            <p>The six-part drama-comedy series is about the everyday and not-so-everyday experiences of the Muslim diaspora in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Set in Auckland, Miles From Nowhere is based on Hassan’s, and his community’s, experiences but also his experiences as a reporter on real-world surveillance, counter-terrorism and Islamophobia.</p>
        
            <p>Arlo Green plays lead character Said, a young Kiwi-Muslim songwriter in crisis. His fiancée has dumped him. His career is non-existent. His passion for music is crippled by lack of confidence. And his mum worries he’s losing touch with his faith. Who still believes in Said? A government spy he shouldn’t even be talking to. Said forms a dangerous friendship with the Security Intelligence Service agent spying on him, risking his whole community to fulfil his dreams.</p>
        
            <p>Green taught himself to play the guitar for the role and helped co-write many of the songs that feature in the series.</p>
        
            <p>Said is something of a loser, Green says.</p>
        
            <p>“Very much a loser. I'm a loser in my real life. So, it was quite easy. I guess he's just really aimless, he's in a deep, deep hole.”</p>
        
            <p>Hanah Tayeb plays Said's younger sister Soraya.</p>
        
            <p>The surveillance elements to the show feel poetic, Tayeb says.</p>
        
            <p>“I feel like a lot of Muslim Kiwis kind of have the shared experience of feeling othered or feeling watched by people.</p>
        
            <p>“I remember growing up. I was a baby when 9/11 happened. But I remember going to New Zealand and going to primary school and still getting bullied for 9/11, even though it was like a decade later.”</p>
        
            <p>Tayeb’s character is Said’s number one bully, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“She lives in Sydney, she's married with kids. She's got her life sussed and she's kind of Said's number one bully. But I think it's because she loves him so much.”</p>
        
            <p>She's also “hilarious as hell”, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“She's cool as hell, and I can't wait for everyone to meet her and to love her as much as I do.”</p>
        
            <p>Green was hesitant to get involved in the project at first, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“I sort of divorced myself from the community just because of the sort of experiences I'd had.</p>
        
            <p>And I'd had a unique upbringing in that sense. And so I was scared to return, because I thought once I wear that hat, you'll always see that hat.</p>
        
            <p>But it felt important. And I loved the writing and the team assembled. And I thought, it didn't feel reductive. It didn't it didn't feel like a paint by numbers.”</p>
        
            <p>Tayeb jumped at the chance, however.</p>
        
            <p>“Moving to New Zealand was my first interaction with a Western country and I was terrified. And I saw no representation. I saw nothing that made me feel like there was a bit of home with me, like there was some nostalgia or something to relate to. There was nothing like that.</p>
        
            <p>“And so, when I saw that the show was casting, I jumped on it as fast as I could.”</p>
        
            <p>Miles From Nowhere launches on Sky Open this Wednesday and will then be seen on Neon.</p>
