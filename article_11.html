            <p>Feature-length music documentaries are at centre stage thanks to Thursday's release of Alien Weaponry: Kua Tupu Te Ara. The music doco is endlessly fascinating as a genre, giving a rare glimpse into the everyday lives, struggles and successes of beloved musicians and artists. Rarely, do they paint a flattering picture. Yes, there's fame and adoration, but there are also egos, addictions and insecurities. Often all at once.</p>
        
            <p>The humble music genre bursts with brilliant entries. Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest shows fame and fortune dissolving firm friendships, I Am: Celine Dion is a harrowing watch and the tragicomedy of Anvil! The Story of Anvil is a real-life Spinal Tap. This week, Becoming Led Zeppelin also thunders into cinemas.</p>
        
            <p>Here in Aotearoa, we aren't without our own worthy entries. There's the brilliant Taite Music Prize-winning King Loser, the hugely recommended The Chills: The Triumph and Tragedy of Martin Phillipps and 2012's cracking rockumentary Shihad: Beautiful Machine.</p>
        
            <p>As you can see there's no shortage of bangers, but here are the ones we think top the charts.</p>
        
            <p>As unique and brilliant as its subject this 2022 documentary about David Bowie's life is a vivid piece of pop art, that's a kaleidoscopic trip through the singer's art, life and philosophy. It rejuvenates archival footage into something jaw-droppingly cool and uses his old interviews to have Bowie narrate the film himself. Simply, a must-see.</p>
        
            <p>This utterly compelling 2004 doco charts the unlikely rise of frenemy bands The Dandy Warhols and The Brian Jonestown Massacre and the breakdown of their relationship as fame, success, jealousy and heavy drugs all enter their worlds - albeit at vastly different levels.</p>
        
            <p>A haunting and heartbreaking look at the life and tragically early death of powerhouse soul singer Amy Winehouse and the demons that plagued her. This 2015 doco is filled with rare home footage and is guaranteed to leave you a blubbering mess by the end of it.</p>
        
            <p>America was engulfed by riots following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. This 2008 documentary recounts how Boston was saved thanks to the Godfather of Soul, his electrifying concert the following night and the city-saving decision to televise the gig live in the hopes that would keep people at home. An astounding reminder of both the power of music and the power of the people.</p>
        
            <p>This controversial 1998 doco about the shocking death of grunge icon Kurt Cobain deep dives into the various conspiracies surrounding the Nirvana frontman's death, including the popular tinfoil-hat theory that his wife, fellow grunge superstar Courtney Love, was maliciously involved.</p>

            <p>Egos and addiction clash in 2004's gripping doco about the almighty tensions threatening to destroy the world's biggest band. In a last-ditch attempt to save the group - and themselves - a therapist is called in. It's an utterly fascinating, all-access look into the drumstick-throwing, door-slamming inner world of a metal monster that almost devoured its creators.</p>
        
            <p>This 2017 doco on Wellington's wildly degenerate rockers Head Like a Hole is as raw, greasy and shockingly uncompromising as the band itself. Filmed over a decade, it's a cautionary tale and a redemption story that's been cranked up to 11.</p>
        
            <p>British punk revolutionaries Sex Pistols are touring here in April so brush up on your history with this gobby 2000 documentary about the hugely influential band. Told through remarkable archival footage and interviews it shows how the sneering outrage merchants formed, violently changed the trajectory of British music forever and chaotically imploded in a little over two years.</p>
        
            <p>It's no exaggeration to say this 1967 doco set the template for the modern music doco genre. It documents the 1965 UK tour that Bob Dylan undertook after betraying his folk fans by plugging in an electric guitar. The film is filled with legendary scenes of a bored, snarky Dylan backstage and simply transcendent performances onstage.</p>
