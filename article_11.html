            <p>What would you do if you became a billionaire?</p>
        
            <p>Well when, Jon Collins-Black has found himself in that position, and decided to recapture the imagination of his youth and set up a treasure hunt across America.</p>
        
            <p>His new book There's Treasure Inside contains all of the necessary clues to find the five treasure chests.</p>
        
            <p>Collins-Black told Sunday Morning the idea was inspired by his hunt for art dealer Forrest Fenn's treasure years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I think [the treasure hunter] spirit was always with me and I was like 'wow, what would it be like to go out and hunt for treasure?' I did a lot of research and that's when I came across Forrest Fenn's treasure and I got really into it for a while."</p>
        
            <p>Collins-Black hid five treasure chests across America, each with their own themes and unique mechanics.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the treasures is larger than the other four and the other four are around similar size," he said.</p>
        
            <p>There was even a treasure box themed around Forrest Fenn and that included some of his original treasures.</p>
        
            <p>The puzzle boxes also included a fourth century BC gold greek loral, a 1960 gold olympic mental won by sprinter sprinter Wilma Rudolph, and even Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's sapphire diamond brooch.</p>
        
            <p>The whole process took Collins-Black five years, which he believed was well worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a venture to get people off of their cell-phones, away from TVs and out into nature because we have this beautiful world outside, and I don't think we pay attention to it as much as we should.</p>
        
            <p>"That was one of the things that I really experienced when I was searching for Forrest Fenn's treasure, just the joy of being outside."</p>
        
            <p>The billionaire made his fortune by creating several successful job hunt websites after the financial crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of unemployment in the United States and people were looking for jobs, so I created free job sites for people to get information on how to apply and the best places to look," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Collins-Black sold the websites and invested most of the money into Bitcoin which was a "good financial investment."</p>
        
            <p>A digital version of his book was set to be released in the next few days. The physically copies sold out but Collins-Black wanted the book to be accessible to all.</p>
        
            <p>"I really wanted to open this up to everyone no matter what their background is.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a lot about having the right spirit. It may sound like a clich√©' but its really not, its really about the experience of going out and hunting," he said.</p>
        
            <p>All five treasure chests remained unfound but all were on public land, no further than 4.8 kilometres from a road and were not buried underground.</p>
