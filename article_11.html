        <h2>Peter Pan production packs humour, heart, and magic</h2>
        <p>
The Darling family has a distinct Kiwi charm; Wendy has a bit more attitude, John is bit less sophisticated, Mrs Darling lovingly scolds her kids in Samoan, and Mr Darling is a grumpy man, worked up about not getting to a BBQ on time.

            <p>As a six-year-old, I was completely captivated by PJ Hogan's live-action Peter Pan (2003); there was something about the magical, sort of dreamlike quality of Neverland, the reckless abandon of the Lost Boys, and the boyish charm of Jeremy Sumpter's Peter, that tapped into how I wanted to be - that is, equal parts sweet and mischevious, and maybe a little angsty.</p>
        
            <p>Of course every generation has their own connection to JM Barrie's classic tale of the boy who wouldn't grow up. For many, it's the 1953 Disney animated classic Peter Pan or 1991's Hook. For a new generation of children, there's now a joyous local theatre production; Carl Bland's Peter Pan, presented by Auckland Theatre Company and Nightsong.</p>

            <p>It's playing for one month at the ASB Waterfront Theatre, from 8 October to 3 November. On Thursday night, I wandered down to check it out.</p>
        
            <p>A group of girls wearing facepaint and fairy skirts tugged their parents' hands as a fabulous Anika Moa, dressed head to tail in mermaid garb, waved them in from the corner of the stage. As soon as the lights went off and the curtains went up, it was clear this version of Peter Pan would be different.</p>

            <p>In Bland's rendition, the Darling family has a distinct Kiwi charm; Wendy has a bit more attitude, John is bit less sophisticated, Mrs Darling lovingly scolds her kids in Samoan, and Mr Darling is a grumpy man, worked up about not getting to a BBQ on time.</p>
        
            <p>There's also a real life dog playing Nana, and Tiger Lily is a fearless talking wolf (rather than a problematic Native American caricature).</p>
        
            <p>The character changes are refreshing, but they're also underpinned with some sadness. The Darling family is riddled with grief because they've lost Michael Darling - the youngest member of their family - and they haven't quite come to terms with his death yet.</p>
        
            <p>Immediately, the emotionality of this production is strong. But it's also light and comical and slapstick when it needs to be.</p>

            <p>As the story continues, the gang meet Peter and Tinkerbell, and an impressive series of technical theatrics unfolds. Pan actor Theo Shakes enters suspended above stage, even managing a mid-air flip before whisking the Darling siblings away to Neverland.</p>
        
            <p>Of course flying is an important element to the charm of Peter Pan - watching this young boy leap from cloud to cloud, swordfight in the air and relentlessly tease the aging Hook is all part of the fun. And Bland's Peter Pan makes sure to pulls out all the stops.</p>
        
            <p>The stage transforms the Darling home into Hook's pirate ship with ease, and features some impressive technical props along the way, including a mechanical crocodile, moving mermaid tails, and a pit in the middle of the stage where characters fall "overboard".</p>
        
            <p>It even manages to recreate the iconic scene in which Tick Tock the Crocodile Swallows Hook whole.</p>

            <p>Jennifer Ludlam is a standout in her double role as Captain Hook and Mr Darling - she's hilariously cruel, shooting down fairies, cutting the heads off birds, and chopping off a poor pirate's ear.</p>
        
            <p>In one scene, Ludlam even appears on stage as both her characters, slipping away behind a stump for seconds at a time to switch costumes between dialogue.</p>
        
            <p>It's all just as funny as it sounds, and what makes it sweeter is the whisper of small voices in the crowd: 'Why did she do that?' 'Where is she going?' 'Is Hook the same as the dad?'</p>

            <p>Bland's Peter Pan is full of humour, heart, and plenty of theatrical magic to captivate audiences of all ages. It might run a touch too long for the little ones, but honestly, it's school holidays - I say let the kids stay up and soak in a bit of extra magic.</p>
