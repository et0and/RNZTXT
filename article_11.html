            <p>Run out of stuff to watch? Join us as we excavate the streamers' back catalogues for the shows we might have missed. This week: Patrick Melrose.</p>
        
            <p>Benedict Cumberbatch stars as the wealthy, dissipated Patrick Melrose in this adaptation of the acclaimed semi-autobiographical Edward St. Aubyn novels.</p>
        
            <p>We first meet Melrose in epsiode one, 'Bad News', getting a call telling him his father David has died. It's a landline call, because this is 1982. Melrose slumps to the floor, a smile spreading across his face as a syringe drops from his hand.</p>
        
            <p>Melrose leaves London and careens through New York ingesting industrial quantities of drugs on a mission to collect his father's ashes which he cradles back to London on Concorde.</p>
        
            <p>Episode 2 ('Never Mind') set in France in the 1960s, makes clear why the adult Melrose is such a mess. David, played with sneering malevolence by Hugo Weaving, rapes Patrick repeatedly over a four-five year period. His mother, heiress Eleanor, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, is either too wasted on cocktails and Valium to notice, or turns a glazed, blind eye.</p>
        
            <p>Part brutal memoir, part searing satire, St. Aubyn's absence of self-pity and stiletto-sharp take on the snobbery, shallowness and sadism of the English upper classes is brilliantly brought to screen life by writer David Nicholls and director Edward Berger.</p>
        
            <p>Cumberbatch is excellent here, in a role seemingly made for him, as he portrays Melrose recovering, building a family, relapsing and finally finding redemption and a kind of fragile acceptance.</p>
