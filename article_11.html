            <p>Kim Yeji made quite the impression at her Olympics debut. The South Korean sharp-shooter stepped out at the women's 10m air pistol final donning cyborgian shooter glasses and a black track suit, looking somewhat like a sci-fi assassin, and stepped away with a silver medal.</p>
        
            <p>She's one of many athletes bringing style and flair to the tournament - this year, bougie custom nails, relaxed street styles, and personalised hair and makeup trends are all the rage.</p>
