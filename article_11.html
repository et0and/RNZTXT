            <p>In 1915, Samoan independence activist I’iga Pisa was condemned to exile in Saipan by the German colonisers of Samoa.
In an extraordinary feat, he escaped from his 5 year exile sentence by secretly carving out an outrigger canoe and paddling from Saipan to Guam. This was a distance of more than 150 km over a period of several days in which he navigated using the stars.</p>
        
            <p>He had taught himself German during the colonial period of German rule in Samoa, but on landing in American-ruled Guam, he learned that New Zealand had taken over as the new colonial rulers of Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>I'iga taught himself English and travelled by boat from Guam to Hawai’i, another U.S. territory in the early 1920s. In Hawai'i, he worked in a printing firm and improved his English with the aim of returning to his homeland of Samoa and fighting for Samoan sovereignty - this time against the New Zealand administration.</p>
        
            <p>I’iga worked for the Department of Samoan Affairs, under the New Zealand Administration, until 1942.</p>
        
            <p>I'iga was the only one of the exiled Samoan revolutionaries who survived to see Samoa win back its freedom from New Zealand in 1962.</p>
