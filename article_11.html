            <p>David Cronenberg's 1979 body horror movie The Brood teases in its trailer that it's "a film so terrifying that it will devastate you totally".</p>
        
            <p>What possesses us to love horror films so?</p>
        
            <p>Curator of Screams may have the answer. They are a collaboration between two contemporary art and horror film lovers, Dowse Art Museum senior curator Chelsea Nichols and City Gallery Wellington senior curator Aaron Lister.</p>
        
            <p>Through their Instagram account and exhibition curation, singularly, and together they explore how art and horror film can be "born of the same dark womb".</p>
        
            <p>Curator of Screams believe horror is again having a cultural moment. They have a new exhibition The Brood at the Dowse and take their title from Cronenberg's film.</p>
        
            <p>In that film a mentally ill mother is said to undergo an experimental 'psychoplasmic' treatment, causing her to give birth to monstrous little 'rage babies' that wreak havoc on her behalf.</p>
        
            <p>Nichols and Lister equate this to the sense sometimes for artists, that artworks might "sometimes operate like wayward, feral children left to run amok in the world."</p>

            <p>The exhibition features nine new commissions from artists who they consider some of the most interesting on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"A new generation," they said, "of brooding, gothy children" There's a general gothic menace to the exhibition but there are also horror film references aplenty: from the demonic dog of Cujo (1983) to Buffalo Bill's dance from The Silence of the Lambs (1991).</p>
        
            <p>Horror is a safe place for us to explore our most irrational fears, Nichols told RNZ's Culture 101.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very safe place, at the end of that movie, you turn it off, you hit rewind on your VHS, if you grew up in the '90s, and that is a place where you can then process it.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not us facing the horrors of the world that we're actually exposed to on the news every day."</p>
        
            <p>The film The Brood is the "embodiment of rage and frustration," said Lister.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about that inside-outside, inside the body, outside the body of the world, turning one's inner monstrosities out into that public space."</p>

            <p>The works in the exhibition can be seen as the demonic offspring in The Brood, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We love the idea of the artworks inside the exhibition operating as kind of little hatchlings and monsters. These little demon beings being let out to do their thing."</p>
        
            <p>The Brood is at the Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt until 22 June.</p>
