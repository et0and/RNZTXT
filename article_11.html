        <h2>Mike Chunn on the magic of music</h2>
        <p>
The music industry legend chats to Summer Times about Split Enz, agoraphobia and some of his favourite songs. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Making music has always been "integral, integral, integral" to the life of Mike Chunn – founding member of Split Enz and creator of the youth songwriting charity Play It Strange.</p>
        
            <p>Chunn tells Anna Thomas that he likes to play piano alone, acoustic guitar after drinking (often with his son Barney singing) and bass guitar in front of a large-as-possible crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest I've played in front of I think was Sweetwaters [with Citizen Band] – 35,000 or something. I remember walking out and taking 'this'll do me'."</p>

            <p>Chunn has been a member of three bands: the early '70s cover band Moses – "I've never found anyone who ever saw us but we did exist" – Citizen Band and Split Enz.</p>
        
            <p>He first met Split Enz bandmate Tim Finn at high school, then one day in the fourth form, they jumped on stage and played 'To Love Somebody'.</p>
        
            <p>"This terrified Te Awamutu lad sang like a bird. And I thought I need to hold on to this kid's coat for the rest of my life and I did the best I could at doing that."</p>
        
            <p>Chunn was at engineering school and living with his mum in Parnell when Tim and Phil Judd visited one day and played three "shockingly good" songs they'd written – 'Split Ends', 'Wise Men' and 'For You'.</p>
        
            <p>"I just said, Listen, if you're looking for a bass player…' and Tim said, well, actually, that's why we're here."</p>
        
            <p>About four weeks later, Split Ends (yet to become 'Enz') played those three songs at Auckland venue Levi's Saloon, scoring themselves a manager and a gig at the Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival.</p>

            <p>The band's signature clothing and hairstyles didnt happen till percussionist Noel Crombie entered the fold, Chunn says.</p>
        
            <p>"He joined by just actually at one show walking on stage with a suit on and pulling out some spoons from his coat pockets. And he started playing the spoons with us.</p>
        
            <p>"There was never an official application form to fill out to want to be in that band. He just became a crucial part of the band and the costumes and everything were driven by him. Noel Crombie, he's the man."</p>
        
            <p>As a band, Split Enz loved attention, Chunn says.</p>
        
            <p>"We were kind of sweetly arrogant, really."</p>
        
            <p>He describes being in the band as like "living on a strange, weird planet".</p>
        
            <p>"Everything was kind of just… new. And it was very exciting, I was really excited about the whole thing."</p>
        
            <p>During his time with Split Enz, fuelled by "a cocktail of drugs", Chunn had a traumatic event that left him in absolute terror and which nine years later he realised was agoraphobia related to travelling.</p>
        
            <p>It's a misconception that agoraphobia is the fear of open spaces, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's being scared of leaving where you feel safe."</p>
        
            <p>Chunn, who became a board member of the Anxiety NZ Trust in 1999, says he has never had a panic attack on the stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Do I regret the whole Split Enz thing having [agoraphobia] in it? Yes, I do. Do I regret the years of the drugs? Yes, I do. But do I regret the in toto picture that is life as a member of that band? Not at all. It was just a magical experience of life."</p>
        
            <p>Over the years, "in the stress of life, in this strange world of music" Chunn has had a couple of relapses but says he's now so much better.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of us – because we are a unique raft of society – have an [anti-anxiety] pill in the pocket, where it sits, and you travel and go to where you want to go and the pill is still in the bottom of your pocket.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit like a health insurance certificate, you take out health insurance but you don't necessarily claim. That was that is like, that pill on the pocket. It's a safety valve."</p>
        
            <p>Although he's now "stepped down a peg" at Play It Strange, as creative director, Chunn still loves promotes and nurturing up-and-coming musicians.</p>
        
            <p>The charity's songwriting competition – which has an average entry age of 16 – is a "magical world", Chunn says.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of emotion in the songs. One of the saddest was by a 15-year-old girl whose elder brother was going off to university and she couldn't stand the thought of his going. He, of course, didn't realise that she loved him so much.</p>
        
            <p>"The themes are pretty much consistent with quite deep emotions but they're becoming far more enunciated and sophisticated."</p>
        
            <p>The songs which make it into the recording studio are judged half on their lyrics and half on the music, Chunn says.</p>
        
            <p>"There are people who say 'I don't listen to words' but I don't believe them ... the lyrics of the teenagers in the Play It Strange world are increasingly magnificent."</p>
        
            <p>He recommends ‘Rainbow Skies’ by Guntaas Oberoi:</p>
        
            <p>Two of a Kind' ​by Split Enz:</p>
        
            <p>In 1983, after making two albums with Split Enz, Chunn was running Mushroom Records when the track 'Two of a Kind' came out.</p>
        
            <p>"If you peel it back like an onion, it's pretty much the brothers singing about themselves. Two of a kind. Theyre very good at wearing their hearts on the sleeves."</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>'No Telling When' by The Muttonbirds:</p>
        
            <p>"I first came across Don [McGlashan] when he was in Blam Blam Blam … It wasn't really until he started coming through with Muttonbirds albums and some of the Front Lawn stuff that I realised he is a lyrical genius, and his whole encapsulating what it is to be in New Zealand, to be a New Zealander.</p>
        
            <p>"Plus he also had this wonderful focus on the sea and lakes and rivers … that is a very poignant aspect of his lyric writing. I think he's just such a man of true colour and metaphor and all that kind of stuff that great lyric-writers are.</p>
        
            <p>"This one is about the ocean … opening lines because he can draw you in like in an instant. Are these the hands of a man? I suppose so. I recall them shaking the hands of other men.</p>
        
            <p>"Don was a champion yachtsman when he was a youngun. Water is very much a very important part of the Don McGlashan life … there are a lot of them about water. 'Anchor Me' would probably be the most famous."</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>'America' by Simon & Garfunkel:</p>
        
            <p>"Mr. Garfunkel, I mean, God bless him but really [Simon & Garfunkel] is all about Paul Simon and his encapsulating American life in two-to-three minutes songs.</p>
        
            <p>"At school, we were very focused on Paul Simon's songs. I also chose the song 'America' because it doesn't have one rhyme.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the sort of craft of someone like Paul Simon. You're listening to the song and it has a really positive effect, the fact that he is essentially just talking and yet it's one of the great musical tracks we ever heard … Tim [Finn] and I used to listen to this 'America' song a lot."</p>
