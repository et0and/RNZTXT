        <h2>At The Movies: How to Have Sex</h2>
        <p>
British coming of age film How to Have Sex is a tale that’s, if not quite as old as time, certainly a familiar one to anyone who’s ever been a teenager, writes Simon Morris. Video, Audio

            <p>How to Have Sex is a tale that’s, if not quite as old as time, certainly a familiar one to anyone who’s ever been a teenager.</p>
        
            <p>Three 16-year-old English girls – Tara, Skye and Em – are off on their first solo holiday, away from their families. </p>
        
            <p>Which means a Mediterranean resort - in this case on Crete – loud music, more booze than is good for them, and if they’re lucky, plenty of holiday hookups.</p>

            <p>There may be pursed lips among some people outside that demographic. But I think most of us have memories of when we were young, dumb and off the leash for the first time.  </p>
        
            <p>On day one, the girls are already chorusing “Best holiday ever!”</p>
        
            <p>Skye seems the most worldly, Em is the most book-smart, while Tara is the most engaging – fun, boisterous, up for anything, a bit naïve.   </p>
        
            <p>Tara’s not particularly well-hidden secret is she’s still a virgin, and plans to rectify matters on this holiday.</p>
        
            <p>And in many ways that’s almost all the story.  </p>
        
            <p>How to Have Sex was written and directed by a young cinematographer called Molly Manning Walker – she shot a little charmer called Scrapper last year - and the subject is one she’s clearly pretty familiar with.</p>
        
            <p>Walker doesn’t fall into the trap of making her young leads better or smarter than they need to be.  </p>
        
            <p>The three girls meet a trio staying next door – two guys, Badger and Paddy, and their platonic female buddy Paige – a nice touch.  But we have no more idea what to expect from them than Tara, Skye and Em do.</p>
        
            <p>There’s every indication that it could all go terribly wrong – particularly in a resort full of extremely drunk, British teenagers. </p>
        
            <p>When Tara – adventurous but younger and smaller than her friends - gets separated at a sleazy nightclub, we can only suspect the worst.</p>
        
            <p>If ever there was a movie designed to bring out the worried parent in an older audience, it’s How to Have Sex. Honestly Tara, have you no idea what can happen at places like this?     [Have you read that guy’s tattoos? Did you ask what they put in that drink?]</p>
        
            <p>The obvious response is “Calm down, grandpa. We’re teenagers, we’ll be fine.” Which at most of these places is true.  Mostly…</p>
        
            <p>But, as the title suggests, if you want to learn How to Have Sex, I’m afraid you’re going to have to meet someone.  </p>
        
            <p>And with all those flashing lights, deafening beats and drunken strangers, telling Mr Right from Mr Very Wrong is pretty much the luck of the draw.</p>
        
            <p>The two reasons why How to Have Sex is rather better than you might think are star Mia McKenna-Bruce whose expressive face is her fortune, and writer director Molly Manning Walker. Everyone has three names these days.</p>
        
            <p>Walker’s script seems so true, it feels like a young girl’s journal. For all I know it is. It’s all in the detail, and her direction is spot-on too. </p>
        
            <p>Her camera background means she knows where to look of course. But the performances she brings out of her young actors are something special too.</p>
