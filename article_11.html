            <p>Broadcaster Matt Heath is leaving Radio Hauraki after 13 years, he told listeners through tears on the Breakfast show on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to his Breakast show co-host of 10 years, Jeremy Wells, an emotional Heath said: "Every day you make me laugh. You're bloody brilliant mate. Not seeing you every day will be a huge gap in my intellectual and emotional life. Hopefully we can find some time for a few lunches at Prego in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Wells replied: "There's not a dry eye in the house".</p>
        
            <p>Heath shared the news more widely via social media, confirming with a gag, "I haven't been fired or anything".</p>

            <p>He gave no other details about where he was going next, but New Zealand Herald's Media Insider column revealed Heath would be the new co-host of Newstalk ZB's Afternoons programme, alongside Tyler Adams, kicking off on 7 October.</p>
        
            <p>Adams has been producing the Afternoons show for several years, which was hosted by Simon Barnett and James Daniels. Barnett previously announced a move to More FM and Daniels signed off for the final time last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"It a very sad day. I love this station with all my heart. The Matt and Jerry Show has been the best job anyone could hope for," Heath wrote on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been paid to laugh and chat with best friends every morning. Plus we have the greatest funniest listeners. Thanks for being there with us over the years. I have enjoyed every second luckily for me I had ten years of it. Thirteen at Hauraki in total. Most grateful for that.</p>
        
            <p>"I will miss you all deeply. But all good things must come to an end sometime. This is my time. Being the Matt in The Matt and Jerry Show has been wicked."</p>

There was not a dry eye this morning when Heath announced his news.

            <p>Heath told the NZ Herald that he had not been looking to move, unless something "challenging and awesome" had come along.</p>
        
            <p>"It's big. It's a different role to what I've done before. There's a lot more talking, so no songs to hide behind. I'm looking forward to having fun, but also going deeper into some issues."</p>
