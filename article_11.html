            <p>As two New Zealanders vie for the best dressed and best suited titles at Melbourne Cup 2024 Fashions on the Field event, check out some of the amazing looks rolling in as the gates open for racing.</p>
        
            <p>Going strong for 62 years and considered one of the highlights, Fashions on the Field includes contests over several days at Flemington Course, where the pool prize offered is more than $A370,000 ($NZ408,000).</p>
        
            <p>Even without a competition though, attendees and members at the Melbourne Cup racing itself are known to make an effort to dress up - making a statement with bright coloured outfits and eye-catching head pieces.</p>

Racegoers got Vogue's memo about vibrant colours being the one of the go-to trends this year for racing season. Hints of creativity coming through with the sort of puffed of lip shaped-hat, bow ties on handbags and the veiled wide brim hat.

Deborah J Quinn - labelled by Vogue as "the world's biggest Stephen Jones client" - certainly indulges in the freedom of expression in her style. She doesn't miss a trick whether it be the lace fingerless gloves, shimmering metallic head piece, or thick-rimmed Windsor-style sunnies.

            <p>The general public can dress as they please, but there are some guidelines for members to adhere to in terms of how much skin they're allowed to show and suitability, otherwise they risk not being allowed in to their designated area.</p>
        
            <p>Clothes deemed not acceptable for members include garments showing the belly button or with an open back below the waist, short jumpsuits/playsuits or shorts above the knee, bralettes and bandeau crop tops, jeans, torn or ripped clothing even if considered 'designer' tears, leggings worn as pants, denim, parkas, and duffle coats.</p>
        
            <p>That's not all, the list also bans certain footwear like joggers, sports shoes, track shoes, runners, slippers, gumboots, or thongs.</p>
