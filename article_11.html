            <p>What’s the secret to a great sandwich? It should have a mix of hot, cold, sweet, sour, crunchy and soft, says chef Max Halley.</p>
        
            <p>Halley started his career working in Michelin Star restaurants but has become a legend on the London food scene with his Max’s Sandwich Shop in North London.</p>

            <p>Its success has spawned a TV show and three books, the most recent Max's World Of Sandwiches, dedicated to the art of stuffing things between bread.</p>
        
            <p>The core contrasts of hot, cold, sweet, sour, crunchy and soft is where the “deliciousness is to be found,” Halley tells Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>“All of the sandwiches in my restaurant have had a deep-fried element, we live in a sandwich world where people seem to claim that lettuce is crunchy, and to me, that is an abomination. Lettuce is fresh and crisps are crunchy.”</p>
        
            <p>Crunch is the element missing from most sandwiches, he says. So how to you bring the crunch?</p>
        
            <p>“Croutons...we have a sandwich that has spring rolls in it. The truth is, if it's been deep-fried it is likely to provide excellent crunch.”</p>
        
            <p>“I am a fan of melted cheese in a sandwich. What I am not a fan of is big slabs of cold cheese, which to me personally is just like putting candle wax in a sandwich.”</p>
        
            <p>“Blending them up and mixing them into mayonnaise is the secret to putting most things in a sandwich,” he says.</p>
        
            <p>“If you try spreading mustard on a piece of toast evenly you will quickly see how much easier it would be were you to mix that mustard into mayonnaise and then spread it on your bread.”</p>
        
            <p>“Cook your bacon slowly so that lots of fat renders out of it. And then mix that fat into mayonnaise and have it in your sandwich."</p>
        
            <p>He even mixes gravy with mayonnaise at his shop, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“All the meats that we put in sandwiches at my sandwich shop are braised meats, meats cooked in liquid fundamentally, meats that end up with gravy.</p>
        
            <p>“The night before I opened my sandwich shop I braised this beef, and in the morning I was taking the beef out of the braising liquid to put it into a tub in order to use it in sandwiches later.</p>
        
            <p>"And I was just looking at this vast tub of gravy and thinking, how can I put that into a sandwich without making it fall apart? and I realised that all I had to do was boil the cooking liquid down and then mix it into mayonnaise - and gravy mayonnaise was born.”</p>
        
            <p>“Rather than using slices of bread. I think pieces of bread, or buns or little ciabatta is the way to go if you have as liberal an attitude to mayonnaise as I do.”</p>
        
            <p>Halley’s a big fan of the yeasty, salty spreads.</p>
        
            <p>“One of the things that my mum used to make for me when I was little was a cucumber sandwiches with Marmite.</p>
        
            <p>“Cucumber and Marmite sandwiches are absolutely fantastic. And I think that's often one of the nice things to do is to make a completely normal sandwich you already make and think about one roguey thing that you could put in there.”</p>
