        <h2>Japanese footwear turns heads - but what makes it so special?</h2>

            <p>These oddly shaped shoes are turning heads from Hollywood to Melbourne's Swanston Street.</p>
        
            <p>First released in the late 1980s, high-end French fashion brand Maison Margiela's cloven-hoof-like tabi shoes were inspired by the Japanese footwear of the same name.</p>
        
            <p>Designer Martin Margiela said he first saw them being worn by construction workers during a visit to Japan.</p>
        
            <p>The brand's range these days include loafers, boots and ballet flats - the most popular retailing for A$1430 (NZ$1590) a pair.</p>
        
            <p>They even have a rhinestone cowboy-boot style with a price tag of A$12,790.</p>
        
            <p>In the West, Margiela's polarising designs have long been a symbol of wealth and style.</p>
        
            <p>But recently a new generation of celebrities have discovered the tabis, bringing them into the public consciousness.</p>
        
            <p>Zendaya wore them in Sydney, Pedro Pascal on the red carpet, and Dua Lipa during on a night out in New York.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Vogue India declared the Maison Margiela tabis "shoes of the year".</p>
        
            <p>That accolade followed a viral saga on social media platform TikTok, when a New York content creator went on a Tinder date with someone who stole her A$1800 tabis - and was later able to track down the thief.</p>
        
            <p>The split-toe design of tabis is thought to have originally come to Japan from China in the 5th century as socks - which worked well with thongs.</p>
        
            <p>In the 15th century, a version made out of a single piece of leather that could be worn outdoors became popular.</p>
        
            <p>Later, when leather prices increased, cotton started to be used.</p>
        
            <p>Shojiro Ishibashi - who would go on to found Bridgestone tyres - reinvented the tabi in 1922 by reinforcing the soles with rubber and metal latches.</p>

            <p>These days in Japan, the sock form of tabi is once again most common.</p>
        
            <p>Tabi shoes, now known as jika-tabi, are still being worn at traditional summer festivals which often involve carrying portable shrines around the neighbourhood and dancing.</p>
        
            <p>They are also still popular among construction workers - who wear them with baggy trousers that allow the wearer to feel the wind and maintain their balance when working high up.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike their French designer interpretation, these tabi-style shoes - which often have steel-reinforced toes - usually retail for just A$50.</p>
        
            <p>RMIT fashion design lecturer Alexandra Sherlock said the polarising cloven-hoof shape of the tabi had always garnered attention for Western audiences, especially in fashion circles.</p>
        
            <p>"[Margiela] is not making the tabi just because it's unusual, but he's doing it to deconstruct notions around beauty and what we consider beautiful and what we might consider ugly," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Sherlock said tabis were popular because they signalled the owner understood high fashion and could afford them.</p>

            <p>The Marugo company in the city of Kurashiki has made tabis for over 100 years, and are one of the few dedicated tabi makers still in business in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Akira Namidome from Marugo told the ABC that the popularity of tabis in the West was helping keep the tradition alive in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>"We have always sold a consistent amount of tabis for the summer festival," Namidome said.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said fewer people had been taking part in these festivals in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>But adapting to changing trends is helping to keep businesses like Marugo open.</p>
        
            <p>The company created a new line of tabis geared towards their fashion-forward clientele, with a diverse range of styles and materials.</p>
        
            <p>Maki Hashimoto from SOU SOU, a Japanese textile maker which sells tabis with colourful patterns made with traditional materials, said half their clientele were from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>While the popularity of tabis has risen internationally, Hashimoto said she hoped Japanese people would continue to enjoy the shoes - and that the tradition would not be lost.</p>
        
            <p>"When I first joined the company a few decades ago, there were at least a dozen tabi makers, but now there are only three major ones including Marugo," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wear them to work, I wear them when I go running, when I go play golf â€¦ I want everyone to see why I love them so much."</p>
