            <p>In a large warehouse, not far from Taupō, a young couple is busy bagging gourmet mushrooms. </p>
        
            <p>Their established vegetable garden and loyal Jack Russell terrier make it difficult to imagine the pair once lived a city life in Auckland. </p>

            <p>Benson Thomas and Hattie MacLennan took the plunge into a new food production venture in January 2023 using the Thomas family's earthworks company to clear their farm paddocks. </p>
        
            <p>They transformed four hectares into land suitable for mushroom growing and the result is Forage Mushroom Co. </p>
        
            <p>They produce several varieties of oyster mushrooms -  Italian, Phoenix (which are native to New Zealand) and Pink - selling them at farmers' markets, to online customers and to local restaurants. </p>

            <p>Forage was born during the pandemic when the pair began brainstorming a new way to make a living. </p>
        
            <p>Thomas had a background in agricultural and applied science and was interested in horticulture and in 2020 he unearthed an obsession with mycology, the study of fungi. </p>
        
            <p>MacLennan, meanwhile, was working in HR and realised she could work remotely when they made the switch to rural living. </p>
        
            <p>She calls Wednesday her "forage day", harvesting and bagging the mushrooms for customers across the region.   </p>

            <p>Forage's HQ is a 600 square metre warehouse brimming with shipping containers and climate-controlled, purpose-built equipment and mushroom grow kits which the pair sell online to those who want to grow their own in just six days. </p>

            <p>Starting a business from the ground up hasn't all been smooth sailing though. </p>
        
            <p>Thomas wants to see more regulation as he says their small business has battled to compete with so-called New Zealand mushrooms, which originate in China at a cheaper price and are sent here to "grow".  </p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year Thomas made the difficult decision to pull 300 kgs of his produce from Asian food stores in Auckland because it was being undercut.</p>
        
            <p>The volume drove the price down and it wasn't viable for Forage to continue with that market, he said. </p>

            <p>Oyster mushrooms are famous for being able to handle high cooking heat without losing their volume. </p>
        
            <p>"We whack them on your plate, Bob's your uncle," MacLennan said, cooking up a plate of Forage fungi for Country Life, with fresh elephant garlic from Hawkes Bay, homegrown thyme and chilli oil.</p>
        
            <p>Positive feedback about their produce has prompted the couple to start working with chefs to develop a new food product they hope to sell to supermarkets. </p>
