Award-winning Appleby Farms ice cream is crafted from cow milk that's travelled "down the road" from Murray King's farm. Audio

            <p>Milk from Murray King's farm on the lower Waimea River flats is crafted into award-winning ice cream.</p>
        
            <p>"We had to find a way of generating better income than we would by producing whole milk powder with the major dairy companies," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The third-generation farmer wanted his small dairy farm, which is surrounded by horticulture and lifestyle blocks, to remain economically viable, so he co-founded Appleby Farms with his neighbour, Julian Raine.</p>

            <p>The challenge was coming up with a unique milk product that they could build a story around.</p>
        
            <p>After a lot of research, including taking part in Te Hono Ideas Bootcamp, they settled on ice cream.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we thought it would be relatively easy, and most importantly, we knew somebody who could make ice cream, which is Kristy Giles!"</p>
        
            <p>Kristy came on board as a co-founder. She is a food technologist and ice cream maker extraordinaire.</p>
        
            <p>That was seven years ago and, initially, Murray said it was a rocky road.</p>
        
            <p>"These things always take longer than you hope and cost more than you expect."</p>
        
            <p>"We built a factory and, you know, steel and concrete isn't the cheapest thing to build, plus all the machinery and the plant that's required to churn ice cream."</p>

            <p>The factory in Stoke is only eight kilometres from the milking shed on Murray's farm.</p>
        
            <p>"We moved onto site at the beginning of July 2017 and we were making ice cream by December of that year, so it was quite a project!" Kristy said.</p>
        
            <p>She drives production and development and wants Appleby Farms to be the cream of the crop.</p>
        
            <p>"So I designed how I wanted the factory to be laid out, I formulated the ice cream and now I look after the operations, which is essentially from the farm to the customer."</p>

            <p>The business now employs about 10 full-time staff and makes more than a dozen flavours of ice cream. Vanilla and chocolate are the perennial favourites.</p>
        
            <p>So what makes a great ice cream?</p>
        
            <p>"Mostly it's fresh whole milk and lovely cream," Kristy said.</p>
        
            <p>"The quality of your dairy material is critical and because we source our milk from just down the road, that's an excellent starting point."</p>
