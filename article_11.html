            <p>A rare Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book has gone for more than $5000 to an overseas buyer at an Auckland-based online auction.</p>
        
            <p>The 1999 Bloomsbury-printed book has special features which set it apart from newer editions, such as dropped text on one page and J K Rowling listed as Joanne Rowling in the copyright section.</p>
        
            <p>The Estate at Webb's specialist Charlotte Dippie said this was what made it sought-after in the already highly collectable world of Pottermania.</p>
        
            <p>She believed this was one of roughly 2500 first edition Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban books available.</p>
        
            <p>"Harry Potter is such a dedicated fanbase. There is all kinds of collectors all over the world [for] who this would be quite a dream item," told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>"Also it could be seen as an investment piece, moreso overseas, but mainly what we've been experiencing is collectors [buying these books]."</p>

            <p>The unidentified vendor's mother is said to have purchased the book in 1999, around the same time the fantasy children's series was gaining attention.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't read many books as a kid ... and this must have been the first one. I did form an emotional attachment to it," the vendor said.</p>
        
            <p>Harry Potter first edition books have proven to have big value in global auction markets, with a Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first edition sold for £21,000 (NZ$46,000) last week.</p>
