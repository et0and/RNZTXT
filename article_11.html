        <h2>Banking on seeds for Raglan</h2>
        <p>
Locals in the seaside town of Raglan are making use of a community seed bank to plant their own veges. Audio

            <p>An old vault in the Raglan town hall has found a new purpose, keeping seeds fresh for sharing among the local community. </p>
        
            <p>The seed bank is part of community efforts to ensure cultivars suitable for the local climate keep growing, people-to-people connections thrive and there's food security for all.</p>
        
            <p>From the vault, the seeds are put onto a specially-made stand built out of scrap wood which is wheeled out on to the front steps of the town hall.</p>
        
            <p>From there passers-by can grab a handful of seed-raising mix from the bag nearby, pop it into a recycled seed punnet and take their pick from the seeds collected and packaged up by local volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>The seed bank has been going for 25 years and is among projects co-ordinated by Jasmine Hunter and Tania Ashman of the Whāingaroa Environment Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"We're keen on saving seeds and distributing seeds, because it's part of food sovereignty. So the idea is that people have control and access to growing their own food," Ashman explained.</p>
        
            <p>The pandemic brought a new lease of life to the seed bank and people can now get the seeds for free.</p>
        
            <p>Heritage plants and vegetables suited to local conditions are also being given the chance to thrive through the seed collecting.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of them are starting to become really associated with Raglan, so we're getting our own range and cultivars that really suit."</p>
        
            <p>"I've had teary moments actually," Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen teenage boys after school, stopping at the seed bank, filling up one of their punnets, and then a little grandma will come along and they'll have this beautiful interaction and connection. </p>
        
            <p>"The grandma will be teaching the teenage boy about the seed.</p>
        
            <p>"This is exactly why it exists. It's not just for food security. It's also for that personal connection between generations."</p>
