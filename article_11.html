        <h2>Movie review - Under Paris</h2>
        <p>
The new Netflix film Under Paris - part shark-thriller, part French cop movie and part Greenie parable - is beyond belief, says Simon Morris. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Under Paris is part shark-thriller, part French cop movie and part Greenie parable - which is why it's getting enthusiastic thumbs-ups from unexpected quarters. </p>
        
            <p>Full disclosure: when I saw the trailer for a film on Netflix called Under Paris I was intrigued. A blend of standard shark film and a police drama in modern-day Paris during a high-profile triathlon looked…. Well, as I say, intriguing.</p>
        
            <p>It stars the lovely Bérénice Bejo, who made a big splash (sorry) in the 2011 French Oscar-winner The artist.</p>
        
            <p>It opens strikingly enough - underneath acres of plastic rubbish in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Sophia heads a group of scientists tagging local sharks. One of them - they call her Lilith - turns up and kills them all - all but Sophia. Lilith used to be a common or garden-variety Mako shark. She's now a terrifying three times bigger. Something in the water, maybe?</p>
        
            <p>Three years later - that was quick - a still mourning Sophia has a new job in Paris, studying sharks. This is a bit of luck. She's told that Lilith has been traced, swimming up the Seine. Not just up the Seine, but just round the corner from Sophia's Paris home.</p>
        
            <p>What are the odds? You may well ask. As does the Mayor, concerned about the aquatic leg of her triathlon.</p>
        
            <p>Sophia is roped in to advise - after all, she's not only a shark expert, but she's got history with Lilith the Great Big Shark. She hooks up with river policeman Adil, who is sceptical.</p>
        
            <p>A shark under Paris? Sophia says cryptically "You had no question when it was a beluga and an orca." Sorry, what?</p>
        
            <p>I'm grateful that Netflix offers an English language version of the trailer. This is crazy enough without anything getting lost in translation.</p>
        
            <p>By now the shark squad includes the River Police, who want to shoot Lilith and a slightly irritating group of young Greenies who want to save our giant carnivorous friend. There's Sophia - I'm not sure what she wants to do - and the Mayor who refuses to believe the shark is even there.</p>
        
            <p>She is of course - "under Paris", otherwise there's no movie. But there's a twist. Lilith is not alone. There's at least one daughter, pointing to a potential sequel.</p>
        
            <p>The film opens on a quote from Charles Darwin - essentially "adapt or die". Perhaps the usually sequel-averse French film industry is picking up tips from people like Jerry Bruckheimer.</p>
        
            <p>To which all I can say is "don't pick up tips from Jerry Bruckheimer." I'm not sure Jerry would have approved of the music underpinning Under Paris - all very Eurovision - while topside tout l'enfer is breaking out.</p>
        
            <p>But by that time the number of questions being raised by this lunatic ratatouille of a movie were starting to overpower its initial entertainment value.</p>
        
            <p>Isn't a shark a salt-water fish? And isn't the Seine a bit chilly for sharks? How did it get past the many locks along the Seine? How and why did it get from Hawaii to Paris anyway? Was it followingt Sophia?</p>
        
            <p>And having ended the second act with a massive bloodbath, there's still half an hour to go. How do you top that? The answer - if you make it that far - will surprise you. Suffice to say: Sharks one, Paris nil.</p>
        
            <p>Under Paris is beyond belief, in other words, as is the unbounded enthusiasm among several people you'd think would know better.</p>
        
            <p>But of course, some people loved Snakes on a Plane.</p>
