            <p>Celebrities arrived in glamour to the British Film Academy Awards (BAFTAs) in London on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Scottish actor and Doctor Who lead David Tennant hosted the 78th edition of the awards, which featured musical performances from UK pop group Take That and Wicked star Jeff Goldblum.</p>
        
            <p>Monochromatic looks appeared to dominate the red carpet, in a similar fashion to the Grammys red carpet earlier this month as stars responded to the sombre mood in Los Angeles after the wildfires in January.</p>
        
            <p>The romanticism trend was kept alive, with US actress Pamela Anderson and Wicked actress Cynthia Erivo rocking bridal-style dresses.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's Wētā FX, which were nominated for their work on Better Man and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, missed out in the best visual special effects category to Dune: Part Two.</p>
