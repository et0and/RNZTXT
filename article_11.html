            <p>Acclaimed British coming-of-age drama How to Have Sex captures both the unabashed confidence of a teenager and the naivety and insecurity that comes with being a 15-year-old. Its star, Mia McKenna Bruce, says the script by Molly Manning Walker impressed her from the outset.</p>
        
            <p>“It just felt so real, it felt very conversational, very authentic," she tells Culture 101.</p>
        
            <p>“So as soon as I read it, I was like, I'd love to be a part of a part of doing this,” she says.</p>
        
            <p>The film is the directorial debut of Manning Walker, and has been a critical success, winning the Un Certain Regard award at Cannes Film Festival.</p>
        
            <p>Teenager Tara and her two friends are celebrating the end of exams with a trip to Malia, on the Greek Island of Crete. There’s drinking, clubbing, dancing, hooking-up in what should be one of the best summers of their lives. But the pressure on Tara to keep up with her more sexually-experienced friends takes a dark turn and leads to sexual assault.</p>
        
            <p>Tara was a relatable character, McKenna Bruce says.</p>
        
            <p>“Particularly, feeling one way, but putting out that you're kind of still your bubbly self, I think that we see a lot in Tara.</p>
        
            <p>“And I felt that a lot as a teenager, definitely trying to be the big personality at all times, even when I wasn't actually feeling it.”</p>

            <p>The film tackles consent, something that’s seldom discussed by teenagers, McKenna Bruce says.</p>
        
            <p>“It's not a lesson that we ever had in school. It's something you have to try and figure out yourself. And when you're that young with no instructions on how to do that, it's really confusing place to be.”</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to the film, McKenna Bruce’s star is on the rise. Her performance as Tara has won the EE BAFTA Rising Star Award, ‘Breakthrough Performer of the Year’ at the London Critics Circle Film Awards, ‘Best European Actress’ at the 2023 European Film Awards and ‘Lead Performance’ at this year’s British Independent Film Awards, beating Jodie Comer, Andrew Scott and Tilda Swinton.</p>
        
            <p>The reaction to the film caught the actors and crew by surprise, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“I think our goal was for it to resonate with some people and hopefully make a difference for them in their lives.</p>
        
            <p>“We had no idea it would get to this level.”</p>
        
            <p>How to Have Sex screened at the NZIFF in 2023 and will now be shown in cinemas in New Zealand from 7 March. </p>
