            <p>Dreamworks' latest movie has a stellar cast, gorgeous animation and a heart-warming story at its core. Is it a school holiday movie that all the family will love? RNZ visual journalist Sam Rillstone takes a look.</p>
        
            <p>The Wild Robot is based on the book series of the same name by Peter Brown. The story follows Roz the robot, who is shipwrecked on an island full of wildlife. Building relationships with the native animals, Roz is thrust into being a parent to an orphaned gosling named Brightbill. It's written and directed by Chris Sanders, of Lilo & Stitch fame.</p>
        
            <p>There's a strong cast: Lupita Nyong'o voices Roz, Pedro Pascal is Fink the Fox and Kit Connor is Brightbill. Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O'Hara and Ving Rhames also pop up in supporting roles.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, Nyong'o's performance is a bit underwhelming. The character is akin to a Baymax from Big Hero 6 or Wall-E, with a dry, naive innocence that is endearing. But as soon as Roz spoke I found that was somewhat broken. While the animation is full of charm, Roz's face is a similar design to Baymax, and the monotone voice has just got nothing behind it.</p>
        
            <p>It's such a shame, because all of the other voice performances have so much animation (excuse the pun). Pascal brings so much heart and richness to his performance, while O'Connor shows himself to be a real talent and, I reckon, a rising star if a voice acting career is in his future.</p>

            <p>Despite the clunky lead performance, I adored this film. Roz's non-speaking moments are great, with shades of the previously mentioned Baymax and Wall-E. What it means to be a parent - or choosing to be a parent - forms the film's emotional core.</p>
        
            <p>This is enhanced by Kris Bowers' powerful score. Swelling strings and pounding drums add so much to moments of triumph and sadness. It got a few tears from me multiple times - the sign of a great film, regardless of the target audience.</p>
        
            <p>It's also stunning to look at. The art style has a painterly quality, which Dreamworks seem to be leaning into following acclaim for the last Puss in Boots movie.</p>
        
            <p>While it's released just in time for the school holidays, The Wild Robot has enough in it for the whole family. There are even a couple of token adult jokes to keep you hooked - but the earnest heart of the film will do most of the heavy lifting.</p>
        
            <p>The Wild Robot (PG) is in cinemas now.</p>
