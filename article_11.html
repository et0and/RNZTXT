            <p>The journey through the "darkness" of grief is the inspiration behind alternative musician C. Zukey's latest album, Stonefruut.</p>
        
            <p>Zukey, a Canadian-born musician from Auckland, began writing the album following the birth of his son Bastian five years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The birth led to his wife, Lydia, sustaining a severe brain injury, he told Music 101.</p>
        
            <p>"Bastian was a big baby, he was also a bit late and because of that, Lydia was induced.</p>
        
            <p>"From the start of labour, it was really quite intense for hours. And then once Bastian was born, Lydia suffered just catastrophic haemorrhaging."</p>
        
            <p>The blood loss was so serious Lydia was unable to get enough oxygen to her brain, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So that caused severe global brain damage. It's been five years now and I feel like now we're in a pretty good place. Lydia is doing pretty well, she's home now finally, after staying at a brain injury rehab centre for many years."</p>

            <p>He poured the intense grief he experienced into Stonefruut, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a bit of a writer's block for a long time. And then, after Lydia's injury, I suddenly had just this huge well of inspiration. And because of that, I just wanted to write it all down.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, I just kept writing, and I just wrote so many songs. And I'm really, really proud and really happy with what I've created."</p>
        
            <p>While Lydia was home now, she was non-verbal and non-mobile, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"She is able to interact, and she is able to smile and laugh and understand jokes and listen to music and cry."</p>
        
            <p>Stonefruut captured the gamut of emotions he experienced following Lydia's injury, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are songs that are depressing, there are songs that are angry and there are songs that are a little bit bargaining, or in denial a little bit.</p>
        
            <p>"And then there are songs that are more in the acceptance stage."</p>
        
            <p>The album was not all sad, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to make sure that there was still hope, that you could still hear the hope in the songs. So even the more depressing songs on the album, there's always a little glimmer of hope."</p>
        
            <p>The hope came from accepting the darkness, Zukey said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you have to let the darkness in. Once you let yourself experience that darkness and that grief, that's the first step to recovery."</p>
