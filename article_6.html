            <p>Highlanders prop Daniel Lienert-Brown has been suspended for three weeks after being found guilty of dangerous play in his side's Super Rugby Pacific game against the Blues.</p>
        
            <p>Lienert-Brown was found guilty of dangerous contact in a ruck.</p>
        
            <p>He was yellow carded for a reckless cleanout in the 59th minute of the match in Dunedin. It was later upgraded to a red card by the TMO.</p>
        
            <p>Despite being down to just 13 players at one stage the Highlanders managed to hold on to beat the Blues 29-21.</p>
        
            <p>The judicial committee ruled the act of foul play merited a mid-range entry point of six weeks/matches.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-two-year-old Lienert-Brown accepted he committed an act of foul play and along with mitigating factors such as his disciplinary record, remorse and conduct, the judicial committee applied the full 50 percent reduction in sanction.</p>
        
            <p>Lienert-Brown was also given permission to apply to take part in World Rugby's coaching intervention programme as a substitute for the final match of the sanction.</p>
        
            <p>He will miss the Super Rugby Pacific matches against Moana Pasifika, the Hurricanes and the Queensland Reds.</p>
