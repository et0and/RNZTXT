            <p>All Blacks and Blues star Beauden Barrett is set for a stint on the sidelines after fracturing his hand in last night's loss to the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett was forced from the field at halftime in Auckland last night after scoring a superb individual try.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues confirmed the injury today, which will see Barrett out of action for several weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"The injury requires ongoing assessment before determining details of treatment or time required for recovery," the Blues said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues' 21-20 loss to the Brumbies was their third defeat of the season, the defending champions sitting in seventh on the points table.</p>
        
            <p>Next weekend they travel over the Bombays to meet the Chiefs in Hamilton.</p>
