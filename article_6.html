            <p>The Hurricanes Poua did not perform a haka against the Blues' women's rugby team this afternoon, after recent controversy.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides are playing at Bell Park in East Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes Poua have caused controversy with their haka on two occasions, with the first labelling the coalition government as "redneck".</p>
        
            <p>The second haka also made references to the government and some bilingual te reo Māori speakers heard Poua haka leader, Leilani Perese, saying the government should "whakangarongaro" or disappear.</p>
        
            <p>It sparked the Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters saying the team could lose support because of naive players damaging the brand.</p>
        
            <p>But the New Zealand Rugby Union said that was misinterpreted.</p>
        
            <p>Chief adviser Māori Luke Crawford said the words could be translated in a number of ways, and must be taken in context.</p>
        
            <p>In this context, it was about refocusing the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It needs to be taken in the context of the whole haka and the other part about it is that it can be translated in in a number of different ways."</p>
        
            <p>Today, there was no haka by the Hurricanes Poua.</p>
