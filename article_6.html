            <p>The sprinkling of stardust over the Champions Trophy may appear somewhat thin on its return to the calendar after eight years, but fans can expect a wide open one-day tournament in the absence of an overwhelming favourite.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament - featuring the top eight teams in the ODI format - was discontinued by the International Cricket Committee (ICC) after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed's Pakistan beat India in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan are therefore holders as well as hosts as they stage a first global tournament since the 1996 World Cup, even if political tensions mean India will play all their matches, including the 9 March final should they make it, in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>Reigning ODI world champions Australia are among several countries sending weakened contingents with Steve Smith standing in as captain of a squad featuring a second-string pace attack.</p>
        
            <p>Regular skipper Pat Cummins, fellow quick Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh were all ruled out by injury, while left-arm quick Mitchell Starc withdrew for personal reasons and all-rounder Marcus Stoinis has quit ODIs altogether.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka did not make the cut for the Champions Trophy, but nevertheless handed the Australians a humbling reality check in the run-up to the tournament with a 2-0 series drubbing.</p>
        
            <p>Reigning Twenty20 world champions India have made the finals of the last three ICC events and Rohit Sharma's team signalled their fine form by winning seven of eight limited-overs matches against England.</p>
        
            <p>Runners-up in the 2023 ODI World Cup on home soil, India boast one of the world's most destructive batting lineups but will be without pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who has been laid low by a back injury.</p>
        
            <p>Seamer Mohammed Shami's impressive return to action in the home series against England was a big relief for Rohit, who will also expect vital contributions from spin all-rounders Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja.</p>

            <p>New Zealand will also fancy their chances of claiming the title having won the tri-nation trophy in Pakistan, beating the hosts in the final of a warm-up tournament also featuring 1998 champions South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Santner's Black Caps side went through the tournament unbeaten and now have a fair idea of the kind of conditions they will face in the Champions Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at the track record of New Zealand in ICC events, they are always there or thereabouts," former New Zealand pace spearhead Tim Southee told the ICC.</p>
        
            <p>"In a tournament like the Champions Trophy, if you get on a bit of a roll, anything can happen. I'd love to see the Black Caps there and hopefully lifting the trophy at the end."</p>
        
            <p>England were unable to defend to defend the T20 or ODI World Cup under Jos Buttler and are now licking their wounds after a tour of India where they were blanked 3-0 in the 50-overs matches.</p>
        
            <p>They have already lost the services of Jacob Bethell through a hamstring injury, while their bowling trio of Brydon Carse (toe), Jamie Overton (hamstring) and Jofra Archer (hand) are all nursing fitness issues.</p>
        
            <p>Giant-killers Afghanistan will make their Champions Trophy debut following their sixth place finish in the ODI World Cup in 2023, when they beat former champions England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan, who face New Zealand in the tournament opener in Karachi on Wednesday, are hoping a successful Champions Trophy will pave the way open for more such tournaments as the country battles perceptions that it is not safe for visitors.</p>
        
            <p>The icing on the cake would be if Mohammad Rizwan, a wicketkeeper- batter like Sarfaraz, could guide Pakistan to a first global title since their Champions Trophy triumph in England eight years ago.</p>
