            <p>Hundreds of people have come to farewell the 25-year-old at the Linwood Sports Club in Christchurch on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Garden-Bachop, a Highlanders and Māori All Blacks representative, died in Christchurch on June 17.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood Garden-Bachop, a father of twin girls, died after a medical event at a relative's home in Christchurch.</p>

            <p>Tributes have been coming in from all around the world for Garden-Bachop, who attended Scots College in Wellington, as the rugby community supports each other through his tragic passing.</p>
        
            <p>A joint statement was released from New Zealand Rugby, the New Zealand Māori Rugby Board, Highlanders, Wellington Rugby and New Zealand Rugby Players Association last Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Connor passed away on Monday following a medical event, and rugby's collective focus at this time is on supporting his family. All of rugby walks alongside the Garden-Bachop family at this time and we are collectively united in our grief."</p>
        
            <p>Garden-Bachop was a "fantastic young player, an exciting New Zealand age-grade representative and a proud Māori All Black".</p>
        
            <p>"Wherever he played, he was a committed and popular team mate with infectious energy and someone who could light up the room.</p>
        
            <p>"Most importantly, he was a loving father to his twin girls, a brother, a son and immeasurably loved by all those who knew him."</p>
