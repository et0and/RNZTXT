An achilles injury wrecked his build-up to the Paris Olympics but it's been smooth sailing this summer for the middle distance runner.

            <p>New Zealand middle distance runner Sam Tanner is feeling the best he has in a long time.</p>
        
            <p>Tanner competed in the Cooks Classic in Whanganui at the weekend winning the New Zealand Championship Mile for the fourth time.</p>
        
            <p>It was a positive return to the track after a disappointing 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Tanner revealed during the Paris Olympics that an achilles injury had wrecked his build-up to the Games. The 24-year-old was in tears after failing to qualify for the semi-finals of the 1500m, describing how the injury had ruined his chances of being at his best for the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>But it has been smooth sailing this summer for the Bay of Plenty athlete.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a pretty good last few months in terms of training with some good volume and no major setbacks," Tanner told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Some specific gym work had helped in getting rid of the injury.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to be doing a racing block now and for the first time in over a year (I'm) feeling good.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's nice to be moving forward."</p>

            <p>Tanner ran 3:55:75 in Whanganui to claim his third consecutive Cooks Garden Mile title.</p>
        
            <p>It was four seconds outside his best, but he was happy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a step forward, the first couple of laps I felt pretty relaxed and so it was just about opening it up over the last 200 or so."</p>
        
            <p>Tanner will compete a couple of times again this summer including at the National Championships in Dunedin in March, but the main focus for 2025 is the World Championships in Japan in September.</p>
        
            <p>However he won't be getting too far ahead of himself with that event still eight months away.</p>
        
            <p>"Taking it day by day, step by step and making sure every day is better than the last.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been pretty happy with the last two weeks so its just about building on what we've got at the moment and hopefully doing something special at the World Champs in Tokyo."</p>
