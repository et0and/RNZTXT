            <p>The Black Ferns crushed Australia in a stunning 62-0 win in their Laurie O'Reilly Cup women's rugby test in Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>The world champions ran in 10 tries at Ballymore with winger Katelyn Vaha'akolo scoring four of them.</p>
        
            <p>The Wallaroos trailed 29-nil at halftime and were held scoreless again in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Errors, penalties and a disjointed attack saw the Wallaroos cough up ball all over the place and their tackling was disappointing at times as they fell off the Black Ferns' attackers.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were dominant at the set-piece and played with pace and freedom on attack.</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful to see our attack flourishing," New Zealand captain Ruahei Demant said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really proud of the effort the girls showed today on attack and particularly on defence."</p>
        
            <p>Last time the teams met the scoreline was a lopsided 67-19 in Auckland two months ago.</p>
