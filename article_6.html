            <p>The Black Ferns have made one change to the starting side for Sunday's second Test of the Pacific Four Series against Canada in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Loosehead prop Chryss Viliko will make her first start for the Black Ferns, replacing the injured Kate Henwood in the only change to the starters that beat USA last week.</p>
        
            <p>Versatile prop Aldora Itunu is set to make her Black Ferns Test return off the bench donning the black jersey for the first time since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns coach Allan Bunting congratulated Itunu on her selection.</p>
        
            <p>"Aldora's perseverance, determination and physical presence has been evident since returning to our environment. She is a special human and has a lot to give this jersey both on and off the field. We know the impact she will make and look forward to her taking the field once again in the Black Ferns jersey."</p>
        
            <p>Loose forward Liana Mikaele-Tu'u is in-line to play her 20th test for the Black Ferns, she will shift to start at No.8, with Layla Sae named at blindside, in the only other change in the playing 23.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a special moment for Liana and her aiga. She is a great contributor to this jersey, her passion and love for this team and where we are going is evident in all she does.</p>
        
            <p>"We know she is ambitious and has plenty more to achieve and we look forward to seeing her influence this weekend."</p>
        
            <p>This will be the 18th test between the Black Ferns and Canada, having first met in 1991 at the Rugby World Cup in Cardiff. The Black Ferns have won all 17 Tests.</p>
        
            <p>Bunting said the team were keen to build on their performance against the USA.</p>
        
            <p>"We were able to see quite a bit of growth in what we have been working through. We want to continue to build on this again this weekend. Canada presents a quality challenge we need on our journey into world cup.</p>
        
            <p>"As a coaching group we want to continue to see growth in certain areas of our game."</p>
