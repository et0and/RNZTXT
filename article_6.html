            <p>The transition from collegiate to professional runner has had its challenges, but Maia Ramsden is now reaping the rewards.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Ramsden broke the national mile record at an indoor meeting in Boston and in doing so qualified for the World Indoor Championships in China later this month.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old is no stranger to success, having been a three-time NCAA champion during her time at Harvard University.</p>
        
            <p>In 2024, she was selected for her first New Zealand team, making the final of the 1500m at the World Indoor Championships before going onto the Olympics where she set a new national 1500m record.</p>
        
            <p>That year she also joined the professional ranks with the On Athletics Club in Boulder, Colorado alongside fellow New Zealand Olympian Geordie Beamish.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely an adjustment. The first couple of races this season there were some growing pains but training has been going well through that," Ramsden told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Training of course is at 1600 metres in altitude, something that takes a while to get used to.</p>
        
            <p>"[You're] up so high the air is not giving you what it does at sea level," she said.</p>
        
            <p>However she is obviously benefiting from it and showed that in Boston this week.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden said while athletics may appear to be an individual sport, she has found being part of a professional team has been extremely rewarding.</p>
        
            <p>"We just have a good time and it really does feel like a team, there really is a camaraderie there."</p>

            <p>Ramsden had some of her team-mates pacing her in Boston this week and she did the same for them after her race.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone has the same level of investment, everyone is on this team because they want to be one of the best in the world. They want to represent their home and also see where the sport can take them."</p>
        
            <p>This year that should take Ramsden to Nanjing, China for the World Indoors.</p>
        
            <p>"I really want to go back because I learned so much in that competition (world Indoors in Glasgow) last year.</p>
        
            <p>"It is where a lot started for me and so now going back a little more confident and a lot fitter I think I can improve on my performance and take away some more lessons going into the outdoor season."</p>
        
            <p>She says running on the boards indoors over the last five years has been a big help.</p>
        
            <p>"Typically tactics has always been something I've struggled with so I do think indoors is something that is good for that.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden will return to Colorado for a two week training block before heading to the World Indoors, pending selection.</p>
        
            <p>The World Athletics Championships (outdoors) in Japan in September is also a goal for Ramsden in 2025.</p>
