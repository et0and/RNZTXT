            <p>Top New Zealand golfers Ryan Fox and Lydia Ko are both within striking distance of the lead heading into the last round of their respective tournaments in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>In the PGA Tour's Houston Open in Texas, Fox overcame a poor start to surge into contention for the title with a 5-under par third round of 65. He is five strokes behind leader, Australian Min Woo Lee, and in joint third place.</p>
        
            <p>Ko is also five strokes off the lead in the LPGA Ford Championship in Arizona. The Olympic champion hit a 4-under 68 to lie in joint 10th place, behind leader American Lilia Vu.</p>
        
            <p>Fox started his third round with two bogeys, but put those behind him to post a 5-under 65, notching five birdies on the back nine.</p>
        
            <p>He had a run of them late, on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes, before a par on the last.</p>
        
            <p>Fox moved into second place before a strong finish by Alejandro Tosti of Argentina relegated him to third equal, with world No 1 Scottie Sheffler and fellow American Ryan Gerard.</p>
        
            <p>Tosti is four strokes behind Lee.</p>
        
            <p>Fox, 38, who has won four times on the European Tour, is chasing his first PGA Tour victory.</p>
        
            <p>Lee had seven birdies and no birdies in his third round, while Sheffler, who had taken the second round lead with a 62, scored 69 this time, including two bogeys.</p>

            <p>At the Whirlwind Golf Club in Chandler, Arizona, Ko hit four birdies on the front nine, but was held back by a double bogey on the ninth.</p>
        
            <p>She had another bogey on the 14th, but also had three birdies in her closing nine. She was unlucky not to get an eagle on the par-5 17th as her putt stopped on the lip of the hole.</p>
        
            <p>American Vu recovered from a double bogey on the 14th hole, with birdies at the next three holes before finishing with a par and a round of 68.</p>
        
            <p>She leads at 18-under by two strokes from English woman Charley Hull, while Ayaka Furue from Japan and Nanna Koerstz Madsen from Denmark are a further shot back.</p>
        
            <p>Ko, who had a stellar 2024 with wins at the Paris Olympics and British Open, won the HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>It was her 23rd LPGA title.</p>
