            <p>Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua will join successful Australian Super Netball side, the NSW Swifts, as a specialist coach.</p>
        
            <p>As part of her professional development, she will join the Swifts for a nine-day period starting from next week.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline led the Sunshine Coast Lightning to Super Netball titles in 2017 and 2018 and was the only coach to lead a Kiwi club to trans-Tasman ANZ Championship success, when the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic lifted the trophy in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>She also coached two grand finals against the Swifts in 2008 and 2019, both of which were won by the NSW side.</p>
        
            <p>Swifts head coach Briony Akle, who recently filled a similar role on the Silver Ferns' coaching team, welcomed her input.</p>
        
            <p>"Our game has produced many wonderful coaches, but few are as decorated as Noeline and we are always looking for ways to freshen up how we do things," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the pleasure of being part of her wider Silver Ferns team and got a wonderful insight into how she works.</p>
        
            <p>"But I also know it's a two-way street and Noeline wouldn't have had the success she's enjoyed by not being open-minded and looking to learn from as many people as possible."</p>

            <p>Dame Noeline said she was excited to be joining the Swifts.</p>
        
            <p>"I have long had a huge respect for the Swifts and their history and legacy and enjoyed many great battles with them as an opposition coach down the years," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe if you aren't learning daily you are standing still and this is a new challenge I am ready to embrace.</p>
        
            <p>"It was fantastic having Briony in our Silver Ferns camp recently and I am honoured to have the opportunity to be part of the team she's leading in Sydney."</p>
        
            <p>The Swifts have reached three grand finals in the last five years and won two titles. Former Silver Fern defender Elle Temu is a training partner for this Swifts and has had several minutes on court so far this season.</p>
        
            <p>After five rounds the Swifts currently sit fourth on the Super Netball ladder and are looking to bounce back from consecutive losses when they host the Giants in the first local Derby of the year on Sunday.</p>
