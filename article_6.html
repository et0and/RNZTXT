            <p>Australia made it back-to-back titles after delivering a clinical 35-23 win over New Zealand in the Fast5 Netball World Series final in Christchurch on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>In a fast-paced decider, Australia took control from the outset with a commanding presence across all areas of the court, leaving the FAST5 Ferns chasing throughout.</p>
        
            <p>With four accomplished shooters, spearheaded by Georgie Horjus dominating from the two-point zone, accompanied by non-stop defensive pressure, the Australians held the upper-hand throughout the contest to lift the sliverware in the six-nation, five-a-side tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Particularly effective were their defensive duo, with captain Maltida Garrett being named player of the match and Ervin O'Shannassy effective in shutting down New Zealand's ability to score extra points from the two-point zone.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders struggled with the pair's long reach which nullified their scoring prowess to just two shots from long range and they also had difficulty finding any consistent flow through the court.</p>
        
            <p>Some brief resistance in a drawn second quarter provided hope but that proved short-lived as Australia took a stranglehold on proceedings to relegate the Fast5 Ferns to the runners-up spot.</p>

            <p>"It was an amazing experience," Garrett said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my first time at Fast5 and when you look out to the crowd and see all the amazing outfits, it's such a great atmosphere. It's such a good week with all the girls that stand along that line, and I'm looking forward to next year already," she said.</p>
        
            <p>England won the battle for the bronze medal, posting a tight 30-22 win over South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Jamaica were fifth, beating winless Malawi 36-31 in their classification game.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Sunday, New Zealand and Australia cemented their places in the final match with two wins each in their remaining round robin matches.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand nailed a hard-fought 41-33 win over South Africa before completing their round robin play in style with an emphatic 50-16 win over Jamaica, highlighted by three six-pointers to Tiana Metuarau.</p>
        
            <p>Australia dominated a dangerous England team 37-16 while also completing a comfortable 42-24 win over Malawi to earn their place in the tournament decider.</p>
