            <p>The Tongan fanbase may make it feel like enemy territory, but the Kiwis insist Auckland is their house.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is preparing to be confronted with a sea of red on Saturday, as the passionate Tonga fans are set to pack the stands at Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Adding to the intensity, the teams are vying for a spot in the Pacific Championships final.</p>
        
            <p>However, Kiwis coach Stacey Jones said fan ratios were irrelevant.</p>
        
            <p>"We are playing at home. Regardless of what the crowd is, this is our home."</p>
        
            <p>His side are under no illusions as to the cauldron awaiting them.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the players know, they have seen what the Tongan people bring to the international game and it's very special, they have taken international footy to another level."</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis second-rower Isaiah Papali'i said they would look to silence the Tongans early.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obvious there will be a big red sea out there and the atmosphere will be high but we can also draw from that."</p>
        
            <p>With defensive lapses having cost them dearly against Australia, Jones said there had been an increased emphasis on defence ahead of the Tongan test.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to match them physically. Their forward pack is very strong. They like to play physical and if we get an arm wrestle with them, it's going to be a tough battle."</p>
        
            <p>With superstars such as Jason Taumalolo and Addin Fonua-Blake in the Tongan pack, Jones said they would have plans to nullify their impact.</p>
        
            <p>"We look at every individual, we do our homework, we are probably more worried about what we have to do. We want to be known more as a defensive team, we have to be strong."</p>
        
            <p>Both sides are looking to bounce back from first round defeats at the hands of the Kangaroos with the Kiwis having the recent edge of their Pacific neighbours, New Zealand prevailing 22-6 in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis centre Matt Timoko said they were anticipating a brutal encounter.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to bring an aggressive mindset, they are a powerful side and they won't be taking a backward step so we have to make sure we weather the storm. We can't shy away from them."</p>
