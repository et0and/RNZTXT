            <p>The Black Caps will go into their first ever test against Afghanistan with no cricket under their belt.</p>
        
            <p>The game in Greater Noida, India will be the first red ball fixture for the Black Caps since the home test series against Australia in March.</p>
        
            <p>This game is the first of six tests in the sub-continent, with two in Sri Lanka and then three against India.</p>
        
            <p>The last time New Zealand played Afghanistan was in the T20 World Cup in June, with the 84-run loss playing a big part in the Black Caps early exit from the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Experienced batter Kane Williamson, who is set to play his 101st test match, said a big challenge awaits.</p>
        
            <p>"As a team it's important that we look to grow as a unit and be clear on how we want to play here," Williamson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys know it's a tough challenge when you play in this part of the world, but always a great experience playing against strong sides so a good opportunity for us."</p>
        
            <p>While the Black Caps last test was in March, they last played in June at the T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Gary Stead said they're acclimatised and ready to go.</p>
        
            <p>"There is excitement within the group about getting back into playing again.</p>
        
            <p>"Afghanistan are an emerging team who have shown their ability in the last couple of World Cups and there aren't many top-tier nations they haven't knocked over now."</p>
        
            <p>Today's test will be Afghanistan's tenth since their made their debut in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Only two of those tests have been played in Afghanistan and today's venue in Greater Noida will be their ninth different venue.</p>
        
            <p>Afghanistan's three tests wins have been against Bangladesh, Ireland and Zimbabwe.</p>

            <p>Greater Noida will become the 124th test venue although it has hosted ODIs and T20Is.</p>
        
            <p>The spin-friendly conditions of the subcontinent will leave New Zealand's five spin bowlers with plenty to look forward to over the six Tests in the region.</p>
        
            <p>Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ajaz Patel, Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips will all be vying for game time.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Tim Southee will play a part in team selections.</p>
        
            <p>"As a spin bowler you'd be looking forward to this, very rarely do you get six matches in the sub-continent and so I'm sure they're excited about it and looking forward to the challenge," Southee said.</p>
        
            <p>Left arm spinner Ajaz Patel is expected to play what would be just his 17th test, his last was against Bangladesh in Mirpur in December 2023 when he took eight wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Keen to improve their record in the continent, New Zealand have added former Sri Lanka spinner Rangana Herath and ex-India batting coach Vikram Rathour to their support staff hoping to gain valuable insight into local conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Herath replaces former Pakistan international Saqlain Mushtaq.</p>
        
            <p>Stead said they'd managed to swap one legend for another.</p>
        
            <p>"Rangana was an exceptional bowler back in the day so we're excited to tap into his strategy and psyche of the Sri Lankan players.</p>
