        <h2>‘Wasn’t up to standard’: Ioane laments All Blacks' attacking errors</h2>
        <p>
While he got on the scoresheet for the first time in a while, Rieko Ioane said the the All Blacks' inability to execute almost cost them in Bledisloe I.

            <p>While he got on the scoresheet for the first time in a while, Rieko Ioane said the the All Blacks' inability to execute almost cost them in a tense 31-28 Bledisloe Cup win in Sydney. Once again, they failed to score any points in the back end of the game, after leading 21-0 after only 15 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"In that second half we got points early, which was a pleasing start. But our discipline let us down and our ability to execute down in their red zone wasn't up to standard," said Ioane post-match at Accor Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The Wallabies did mount a commendable fightback after the three-try All Black blitz, scoring two of their own in the first half and then the only two of the second half. Ioane said the Joe Schmidt-coached Australians "attacked a lot more than the teams we've played so far".</p>
        
            <p>"They're similar to us in a lot of ways. They want to get some air on the ball and they exposed some errors…a lot of it was our own poor execution."</p>
        
            <p>Discipline was once again an issue for the All Blacks, after yellow cards played a big part in the two recent losses to the Springboks. This time, they were reduced to 13 men after Caleb Clarke and Anton Lienert-Brown were sinbinned in the last 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>"Pressure does funny things to you. Boys try so hard; we want to be the ones to get the steal or make the big tackle and it just comes down to what pressure does to us in those moments. Those things are easy fixes, they're mental and it's just about working smarter… it's those little one percenters, it almost cost us," said Ioane.</p>
        
            <p>Admittedly, the All Blacks did create plenty of opportunities in the second half and even crossed the line twice - only to be fairly denied by the TMO. In all, they manufactured seven scoring situations that should've been taken, something Ioane said can be fixed.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess that's our discipline too, to execute. That's a skillset thing, which is pleasing, because if it was a game plan or tactical thing then we'd be worried."</p>
        
            <p>Still, Ioane was happy overall with the result. It means the Bledisloe Cup is once again safe in the All Blacks' possession for a 22nd straight season, and he said there was a lot to be pleased about with the performance.</p>

            <p>"I thought we kicked well…we've got the best outsides in the world so the more we can get it wide with our loosies ranging in those wide channels, the better we're going to be. I thought we did that well tonight…retaining the Bledisloe Cup's not easy, so we're happy with that."</p>
        
            <p>Also putting a smile on the 76-test player's face was his first half try. Despite sitting high on the all-time All Black try-scoring list, Ioane hadn't crossed the line this season till he was sent away down the wing by the impressive Cortez Ratima.</p>
        
            <p>"I can still score tries, just saying," he joked.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a big old drought…but happy we got it done and I'm happy we got the win most importantly."</p>
