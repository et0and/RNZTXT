        <h2>'Only time will tell': Warriors gamble on another departing junior star</h2>
        <p>
The Auckland club has a habit of letting young Kiwi talent slip through its fingers, but has also reaped rewards.
</p>
        
            <p>NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster has defended his club's reputation for letting local Kiwi talent slip through its fingers, as another local junior heads offshore to find his NRL fortune.</p>
        
            <p>This time last year, hopes were high that powerful front-rower Zyon Maiu'u, still only 20, would to break into first grade for the Auckland side, but a dangerous high tackle in the pre-season saw him suspended two games and he never quite recovered his momentum after that.</p>
        
            <p>He eventually made his only appearance against Gold Coast Titans on ANZAC Day - a 13-minute shift off the bench that produced 77 metres from seven runs - but has now been granted an early release to join Canterbury Bulldogs for the coming season.</p>
        
            <p>"He was still contracted, but he had a good opportunity," reflected Webster. "We've got a lot of young, local talented forwards, and Zyon is a terrific person and terrific player - a player on the way up.</p>

            <p>"You don't allow that permission for everyone, but he's got a different path there than he has here at the moment, so we wanted to give him the opportunity to pursue that.</p>
        
            <p>"Is there an element of regret? When it's such a good person like Zyon, there is, but I feel like the balance of our roster, with all our local talentâ€¦ Zyon and I had a good chat, and agreed it was the right thing for him to do that."</p>
        
            <p>Over their 30-year history, the Warriors have developed an unenviable reputation for letting promising youngsters cross the Tasman to Aussie clubs and watching them blossom into fine NRL performers.</p>
        
            <p>Some find their way back to Mt Smart. Bruising second-rower Marata Niukore emerged from the Warriors U20 team, but debuted and played almost 100 games for Parramatta Eels, before returning two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"[Zyon] obviously had a good connection with most of the boys in the group and he added a lot, not only on the field, but off it as well," said Niukore.</p>
        
            <p>"Full credit to him, he's going over to pursue an opportunity that's better for himself and his family. Obviously sad to see someone like him go, but it gives someone else an opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Forward utility Erin Clark was another outstanding prospect through the Warriors juniors and debuted in first grade, before he was released to join Canberra Raiders mid-season. He has since chalked up almost 100 games for Gold Coast and will likely add to his one appearance for the Auckland club this season.</p>

            <p>In reality, New Zealand has become a happy hunting ground for rugby league talent, with Australian clubs sending scouts across the ditch annually to compete against the Warriors for young blood. One local club is simply unable to scoop up every bright prospect and not everyone that passes through their system will find a place in the top team.</p>
        
            <p>It's a numbers game that the Warriors have struggled to master, but players like Niukore and Clark give hope that there is long term gain from short term pain.</p>
        
            <p>"You always wonder if you're going to see Zyon go on to become one of the greatest front-rowers at another club," confessed Webster. "You always have those worries, but at the same time, I'm really confident in the path of a lot of other guys here too.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not frustrated with Zyon. We could have dug our heels in and said no, but it's a two-way street. We felt for the balance of our roster and the best for Zyon, he should go and take this opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you'll always have an element of 'that guy's gone on to become a good player', but we have to be judged on whether we keep the right ones.</p>
        
            <p>"Only time will tell."</p>
