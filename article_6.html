            <p>It's been reported that All Black Damian McKenzie is on the verge of taking up a short-term deal in the Northern Hemisphere next year with French club La Rochelle.</p>
        
            <p>According to rugbyprime.com in France, Top 14 professional rugby union club La Rochelle is about to reach an agreement with McKenzie to join the club next season.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old, who plays both fullback and first five-eighth, would arrive in France at the end of the Rugby Championship 2025.</p>
        
            <p>With a number of players coming to end of their contracts, the French club is looking for reinforcements.</p>
        
            <p>If McKenzie signs with the club, he would be following in the footsteps of All Blacks midfielder Jordie Barrett, who in April this year re-signed with NZR through 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett also agreed to a stint with Irish club Leinster after the All Blacks' northern tour in December, ensuring he will miss the 2025 Super Rugby season with the Hurricanes. Starting in December he will spend six months at Leinster.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie, who has been All Blacks coach Scott Robertson's first-choice first five-eighth this season, is contracted to New Zealand Rugby through 2025.</p>
        
            <p>If the 54-Test cap McKenzie signs with the club it would be his second sabbatical in the northern hemisphere - he missed the 2022 Super Rugby season while on a sabbatical with Japanese club Tokyo Sungoliath.</p>
