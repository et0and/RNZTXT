            <p>Despite the Wellington Phoenix's dream start against Melbourne Victory at Porirua Park the A-League match ended in disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>Less than two minutes into the game on Saturday Phoenix midfielder Maya McCutcheon headed in a goal from a corner to give the home side an early lead against one of the competition's front runners.</p>
        
            <p>A defensive error just after the hour mark allowed Victory to equalise, and the match finished 1-1.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix head coach Paul Temple was left frustrated after the team's performance was not reflected by the scoreline.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've probably come away from it disappointed with a point to be honest.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we controlled the game from start to finish. We had more possession, more of of the ball, made more passes, looked the more likely.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, they got a goal off a mistake of ours, and that's a horrible way to concede.</p>
        
            <p>"For the players involved, they're really frustrated with themselves, we're frustrated as a team, but it's just part of football as well."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix could have had a greater lead at half-time and Temple rued missed chances.</p>
        
            <p>"The first half was good, it was what we intended from the game. Nick's [coach Nick Stanton] been working hard with them on set pieces, and one of those came off brilliantly.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great when one of those comes off. As a staff, it's what you work on, and we were really good in the first half. The rotation down the left side with Lara, Grace, and Annalie was deadly, and I thought they really struggled to contain us down that side.</p>
        
            <p>"We just didn't use it as much in the second half, which is frustrating and something we have to work on.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we missed an opportunity in the first half when we were that dominant to put another goal away. When you're only 1-0 up, there's that really fine edge.</p>
        
            <p>"Victory are a team that's been around finals, they know how to grind out results year after year, and they did that today."</p>
        
            <p>Seventeen-year -old Ela Jerez made her debut for the Phoenix after signing a scholarship deal at the beginning of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"The first three months she was adjusting to being a professional. She's still so young, learning what it's like, but she's been really professional with her mentality as the year's gone on," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard for a young player to come in, they're so nervous, but it's good for her to get it out of the way. You'll start to see her qualities come out. She's a really technical player."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will return to action next Sunday, making the long trip to Perth to face the Glory in the final match before the international break.</p>
