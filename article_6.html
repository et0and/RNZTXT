            <p>Favourite Master Lock Comanche has been forced forced to retire from the 79th running of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, leaving Law Connect as the new race leader.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect, which won line honours last year in a thrilling finish by just 51 seconds, was first past the turning mark after cannons sounded at 3pm on Thursday (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>However, it soon ran into some sail issues, giving race record holder Master Lock Comanche an unexpected advantage.</p>
        
            <p>But having set record-breaking pace, Master Lock Comanche retired in the early hours of Friday due to mainsail damage approximately 63 nautical miles off Green Cape - one among seven retirements from the race from the initial fleet of 104.</p>
        
            <p>Wild Thing 100, another supermaxi, almost capsized after making a late tack to avoid the smaller Celestial V70.</p>

            <p>Covering approximately 630 nautical miles of the Tasman Sea and notoriously treacherous Bass Strait, the gruelling annual race is Australia's premier yachting event.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasts were for a fast start in north-easterly winds of up to 20 knots before a trough strikes in the early hours of Friday, bringing strong-to-gale-force, south-westerly winds.</p>
        
            <p>The friendly weather conditions could bring the race record - set by LDV Comanche in 2017 - of one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds in sight.</p>
        
            <p>Sailors will be keen to avoid inclement weather when they cross the Bass Strait as they head across from the mainland towards the island state of Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>Five yachts were sunk and six sailors killed when a major storm hit the fleet during the 1998 race.</p>
