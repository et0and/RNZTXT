            <p>The Blues Women will host the Super Rugby Aupiki final after previous leaders the Chiefs Manawa were stunned by Matat큰 in the final match of the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>South Island side Matat큰 stormed home with late tries to Amy du Plessis and Liv Governe to beat the Manawa 22-20 in Christchurch on Saturday, registering their second win and comfortably biggest scalp of the season.</p>
        
            <p>However, it wasn't enough to prevent a Blues-Chiefs decider on Saturday, with both of those teams having confirmed their places in the final two weeks earlier.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues will carry momentum - as well as home advantage - into the match after scoring seven tries in beating the Hurricanes Poua 41-29 in their final match, with winger Katelyn Vaha'akolo bagging a brace.</p>
        
            <p>The Manawa appeared on track to be top qualifiers when leading 20-12 heading into the final quarter but their late capitulation will see them travel north up the highway, where they will try to put the memory of last year's 33-31 final loss to Matat큰 behind them.</p>
