            <p>November 14 2009. Before Avatar, Instagram and the iPad. When 45th and 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump was still a reality TV star, occasionally guest spotting in professional wrestling. That was the last time New Zealand booked their place at a men's football World Cup. Rory Fallon's 45th minute goal ensured the All Whites would be drowning in the hum of vuvuzelas in South Africa the following year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's fellas have yet to return to the big show, falling at inter-confederation play-off hurdles against Mexico, Peru and Costa Rica along the way. But this time around, the winners of Oceania qualifying will automatically gain passage to next year's showpiece in North America - giving Darren Bazeley's men a huge shot at ending that exile. But much like how that 1-0 triumph over Bahrain 16 years ago followed a hard-fought first-leg 0-0 draw, New Zealand must get through another fixture before their ultimate date with destiny.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand must first get through a semi-final clash with Fiji on Friday night, with the winner facing the victor of New Caledonia v Tahiti - OFC's other semi-final clash - at Eden Park on Monday.</p>

            <p>Let's be very clear. New Zealand are massive favourites to win on Friday - and Monday - and qualify for the 2026 World Cup. That was made painfully evident with their Group Stage results across October-November last year. Tahiti, Vanuatu and Samoa came unstuck, receiving the blunt end of 3-0, 8-1 and 8-0 results respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Bazeley can also benefit from perhaps his two most talented players - Chris Wood and Libby Cacace - being in great form. Wood is one of the Premier League's top-scorers while Cacace has finally established himself in an Empoli side who have reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Jesse Randall is one of a handful of Auckland FC players rewarded for the A-League upstarts thrilling beginning to life, in place of the fading light that was teammate Liam Gillion earlier this season.</p>
        
            <p>While Ben Old is absent through injury and Finn Surman left behind to concentrate on first-team football at Portland Timbers, this is as close to the strongest All Whites squad you can imagine.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's head coach has a few selection dilemmas to consider. Between the sticks, Max Crocombe has clearly been his number one option but Alex Paulsen is in good form at Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The back-line is tricky, with several players also in fine form at the Black Knights. Tommy Smith, Nando Pijnaker and Francis de Vries, in particular, will believe they deserve a starting berth based on their recent performances. So perhaps we see young prodigy Tyler Bindon switch to right-back, with Storm Roux and Tim Payne both out of form in the A-League - with either Smith or Pijnaker slotting in alongside Michael Boxall.</p>
        
            <p>A double pivot in midfield seems likely, with Marko Stamenic a shoo-in to start. The options alongside both lack regular game-time over the past couple of months. Joe Bell is off-season in Norway while Alex Rufer has just battled back from glandular fever - so that position could go to either.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Garbett has been given a vote of confidence by Bazeley despite his issues at Dutch side NAC Breda while the other attacking midfield positions are up for grabs, although Eli Just and Logan Rogerson would appear most likely. Leading the line? It can only be Chris Wood.</p>
        
            <p>Predicted XI</p>
        
            <p>Crocombe; Bindon, Pijnaker, Boxall, Cacace; Rufer, Stamenic, Garbett Just, Rogerson; Wood.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand squad</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeepers: Max Crocombe, Alex Paulsen, Oli Sail.</p>
        
            <p>Defenders: Tyler Bindon, Michael Boxall, Liberato Cacace, Tim Payne, Nando Pijnaker, Tommy Smith, Francis de Vries, Storm Roux.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Matthew Garbett, Joe Bell, Sarpreet Singh, Marko Stamenic, Alex Rufer, Callum McCowatt.</p>
        
            <p>Forwards: Kosta Barbarouses, Jesse Randall, Eli Just, Logan Rogerson, Ben Waine, Chris Wood.</p>

            <p>Fiji are under no illusions about being the underdogs for this fixture. That tag has only been reinforced by the injury-enforced absence of their star player, ex-Wellington Phoenix goal-machine, Roy Krishna.</p>
        
            <p>But in head coach Rob Sherman they have a man who has helped shape the careers of Welsh stars Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, as well as some of the All Whites team during a stint as New Zealand Football's technical director.</p>
        
            <p>The squad has a blend of New Zealand-based talent as well, with six players based in Aotearoa, as well as a smattering of Australian locals and one who plays in England's non-league system - defensive powerhouse Scott Wara.</p>
        
            <p>Yet it is some of the Fijian-based players who may prove New Zealand's biggest threat - specifically the mobile Sairusi Nalaubu in attack and the powerful but technical Setareki Hughes in midfield.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji squad</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeepers: Joela Biuvanua, Akuila Mateisuva, Jerome Narayan.</p>
        
            <p>Defenders: Filipe Baravilala, Gabby Matansiga, Mohammed Nabeel, Semi Nabenu, Ivan Kumar, Sterling Vasconcellos, Scott Wara.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Setareki Hughes, Leroy Jennings, Patrick Joseph, Brendan McMullen, Merrill Nand, Mohammed Raheem, Penisoni Tirau, Tevita Waranaivalu.</p>
        
            <p>Forwards: Etonia Dogalau, Thomas Dunn, Sairusi Nalaubu, Epeli Valevou, Christopher Wasasala.</p>
        
            <p>21 March 2022 New Zealand 4-0 Fiji</p>
        
            <p>28 March 2017 New Zealand 2-0 Fiji</p>
        
            <p>25 March 2017 Fiji 0-2 New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>Fiji will bring absolutely everything they have to this game but there is just too big a gulf in the qualities of the two teams.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites should be fitter, faster and better organised, while also having the killer instinct of an in-form star striker.</p>
        
            <p>Anything other than a comfortable Kiwi win will be a huge surprise.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 4-0 Fiji </p>
