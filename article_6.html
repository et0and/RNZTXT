            <p>New Zealand racing driver Liam Lawson has been eliminated after the first stage of qualifying for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson finished last of the 20 drivers in the stage.</p>
        
            <p>Pierre Gasly, Ollie Bearman, Jack Doohan and Gabriel Bortoleto also failed to make it beyond the first stage.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just really tough, honestly," he told the Sky Sport broadcast.</p>
        
            <p>"The window is really small, it's not an excuse. I have to get a handle on it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a messy session, had we not dealt with traffic it might have been okay but it is still not good enough.</p>
        
            <p>"We should be fast enough on our first lap. I just need to get on top of it."</p>
        
            <p>"It's just time, unfortunately, I don't really have time. To drive a Formula One car takes 100 percent confidence in what you're doing. It's not that I don't have confidence, but the window is so small that I just seem to miss it.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how else to put it. It's just not good enough."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson will start from the back of the field in Sunday's big race.</p>
        
            <p>He had earlier finished 14th in the Grand Prix sprint - won by Lewis Hamilton - earning plaudits from Red Bull boss Christian Horner for his driving, as he overtook five cars during the 19-lap event.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Oscar Piastri finished fastest in qualifying to take pole position for Sunday's race.</p>
        
            <p>The McLaren driver will have Mercedes' driver George Russell on the front row, while Lando Norris will start from three and Max Verstappen from four. Norris abandoned the final session.</p>
