            <p>Aotearoa New Zealand's Waka Ama teams have had a successful week at the IVF World Sprint Championships in Hawai'i, reigning in 13 gold medals.</p>
        
            <p>The elite women's team won gold in the V6 and V12 500m sprints at the start of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Three para athletes - George Thomas, Dale Johnson and Peata Nuku - all won gold in their single 250m sprints.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne's Horouta won the V12 500 metre sprint in the under 16s category, while its Kaiarahi Toa team won its V6 1500m sprint.</p>
        
            <p>Master paddlers in the over 50s, 60s and 75s category also won gold in both their single and six seated waka races.</p>
        
            <p>The elite women's team coach Sieda Tureia said the group spent around eight months training for the championships.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest thing that we needed to prepare for is fitness and working under fatigue. Being in competition that is over two days, we have a set amount of races that we need to perform at a high quality given that it is sprints. So being able to repeat those performances as well as extend and improve each time has been a big focus for us," Tureia said.</p>
        
            <p>The training camps would involve the elite women's team training for two hours, three times a day - usually in the weekends.</p>
        
            <p>She said Aotearoa had done well overall.</p>
        
            <p>"We have done better in the past but we have to give respect to that fact that there are many countries that have also spent a lot of time and resources into developing there own elite crews and their own juniors, so that we have some development coming through which is really exciting," Tureia said.</p>
        
            <p>She said Aotearoa has been good at developing the elite paddlers with their succession plan to help them perform at a higher level.</p>
        
            <p>"Countries are catching up but that makes our job a lot more exciting, it kind of encourages us to push a bit more and already start making some plans for the next competition in Singapore," Tureia said.</p>
        
            <p>The racecourse was also a surprise to the team because it was in a bay, so it was more exposed to swells and surf.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming on very tricky and difficult angles so that was a big challenge for us is to kind of wrap our heads around that because here in Aotearoa we race at Lake Karapiro which is a lot more controlled," Tureia said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the change in climate wasn't too hard for the team to adjust to because it had been raining quite a bit.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are currently third on the medal table with 30 silver and 14 bronze, while Tahiti is on top with 33 gold.</p>
        
            <p>This year 1873 paddlers from 27 countries are competing at Hilo Bayfront Beach</p>
        
            <p>The final day of competition will take place at Hilo in Hawaii on Saturday.</p>
