            <p>Rory McIlroy's decision to join forces with world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and take on LIV Golf League stars Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka isn't aimed at bringing the sport back together.</p>
        
            <p>McIIroy says he was motivated to sign on the for the December exhibition game to please golf fans.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't say it's meant to send a message," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more we wanted to do something that, I guess, all golf fans could get excited about. You've got the best player in the world (Scheffler). You've got two guys in Bryson and Brooks that have won majors in the last two years. You've got me in there, who - I haven't done what those guys have done the last couple years but I've definitely been, I feel, one of the best players in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a way to show golf fans in the world that this is what could happen or these are the possibilities going forward," McIlroy continued.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been saying this for a long time. I think golf and golf fans get to see us together more than four times a year."</p>
        
            <p>The PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which finances LIV Golf, announced last week that they are planning to meet in New York about a potential investment in the hopes of repairing men's professional golf.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we are all in the game of golf trying to look for a solution to all this and try to move forward. So we'll see, yeah. I know as much as you do at this point, and I'm sure news will start to trickle out here in the next few days," said McIIroy.</p>

            <p>McIlroy, Tiger Woods and Adam Scott are part of the PGA Tour Enterprises transactional subcommittee, which has been negotiating with the PIF.</p>
        
            <p>McIlroy has expressed his frustration since the creation of LIV Golf, which began in 2021 and has splintered the sport.</p>
        
            <p>But despite the current state of men's golf, McIlroy remains hopeful that a deal can be worked out.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everyone in the game would love there to be one (a resolution)," McIlroy told BBC Sport Northern Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>"A solution is hard to get to because there are different interests and people want different things. There's going to have to be compromise on both sides but, hopefully, they're the things they're talking about in those meetings.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hopeful and hopefully we'll be hearing some good news in the foreseeable future where things start to come back together."</p>
