            <p>Black Caps batter Kane Williamson will miss the dead-rubber third cricket Test against India in Mumbai as the team looks ahead to the upcoming three-Test series against England in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was nursing a groin injury that saw him miss the first two Tests that New Zealand won in India.</p>
        
            <p>The first Test against England starts in Christchurch on 28 November and coach Gary Stead said a cautious approach would be taken to ensure the top order batter would be fully fit for the home summer.</p>
        
            <p>Stead said Williamson had made good progress.</p>
        
            <p>"Kane continues to show good signs, but isn't quite ready to jump on a plane and join us," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"While things are looking promising, we think the best course of action is for him to stay in New Zealand and focus on the final part of his rehabilitation so he'll be good to go for England.</p>
        
            <p>"The England series is still a month away so taking the cautious approach now will ensure he is ready for the first Test in Christchurch."</p>
        
            <p>The third Test against India begins on Friday.</p>
