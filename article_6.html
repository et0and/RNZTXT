            <p>Australia have retained the Rose Bowl trophy after having the White Ferns on the ropes when a thunderstorm cut the second One Day International short in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns were 122 for 5 after 30.1 overs, chasing a huge target to win when the umpires sent the players off the field as thunder and lightning approached the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after, the match was called off and Australia beat the White Ferns by 65 runs courtesy of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns had to pull off their biggest ever run chase in ODI cricket after Australia set them a target of 292 to win.</p>
        
            <p>Annabel Sutherland anchored the Australian innings - scoring a century to take the visitors to 291 for seven.</p>
        
            <p>Australia continued to score at a quick rate, despite the efforts of White Ferns seamer Molly Penfold, who was picked ahead of Jess Kerr.</p>
        
            <p>Penfold took four key wickets to achieve her best ODI bowling figures but it did little to dampen the visitors' aggressive approach.</p>
        
            <p>When Penfold dismissed Ellyse Perry and Beth Mooney in quick succession, Australia were 110 for 4 after 23.1 overs and it felt like New Zealand were in a good position.</p>
        
            <p>But Australia showed yet again why they are the number one team in the world and Sutherland, batting at number five, took complete control and finished on 105 not out off 81 deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>Facing a mammoth task, New Zealand didn't get off to a good start when opener Suzie Bates lost her wicket for just four runs.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow opener Bella James made a good start on her international debut but was eventually dismissed for 27.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Kerr was run out by a whisker on video review when she was on 38 and not longer after that the weather forced the players from the field.</p>
        
            <p>The first ODI was completely washed out but the White Ferns could still salvage a 1-all series draw if they can beat Australia in the final ODI on Monday.</p>
