            <p>Both teams fell short against their respective opponents last week, so it's starting to feel like do or die time for the Warriors and Titans.</p>
        
            <p>On top of that, the Warriors will be seriously looking to right the wrongs of the round seven Anzac Day match, which sent them into a down and out spiral before their recent return to form over the past month.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors head coach Andrew Webster dismissed notions of taking the Titans lightly, saying it would not only be disrespectful but foolish if they went into this game thinking they had already secured the victory.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Kolkstad 2. Edward Kosi 3. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck 4. Adam Pompey 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Te Maire Martin 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Jackson Ford 11. Marata Niukore 12. Dylan Walker 13. Tohu Harris (c)</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Chanel Harris-Tavita 15. Jacob Laban 16. Jazz Tevaga 17. Tom Ale</p>
        
            <p>Titans: 1. Keano Kini 2. Alofi'ana Khan-Pereira 3. Brian Kelly 4. Phillip Sami 5. Jojo Fifita 6. Jayden Campbell 7. Kieran Foran (c) 8. Keenan Palasia 9. Chris Randall 10. Joseph Pahulu 11. David Fifita 12. Beau Fermor 13. Erin Clark</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Sam Verrilis 15. Issac Liu 16. Iszac Fa'asuamaleaui 17. Joe Stimson</p>

            <p>Roger Tuivasa-Sheck makes his long-awaited return to the starting line-up after a lengthy sideline stint due to a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>It couldn't come at a better time with the Warriors finding themselves down on numbers with Dallin Watene-Zelezniak being suspended for one game and Rocco Berry picking up a shoulder injury last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Also missing from the forward pack are two huge names in Kurt Capewell (Queensland) and Mitch Barnett (NSW) both being called into Origin camps.</p>
        
            <p>Tohu Harris reclaims his 13 jersey starting at lock with Dylan Waker making the shift into the second row, along with Tom Ale and Jacob Laban earning spots on the bench.</p>

            <p>A much-needed boost for the Titans will be second rower David Fifita returning after missing last round's match with an ankle injury.</p>
        
            <p>Klese Haas is out due to injury and Moeaki Fotuaika has called into Origin camp, they're replaced by Joe Stimson and Iszac Fa'asuamaleaui.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 24 - 27 Storm (Anzac Round)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 28 - 18 Titans (2023)</p>
        
            <p>The Titans snapped their six-game losing streak at the start of this season when they caused one of the upsets of the year defeating the Warriors on Anzac Day.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the Warriors got a bit of a scare before walking away with a 10-point victory in the midst of their seven-game win streak.</p>
        
            <p>It won't be an easy feat for either club, as both are frantically trying to get another victory in order to keep up with the pace of competition.</p>
        
            <p>On paper this should be a win for the Warriors. But they'll need to respect their opponents, who will be looking to throw the kitchen sink at them early.</p>
        
            <p>If they can stick to the basics, wear the Titans down with strong contact up the middle, keep structured defence and wait to capitalise off the mistakes the Titans are almost certain to make with their loose brand of footy, it could provide ample opportunities on attack.</p>
