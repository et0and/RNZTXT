            <p>Neither the Wellington Phoenix nor Central Coast Mariners could find the back of the net after 90 minutes, as their A-League clash in Christchurch ended in stalemate.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix's first match in the city in nine years will not go down as a classic.</p>
        
            <p>While the result marks three games on the trot unbeaten for Wellington, they will be left to rue a golden opportunity to knock over the table toppers.</p>
        
            <p>Their defence was solid but a lack of impetus on attack left fans with little to cheer about, with Wellington languishing in ninth on the points table.</p>
        
            <p>The first 45 saw few genuine scoring shots, Nathan Walker coming closest when he fired a powerful shot which deflected off of Mariners keeper Dylan Peraic-Cullen.</p>
        
            <p>Kazuki Nagasawa also appeared to have drawn a penalty in the box when he was brought down in the 65th, but none was forthcoming to the dismay of the home crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The side returns to Wellington on Thursday to take on the bottom-placed Brisbane Roar.</p>
