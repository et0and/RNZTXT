            <p>Despite a dearth of runs, the Black Caps selectors are keeping the faith in opener Devon Conway ahead of a tough tour to India.</p>
        
            <p>Conway has passed 50 just twice in his last fifteen innings, most recently scoring 61 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Galle.</p>
        
            <p>After averaging 63 in his first year with 379 runs in six innings, the numbers have since plummeted for Conway, and he is now averaging below 40, with scores of 17, 4 and 9 before his possibly career-saving half century.</p>
        
            <p>Battling both injuries and form, Conway now has his selection under serious question.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps selector Sam Wells admitted Conway was short on big scores in recent times.</p>
        
            <p>"Devon's been in a bit of a light run there is no doubt about that but if you look at him he's played 22 tests, averages 40 with four test hundreds, I think as an opener in test cricket, we wouldn't have many players who have historically done that."</p>
        
            <p>Conway started his test career with a bang, scoring 200 against England at Lords, making him the first New Zealand batter to make a double century on test debut on foreign soil.</p>
        
            <p>A further three centuries came against Bangladesh (2) and Pakistan, the last of which was in January 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Admittedly those runs (are) lopsided if you split the tests that he's played. But we think he's one of our best players. He's been in a bit of a lean run.</p>
        
            <p>"But part of the art of being a selector is not throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and holding onto guys when they will go through lean runs."</p>
        
            <p>Wells stressed that class was permanent.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're a quality player, you're a quality player, but Devon still has to earn his place on the side through weight runs. But it's definitely pleasing to get that that 60 on the board. It's always nice to feel a few out of the middle, so I'm sure it takes some confidence out of that."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps depart for India on Friday, minus Williamson who will sit out at least the first test with an ongoing groin strain.</p>
        
            <p>Wells said they remain hopeful Williamson will take part in the series at some stage though they will have to "play it by ear."</p>
        
            <p>The decision to come home for ten days between series did draw criticism from some corners, who felt acclimatising in India would be the wiser decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure they have enjoyed spending time with their families, the guys spend a lot of time on the road. I don't know how they do it half the time because a lot of them have young families and it must be tough."</p>
        
            <p>Wells said it is an unrealistic demand to have the players head straight to Bengaluru on the back of two tests.</p>
        
            <p>"I think getting the guys rested physically and mentally is definitely the better way to go than to grind them into the ground."</p>
        
            <p>Having suffered a record defeat in Galle, Wells said the side is hungry for redemption.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure like any professional sportsmen, when the results aren't going your way, it's going to affect the mood a little bit but these guys will be fired up for two back to back test series."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps kick off the tour on 16 October.</p>
