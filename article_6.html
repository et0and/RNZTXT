        <h2>Frustrated Football Ferns held to a goalless draw by Thailand</h2>
        <p>
The Ferns were unable to clinch what would have been their 100th international victory.

            <p>The Football Ferns and Thailand have drawn 0-0 in Christchurch. The result ended a six-match win streak for the home side and put celebrations for the side's 100th ever victory on hold, despite dominating much of the proceedings at Apollo Projects Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>To make matters even more frustrating, the match ended shortly after an unmarked Meikayla Moore missed from point blank range in the 97th minute, sending her shot wide of the post after the ball was played to her in front of goal by Indiah-Paige Riley.</p>
        
            <p>It was probably the best of numerous chances that the Ferns created, as the Thai side seemed intent on sitting back and simply defending their way through the entire game. It was a far cry from their display on Saturday that saw them record a clinical 4-0 win against the same opposition playing very much the same way.</p>
        
            <p>"It was frustrating … disappointing from us. They play with a very compact shape … but we need to be better," said captain CJ Bott post-match, her and the Ferns' body language in sharp contrast to the relieved and delighted Thai side, who took the opportunity to celebrate with a small but noisy set of fans.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Jitka Klimková made three changes to her side; Vic Esson came in for Anna Leat in goal, Claudia Bunge for Rebekah Stott at centre back and Katie Kitching for Riley in central midfield.</p>
        
            <p>World Cup hero Hannah Wilkinson created a decent chance in the 27th minute when her deflection fell for Malia Steinmetz to get a shot off, but it went over the bar. Bott and Jacqui Hand had shots on goal too, making goalkeeper Tiffany Sornpao once again Thailand's busiest player.</p>
        
            <p>The chances kept coming in the second half, notably for Katie Bowen, but nothing was on target or possessed any sort of power.</p>
        
            <p>The match ended with a flourish as the Ferns desperately searched for a breakthrough, but the lack of finishing is a depressingly familiar feeling for Klimková's team - reminiscent of their inability in last year's World Cup to gain a second pool result after upsetting Norway in the opening game.</p>
        
            <p>Things will have to improve quickly, as the Ferns now turn their attention to the 2024 Paris Olympics. They have drawn hosts France, along with Colombia and Canada. Their first match is against the Canadians in Saint-Étienne on 25 July.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 0</p>
        
            <p>Thailand 0</p>
        
            <p>HT: 0-0</p>
