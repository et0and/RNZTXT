            <p>Chanel Harris-Tevita will look to put his horror night with the boot behind him this weekend when the Warriors meet the Tigers in Auckland on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The five-eighth has become the scapegoat for the loss to the Raiders at the weekend after missing all three shots at goal.</p>
        
            <p>Despite outscoring the Raiders four tries to three, the Warriors went down 20-18 after converting just one try, with Harris-Tavita thrust into the role after the starting kicker Adam Pompey was injured.</p>
        
            <p>Though two of his misses were tough shots, it's the one sitter he shanked that fans latched on to, some going as far as messaging him racial abuse on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster said they said they completely backed Harris-Tavita.</p>
        
            <p>"We got around him, told him to get his head up and get on with it. It's going to make him stronger, mate. So many things in that game we got wrong prior to that and there's a million goal kickers that are reached out this week talking about how many they've missed in that situation, some legends of the game have got really good experience where not everyone gets that right and don't have a great day."</p>
        
            <p>Addin Fonua Blake said there was much more that cost them the game than the missed conversions.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like he caught a bit of unwarranted criticism for that. Obviously he missed the kicks. But there was also 20 points scored against us, that's not good enough and I don't think that was talked about enough. It's a team sport. We all back Chanel, and he's going to ice a few good moments for us on Friday."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors' season is hanging by a bit of a thread, needing to win five of their last seven to be a shot at the top eight.</p>
        
            <p>However, they do get a good chance to bounce back on Friday against the bottom-placed Tigers</p>
        
            <p>"We can make a run here but there's no point looking ahead. We've got to win this week and have a real strong performance," Webster said, not underestimating the threat of the Tigers.</p>
        
            <p>"They're kids. Kids coming along really well, the will be really hungry this week. They've had some really good wins. In the last six weeks, the rest of them, they've been in the fight. I think when young, talented players play in the NRL and have got nothing to lose, they're deadly. They're scary. You know, we've got to turn up and be on our toes, because they'll be fearless."</p>
        
            <p>Webster has been forced to make a number of changes this week with two of his regular back three out of action.</p>
        
            <p>With Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Marcello Montoya, Taine Tuaupiki and Adam Pompey all out this week, the Warriors can form a complete backline from a list of injured players which also includes centre Rocco Berry, standoff Luke Metcalf and halfback Shaun Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Edward Kosi takes the spot on the wing while New South Wales Cup regular Moala Graham-Taufa is named for his third NRL appearance in the centres.</p>
        
            <p>"It's funny, so many guys get an opportunity this week, but the beauty about it is, we've got faith in them."</p>
