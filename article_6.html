            <p>While the Black Ferns' shock home defeat to Canada last year is a result that a lot of Super Rugby Aupiki's players won't be looking back on fondly, there's one who will be beaming with pride at the thought of it. Chiefs midfielder Shoshanah Seumanutafa played a crucial role in the 22-19 win for her home nation and admits that the Canadians used a lot of what the current world champions had been doing to their advantage.</p>
        
            <p>"We have learned a lot from the Black Ferns for sure. And I think there is a lot to learn from the rugby that is played out here," the 25-year-old said. Seumanutafa certainly would've been the first port of call for the Canadian coaching staff too, having spent last season in the Manawa wider training squad and then a season in the Farah Palmer Cup with Counties-Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>"I think for me at least, playing over here I really enjoyed it and it kind of allowed me just to be confident in myself again. And I guess in that sense, kind of I did learn how to play at that level.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the opportunity to learn a lot from a lot of the girls and stuff. Coming on to as a wider squad, player just allowed me to try new things and express myself. Everyone was super welcoming and super encouraging, and I think it just allowed me to not really stress about the whole competition and just let me kind of do myself grow, and just focus on playing."</p>

            <p>Seumanutafa is now a full squad member in the Manawa team, alongside a number of senior Black Ferns. She said the desire to go one better than last season, where they were beaten in the Aupiki grand final by the Blues Women, was strong.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a tough finish to the season, last year."</p>
        
            <p>Her rugby journey is an interesting one to becoming the second Canadian test player to join the Chiefs, after Tyler Ardron had a season with the men's side back in 2019. Seumanutafa grew up in British Columbia and was drawn to the game through her Samoan father and watching her brothers play. Still, opportunities for girls to play rugby were limited.</p>

            <p>"My dad to was my first coach, so he was just helping train me. My high school didn't have a team. There weren't a lot of rugby high school teams at the time, so I to tried and find the closest school to me and join their team. Once I graduated, I decided to go to university and kind of that was the next level for us, in Canada. So I joined University of British Columbia and was there for many years… because I wasn't that good at school."</p>

            <p>From there, it wasn't long before Seumanutafa got her test call-up. However, despite the team being doing well enough to earn a semi-final spot at the last World Cup and currently hold the number two spot after an excellent 2024 season, women's rugby very much remains a minority sport in Canada.</p>
        
            <p>"There's not a lot of rugby back at home. So a lot of our girls go overseas, a lot (of the Canadian test team) play in England and a few come over to New Zealand as well. So I think just you've had the opportunity to be able to learn from other countries as well and kind of bring back the best of each and come back together."</p>
