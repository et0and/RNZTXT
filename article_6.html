            <p>Max Verstappen has won five of the last six grands prix in Mexico and while Ferrari will fancy their chances this weekend, the Red Bull driver can take another big step towards a fourth Formula One title.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen arrives at the high-altitude Hermanos Rodriguez circuit 57 points clear of McLaren's Lando Norris with five rounds remaining.</p>
        
            <p>Norris described finishing fourth at last Sunday's US Grand Prix in Austin, with Verstappen third, as a 'momentum killer' in the title battle while Red Bull saw a potential turning point.</p>
        
            <p>The result was the first time in five races that Verstappen had beaten Norris, and the Briton has yet to finish higher than fifth in Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>The constructors' title is far more open, with Ferrari poised to overtake Red Bull for second place after Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz finished one-two in Texas to reduce the gap to eight points.</p>
        
            <p>The pair swept the front row in Mexico last year, with Leclerc on pole.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull need Sergio Perez to produce the points in his home race and turn around a dire run of form that has seen him score only 150 points to Verstappen's 354.</p>
        
            <p>Perez's tally is the lowest of any driver in the top four teams, with nothing better than sixth since Miami in May and serious questions raised about his future despite a contract extension for 2025 and 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Leclerc and Sainz have plenty to be optimistic about as they chase Ferrari's fifth win of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton is the only current driver other than Verstappen to win in Mexico, the seven-times world champion taking his 2017 and 2018 titles there.</p>
        
            <p>Kimi Antonelli, the Italian who will take Hamilton's place next season when the Briton moves to Ferrari, will take part in first free practice using Hamilton's car.</p>
        
            <p>Aston Martin's double world champion Fernando Alonso will chalk up a major milestone as the first Formula One driver to reach 400 grands prix.</p>
        
            <p>To put the achievement into perspective, the 43-year-old Spaniard has started more than a third of all the races (1,120) ever held since the first in 1950.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealander Liam Lawson gets the second start of his six-race stint to end the 2024 season on a high following his ninth place in Texas.</p>
        
            <p>The RB driver impressed in his return to the sport and with no grid penalty hanging over him this weekend will be hunting a top ten in qualifying.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda is also expected to respond following his 14th place in Texas with the team looking to him to take on the challenge from Lawson.</p>
