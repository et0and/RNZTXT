            <p>The Pulse have won their fifth minor premiership and will host the ANZ Premiership grand final after beating the Tactix 58-44 in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>But perhaps even more important than a home grand final - the Pulse have avoided an elimination final against the in-form defending champion Mystics this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Tactix could still grab their first maiden title and send outgoing coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek out on a high, after twice finishing runners-up.</p>
        
            <p>They will be on home soil when they take on the Mystics, who have looked dangerous since Grace Nweke and Peta Toeava returned to the fold after rehabbing from injury.</p>
        
            <p>So much was riding on the final game of netball's ANZ Premiership regular season but the Pulse denied the Tactix the opportunity to host the grand final for the first time.</p>

            <p>The Tactix and Pulse had been battling it out at the top of the ladder all season and came into the game on the same number of wins.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington-based side became the most successful team in ANZ Premiership history when they claimed their third title in 2022 and have a chance to build on their legacy.</p>
        
            <p>When the teams last met in Round 10 the Tactix defeated the Pulse 58-53 in Christchurch in extra time.</p>
        
            <p>But the Pulse did their homework and dominated the first quarter 16-10, thanks in part to a five-goal unanswered scoring run.</p>
        
            <p>Martina Salmon started at goal shoot for the Pulse again, while veteran ring-in Claire Kersten did a great job at centre.</p>
        
            <p>Salmon scored 13 from 15 to set up the Pulse beautifully.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Walmsley replaced Salmon in the second quarter, while Maddy Gordon replaced Kersten at centre.</p>

            <p>The Tactix also mixed up their defensive line by bringing Kate Lloyd on at goal keep, while Jane Watson moved to goal defence, and Karin Burger to wing defence.</p>
        
            <p>Later in the second quarter Tactix coach Delaney-Hoshek brought Paris Lokotui on at goal defence, and moved Watson back to goal keep.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the Tactix efforts to change the momentum of the game the Pulse extended their advantage to lead 31-22 at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>With the Pulse leading 39-31 with five minutes left in the third spell, Salmon came back on for Walmsley.</p>
        
            <p>The Tactix won the third quarter by three goals to trail the Pulse by six goals going into the final turn.</p>

            <p>The Tactix got within four of the Pulse in the final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Walmsley came on for the last eight minutes of the game and the Pulse went on an incredible 11-goal run before the Tactix finally scored their 42nd goal.</p>
        
            <p>Ellie Bird, who was so vital for the Tactix for the bulk of the season, came on at goal shoot for Aliyah Dunn with six minutes left in the game.</p>
        
            <p>Delaney-Hoshek made other last-ditch changes but it was too late and the Pulse ran away with the game.</p>
        
            <p>Both Pulse goal shooters put in a great shift - Salmon finished with 20 from 22 and Walmsley 30 from 36.</p>
