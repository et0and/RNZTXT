            <p>Silver Ferns Maddy Gordon and Amelia Walmsley both returned from lenghty injury spells to help the Pulse conjure a fighting 53-48 win over the Magic in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse reclaimed top spot on the standings with two rounds remaining, their third win in a row lifting them a point clear of the Tactix.</p>
        
            <p>The Magic snaffled a bonus point to remain fourth, one point behind the Mystics, with both teams set to fight it out over the closing weeks for the third and final playoffs berth.</p>
        
            <p>It was a heartbreaking outcome for the Magic, who led through each of the first three quarters but lost the final stanza 13-6, with their passing lines into the circle effectively cut off by the Pulse defence.</p>
        
            <p>Magic shooters Saviour Tui (25/29) and Ameliaranne Ekenasio (23/30) were also wayward in the final stanza, while Walmsley found her range to finish with 16 goals from 18 shots.</p>

            <p>Towering goal shoot Walmsley has been recovering from a knee injury since round five, while midcourter Gordon's ankle injury stretched her time on the medical table back to round three.</p>
        
            <p>Both players were introduced midway through the third quarter and their impact sparked a turnaround.</p>
        
            <p>The result avenged the 58-41 hammering the Pulse took from the Magic in Tauranga in round seven.</p>
