            <p>The Black Sticks women have won the Nations Cup hockey tournament in Chile.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand beat Ireland in a shootout after the final finished 1-1 at the end of regulation play.</p>
        
            <p>It reversed the result from when the two sides met in pool play .</p>
        
            <p>Emelia Surridge opened the scoring in the first few minutes, with Ireland grabbing the equaliser in the final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've been building so well this week," said player of the game Holly Pearson.</p>
        
            <p>"As a young inexperienced group to win today is really special for this group especially going forward."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is now eligible for promotion to the FIH Hockey Pro League.</p>
        
            <p>It will also give the team confidence as they build towards World Cup qualification against Australia in August this year.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Sticks women failed to qualify for last year's Olympics.</p>
