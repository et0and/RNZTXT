            <p>Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor has reached a preliminary agreement to fight American social media influencer-turned-fighter Logan Paul in an exhibition boxing match.</p>
        
            <p>McGregor, who was ordered to pay damages last month, after a jury in a civil trial at Ireland's High Court found he assaulted a woman in 2018, has tweeted the fight will take place in India, but has not specified when it will potentially occur.</p>
        
            <p>"I am in preliminary agreements with the Ambani family to face Logan Paul in a boxing exhibition in India," he said. I have agreed.</p>
        
            <p>"I will then seek my return to the Octagon."</p>
        
            <p>Paul - whose younger brother Jake fought 58-year-old former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson in a widely watched Netflix event that strained the streaming platform's servers - also has few fights under his belt.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old survived eight rounds against retired five-division champion Floyd Mayweather, who is 18 years his senior, in an exhibition fight three years ago.</p>
