            <p>Wellington's Sky Stadium is officially a sell-out for Saturday night's A-League football semi-final between the Phoenix and Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>The stadium capacity for the match is 34,500.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand-based fans can no longer get tickets, although Melbourne Victory fans can still access a couple of hundred tickets for Australian-based fans.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix are chasing their first-ever grand final berth in the club's 17-year history, with the semi-final tie level after the first leg in Melbourne was tied 0-0.</p>
        
            <p>The club's previous biggest crowd attendance was almost 33,000 set when they hosted a semi-final in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix captain Alex Rufer said playing in front of a capacity crowd meant a lot.</p>
        
            <p>"We deserve it, Wellington deserves it and it would be awesome for the club," Rufer said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've really given it everything this year and hopefully we get a good crowd to show us that they support us too."</p>
        
            <p>The winner will play either defending champions Central Coast Mariners or Sydney FC in the final.</p>
        
            <p>The second semi between those two sides in Gosford on Saturday night is also a sell-out.</p>
