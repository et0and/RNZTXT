            <p>The world champion Black Ferns have suffered a last gasp loss to Ireland in their opening W-X-V rugby test in Vancouver, going down 29-27.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns led 27-22 with just a minute to go when Ireland scored to level the scores at 27-all, and then slotted the conversion to seal the win.</p>
        
            <p>The match was close throughout.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand scored first through hooker Atlanta Lolohea to go head 7-nil but Ireland replied through loose forward Aoife Wafer after a quick tap form a penalty close to the line to close the gap to 7-5.</p>
        
            <p>A Renee Holmes penalty extended the Black Ferns lead to 10-5 midway through the first half.</p>
        
            <p>Ireland's Wafer scored a second when she crashed over from the back of the scrum to make it 10-all and with a subsequent conversion, Ireland found themselves in front for the first time with 12-10 at the 30 minute mark.</p>
        
            <p>They extended the lead to 17-10 when hooker Neve Jones scored her side's third try.</p>
        
            <p>But the Black Ferns scored just before the break through winger Katelyn Vahaakolo and Renee Holmes conversion levelled the scores up at 17-all at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>The second half was a grinding affair but the Black Ferns simply failed to make the most of their scoring opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>They had two second half tries disallowed through the Television Match Official, when Sylvia Brunt lost the ball as it grounded over the line and again when Luka Connor appeared to have scored only for it to be disallowed due to an earlier obstruction.</p>
        
            <p>A Renee Holmes penalty goal midway through the second half broke the deadlock to give the Black Ferns a 20-17 lead, only for Ireland to reply with a try to Erin King to re-take the lead 22-20.</p>
        
            <p>Sustained pressure from the Black Ferns finally paid off when Mererangi Paul scored to give New Zealand the lead again at 25-22 and the subsequent conversion from Bremner extended that to 27-22 but Ireland were not giving up.</p>
        
            <p>A penalty with time nearly up saw Ireland kick for touch and set-up a line-out just out from New Zealand's line and from the following maul and several rucks Erin King finally crashed over to level the score and Dannah O'Brien held her nerve to slot the conversion and give Ireland an historic win 29-27.</p>
        
            <p>Ireland outscored New Zealand five tries to four.</p>
        
            <p>Post match, Ireland captain Edel McMahon said: "I'm lost for words because that was unbelievable. The girls got stuck in right from the get go and it went right down to the wire. But right from the start everyone had belief ... and that was absolutely amazing.</p>
        
            <p>"This team has been on a journey ... we are still going up and it's all about belief. We work hard and we challenge each other every day ... it's just hard bloody work."</p>
        
            <p>A disappointed Black Ferns co-captain Kennedy Tukuafu told Sky Sport the loss was not through a lack of effort.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very hungry Irish side ... so it's back to the drawing board and we need to make sure we are up for the next couple of games."</p>
        
            <p>Tukuafu highlighted two areas of concern - the inability to make the most of their scoring opportunities and making too many errors.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's next game in the tournament is against world number one England in a week's time.</p>
