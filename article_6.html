            <p>Henry Nicholls has been dropped from the Black Caps squad for the two-test series against South Africa next month.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls has failed to make the 13-player squad along with spinners Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi.</p>
        
            <p>He's struggled for runs over the past couple of years and there had been growing calls for him to axed.</p>
        
            <p>In his last 20 test innings going back two years - he has scored over 50 just once, making 200 not out against Sri Lanka in March last year.</p>
        
            <p>The 32 year old Nicholls made his debut in 2016 and has played 56 tests.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Gary Stead acknowledged that some tough calls had to be made, including leaving out Nicholls, Patel and Sodhi.</p>
        
            <p>"All three players have made strong contributions to Test-winning performances over the past 14 months.</p>
        
            <p>"But we believe we've struck a good balance between experience, and providing opportunities for newer players."</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson has been included after injurying his hamstring playing the T20 series against Pakistan a fortnight ago.</p>
        
            <p>Rachin Ravindra has been brought into the line-up for Nicholls and is set to bat in the middle order for the first time in his Test career, with Will Young providing batting cover.</p>
        
            <p>24 year-old Ravindra made his Test debut in 2021-22 against India at Kanpur, adding another cap at Mumbai before returning to New Zealand to play in that summer's opening Test against Bangladesh.</p>

            <p>Also included is Glenn Phillips, who is line to play his first Test on home soil after making his debut against Australia in 2019-20 and playing in both Tests on the early season tour to Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>A squad of 13 will assemble for each Test, with pace bowler Will O'Rourke joining the squad for the second match at Hamilton's Seddon Park, and one player coming out of the squad from Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>O'Rourke's elevation follows his selection in the New Zealand A side for the four-day "Tests" against Australia A, and his recent ODI debut.</p>
        
            <p>Allrounder Mitch Santner also retains his place in the squad following on from strong contributions with ball and bat in Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>If selected in the eleven, it will be his first Test at home since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi are the other members of the Bangladesh touring squad not included, with the selection group seeking a different balance for the conditions expected.</p>
        
            <p>Stead said the squad was a challenging one to pick, with a number of players putting their hands up, and conditions to consider.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pleasing as a selector to see different players making contributions during the recent series in Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>"Glenn and Mitch both earned selection on the back of their recent work in red ball cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"They continue to work on their games to contribute across formats and situations."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was exciting to have such a range of experience and options in the group.</p>
        
            <p>"Will O'Rourke has impressed us in stepping up from domestic cricket to New Zealand A and then international level.</p>
        
            <p>"Rachin Ravindra is another player who has really impressed us with his contributions to the team over the past 12 months in international cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been particularly pleased with his ability to adapt and learn in different roles."</p>
        
            <p>He noted that, while several players in the squad had missed cricket recently due to injury, all were tracking positively for the series opener.</p>
        
            <p>"Tom Blundell, Kyle Jamieson and Kane Williamson are all at slightly different points in their rehabilitation plans.</p>
        
            <p>But we're confident they'll be good to go at Bay Oval."</p>
