            <p>New Zealand have capitalised on the home advantage to take line honours at SailGP in Lyttelton to snatch an overall series lead.</p>
        
            <p>The Peter Burling-skippered Black Foils sailed clear of France and Canada in the three-team final for the overall victory in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The schedule was reduced to fleet races and a final on Sunday after dolphins on the Lyttelton course forced cancellation of racing on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Australia were unable to start the second and third fleet races with significant damage to their foiling catamaran.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand finished second in the last fleet race to progress to the final, with Australia failing to qualify for the winner-takes-all final podium race.</p>

            <p>"Doesn't get any better than that," said Kiwi wing trimmer Blair Tuke after the win over France by 12 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>"Race weekend win at home, beautiful conditions, crowd... after yesterday's disappointment for everyone, we're so stoked to put on a good show today.</p>
        
            <p>"We said we hoped to do it and we've done it.</p>
        
            <p>"We got into a tough spot in that last fleet race to make the final, but held it together, and executed a good start and had a clean race from there."</p>
        
            <p>Australia's foiling catamaran suffered damage during the opening race when they collided with Canada and became hooked on a marker buoy, forcing them out of the contest.</p>
        
            <p>The fleet now heads to Bermuda in May, with further stops at Halifax and New York, before the final at San Francisco in July.</p>
        
            <p>The SailGP series is in its fourth year and involves 10 teams racing identical high-tech foiling F50 catamarans reaching speeds of 50 knots.</p>
