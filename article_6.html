            <p>Holders Manchester City beat Chelsea 1-0 with a late Bernardo Silva goal to reach the FA Cup final after an absorbing end-to-end Wembley semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>Silva sidefooted the ball home in the 84th minute after Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic parried a shot from former Blues midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.</p>
        
            <p>City will meet Manchester United or second-tier Coventry City, who play on Sunday, in the showpiece game on 25 May.</p>
        
            <p>The result offered some consolation for Pep Guardiola's side, who were eliminated on penalties in the Champions League quarter-finals by Real Madrid in midweek.</p>
        
            <p>Silva, who missed a penalty in the shootout against Real, said he was: "Very happy after a very frustrating week for all of us, for me personally.</p>
        
            <p>"The good thing is in football, if you play at Man City you play every three days, so after two to three days, you have a chance for a bit of revenge and to put things right."</p>
        
            <p>City are still on for a double, standing two points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea, whose last visit to Wembley ended in League Cup final defeat by a late Liverpool goal in extra time two months ago, squandered some of the best chances.</p>
        
            <p>Senegalese Nicolas Jackson was particularly profligate.</p>
        
            <p>He took the first shot on target in the eighth minute but it was easily collected by Stefan Ortega in the City goal.</p>
        
            <p>Early in the second half, Jackson had two chances to put the ball away but Ortega intercepted both.</p>
        
            <p>There were also opportunities for 21-year-old former City forward Cole Palmer, who scored four goals against Everton in the league last Monday, and for Noni Madueke.</p>
        
            <p>A last-gasp free kick from substitute Mykhailo Mudryk sailed over the bar, summing up a miserable afternoon for Chelsea and their manager Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea have now been eliminated from six of their last eight FA Cup ties against Manchester City, including in the third round last season.</p>
