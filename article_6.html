        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific team preview: the Chiefs</h2>
        <p>
We're counting down to the season starting on Friday, today we look at the last year's beaten finalists the Chiefs.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - Super Rugby Pacific kicks off on Friday 14 February, with one less team than last season and a whole host of things to talk about. We're once again previewing each New Zealand team from worst to first, today it's last year's beaten finalists the Chiefs.</p>

            <p>Clayton McMillan's men will be hurting after last year's excellent campaign came to such an abrupt halt in the final. Still, the Chiefs are coming into 2025 as one of the favoured teams, albeit missing one of their key players. McMillan is now into his fourth season in charge of the team and will be getting impatient for some silverware after coming up short in the last two finals.</p>

            <p>Once again, the Chiefs are stacked. They now can boast an All Black inside back pairing, a rising star in Josh Jacomb, perhaps test rugby's form lock last season in Tupou Vaa'i and the usual firepower out wide with Emoni Narawa and Etene Nanai-Seturo. They can count on decent home support too, with FMG Stadium Waikato consistently drawing good crowds to support their team.</p>

            <p>The best player the Chiefs had last year will not be lacing up his boots this year, with Wallace Sititi out with a knee injury. Just when it happened remains a mystery, so it's hard not to think McMillan will have some pretty strong thoughts on Sititi starting every test on the All Blacks' end of year tour. Then there's the Shaun Stevenson situation, with the fullback missing the first four rounds due to an NZ Rugby approved stint in Japan. While Stevenson gets a nice little payday, he leaves his spot wide open for someone to come in and take.</p>

            <p>Kaylum Boshier looks to be the replacement for the departed Sam Cane, with young flanker the likely starter at openside. He joins a very strong loose forward unit that will absorb the loss of Sititi as well. Jacomb has been handed the 10 jersey for the first game and it's a pretty tough assignment, it will be interesting to see whether this is a long term plan by McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want to change fundamentally how we play Chiefs rugby, which gives the ball some air and we ask our players to be courageous, but also recognise that teams understand what it looks like when we're playing well, and how they can impose their game on us to potentially suffocate us." - Clayton McMillan.</p>

            <p>Chiefs Mana has taken a serious hit in the last couple of years as the side has done literally everything except win a title. Waikato Draught has never tasted so bitter after the last two finals, especially since the last one was an absolute flogging at the hands of the Blues in front of 47,000 Aucklanders who have been more than happy to rub it in for the last year. Hamilton can't even win the one thing it seemingly had an eternal lock on either, having lost its spot of chlamydia capital of New Zealand to the nearby East Cape. Just to rub it in, Auckland's pinched the number one spot for gonorrhoea as well.</p>
        
            <p>Round one at Eden Park stands as an early chance of vengeance against the Blues, in a rematch of last year's final. The two sides meet again four rounds later, but the most important games look like the very tough run home: the Chiefs have away games at the Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders to finish the regular season.</p>
