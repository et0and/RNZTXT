        <h2>Watch: Pakuranga win thrilling U85kg National Club Cup</h2>
        <p>
A dramatic sideline conversion crowned the Black Panthers as the top weight grade side in New Zealand.
</p>
        
            <p>Pakuranga's Riley Harrison broke the hearts of the defending champion High School Old Boys Light Bears in the National Club Cup Under 85kg final at Sky Stadium on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>His conversion from out wide of Francis Morrison's try, deep into injury time, made the score 23-22, ending a thrilling match that crowned the Black Panthers as the top weight grade side in the country.</p>
        
            <p>It was the fifth time the competition had been held and the second time the final was a curtain-raiser for an All Black test.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Harrison had nailed three shots at goal after Pakuranga were awarded a string of penalties. Their dominant set piece propelled them to the Auckland U85kg title and subsequent charge to the national final.</p>
        
            <p>HSOB finally got their hands on the ball and into the game after a break by wing Tom Anderson, and while he couldn't get a pass away for what would've been a certain try, they kept themselves in the Pakuranga 22 for Ned Milne to eventually score under the posts. His side took a 13-9 lead into the halftime break.</p>
        
            <p>By then, it had become clear both sides were keeping things tight and going to the boot often. Defence was extremely tight and chances were at a premium, with both sets of forwards' fitness levels tested immensely.</p>
        
            <p>Taine Cordell-Hunt banged through a 40-metre penalty in the 49th minute to stretch HSOB's lead to 19-9.</p>
        
            <p>But Pakuranga's lineout and scrum got them back into the game shortly after, when a drive first yielded a penalty and the subsequent scrum saw replacement loose forward Logan Kinnear take the ball off the back and crash over.</p>

            <p>The game looked likely to finish with a HSOB victory as they worked the ball into the Pakuranga half and camped out in the 22, then were awarded a penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Crucially, it was Cordell-Hunt's only miss of the day, leaving the door open just enough for Pakuranga to mount their furious last assault on the line.</p>
        
            <p>Around 30 phases later, Morrison crossed to give Harrison and Pakuranga their moment of glory.</p>
        
            <p>Grade patron Sir Graham Henry said post-match the final was a "wonderful advertisement" for under 85kg rugby.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Rugby was expected to confirm a schedule for New Zealand's first Under 85kg side in the coming weeks.</p>
