            <p>Joelle King has overcome a lengthy injury layoff to create New Zealand sporting history in Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>King became the first athlete to win 11 New Zealand Squash Championship titles, breaking Dame Susan Devoy's 32-year-old record of 10 national titles.</p>
        
            <p>Against young up-and-comer Ella Lash in the women's final on Sunday, King was a cut above, dropping one game as she cruised to another national title, beating 18-year-old Lash 11-5, 7-11, 11-3, 11-8.</p>
        
            <p>"To dream of winning one was huge when I was a child, so to be on my 11th is surreal," King said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll never match some of Suzie's records but to beat one of them is no mean feat and I'm really pleased."</p>
        
            <p>King was sidelined from the sport for eight months from last October with a disc problem in her back and a torn meniscus.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been the toughest time of my career. To just be back on court playing is a big win, I've been extremely emotional but I'm so happy to have got through the weekend pain-free."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand has a new men's champion, following a family showdown between brothers Temwa and Lwamba Chileshe.</p>
        
            <p>Older brother Lwamba took the honours, winning in three games. The match got off to a brutal start with a mammoth 32 points contested in the opening game, Lwamba eventually winning 17-15 after Temwa was unable to convert five game balls.</p>
        
            <p>From there Lwamba stayed composed and rode his momentum for a 17-15, 11-7, 11-8 victory.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bittersweet victory for me today as I always want the best for my brother and it's always hard playing him as we both know each other's games inside and out," Lwamba said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am very stoked to have won my first ever national title as I don't know if I'll ever get my name on this trophy again.</p>
        
            <p>"Shout-out to Paul Coll who is New Zealand number one and decided to have his wedding at the same time as nationals to give the rest of us a shot at this title."</p>
        
            <p>Elijah Thomas beat Joel Arscott to place third in the men's division, while Jena Gregory overcame Winona-Jo Joyce to place third in the women's.</p>
