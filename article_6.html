            <p>The most thrilling sport on the planet delivered more pulsating moments, jaw-dropping knockouts, new champions, intense beefs, the birth of new stars, and the end of legendary careers.</p>
        
            <p>It was another typically unpredictable, chaotic and wild year inside the world of MMA.</p>
        
            <p>Jonty Dine takes a look back at the highlights.</p>
        
            <p>Another somewhat rocky road for Kiwis in the world's biggest MMA promotion.</p>
        
            <p>Former middleweight champion Israel Adesanya failed to reclaim his title at UFC 305 in a heated rivalry with South Africa's Dricus du Plessis, culminating in Adesanya submitting to a crank in round four of their bout in Perth in September.</p>
        
            <p>However, City Kick Boxing still picked up two wins in Western Australia - lightweight Dan Hooker edging a decision over Mateusz Gamrot, while Kai Kara France put himself back in title contention with a first round TKO of Steve Erceg.</p>
        
            <p>Carlos Ulberg put himself in the conversation for a shot at gold at light heavyweight after two cancelled bouts and a string of injuries. The Black Jag finally got things back on tack with a win over Volkan Oezdemir in November.</p>
        
            <p>Junior Tafa was the busiest Kiwi fighter with three bouts at heavyweight, picking up a win and two losses, including a controversial submission at 305. Older brother Justin appeared in the octagon just once, losing a decision to Karl Williams in March.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, Aaron Tau failed to impress Dana White on the boss' titular Contender Series, however Navajo Stirling did manage to secure a contract on the show, with a round two knockout of Phillip Latu.</p>
        
            <p>GOAT or duck? Jones has always polarised the MMA community due to some disgraceful behaviour outside of the cage, but his refusal to even entertain the idea of a bout with interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall has taken his villainy to new lows.</p>
        
            <p>Both Jones and Dana White are now pushing the narrative that Jones is the greatest fighter of all time, a notion that was only given more weight after Jones' methodical destruction of an over the hill Stipe Miocic, until he squares off with Aspinall, he will not earn the respect of the fanbase.</p>

            <p>Max Holloway's legendary finish of Justin Gaethje at UFC 300 to declare himself the true BMF of the sport will live as one of the most iconic moments in the sport's history.</p>
        
            <p>Scoffed at for its gimmicky nature, the ending to this war was no joke as the Hawaiian warrior pointed to the middle of the octagon, daring Gaethje to trade with him for the final 10 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>'The Highlight' obliged and the pair engaged in a violent exchange of haymakers, with Holloway finding the chin in the final second of the fight as Gaetje crumbled to the canvas and the Las Vegas crowd erupted.</p>
        
            <p>It is the most maligned art in mixed martial arts, but there is no denying the effectiveness of wrestling.</p>
        
            <p>The bar was set insanely high by the Dagestani dynasty, with Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev changing the game with their suffocating styles, as more masters of the mat have smothered their way to the top of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>This year saw the fairy-tale rise of Rocky Edwards end in deflating style as Belal Muhammed ragdolled the Englishman to take his welterweight strap in front Leon's London faithful.</p>
        
            <p>The Suga Show was also soured at the Sphere, with Merab Dvalishvili nullifying the striking guru with his relentless takedowns. Another wrestling wizard in Bo Nickal also continued his surge up the ranks at middleweight.</p>

            <p>The UFC does production value like few others and the spectacle that was the Sphere at UFC 306 solidified this reputation.</p>
        
            <p>Held on Mexican Independence Day weekend, the production included immersive audio and visual technology with epic short films celebrating Mexican heritage between fights.</p>
        
            <p>A huge gamble by Dana and his team which paid off with a record with a $22 million gate.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Featherweight king Illia Topuria's two wins in 2024 may even eclipse Conor McGregor's 2015 due to the calibre of opponent.</p>
        
            <p>El Matador ended one of the greatest and most dominant reigns in the promotion's history when he finished Alex Volkanovski at UFC 298 before uncorking another brutal right hand on BMF champ Max Holloway at UFC 308 to record stunning back-to-back wins and usher in the era of Illia.</p>
        
            <p>Alex 'Poatan' Pereira's three vicious knockouts in 2024 has earned him the moniker of the UFC saviour.</p>
        
            <p>His first victim was Jamahal Hill at UFC 300, after referee Herb Dean saw Pereria caught one on the cup, he tried to pause the action, only for Poatan to wave him off, and sleep "Sweet Dreams" seconds later.</p>
        
            <p>A rematch against Jiri Prochazka at UFC 303 ended far more emphatically with a decisive head-kick KO once and truly ending the rivalry.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, at UFC 307, Pereira eventually broke a very game Khalil Rountree Jr. in a gruelling and bloody bout. Pereira is now considering a switch up to heavyweight, for what would be an historic three-division championship run should he claim a third belt.</p>

            <p></p>
        
            <p>The depressing fall of Tony Ferguson continues.</p>
        
            <p>Once the most feared man in the lightweight division and owner of a legendary 12-fight win streak from 2013-2019, El Cucuy has become a shell of the former fighter and has stretched his streak of defeats to eight, tapping out to a rear-naked -choke at the hands of Michael Chiesa in August, surpassing BJ Penn for the longest losing run in UFC history.</p>
        
            <p>Fans are now begging Ferguson to hang up the gloves.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Fan favourite Dustin Poirier's stock took a dive in 2023 after Gaethje sent him to the shadow realm with a vicious head kick to win the vacant BMF title.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Diamond bounced back in blockbusting style with a second-round knockout of Benoit Saint Denis to earn another shot at the Dagestani phenom that is Islam Makhachev.</p>
        
            <p>A five round classic played out at UFC 302, Poirier proving one of Islam's toughest tests to date, with the Russian eventually submitting Poirier in the fifth round with a D'Arce.</p>

            <p>Completing her trilogy with Alexa Grasso for the flyweight title, Valentina Shevchenko reclaimed her crown at UFC 306 with a unanimous decision win.</p>
        
            <p>Dropping her strap in early 2023 before fighting out a split draw later in September, Shevchenko had to wait another 12 months for her shot at redemption, and the bullet did not miss, scoring 50-45 across the board.</p>
        
            <p>One of the dumbest rules in MMA which harbours back to the late 90's when the sport was labelled 'human cockfighting.'</p>
        
            <p>The 12 to 6 elbow rule, which banned the use of a downward elbow strike from above the head straight down to an opponent, was implemented due to videos of fake martial art 'masters' breaking dozens of faux cement blocks with the move.</p>
        
            <p>The rule resulted in a disqualification loss for Jon Jones in 2009, the only blemish on his otherwise perfect record. Thankfully, the rule was redacted in July.</p>
        
            <p>Donald Trump's connection with MMA dates back to the UFC's infancy, when Trump was one of the few venue owners prepared to host its events.</p>
        
            <p>The partnership hit new heights during the 2024 presidential campaign when White and Joe Rogan both heavily endorsed the president elect.</p>
        
            <p>His election win culminated in a nauseating tribute video played at UFC 309 where Trump sat cage side with several members of his new cabinet, inlcuding Elon Musk.</p>
        
            <p>Several fighters paid tribute to Trump throughout the night, including Jones who celebrated his title win with the trademark Trump dance.</p>
