            <p>Undefeated Japanese boxer Naoya Inoue survived a first-round knockdown to knock out challenger Luis Nery in the sixth and defend his undisputed super bantamweight world championship at the Tokyo Dome.</p>
        
            <p>Inoue progressed to a professional record of 27-0, with 24 of his victories coming by KO or TKO. Mexico's Nery suffered the second knockout of his professional career, and fell to 35-2.</p>
        
            <p>Nery's left hook knocked down Inoue for the first time in his career, but the 31-year-old got back up and knocked Nery down in the second round with his own left hook to regain momentum.</p>
        
            <p>Another left hook from Inoue dropped Nery in the fifth before a right hand finished the bout in the next round, ensuring Inoue retained his WBC, WBO, WBA and IBF belts in front of a sold-out home crowd.</p>
