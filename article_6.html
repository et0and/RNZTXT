        <h2>'See it, be it': Trailblazer embraces role as first female SailGP driver</h2>
        <p>
The two-time Olympic champion is now jockeying for position on the water against her male rivals.

            <p>The first thing you need to understand about Brazilian SailGP skipper Martine Grael is her pedigree on the water.</p>
        
            <p>Father Torben Grael is a two-time Olympic champion in the Star class, he's played a key role for Luna Rossa in America's Cup challenges, and won the Volvo Ocean Race.</p>
        
            <p>Of course his children would follow in his wake. Son Marco has also sailed at two Olympics, but daughter Martine admits she never really considered that a viable pathway during her formative years.</p>
        
            <p>"Growing up in Brazil was probably different to growing up here in New Zealand," she explained, overlooking the SailGP village at Auckland's Wynyard Viaduct. "Over there, it was very unlikely girls would get called into weekend races.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was younger, I didn't dream about the Olympics, until there was a girl in Brazil that got a bronze medal - that's when my dream began, even though I had a father at home with five Olympic medals.</p>
        
            <p>"It's funny to think I only started dreaming about the Olympics, when a girl won an Olympic medal for Brazil. Looking back, I realise that role models and inspiration play a big role in what people dream of."</p>
        
            <p>That 'see it, be it' moment probably occurred, when Fernanda Oliveira and Isabel Swan stepped onto the women's 470 podium at Beijing 2008. Grael would have been 17 and would become a world youth champion the following year.</p>

            <p>Now 33 and herself a two-time Olympic gold medallist, she is very conscious of the responsibility she's been handed as SailGP's first female driver.</p>
        
            <p>The professional sailing circuit has always promoted women sailors, allocating spots on the boat for them, but Grael is the first to be handed control, something she doesn't take lightly.</p>
        
            <p>"Being the first female driver, for sure, will show young girls that 'This is what I want to be'," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really grateful for this opportunity, I feel like I'm representing a lot of girls out there in the sailing world.</p>
        
            <p>"Having this opportunity to sail at high level with good people, with investment in the team and really professional people, that's the first time."</p>
        
            <p>Brazil has a proud tradition of Olympic sailing, led by Grael, her father and another two-time champion, Robert Scheidt, but Mubadala Brazil are only taking their first steps on the SailGP stage.</p>
        
            <p>Grael is not just a trailblazer for women, but also for her nation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually a bit of a challenge for me," she admitted. "I always like to have very open discussions with everybody and listen to everybody, so I'm maybe not the greatest leader.</p>
        
            <p>"I love people that know what they're doing and I think the team we have make it very easy for me, great personalities and great sailors. We're having a good time on the water and improving."</p>
        
            <p>Brazil made their debut in light winds at Dubai last November, placing 10th of the 12 teams overall, and finishing midfleet in the third and fourth races, considered a promising start.</p>

            <p>Still, Grael hopes for bigger and better things this weekend at Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't expect us to win, but I'm hoping for a better performance than we did in Dubai," she said. "We're not sad about it, but we knew we could do better.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, we are here to win and not just be good at it, but we have to acknowledge that most of the teams have been here for four seasons and we're just coming in rookies.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd be very naïve to think we can just come out there and win every race, but it's not impossible. We've seen we're not too far off and we're here to get that title eventually."</p>
        
            <p>Grael's Olympic and ocean-racing experience means she brings instant mana to her new role. Most of her rivals know her either personally or by reputation, and have accepted her easily.</p>
        
            <p>She also has a couple of 'big brother' minders on her crew - one is literally her big brother, former Olympian Marco Grael. Another is former Black Foils and Emirates Team NZ flight controller Andy Maloney, who has switched allegiances to the expansion outfit.</p>
        
            <p>"Andy's just as Kiwi as you can imagine," insisted Grael. "He's great… I've sailed against his sister and we're really good friends, and I know his family very well.</p>
        
            <p>"He's as good a personality as I expected and also a very good leader in his own right. He's very good at talking in the right moments and pulling the team forwards.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very valuable and reassuring to sail with him."</p>
