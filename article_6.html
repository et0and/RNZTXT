            <p>A record number of entries have been received for next week's National Surfing Championships in Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>More than 400 surfers have signed up for the 62nd National Championships.</p>
        
            <p>Both 2024 champions Daniel Farr of Taranaki and Maya Mateja of Raglan will be there to defend their elite titles.</p>
        
            <p>Also competing in the women's division is international star Paige Hareb who last won the title in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>With Taranaki having an abundance of surfing spots, organisers can pick from a half a dozen venues from Fitzroy in the north to Opunake in the south depending on conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The week long event starts on Sunday and is the 10th time it has been hosted by the West Coast region, with the most recent in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 29 divisions are contested with both men's and women's sections from under 14's to over 70's.</p>
        
            <p>Athletes compete in short and long boards, stand-up paddleboards, knee and body boards.</p>
        
            <p>Up for grabs is the Peter Byers Overall Performance of the Event Award.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Byers started surfboard building in 1958 after being visited by Californian lifeguards Bing Copeland and Rick Stoner.</p>
        
            <p>Remembered as one of the pioneering board riders and the founding father of board making in New Zealand, Byers passed away in 2012 at the age of 71.</p>
        
            <p>That year and every nationals since, Surfing New Zealand honoured the memory and pioneering work of Byers with a surfboard shaped trophy shaped out of West Coast Kauri by local craftsman Clive Barron.</p>
