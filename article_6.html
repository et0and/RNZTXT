            <p>Black Caps allrounder Michael Bracewell is playing a straight bat at the prospect of him returning to the national side for the T20 World Cup later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell had become a fixture in the New Zealand side until he suffered an achilles injury in England in June last year.</p>
        
            <p>He suffered the injury while playing for Worcestershire in the English T20 Blast and underwent surgery which ruled him out of contention for the World Cup in India.</p>
        
            <p>The 32 year old off spinner and big hitter returned to the game earlier this month for Wellington in the Super Smash.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell wasn't considered for this month's T20 series against Pakistan, but he may come into contention for the T20 games against Australia next month.</p>
        
            <p>While he has excelled mostly in the 50-over version of the game, his versatility will throw him in consideration for the T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just trying to take it game-by-game at the moment, when you come off a big layoff the risk is that you start thinking about the big picture and don't take care of things in front of you," Bracewell told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"My focus is very much on playing the ball in front of me and trying to bowl the ball that I want to bowl and from there you just let the other things take care of themselves."</p>
        
            <p>He says he's in regular contact with the Black Caps staff.</p>
        
            <p>"They're keeping a close eye on my progress and giving me all the support I need to do the things I need to out on the field."</p>

            <p>Bracewell admits all he can do now is play as much domestic cricket as possible for the rest of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"I've just got to get time in my legs, after a long break you never really know how things are going to go when you get back to match intensity, but it's responding really well.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm enjoying playing for Wellington at the moment and just trying to keep making those steps forward from a rehab and performance point of view."</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell shot onto the international stage in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He played in the World Cup in Australia and scored well in the ODI series in Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>In early 2023 he scored the third fastest century in New Zealand ODI cricket while batting against India and that resulted in him picking up an IPL contract with the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</p>
        
            <p>There are plenty of pinnacle events for Bracewell to aim for over the next few years with the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the USA in June.</p>
        
            <p>The next 50-over World Cup is in 2027 in southern Africa, while the 50-over Champions Trophy, which New Zealand won in 2000, returns in 2025 in Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>Possible New Zealand squad for T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA in June:</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson (captain), Devon Conway, Finn Allen, Tim Seifert, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner, Jimmy Neehsam, Michael Bracewell, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Ish Sodhi and Lockie Ferguson.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Milne and Ben Sears come into the squad if non contracted Boult and Neesham are unavailable.</p>
