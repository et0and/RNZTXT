            <p>Australia have started the defence of their women's T20 World Cup title with a strong performance against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>Australia won by six wickets, while another title contender, England, opened their campaign with a 21-run win over Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka chose to bat first in Sharjah but struggled to 93 for seven, with Nilakshika Silva top scoring with an unbeaten 29.</p>
        
            <p>Australia also struggled for a while with the bat, but thanks to an unbeaten 43 from Beth Mooney, got home with 5.4 overs to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Their next game is against New Zealand on Wednesday with the White Ferns coming off an upset win over India in their opening match.</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowler Megan Schutt, who was player of the match for Australia today, told the ICC they were excited about meeting New Zealand again.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be a great match (against New Zealand). We've obviously just come off a series against them in Australian conditions so it'll be an even tougher match up here."</p>
        
            <p>Schutt took three wickets for 12 runs from her four overs.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile in the other group England relied on their four spin bowlers to overcome Bangladesh in a low scoring game.</p>
        
            <p>Danni Wyatt-Hodge top scored with 41 as England set a target of just 119.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh finished on 97 for seven with Sohana Mostray making 44.</p>
        
            <p>Tomorrow India play Pakistan and Scotland play West Indies.</p>
