            <p>All Blacks winger Emoni Narawa has extended his contract with New Zealand Rugby and the Chiefs until the end of 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Narawa has had another strong Super Rugby Pacific season, scoring eight tries in just seven appearances this year to sit in the top three for tries scored in the 2024 competition.</p>
        
            <p>"It is fantastic that Emoni has recommitted to the Chiefs for the next few years. He has always had massive potential, and it has been a real pleasure seeing that talent realised over the last few seasons, exemplified by his selection as an All Black in 2023," said Chiefs head coach Clayton McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>Narawa joins fellow outside backs Shaun Stevenson and Etene Nanai-Seturo in re-committing to the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>"Emoni has an unbelievable ability to see space and create opportunities for himself and others. He is a valued team member and a real character who contributes significantly both on and off the field," McMillan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people have contributed to Emoni's journey, but none more so than his young family. They have given him stability and a real purpose in life and we are grateful they too will continue to be a part of the Chiefs whƒÅnau."</p>

            <p>Narawa, who was named in last year's All Blacks World Cup squad before being ruled out of the tournament with injury, was excited to be continuing his career in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really blessed and grateful for the opportunity to extend my time with the Chiefs until 2026. This club is our family and has definitely helped me become the player that I am today. God is good, excited for what's to come."</p>
