        <h2>The Sam Cane story isn't finished after all</h2>

The former captain is ready to potentially finish his All Black career on his terms.

            <p>Former All Black captain Sam Cane is ready to potentially finish his All Black career on his terms.</p>
        
            <p>The 95-test veteran has been named on the bench for Saturday night's test against Argentina and said on Thursday that he "always believed" he would make a return to the black jersey.</p>
        
            <p>"I have plenty to offer, with my ability. Through rehab and coming back through surgery ... I'd just try and do the same week of training, then do it better," said Cane, referring to the neck injury he suffered in January that had restricted him to only three games of rugby since.</p>
        
            <p>"I think having been in [this year's All Black environment] from the start ... it's allowed me to get a feel of how I can fit in and where I can contribute from a leadership point of view. Last week and this week I feel a lot more comfortable."</p>

            <p>Cane's initial inclusion in the wider All Black squad raised a few eyebrows, not only because he has signed to play in Japan from next year on, but also because he was very much seen as a link to the Ian Foster era.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said he was eager to make the most of the situation and not finish his test career on the now-infamous red card in last year's World Cup final loss to the Springboks in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"I never really thought about it as the last chapter. This one will be pretty sweet knowing how much work's gone on to get back."</p>
        
            <p>Cane will find himself in the unfamiliar spot of being somewhere down the back of the team when they run onto Eden Park to defend their 30-year unbeaten streak. Ardie Savea will captain the side, which was Cane's role for 27 tests.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely not as much mental load," he said in regard to not being captain.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, I greatly care about the team and how we're going. It's how my mind works, I've sort of been programmed that way for a few years now."</p>
        
            <p>Cane said his time in charge taught him some important lessons about how to deal with a loss, which is exactly the position the All Blacks find themselves in after the Pumas outplayed them at Sky Stadium last Saturday night.</p>

            <p>"It was tough to watch the boys go down ... ultimately we applied pressure and eased off. We weren't able to stack good moments on good moments.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll look at a loss and say 'oh there's so many things we could improve' but just nailing a couple of big blocks will make the biggest difference. Going out there with a mindset of taking the game to them."</p>
        
            <p>Cane said he was "looking forward" to facing the Pumas for what could be a monumental win at the All Blacks' fortress.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really enjoying the defensive philosophies [assistant coach] Scott Hansen is bringing ... Argentineans like to run hard so we'll be bringing our own physicality."</p>
