            <p>It hasn't even been a fortnight since the Rugby World Cup final, but we can cast our eye ahead to next season with the squad namings of the Super Rugby Pacific sides.</p>
        
            <p>More team announcements to come:</p>
        
            <p>Noon: Moana Pasifika</p>
        
            <p>1pm: Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>2pm: Blues</p>
        
            <p>3pm: Crusaders</p>
        
            <p>Youthful is a positive way of describing the Highlanders' squad this season, inexperienced is another way - but that's nothing new for the perennial battlers of Super Rugby. Clarke Dermody says goodbye to Aaron Smith and Shannon Frizell, leaving Ethan de Groot as the only test player in his squad, but there are some interesting names that have come in.</p>
        
            <p>Timoci Tavatavanawai and Jacob Ratumaituvuki-Kneepkens join from Moana Pasifika and the Blues respectively, while Welsh test player Rhys Patchell takes over from Freddie Burns as the Highlanders' import first five. Argentinean Martin Bogado returns on the wing, while Tom Sanders will provide good leadership in the loose forwards after his long stint at the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Jermaine Ainsley, Daniel Lienert-Brown, Ethan De Groot, Ayden Johnstone, Luca Inch, Saula Ma'u</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Henry Bell, Ricky Jackson, Jack Taylor</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Mitchell Dunshea, Fabian Holland, Pari Pari Parkinson, Max Hicks, Will Tucker</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards; Nikora Broughton, Billy Harmon, Tom Sanders, Sean Withy, Oliver Haig, Hayden Michaels, Hugh Renton</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: James Arscott, Folau Fakatava, Nathan Hastie</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Rhys Patchell, Cameron Millar, Ajay Faleafaga</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Sam Gilbert, Josh Timu, Jake Te Hiwi, Tanielu Tele'a, Matt Whaanga</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Mart√≠n Bogado, Jacob Ratumaituvuki-Kneepkens, Jonah Lowe, Timoci Tavatavanawai, Connor Garden-Bachop, Jona Nareki</p>
        
            <p>"We have had a few changes in our squad and our coaching group so it will be great to get everyone together and start building some cohesion through the preseason. We will just about have our whole squad together from day one, which is a nice opportunity for us," Dermody said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am also pleased to see some of the younger players that we have invested in over the last few years start to come through to Super Rugby level. I am sure their individual enthusiasm will be infectious for the squad."</p>
        
            <p>A new look for the Chiefs</p>
        
            <p>There's been a fair bit of turnover at the Chiefs. Clayton McMillan has lost Sam Cane, Brodie Retallick and Bryn Gatland to Japan, Pita Gus Sowakula and Brad Weber to France, Angus Ta'avao is moving back up the road to the Blues, while Rivez Reihana is headed down south to the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Kaleb Trask and Reuben O'Neill return to Chiefs colours, while Jimmy Tupou's addition to the loose forwards is an exciting addition. While there are eight new full time contracted players, New Zealand U20 prop Sione Ahio is the only one to have not yet played Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Sione Ahio, George Dyer, Kauvaka Kaivelata, Reuben O'Neill, Jared Proffit, Aidan Ross, Ollie Norris</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Samisoni Taukei'aho, Bradley Slater, Tyrone Thompson</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Naitoa Ah Kuoi, Josh Lord, Manaaki Selby-Rickit, Tupou Vaa'i</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Kaylum Boshier, Samipeni Finau, Luke Jacobson, Simon Parker, Jimmy Tupou, Wallace Sititi, Malachi Wrampling-Alec</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Cortez Ratima, Xavier Roe, Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Damian McKenzie, Josh Ioane, Kaleb Trask</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Anton Lienert-Brown, Rameka Poihipi, Daniel Rona, Quinn Tupaea</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Liam Coombes-Fabling, Peniasi Malimali, Etene Nanai-Seturo, Emoni Narawa, Shaun Stevenson, Gideon Wrampling</p>
        
            <p>McMillan's side has nine All Blacks, however he is excited about the addition of some fringe players to the main squad.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys have been knocking on our door for a while now and we are excited to offer them a place this year. They have been impressive throughout NPC and during their time in our environment, so rightly earn their spot within our squad," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a new look squad for us but despite the changes, there remains a lot of continuity within this group. They are familiar with our environment, know how we do things, and bring a lot to the table."</p>
