            <p>Mercurial playmaker Damian McKenzie has recommitted to New Zealand Rugby, the Chiefs and Waikato for a further four years.</p>
        
            <p>The versatile 61-test first-five and fullback quashed talk that he would take up an offshore club option, saying he was strongly committed to continuing his career in New Zealand and achieving his goals with the All Blacks and at Super Rugby level.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm incredibly excited to re-sign with NZ Rugby and continue my journey with both the Chiefs and All Blacks," the 29-year-old said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The opportunity to represent both teams is something that I'll never take for granted. I feel like I've still got a lot to give to New Zealand rugby and look forward to adding value where I can.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm extremely motivated to win a championship with the Chiefs and ultimately hope to be a part of a successful Rugby World Cup in 2027 and campaigns beyond that."</p>

            <p>In releases from both New Zealand Rugby and the Chiefs, it was unclear if McKenzie had included any sabbatical clauses in his contract, which would allow him to take up a short-term contract with overseas clubs.</p>
        
            <p>His retention added intrigue to the All Blacks first-five selection, proven performer Richie Mo'unga set to become available for test duty again when he returns from a three-year Japanese club contract in early 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill-born McKenzie made his test debut in 2016 and has gone on to score 311 points. A reliable goalkicker, the diminutive playmaker was best known for his game-breaking ability with ball in hand, able to beat defenders effortlessly with deception and acceleration.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks coach Scott Robertson said he was thrilled with McKenzie's retention.</p>
        
            <p>"Damian is such a valuable member of our group. He has an incredible skill set and the ability to change a game. He is just continuing to get better and better, which makes him a critical signing for us heading into the next Rugby World Cup and beyond."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson echoed that sentiment.</p>
        
            <p>"Damian is a rare talent who has made a big contribution to the game in New Zealand for over a decade for Waikato, the Chiefs and in a black jersey.</p>
        
            <p>"We're thrilled he's committed to another four years, and with his best rugby ahead of him it's exciting to look forward to the impact he will have on and off the field as we enter an exciting period for the international game."</p>

            <p>McKenzie was in his 11th season of Super Rugby with the Chiefs after making his debut in 2015, and was the Chiefs all-time leading points scorer with more than 1200 points.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan said McKenzie's influence was difficult to measure.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a significant outcome given the high level of interest he received from offshore. He influences games the way few people can, and he will continue to add to his legacy, which would have to rank among the elite players to have ever pulled on a Chiefs jersey."</p>
