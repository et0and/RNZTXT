            <p>"It used to be two Weet-bix and a banana with milk. But since coming to school (in the US), you can't get Weet-bix here. So now it's avocado on toast, usually with an egg."</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi athlete Maia Ramsden is talking about her pre-race meal, and the excitement in her voice is apparent down the phone during a chat with First Up.</p>
        
            <p>She's riding high, having just defended her 1500m title at the NCAA Championships last weekend in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
        
            <p>She had plans to celebrate the win, but exhaustion got the better of her.</p>
        
            <p>"My family was here, so we went out for dinner, which was super lovely. And then I got back to our hotel and I lay down, and didn't have the energy to get out of bed."</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden's parents and sister travelled all the way from Wellington to cheer her on, while her aunt joined them from Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just the best thing ever, I couldn't have asked for a better support crew."</p>
        
            <p>Last month Ramsden was just eight-one hundredths of a second outside the Paris Olympic qualifying mark. She's now got her sights set on qualifying this weekend at an event in Vancouver.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just taking it one race at a time. There's other ways to get there on points and stuff as well, so I'm just looking to execute a good race this weekend and then we'll kind of assess where that puts me."</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old recently graduated from Harvard University, after studying history and literature. It's a world away from her introduction to running back in Wellington, where she competed in the Weet-Bix triathlon at age five.</p>
        
            <p>"I think my parents just threw me and my little brother into them. It really is what started me on this path, because I moved from Wellington to Solomon Islands and then I kept doing triathlon there, and then eventually I realised I really didn't like swimming."</p>
        
            <p>Foreign countries are familiar to Ramsden who was born in New York.</p>
        
            <p>Her family have moved around due to work commitments. She started her schooling in Wellington, then hopped around the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Ethiopia, before heading to Boston for university.</p>
        
            <p>With the likes of Kimberly May, who finished runner up in the NCAA's 1500m, along with Paris-bound Geordie Beamish and Sam Tanner impressing on the track, Ramsden said the future of New Zealand running looked bright.</p>
        
            <p>"We obviously have such a rich history of of 'Milers' at home, and yeah, just being able to be in the NCAA with Kim has been so fun.</p>
        
            <p>"With all of us being over here, everyone makes an effort when we're in the same place or going to the same meets to just catch up.</p>
        
            <p>"I really appreciate that, 'cause I didn't go to secondary school at home, but I had this community of runners mostly who I've known and grown up running with over the years. To be able to have that community here is really important to me."</p>
        
            <p>And while Weet-bix or avocado on toast are the go to before a race, Ramsden said she always ate the same things after competing. Burgers.</p>
        
            <p>"I always get a burger. I'm just like, I need some iron. Something big and filling."</p>
        
            <p>She's imagining Olympic qualification, and eating burgers in Paris next month.</p>
        
            <p>"That would be the dream! And some real fries, some actual French fries instead of chips," she said with a laugh.</p>
