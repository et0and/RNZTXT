            <p>This weekend Counties Manukau and Wellington go head to head for the trophy dedicated to the most thrilling rugby player to don either province's jersey. The Jonah Tali Lomu Memorial Trophy has been contested between the late legend's two beloved provinces since 2016 with Wellington wining last year's clash 56-25.</p>
        
            <p>The metre-high "Number 11" Totara trophy is a fitting tribute to the greatest to ever play the game.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ looks back at 10 unbelievable Jonah Lomu moments for both the Lions and Steelers.</p>
        
            <p>Beat Canterbury 34-29 in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>An iconic moment in a legendary final. Arguably the greatest individual try in NPC, the irresistible force met the immovable object when Marika Vunibaka and Lomu came together on the sideline, but Lomu palmed off the Fijian flyer not once, but twice, in a brutal exchange between the behemoths before Jonah slammed the ball on the Jade Stadium turf.</p>

            <p>Beat Wellington 33-8 in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>One of his very best. Lomu left several Lions in his wake en route to this spectacular solo effort.</p>
        
            <p>Beat Waikato 22-12 in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's introduction to a legend, Lomu displayed his ungodly ability on this day in Queenstown, standing in a tackle for what seemed an eternity before backing up to score his hat-trick and earn Counties the title.</p>
        
            <p>Beat Wellington 29-3 in Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>Future All Black, Hurricanes and Lions teammate Tana Umaga got a brutal introduction to the late, great, Tongan wrecking ball, taking two fends in the mush before a desperate dive to stop the big man, only to be left clutching at air.</p>
        
            <p>Lost to Otago 41-32 in Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>Another stunning display of raw power, Lomu brutalised his way to the chalk against this classy Otago outfit, dragging Tony Brown, Josh Kronfeld, and John Leslie all over the line with him.</p>

            <p>Beat Canterbury 34-29 in Chirstchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Before winning the physical battle, Lomu also gassed his opposite Vunibaka to score the opener following a deft grubber from the underrated Paul Steinmetz to kick off the best NPC final ever played.</p>
        
            <p>Beat Waikato 48-23 in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Lomu and the Lions enjoyed a superb run at the back end of the 2000 NPC, their run to the title coming on the back of impressive victories over Waikato, Auckland and then of course Canterbury. Lomu both scored and set one up for Jerry Collins as the Lions ran riot.</p>
