            <p>Grace Steinmetz has abruptly retired from rugby, after receiving medical advice that it would be unsafe to continue playing.</p>
        
            <p>The three-test Black Fern and Chiefs Manawa player released a post on Instagram that said it was "not how I pictured my rugby career coming to an end."</p>
        
            <p>"Scans have come back showing a brain injury that means I need to hang the boots up, medically retire and never play rugby again. Grateful that my health is still intact and we found out before it was too late.</p>
        
            <p>"This game and the people within it have done SO much for me, and I am super grateful for the last seven years I have had in this sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to everyone who has been a part of my journey and supported me along the way. I will understand one day."</p>

            <p>Steinmetz's announcement has drawn many supportive comments from teammates and men's players.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old represented Wellington and Canterbury at FPC level, after being a part of the national Sevens programme. Her stint at Chiefs Manawa saw Steinmetz play in two Super Rugby Aupiki finals and she also spent time in Japan playing Sevens.</p>
        
            <p>Steinmetz is also engaged to Chiefs player Rameka Poihipi.</p>

            <p>Head injuries are a serious issue for rugby union, with a class action lawsuit currently underway from a group of UK players seeking damages from World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) for negligence and failing to protect them.</p>
        
            <p>Closer to home, former All Black Carl Hayman last year revealed the struggles with dementia and the degenerative brain condition CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) that he now lives with.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Black Fern Portia Woodman-Wickliffe was knocked out during 2022's Rugby World Cup final at Eden Park, later admitting she has no recollection of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"All I remember is pretty much when I got to come out onto the field and celebrate with the girls," she said in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Smithy [coach Wayne Smith] came to me after the game, he was like 'Do you remember much of that game?' I was like, 'Nah, not really, Smithy', and he goes, 'You were playing an absolute blinder in the first 15 minutes', and I was like, 'No, don't tell me that!' If I had been playing a crap game it would have been a bit easier to take."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Black Ferns face England on Monday morning in the next match of their WXV1 campaign.</p>
