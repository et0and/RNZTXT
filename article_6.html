        <h2>'It's a special place': Raducanu happy to be back in Aotearoa</h2>

Crowd favourite and former US Open champion Emma Raducanu is aiming to start a big season in Auckland.

            <p>Crowd favourite and former US Open champion Emma Raducanu is aiming to start a big season at the ASB Classic is Auckland. It's the third year in a row the 22-year-old has competed in New Zealand's only WTA (Women's Tennis Association) event, and Raducanu is "being realistic" about her hopes for the week.</p>
        
            <p>"My hopes and expectations, I'm not, you know, setting myself or making any excuses. I just am being realistic. But, for me, being healthy, getting a match here and a couple matches, see how far I can go. And yeah, push really and build for the Australian Open," she said at the pre-tournament press conference.</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu has had a roller coaster of a career after her breakthrough 2021 win at Flushing Meadows, dogged by injury but remaining one of the most marketable faces in the sport. This year saw glimpses of a potential return to that initial success, with her best Grand Slam finish in 2024 being a fourth round defeat to New Zealand's Lulu Sun at Wimbledon.</p>

            <p>"I think I need to, probably I give myself a bit more credit for (this season) because the second half of the year, I wasn't on court competing as much as a lot of others," she said, referring to a lower back injury that saw her fall outside of the top 300. Between April and now she's climbed back 250 places in the world rankings, despite also being forced of the court due to a foot ligament injury in October.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's like a good stepping stone after three surgeries the year before. And I think this year I'm just ready to push on and build on and I've really kind of taken measures and steps to do that with my team and how I'm operating and how I'm feeling about things. So, I'm looking forward to this year."</p>
        
            <p>That rapid climb back up the rankings is made even more remarkable given that Raducanu only played 15 tournaments last year, focusing on the grass court season that favoured her style. It's also seen her gain a seeded spot in the ASB Classic, something she hasn't enjoyed for a few years now, although it hasn't altered her preparation at all.</p>

            <p>"I actually didn't really look at the draw or the list, so I didn't know that. But yeah, I guess it's pretty cool. I haven't been seeded in, in a while. (But) it doesn't really make a difference though. I feel like everyone and the depth of the women's game right now is so strong that, literally anyone can win any tournament."</p>
        
            <p>It would be nice if she was the one winning this one, however. Raducanu's presence along with Naomi Osaka - another player with a tumultuous last few years - has provided the star power of this year's women's field after two time champion and world number three Coco Gauff decided to play in Perth this year. Having both go deep in the tournament will be exactly what the organisers and sponsors will be after, and that's looking likely thanks to favourable draws for both.</p>
        
            <p>Besides, there's the fact that Raducanu clearly enjoys being here, given that one of her best friends is a Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>"I have great feelings and great ties to New Zealand, it's a special place."</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu takes on American Robin Montgomery in her first match this evening, meanwhile top seed Madison Keys will play Lucia Bronzetti in the day session. Last night's results saw three matches go the full distance, Katie Volynets battled out a 6-4 6-7(8) 6-2 win over Erika Andreeva, Ann Li beat Sloane Stephens 5-7 6-4 6-4 and Julia Grabher beat Leyre Romero Gormaz 6-2 3-6 7(9)-6.</p>
