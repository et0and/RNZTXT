            <p>Football journeyman Joe Champness has left Auckland FC without taking the field in the current A-League season.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites midfielder has left the new club by mutual consent, chief executive officer Nick Becker said.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland FC would like to express its thanks to Joe for being part of the early foundations of the club and his contribution to date.</p>
        
            <p>"The club would like to wish Joe all the best for the future in both his football and personal endeavours."</p>
        
            <p>Champness has previously played in the A-League for Newcastle Jets and Brisbane Roar.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old arrived at Auckland FC after playing in Turkey since the start of the 2020/21 season, most recently with Adanaspor.</p>
        
            <p>Champness is also a musician, releasing music under the stage name Jowic.</p>
        
            <p>The league-leading Auckland FC lost for the first time this season on Saturday, going down 4-0 to Western United.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC play next on 28 December against Central Coast Mariners.</p>
