            <p>The job is only half done for the Pumas.</p>
        
            <p>Having shocked the All Blacks in [the https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/524772/all-blacks-come-crashing-to-earth-in-38-30-loss-to-argentina first test in Wellington 38-30], Argentina are now looking to break the greatest streak in international rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Eduardo Bello said they hold no fear of the fortress that is Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really happy, because we came here to win, but to win two games. So the first step was Wellington. Now we are looking forward. Wellington for us is done. We focus on the next week. Now we play with another team, another mindset, we are ready to go."</p>
        
            <p>The last time the Pumas beat the All Blacks in Christchurch in 2020, the return test in Hamilton saw them on the end of a 53-3 drubbing.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want this to happen again. There is a small difference to win the game or lose by 40 points against New Zealand. It's a new game. It's a new week."</p>
        
            <p>Halfback Gonzalo Bertranou reiterated this theme.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a new a new page, new challenges. So we move on. Focus on the next challenge. We know that New Zealand is going to be another beast this weekend, they are going to come back stronger. We know what's coming, we are prepared for that."</p>
        
            <p>The Pumas number nine said whether or not the public are writing them off, they know they can create history.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that it is 80 minutes, it doesn't matter what's in the past or the present, it's 80 minutes."</p>
        
            <p>Having come back from an early deficit, Bello said there are still areas they were not happy with following the clash in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>"The penalties, we gave away a lot of penalties in the first 20-30, minutes, and the other thing is, when we arrive in the 22, we need points every time."</p>
        
            <p>An area where the All Blacks will look to dominate, Argentina will likely have to contend with a few more scrums in Auckland, having gone an entire half without one in the first test.</p>
        
            <p>"Never in my life have I played for a 50 minutes and no scrums. We know they like the scrum. They will come for us, but we are ready to come for them."</p>

            <p>Of course, there is also the Eden Park factor.</p>
        
            <p>In an astonishing unbeaten streak dating back to 1994, the ground has been a graveyard for opposition for 49 straight tests.</p>
        
            <p>Bertranou said the side are not shying away from the facts.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that Eden Park is one of the most important stadiums in the world. In the Northern Hemisphere, you've got Twickenham, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's Eden Park."</p>
        
            <p>Argentina has played just once at Eden Park, a losing effort in the 2011 Rugby World Cup quarterfinal.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember this game. I was young, I watched the game with my friends at about 4am, but we lost that. So we hope to change history," said Bello.</p>
        
            <p>But despite the history, Bertranou said the Pumas are undaunted.</p>
        
            <p>"No fear, but we respect the All Blacks, we know the history, we know that it's probably the best team in the world, always, that's why they have gone 30 years without losing at Eden Park."</p>
        
            <p>Bello said whether playing in Auckland or Buenos Aires,</p>
        
            <p>"For us, it doesn't change. We are on a pitch the same size."</p>
