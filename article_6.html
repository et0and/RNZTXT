            <p>A faster men's doubles format, with greater focus on matches between singles players and established doubles teams, is being trialled at the Madrid Open.</p>
        
            <p>Teams are allowed just 15 - rather than the usual 25 - seconds between points after rallies up to three shots, and only 60 seconds to sit down at the change of ends. Five rounds will be played in five days.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand player Michael Venus and his British partner Jamie Murray beat Denis Shapovalov and Alexander Bublik in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>Murray likes the shortened changeovers and the tournament being spread over such a short period, but is not a fan of the reduced time between some points, the BBC reported.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like it's very rushed," the seven-time Grand Slam champion said after the match.</p>
        
            <p>"Fifteen seconds for doubles is very short. In singles you are playing a lot on instinct, but in doubles there's a lot more strategy to start the points, and to lose that communication with your partner I don't think is a good thing for the sport."</p>
        
            <p>Murray would also like to see more social media promotion of doubles, to attract new fans to the game.</p>
        
            <p>"The social media side of things is just an absolute zero," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wrote to ATP Media last year after Miami and I basically counted all the posts that they had done across Indian Wells and Miami, and it was like 1% of their total posts [were about doubles]."</p>
        
            <p>"For me, it's a shootout, which is kind of exciting. Once we get going - bang, this is on," said Matt Ebden, the current doubles world number one and president of the ATP Player Council.</p>
        
            <p>"People like seeing the volleys, the return winners, the angles and all the reactions, but there is a bit too much dead time.</p>
        
            <p>"We just looked at how we can keep the game flowing to make it a better product for the fans ultimately."</p>
        
            <p>Those supporters will be able to move freely around the stadium during points.</p>
        
            <p>The trial will continue at future tournaments, although not necessarily always in the second week in the space of just five days.</p>
        
            <p>Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas were among seven top-20 singles players to enter the event.</p>
