            <p>Paris Olympics organisers said they would boost security at the Games and ensure security staff are available and well trained after a pitch invasion at a soccer match between Argentina and Morocco on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers said the incident during the opening match of the football tournament - in which security staff chased fans around the pitch at Saint-Etienne Stadium - had not posed a major security risk and that lessons would be learned.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not minimise the events of yesterday," Olympics security director Bruno Le Ray told reporters, adding that additional staff and crowd barriers would be brought in for upcoming matches at Saint-Etienne, where access to the pitch is easier than at other stadiums.</p>
        
            <p>Le Ray said that on average 17,000 agents would secure some 40 competition sites and some 100 non-competitive sites such as the Olympic Village, training facilities and hotels.</p>
        
            <p>On the busiest days, this would increase to 22,000 staff. Staffing levels depend on the sports, with more than 1000 agents deployed for major team sports events, but a fraction of that for individual sports like athletics.</p>
        
            <p>Le Ray said that while police will take care of security outside the Olympic venues, security inside will be handled by organisers, who have contracts with over 110 security firms.</p>
        
            <p>He said contracting sufficient security staff had been a challenge at recent Olympic Games, especially since the Covid pandemic, when many security agents looked for jobs elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>In order to mitigate the no-show risk - sometimes 10 to 30 percent of staff do not show up for work - organisers have asked companies to identify up to 15 percent more agents.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged organisers had struggled to find sufficient female staff to screen female spectators, but said that technology would help.</p>
        
            <p>"Using metal detectors, male security staff can control female spectators without the need for touch," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Equipment such as barriers, cameras and detectors account for just under half of the Paris Olympics' 320 million euro (NZ$590 million) security budget, with the rest mainly for staff.</p>
