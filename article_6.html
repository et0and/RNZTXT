            <p>Ever since Auckland FC's arrival into the A-League was confirmed, the countdown has been on for this moment. The new side, currently two wins from two in their debut season, travels to the capital this weekend for what should be a fiery reception from last year's preliminary finalists. The game will be the first ever professional derby match in New Zealand football history, but why is that such a big deal?</p>

            <p>Teams from the same geographical area make up derbies, as they have generally fiercely divided fan bases. Auckland and Wellington obviously don't share a border, but they fall into the category by being the only two NZ sides in the A-League. It's hoped this rivalry will become the highlight of both teams' seasons, one in which they go up an extra gear to claim local bragging rights. The Phoenix took the step of flying a plane over Auckland's last home game, carrying a banner that read 'NZ is Yellow - see you next week'.</p>
        
            <p>Yes, both Sydney and Melbourne have big derby matches that are highly anticipated each season. Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers regularly draws crowds of 25,000 plus, while the Melbourne City and Melbourne Victory derby in pulls in 20,000 strong crowds. While this first edition is being played in Wellington, the second match on 7 December at Go Media Mt Smart Stadium has already sold out.</p>

            <p>Football unfortunately has a reputation for off-field aggression and violence among fans, with derby matches around the world being notorious hot spots for this kind of behaviour. Already this week there have been reports that the Phoenix have increased security for the game and while there has been nothing more than a few blowhards talking themselves up on social media, the fact still remains that the 500 Auckland FC fans travelling for the game will be the largest away section by far Sky Stadium has ever hosted.</p>
        
            <p>However, whatever happens will be light years away from the most famous football derbies in the world. Scotland's Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers FC is rooted in social division and sectarianism and requires hundreds of police and security to manage. Argentina's Supercl√°sico between River Plate and Boca Juniors goes one step further and simply prohibits away fans from even attending each other's matches, under pain of instant arrest.</p>

            <p>Auckland FC's hot start to the season is exactly what coach Steve Corica was looking for, especially since their last game was a thrilling 1-0 win over his old side Sydney FC. The game went to the 97th minute, which showed the new boys have the heart to hang in there right till the end. Meanwhile, the Phoenix have had a win and a draw, but will be banking on the big game experience they gained in last season's breakout campaign.</p>
        
            <p>One squad addition Auckland FC made over the off season really fired up their rivals. Alex Paulsen, who had an outstanding season in goal for the Phoenix earlier this year, ended up in Auckland after a bit of somewhat shady dealings by the new club and its owner's connections.</p>
        
            <p>"People are excited but players have to be smart not crazy. Obviously, we will give everything on the pitch but we won't go crazy, we don't need a red card or something. The season's long so we have to be smart." - Auckland FC captain Hiroki Sakai.</p>
        
            <p>"Our club, it is the people's club. Wellington's a very small demographic and for a long time it was basically the torch-bearer for all of football in New Zealand. We have a lot of fans across New Zealand, and a lot in Auckland as well." - Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano.</p>

            <p>Many great rivalries are built on teams representing different socio-economic classes and while it's a stretch to say Auckland FC are for the rich folk and the Phoenix are the working class team, it at least has a bit of truth at the top end. Auckland FC are owned by US billionaire Bill Foley, whose current support for Donald Trump's presidency has not gone unnoticed. As per Italiano's comments, it's meant the Phoenix can easily claim the moral high ground in what will hopefully be a longstanding and exciting NZ football derby.</p>
