        <h2>Olympics drone inquiry shows 'unacceptable' pattern</h2>
        <p>
An independent review of drone use by a staff member of Canada's women's football team involving the Football Ferns at this year's Olympics shows a "pattern of unacceptable culture".

            <p>An independent review of drone use by a staff member of Canada's women's football team involving the Football Ferns at this year's Paris Olympics showed a "pattern of unacceptable culture" and lack of oversight, Canada Soccer says.</p>
        
            <p>Canada's women's team were engulfed in a spying scandal at the Games after New Zealand's team said their training session was disrupted by a drone flown by a Canada staff member.</p>
        
            <p>Canada were docked six points in the Olympic tournament while head coach Bev Priestman, who steered them to gold at the Tokyo Games three years before, was banned for a year by world soccer's governing body FIFA.</p>
        
            <p>Canada reached the quarter-finals where they lost to Germany.</p>
        
            <p>"Our initial review of the conclusions of the independent investigator reveals that the drone incident in Paris was a symptom of a past pattern of an unacceptable culture and insufficient oversight within the national teams," Canada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Blue said Canada Soccer would reveal "key conclusions" from the report within a week and would outline the next steps the organisation will take to address the findings.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Augruso, board chairperson for Canada Soccer, said they were committed to "renewing" the organisation following the embarrassing incident.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that more needs to be done and change takes time," he said.</p>
