            <p>The All Whites were outclassed 2-0 by the former European Champions Greece after the hosts blitzed the opening half in Athens.</p>
        
            <p>Greek youngster Giannis Konstantealis capitalised on some shaky New Zealand defence in the 10th minute to open the scoring.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand goalkeeper Michael Woud was out of position as the ball crept inside the far post.</p>
        
            <p>A second goal to the hosts in the 29th minute off the corner was one of handful of scoring opportunities for the former European Champions in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand keeper saved Dimitrios Kourbelis' header, only for Giorgos Giakoumakis to get the loose ball into the net.</p>
        
            <p>All Whites skipper Chris Wood made it through the first half but was taken off at halftime as he manages a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>Greece held on to their 2-0 half-time advantage as New Zealand kept the side goalless in a second-half which lacked intensity.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites play Ireland in Dublin on Wednesday in their final match of the season.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will be looking for an improved outing in their last match with next year looming as an important one with the start of FIFA World Cup 2024 qualifying.</p>
