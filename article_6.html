            <p>New Zealand's Lulu Sun will play a lower-ranked first-round women's singles opponent at the US Open before a possible showdown with two-time grand slam champion Aryna Sabalenka.</p>
        
            <p>World No 57 Sun will face 69th-ranked Italian Lucia Bronzetti first up at the year's final grand slam tournament starting in New York on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Victory for the 23-year-old will send Sun into a likely collision course with Aryna Sabalenka, the tournament second seed who was beaten by Coco Gauff in last year's final, before going on to bag a second successive Australian Open crown in January.</p>

            <p>Sun's last grand slam appearance - and her first since switching allegiance from Switzerland - was her heady quarter-final run at Wimbledon in June, where she became the first New Zealand woman to reach the last eight at the grass court tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The Te Anau-born Sun showed she is in good form heading into her US Open debut, beating 89th-ranked Russian Erika Andreeva 6-4 6-3 in the quarter-finals of the Monterrey Open in Mexico on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Her semi-final opponent will be either third seeded Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova or seventh seed Yuan Yue of China.</p>
        
            <p>The in-form Sabalenka, looking to go one further after finishing runner-up in New York last year, returns well-rested after a mid-year break to focus on her health.</p>

            <p>She will be confident about her chances after winning the tune-up event in Cincinnati.</p>
        
            <p>Sabalenka's fortnight may include a third-round date with Alexandrova (29) followed by a fourth-round clash with Madison Keys (14), Zheng Qinwen (7) in the quarters, defending champion Gauff (3) in the semis and Iga Swiatek in the final - if results all go to seeding.</p>
        
            <p>Gauff, who last year became the first American to win a US Open singles title since 2017, will begin her title defence against Frenchwoman Varvara Gracheva.</p>

            <p>Top seed Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam winner who reached the fourth round last year, will start against a qualifier and faces a potential quarter-final clash against Canadian Open champion and Cincinnati runner-up Jessica Pegula.</p>
        
            <p>Among the more high-profile first-round women's matchups, four-times Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka, in her first New York appearance since becoming a mother, will face Latvian 10th seed and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko.</p>
        
            <p>Top seed Jannik Sinner, whose doping case has dominated the lead-up to the US Open, faces a tough road to the New York men's final.</p>

            <p>Sinner won in Cincinnati this week to claim his fifth title of a breakout season before the revelation that he [avoided a ban over two positive tests in March as it was ruled the Italian bore no fault or negligence for the violations.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Open champion is projected to face 14th seed Tommy Paul in the fourth round, 2021 winner Daniil Medvedev (5) in the quarter-finals, Carlos Alcaraz (3) in the semis and defending champion Novak Djokovic (2) in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic, who has not competed since winning the gold medal at the Paris Olympics, will begin against a qualifier and is expected to meet Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals and fourth seed Alexander Zverev in the semis.</p>

            <p>Reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz, who lost the opening match of his only US Open tune-up event, will also start against a qualifier and could face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in the quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Among the first-round matches to watch on the men's side is big-hitting Ben Shelton, who electrified the home crowds last year with a spirited run to the semis, against 2020 champion Dominic Thiem, who is retiring at the end of the year.</p>
