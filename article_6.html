            <p>The Warriors came into this game on an absolute high after stringing three wins in a row over some quality opponents, whilst the Storm were under strength, missing multiple key players.</p>
        
            <p>But the Warriors blew a 14-point lead to go down to the Storm 24-38.</p>
        
            <p>After scoring three quickfire tries to start the game, the Warriors lost control in slippery conditions as the Storm surged back to lodge a 16th straight win over the New Zealand side.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors closed within two points in the second half but their hopes faded when wingers Marcel Montoya and Dallin Watene-Zelezniak were both sent to the sin bin, reducing them to 11 players.</p>
