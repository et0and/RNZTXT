            <p>Belal Muhammad has stolen the welterweight title from Leon Edwards, winning by unanimous decision in their main event bout at UFC 304 in Manchester, England.</p>
        
            <p>Muhammad (23-3-0) and Edwards (22-4-0) had met back in 2021, but that fight ended in a no contest because Edwards accidentally poked Muhammad in the eye.</p>
        
            <p>But on Saturday (UK time), the two went the distance, with Muhammad taking the cards 48-47, 48-47, 49-46 to snag the welterweight belt.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Aspinall (15-3-0) and Curtis Blaydes (18-5-0) were also in a championship fight, and Aspinall was able to defend his heavyweight title by knocking out Blaydes in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>Other winners Saturday included lightweight Paddy Pimblett (22-3-0), middleweight Gregory Rodrigues (16-5-0) and featherweight Arnold Allen (20-3-0).</p>
