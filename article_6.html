            <p>Big-hitting Black Caps batters lay foundation for a five wicket victory over Pakistan in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Rain delayed the start of the second T20 game of the series with the match reduced to 15 overs a side.</p>
        
            <p>Sent in to bat, Pakistan set the hosts 136 to win off the back of captain Salman Agha's 46 off 28 balls.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders spread the wickets amongst the bowlers with Jacob Duffy, Ben Sears, Jimmy Neesham and Ish Sodhi all taking two each.</p>
        
            <p>In reply, the Black Caps had a slow start before openers Tim Seifert and Finn Allen got their eye in and started finding the boundary with ease.</p>
        
            <p>Seifert scored a quickfire 45 off 22 balls, including five sixes and three fours, and Allen also had five sixes and a four in his 38 off 16 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell (14 off 14) and wicketkeeper-batter Mitchell Hay (21 off 16) helped get New Zealand close to victory before stand in captain Michael Bracewell hit the winning runs.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps reached the required total with 11 balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand now lead the series 2-0 after they won the opening game by nine wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The third game of the five match series is in Auckland on Friday night in another double header with the White Ferns.</p>
