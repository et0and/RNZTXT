            <p>Ryan Fox has a share of the lead at the Canadian Open after a strong finish to the second round.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander nailed a 14-foot (4.3m) birdie on his final hole to rejoin Robert MacIntyre of Scotland as joint leader.</p>
        
            <p>They are 10-under heading into the final two rounds, with Fox shooting a 6-under 64 and MacIntyre 66.</p>
        
            <p>Fox started on the back nine and birdied four holes going out. Consecutive birdies at the fourth and fifth got him to 10 under, and after a bogey at the next hole, He rolled in a 14-foot birdie, his seventh of the round, on the par-4 ninth to match MacIntyre again.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my first time playing in Canada in about 12 years," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've enjoyed my time so far here. Golf course kind of suits my eye. Similar grass to what we play at home. Similar kind of old style, tree-lined golf course, which is what I grew up on. Hopefully I can keep it rolling over the weekend like that."</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time either Fox or MacIntyre has the lead after 36 holes on the PGA Tour.</p>
        
            <p>They are two shots ahead of Joel Dahmen, while Canadian Mackenzie Hughes matched Fox's 64 for the round of the day and moved into a tie at 7 under with Andrew Novak (67) and first-round leader David Skinns of England (71).</p>
        
            <p>Rory McIlroy, the highest-ranked player in the field and a two-time Canadian Open champion, struggled to a 2-over 72, and the Northern Irishman dropped to 2 under for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, at the US Women's Open, Lydia Ko missed the cut after shooting a second-round 73 to go with her first round 80. But fellow New Zealander Amelia Garvey made it through to the weekend rounds with a 76 to go with her first round 71.</p>
