            <p>Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz suffered defeat on his ATP Finals debut as Alexander Zverev fought back to win in Turin, Italy.</p>
        
            <p>World No.2 Alcaraz lost 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4 to Germany's Zverev, who won the event in 2018 and 2021.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time the 20-year-old Spaniard has lost three matches in a row since March 2021, when he was ranked outside the world's top 100.</p>
        
            <p>Alcaraz had won his past two meetings with Zverev this year but struggled for consistency on the indoor hard court.</p>
        
            <p>He trailed 3-1 in the opener before breaking back and staved off four break points in his next service game to lead Zverev for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev himself saved two set points to force a tie-break, but Alcaraz found some semblance of rhythm to clinch the opener.</p>
        
            <p>However, seventh seed Zverev responded instantly, breaking Alcaraz at the first opportunity as he forced a deciding set.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev played the big points better throughout, saving five of six break points and hitting 16 aces before sealing victory with a service winner.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to beat the best players in the world, and he's definitely one of them," Zverev said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's special to win on this court again."</p>
        
            <p>Russia's Daniil Medvedev was to play compatriot Andrey Rublev later in the Red Group.</p>
        
            <p>The ATP Finals features eight of the year's best men's players split into two groups of four, with the top two qualifying for the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Novak Djokovic is the defending champion and secured the year-end number one status with victory over Holger Rune on Monday.</p>
