            <p>New Zealand golfer Michael Hendry charged through the field on the third day of the Australian PGA in Brisbane on Saturday, in his best round since undergoing treatment for Leukaemia.</p>
        
            <p>Henry, who was diagnosed in April, surged up the leaderboard to a share of 14th place with a birdie-laden round over seven-under 64 at Royal Queensland to be the leading New Zealand on seven-under, one stroke ahead of Josh Geary.</p>
        
            <p>Despite equalling the course record, his chances of winning the tournament on Sunday are virtually non-existent, with Australian Min Woo Lee having pulled three strokes clear of the field on 17-under after shooting 66.</p>
        
            <p>Japan's Rikuya Hoshino (64) is second, with Australian Curtis Luck (66) a shot further back in third.</p>
        
            <p>Hendry's treatment forced him to miss the British Open at Royal Liverpool in July.</p>
        
            <p>He returned to the PGA Tour of Australasia at this month's Queensland PGA and contested another event in Australia but pulled out of week's Victorian PGA, having to return to New Zealand for further treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a little bit nervous whether it was going to hurt but â€¦ the good thing is now they've managed to get the medication right when they've given me a bone marrow biopsy," Hendry told reporters after his round.</p>
        
            <p>"It's painful even though I'm medicated, but the day after there's no pain, so that's a real bonus because the first few really hurt for a few days."</p>
        
            <p>Hendry has bone marrow treatment every 12 weeks as well as regular blood tests.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment it seems to be doing what it's told but who knows what the future holds," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll just try to make hay while the sun shines."</p>
