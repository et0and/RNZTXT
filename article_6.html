        <h2>Can New Zealand win a game at the World Cup?</h2>
        <p>
Former All White Ben Sigmund believes the current side could be the first to score a win.

            <p>Former All Whites defender Ben Sigmund believes the current side can win a game at next year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand qualified for the 2026 tournament in North America with a 3-0 win over New Caledonia in Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>That guaranteed them a place in the finals as the winner of the Oceania region and they become just the third New Zealand side to feature in the finals following the 1982 team in Spain and the 2010 side in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Sigmund was a member of that side in 2010 that drew all of their group games. The '82 team had lost all three of their group games.</p>
        
            <p>However, Sigmund believed this side could win a game in the finals.</p>
        
            <p>"A hundred percent, those players are all up to a world-class standard," Sigmund told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine if they got a win and a draw that would be something to be really proud of."</p>
        
            <p>The next World Cup increases to 48 nations with 12 groups of four teams.</p>

            <p>The top two teams from each group and the eight best third-placed teams progress to the round of 32.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites game against New Caledonia was not all one-way traffic, with New Caledonia putting a lot of pressure on the New Zealand defence.</p>
        
            <p>The first goal was not scored until the 61st minute and that provided some concerns for many New Zealand fans, including Sigmund.</p>
        
            <p>"They were a bit nervous looking and I think they thought it was just going to happen for them."</p>

            <p>Sigmund thought the substitution of an injured Chris Wood for Kosta Barbarouses was probably a good thing.</p>
        
            <p>"Kosta was going to nip around and be a pest up front.</p>
        
            <p>"He scored and set one up and deserves some accolades because he changed the game for New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Sigmund is impressed by the squad that has been assembled with most playing in top leagues around the world and a number from the two professional A-League teams in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a young team which is great to see and what an exciting opportunity for these players to go to a World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"Football in New Zealand is on the up and it's just going to get bigger and better and it is exciting for all the young kids that want to aspire to be professional footballers in this country."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand became the second team to qualify for the World Cup after Japan.</p>
        
            <p>As hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States are all included.</p>
        
            <p>New Caledonia now go to a six team Intercontinental play-off where two place are available to qualify for the World Cup.</p>
