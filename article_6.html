            <p>It has been a resurrection of biblical proportions as Joseph Parker has gone from being dismissed as a top 10 contender, to fighting for the crown.</p>
        
            <p>He will soon take stage to fight for the biggest prize in boxing against Britain's Daniel Dubois for the undisputed heavyweight championship.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Sport will be liveblogging the event at approximately 10am, Sunday, 23 February.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the blockbuster bout, RNZ looks at the 10 finishes which demonstrated the power of the Samoan-Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>July 5, 2012</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity Convention Centre, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 2</p>
        
            <p>The pro debut of a baby-faced Parker and it was an emphatic and destructive introduction. Proving far too slick and powerful for his opponent, Garmonsway went crashing into the corner after eating several shots and the referee ended things with just over a minute remaining in round two.</p>
        
            <p>December 15, 2012</p>
        
            <p>Trusts Arena, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 3</p>
        
            <p>It was the hungry young gun against the veteran and in just his third pro bout, Parker enforced a changing of the guard.</p>
        
            <p>With just under a minute remaining in the second, Parker put Tutaki on the ropes with an explosion of a dozen unanswered punches, three consecutive to the liver sending Tataki to a knee.</p>
        
            <p>Surviving to the bell, Tutaki bravely swung for a finish, but he was out on his feet, eating another dozen vicious shots, a left uppercut finding the mark to finally put the warrior away.</p>
        
            <p>Known as the 'Express Train,' Tutaki died in 2024 due to a heart attack.</p>
        
            <p>June 13, 2013</p>
        
            <p>Trusts Stadium, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Win by KO in Round 2</p>
        
            <p>Parker's rapid rise continued as he met the man who had fought legends such as Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield.</p>
        
            <p>However, the South African was no match for Parker's power.</p>
        
            <p>After a subdued start, Parker found his range and Botha's chin in the second. Having peppered the body, Botha tried to taunt young Parker, before taking a vicious combination of rights and lefts with the finish coming with 30 seconds until the bell.</p>
        
            <p>October 10, 2013</p>
        
            <p>Trusts Stadium, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 2</p>
        
            <p>Another early statement from Parker, firing off lightening jabs as Tatapu swung wildly. Parker then threw the training script out of the ring and engaged in a brutal brawl.</p>
        
            <p>Suffering a cut with just 30 seconds remaining in the first, Parker was triggered into a frenzy and unleashed an absolute barrage on Tatapu.</p>
        
            <p>Lucky to survive to the second, Tatapu would not see a third, another thunderous uppercut knocking the fellow Samoan out cold and take the NZNBF heavyweight title.</p>
        
            <p>December 6, 2014</p>
        
            <p>Claudelands Arena, Hamilton</p>
        
            <p>Win by KO in Round 4</p>
        
            <p>A ferocious finish for the rapidly rising star. Parker peppered the body across three rounds in cerebral style, awaiting his opening which came early in the fourth.</p>
        
            <p>A crisp left jab followed by an absolutely monstrous right hand felled the Brazilian giant, sending a chill down the spine of the heavyweight division.</p>

            <p>August 1, 2015</p>
        
            <p>Stadium Southland, Invercargill</p>
        
            <p>Win by KO in Round 1</p>
        
            <p>It took just thirty seconds. Tupou came out swinging but found nothing, Parker weathering the storm and threw a grazing right hook which clipped the top of Tupou's head and sent him face first into the canvas.</p>
        
            <p>July 21, 2016</p>
        
            <p>Horncastle Arena, Christchurch</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 4</p>
        
            <p>A clash of two Pacific powerhouses, Parker barely broke a sweat as he kept his unbeaten record intact, with a twentieth career win.</p>
        
            <p>A picture-perfect right uppercut put Haumono on the floor and he couldn't clear the cobwebs in time, putting Parker firmly in title contention.</p>
        
            <p>June 29, 2019</p>
        
            <p>Dunkin' Donuts Center, Rhode Island</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 10</p>
        
            <p>Looking to bounce back from consecutive losses, it was a Samoan showdown in Rhode Island.</p>
        
            <p>Parker showed his class and evolution, patiently picking apart Leapai for 10 rounds, a right uppercut which rocked Leapai mercifully ending the beatdown.</p>
        
            <p>February 29, 2020</p>
        
            <p>Ford Center, Texas</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 5</p>
        
            <p>Thoroughly dominant across the opening three rounds, it was with 20 seconds left in the third that a brutal right hand had Winters grabbing at the ropes before hitting the canvas.</p>
        
            <p>Recovering to receive more damage, a thudding right cross signalled the beginning of the end for Winters. A stumbling Winters walked forward into a savage left hook which almost sent him flying out of the ring.</p>
        
            <p>May 24, 2023</p>
        
            <p>Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne</p>
        
            <p>Win by TKO in Round 1</p>
        
            <p>Continuing the momentum from his return win over Jack Massey, Parker made easy work of his Samoan opponent, in a savage 90 second lesson.</p>
        
            <p>It was again the deadly right hook which shut out the lights early in the first.</p>
