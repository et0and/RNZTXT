            <p>Two successive losses to Bangladesh has the Black Caps on notice heading into tonight's second T20 international at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the first two ODI's Bangladesh bounced back to win the third one-dayer last week by nine wickets after bowling New Zealand out for just 98.</p>
        
            <p>They again dominated the opening T20 international in Napier on Wednesday with a five wicket victory.</p>
        
            <p>In both of those games the New Zealand top order generally failed and didn't give their bowlers a big enough target to defend.</p>
        
            <p>The toss has obviously played a part during the tour, but the Black Caps do have the home advantage and need to make more of that.</p>
        
            <p>All-rounder Jimmy Neesham admits forming partnerships is the key to turning things around.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't dwell too much on a loss, the way you lose is probably more important than the loss, Neesham said.</p>
        
            <p>"We probably need to respect the conditions a little more, we've seen the ball moving around quite significantly especially in the top six overs and the top ten in the ODI's which is something we're not use to seeing in white ball cricket in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Bangladesh have unearthed a couple of pretty good quality seamers recently and they'll be happy with their seam stocks at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>Neesham, who top scored with 48 in the opening T20 admits they have their backs against the wall.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got nowhere to go now, we've got to win two in a row to win the series.</p>
        
            <p>"Bay Oval is always a really good batting track, high par scores and brings the spinners into the game slightly more.</p>
        
            <p>"But probably another ground that suits Bangladesh a little bit as well with their spinners so we certainly have our hands full looking at the series, but confident we can bounce back.</p>
        
            <p>The game at Bay Oval starts at 7:10pm.</p>
