            <p>Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad is set to make his first NRL appearance of the season for the Warriors this weekend in the hotly contested fullback position.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors coach Andrew Webster has moved Roger Tuivasa-Sheck back to the centres after a brilliant performance from the back against the Knights.</p>
        
            <p>Webster said he wanted to put his best possible 17 on the park, which meant making room for both players.</p>
        
            <p>"Charnze is so comfortable in his own skin, Roger is comfortable in his own skin and that that's our whole identity. We want everyone to be happy and know their role and know that we have complete faith in them."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said neither player had anything to prove.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they're just trying to be themselves, Charnze isn't going to play like Roger. He's going to do different things and last week when Roger played fullback he didn't play like Charnze."</p>
        
            <p>Webster was quick to point out the heights Nicoll-Klokstad reached in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"He was almost a Golden Boot winner last year. if he brings that form, we'll be happy and if Roger keeps bringing what he has been bringing we'll be happy with that too so I think it's going to be pretty bloody good side If we get that right."</p>
        
            <p>Having not played since the Pacific Championships final in November, Webster said Nicoll-Klokstad was champing at the bit to get back.</p>
        
            <p>"What he brings to the group is great, he is one of our leaders, he is our energy guy, when he brings that, everyone has a smile on their face."</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Tohu Harris said they were feeling a bit spoilt by their squad depth, and understood the debate surrounding fullback was due to having multiple quality options.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of it is because of how good Roger is and the things he has done in that position, I'm just so excited to have them both on the field at the same time."</p>
        
            <p>Harris said the pair drove each other's competitiveness.</p>
        
            <p>"Roger will outwork anyone and Charnze is literally always right along side him."</p>
