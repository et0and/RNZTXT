        <h2>Cricket: Top run scorer keeps his eye on the ball</h2>
        <p>
The country's top run scorer in first-class cricket this season says he is beginning to hone in on "the formula he wants" following a dominant start to the summer with the bat.

            <p>The country's top run scorer in first-class cricket this season says he is beginning to home in on "the formula he wants" following a dominant start to the summer with the bat.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury opener Rhys Mariu is leading the charge on the domestic circuit, amassing 590 runs at an average of 147.5 during the first half of the Plunket Shield prior to Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Across his last five innings, he has peeled off a double ton, a century and two 50s, compelling numbers that have prompted numerous calls for the 23-year-old to be considered for an international call-up.</p>
        
            <p>With only 11 first class matches behind him since his early 2023 debut, the north Cantabrian is averaging at a tick over 71, with a total four centuries and six 50s.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this relative inexperience, Mariu stepped in as Canterbury captain for a couple of recent Plunket Shield hit-outs, both matches that saw him go big.</p>
        
            <p>Mariu told RNZ the "surprise" promotion to leadership put the onus on him to make a major contribution.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm starting to find a formula as to how I want my game to look like," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt more responsibility to go out and put a big score on, which has helped, even when I'm not captain.</p>
        
            <p>"If I can have that same mindset then it'll bode well for future innings."</p>
        
            <p>In his first stint leading the side in the absence of regular captain Cole McConchie, Mariu hit 240 as Canterbury completed a comprehensive 10-wicket drubbing of the Central Stags in Nelson.</p>

            <p>His eight-hour-occupation at the crease, included a 258-run third-wicket stand with fellow centurion Matt Boyle.</p>
        
            <p>"With that partnership with Boyley, we were bouncing off each other, keeping each other accountable, which makes the time go easier, as opposed to doing it by yourself.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not always easy, especially on a hot day."</p>
        
            <p>Mariu backed this effort up with a knock of 185 just over a week later in Auckland, again captaining the side against the Aces.</p>
        
            <p>In his five visits to the crease in the competition, Mariu is yet to be dismissed for less than 70.</p>
        
            <p>Purple patch maybe, the modestly-spoken player is refusing to get ahead of himself, alluding to the fickle nature of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just trying to ride the wave.</p>
        
            <p>"Cricket's a funny game where you can go through bad patches and good patches.</p>
        
            <p>"Just fortunate enough to be going through a good patch at the moment but I know that bad patch will come so just trying to stay pretty level."</p>
        
            <p>Originally from north Canterbury's Woodend area, Mariu's ascent has been a gradual one, following in the family footsteps from an early age.</p>
        
            <p>He played his junior cricket throughout the Waimakariri district, before continuing on the cricketing passage during his time at Christchurch's St Andrew's College.</p>
        
            <p>Mariu captained St Andrew's to a maiden Gillette Cup title in 2019, capping a notable year in which he was picked for the New Zealand under-19 and New Zealand Maori Schoolboys teams.</p>
        
            <p>Like his father Marcus and older brother Josh, Mariu has represented Canterbury Country at Hawke Cup level.</p>
        
            <p>The incremental climb up the levels he credited as being "very important" in his overall development as a player.</p>
        
            <p>Where the road leads to next remains to be seen.</p>
        
            <p>Following an impressive start to the season, Mariu's name has been continuously highlighted by fans and pundits.</p>
        
            <p>This ramped up during the Black Caps' recent home series defeat to England, as selection debate intensified around the makeup of the home side's batting lineup, including its opening pair.</p>
        
            <p>Some believe Mariu has the talent, durability and figures befitting of the next New Zealand opener.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always nice to be in the conversation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking at the guys in the current team, they're guys I still perceive as impressive batsmen.</p>
        
            <p>"[Test cricket] is obviously a goal, but it'll happen when it happens."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps don't play any more tests until July when the side is scheduled to tour Zimbabwe.</p>
        
            <p>Whether he is ready for the step up to the top level, he said he'll find out if the time comes.</p>
        
            <p>For now, he is happy merely making contributions for Canterbury, however that may be.</p>
        
            <p>"If I can contribute to wins then that's what I want to do.</p>
        
            <p>"If that means I'm scoring lots of runs then that's cool,</p>
        
            <p>"If it's fielding well, or even having a bowl here and there, as long as I can contribute, then that's the main goal."</p>
