            <p>Wellington Phoenix have snared the signature of Portuguese attacking midfielder Franciso "Chico" Geraldes in a bid to address their dearth of goals in the men's A-League.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old agreed to a loan deal until the end of the season, with the Phoenix hopeful he could add some flair to a campaign that had them 10th, sitting six points outside the top six, with just 16 goals from 15 matches.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano said he had been searching for a playmaker for the past month and felt fortunate to secure Geraldes, who had played 150 matches in the top-tier Liga Portugal.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of quality he's far above and beyond what sort of player I thought we would get in this window," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"Chico is exactly what we need. He's a creative playmaker. He can play as an eight or a 10, but he's been most effective in that higher position.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been training with his last loan club in Spain (Eldense) so he's still relatively fit and I'm hoping that he can hit the ground running after a week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to take him time to find his feet, especially as the A-League is a little bit quicker transitionally, but once he comes good I think he'll be a really, really good player for us."</p>
        
            <p>Geraldes came through the Sporting Lisbon youth system and was a Portuguese youth international before stints at Liga Portugal, Sporting CP and Rio Ave FC.</p>
        
            <p>He had played at clubs in the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Spain over the past 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>"I think this is the perfect place for me to come. I'm looking forward to playing and helping the Phoenix," Geraldes said.</p>
        
            <p>"The team is the most important thing. I want to help the Phoenix secure more points and get qualification to the finals.</p>
        
            <p>"And personally I need to get my joy back in football. I think Wellington is a very warm place to be because people are so gentle and so kind, and they're already making me feel at home."</p>
        
            <p>Geraldes won't play in Wellington's next match away to Melbourne Victory on Friday, with the club targeting his debut in next week's derby against Auckland FC.</p>
