            <p>The 2024-25 A-League Men season gets underway on Friday night with a repeat of last year's Grand Final between reigning champions Central Coast Mariners and Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>That fixture raises the curtain on a momentous A-League campaign for New Zealand. For the first time ever there will be two sides representing Aotearoa with the upstart Auckland FC joining the Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland have built a team from scratch while the Phoenix have embarked on yet another massive rebuild, following the loss of several key players for the second off-season in succession.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC</p>
        
            <p>Head coach: Steve Corica</p>
        
            <p>Key players: Hiroki Sakai, Jake Brimmer, Dan Hall</p>
        
            <p>Key signing: Alex Paulsen</p>
        
            <p>One to watch: Jesse Randall</p>
        
            <p>Prediction: 8th</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix</p>
        
            <p>Head coach: Giancarlo Italiano</p>
        
            <p>Key players: Kosta Barbarouses, Alex Rufer, Scott Wootton</p>
        
            <p>Key signing: Kazuki Nagasawa</p>
        
            <p>One to watch: Isaac Hughes</p>
        
            <p>Prediction: 5th</p>
        
            <p>The presence of both teams represents a massive opportunity for growth for each team and football in New Zealand. However, to get bums in seats, eyes on screens and clicks on apps, some form of rivalry needs to be drummed up between the two.</p>
        
            <p>So what might that look like, and what can each team leverage to create a unique derby?</p>
        
            <p>A singular rivalry between two New Zealand teams in one sport makes the Kiwi-lasico a unique proposition for fans.</p>
        
            <p>Popular teams such as the Warriors and the Breakers plough lone furrows in their respective leagues while rugby union divisions are spread across numerous regions.</p>
        
            <p>In domestic professional football there is now only one choice - you are either Auckland or Wellington.</p>

            <p>Some of the best rivalries in football stem from a belief of an imbalance between each fan base or club. The Phoenix could argue they are the David to Auckland's goliath. It's a bigger city, a richer owner, and part of a multi-club model which is already paying dividends. Similar to how the wilting Manchester derby ignited, when City were pumped full of money to take it to United, this is a rivalry the Phoenix needed.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Auckland will point to the Phoenix's long-standing position within the A-League. They will consider themselves the upstart against the established elite, zoomer v boomer, TikTok v Facebook, a disruptor among the norm which can certainly generate some heat.</p>

            <p>Player transfers have long been a way to give derby matches an extra bit of spice. Think England legend Sol Campbell's North London switch from Tottenham to Arsenal. Or Luis Figo's switch from Barcelona to Real Madrid.</p>
        
            <p>This is already happening, with Auckland snapping up Alex Paulsen, via AFC Bournemouth, just a few months after he was named the best goalkeeper in the A-League as a Phoenix custodian. Meanwhile, Callan Elliot and Logan Rogerson are also ex-Nix players now plying their trade for the newbies.</p>
        
            <p>On the other side, the Phoenix plucked Marco Rojas from under the nose of Auckland this off-season and with only a limited pool of Kiwi and Australian players available to form the bulk of each squad, it won't be long before someone is making the direct switch.</p>

            <p>While it is important for this rivalry to have a little bit of aggro it should still remain a 'friendly rivalry'.</p>
        
            <p>Think about the Merseyside derby. Liverpool and Everton have no love for each other, but a mutual respect born of being from the same city, a city which often sees itself fighting the system and the rest of the nation.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland and the Phoenix are in a similar boat - the lone Kiwi sides among a sea of Australian competition.</p>
        
            <p>It's a rivalry, yes, but should above all present an exciting opportunity to get one over your neighbour before inviting them for a beverage of choice after. A truly Kiwi rivalry will only make this even more popular.</p>
