            <p>New Zealander Finley Melville Ives has unfurled an explosive run in Switzerland to be crowned men's freeski halfpipe world champion.</p>
        
            <p>The Wanaka teenager said he was shocked after heading a 12-strong field in what was his debut appearance at a world championships.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I am in shock. I can't believe I landed my run, I am so hyped," Melville Iles said.</p>
        
            <p>"The pipe is so good, I am so thankful the weather is good, thanks to everyone for coming out - I just can't believe it, it's so sick."</p>
        
            <p>As the top qualifier for finals, the 18-year-old made his mark from the outset, putting down an exceptional score in his first of two runs.</p>
        
            <p>The run began with a switch right double cork 1080 Japan, then a left double cork 1620 mute, a left alley-oop double flatspin 1080 mute, a switch left double cork 1080 Japan, before ending with a right double cork 1620 safety.</p>
        
            <p>The judges awarded Melville Ives a mammoth score of 96.00, which saw him shoot straight to the top of the leaderboard at the midway point.</p>
        
            <p>The other 11 athletes, including New Zealander Luke Harrold, couldn't match that score on their second runs either, leaving Melville Ives able to take a victory lap for his final run.</p>

            <p>Decorated slopestyle athlete Nick Goepper finished in second place, with two-time Olympic halfpipe medalist Alex Ferreira, also of the USA, rounding out the podium in third.</p>
        
            <p>Melville Ives was thrilled to share the podium with Goepper and Ferreira, saying; "They're both my idols, so I honestly can't believe it. I'm so stoked to share the podium with them."</p>
        
            <p>Lake Hawea 16-year-old Harrold finished fourth position on Sunday after being bumped out of podium position by Goepper in run two.</p>
        
            <p>Harrold nevertheless made history by putting down the first switch left alley-oop triple cork 1260 mute ever landed in competition during his second run.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Auckland 17-year-old Mischa Thomas placed ninth in the women's freeski halfpipe finals - her first major tournament.</p>
        
            <p>It rounded out a hugely successful series of returns for New Zealand at the 2025 freeski and snowboard park and pipe world championships.</p>
        
            <p>Two other New Zealand world champions were crowned - Zoi Sadowski-Synnott grabbing her third snowboard slopestyle title and Luca Harrington the freeski big air gold.</p>
        
            <p>Ten months out from the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, the New Zealand athletes will turn their focus to spring training camps in the Northern Hemisphere before returning home for the domestic season.</p>
