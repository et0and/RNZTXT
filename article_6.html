            <p>The All Blacks visited City KickBoxing last week, prompting some fans to ponder how the All Blacks would fare in the UFC.</p>
        
            <p>If these worlds were to collide, here are RNZ's eight candidates for the octagon.</p>
        
            <p>Note that some small weight cuts would need to occur. Weights are given in pounds as well as kilograms as imperial measurements are standard in the UFC.</p>
        
            <p>Asafo Aumua 108kg (238lb)</p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Derrick Lewis.</p>
        
            <p>Aumua brings pure power to the table and against the greatest knockout artist in history, this bout would be violent, and spectacular.</p>

            <p>Cortez Ratima 87kg (191lb) </p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Middleweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Bo Nickal.</p>
        
            <p>As seen with his "don't argue" on Leicester Fainga'anuku, Ratima's strength belies his stature. Could he derail the Nickal hype train?</p>

            <p>Ethan De Groot 122kg (268lb)</p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Tai Tuivasa.</p>
        
            <p>With his trademark Southland mongrel, De Groot would be a threat to every man in the heavyweight division. De Groot and Bam Bam would no doubt stand and bang until someone goes to sleep.</p>

            <p>Damian McKenzie 78kg (171lb)</p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Welterweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Colby Covington.</p>
        
            <p>Having copped plenty on the pitch over his career, the durable McKenzie could no doubt absorb brutal punishment in the octagon and smile through it. His war of words with Chaos would be just as entertaining as their meeting in the cage.</p>

            <p>Ethan Blackadder 111kg (244lb)</p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Stipe Miocic.</p>
        
            <p>Blackadder's relentless work ethic and brute force would translate nicely to MMA, and his seemingly endless gas tank could see him take one of the greatest into deep waters.</p>

            <p>Jordie Barrett 95kg (209lb) </p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Light Heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Jiří Procházka.</p>
        
            <p>As Marika Koroibete can attest, Barrett possess a dangerous front kick. With his reach advantage, he could well find the chin of the Czech Samurai in what would be a showcase of unconventional striking.</p>

            <p>Ardie Savea 99kg (218lb)</p>
        
            <p>Weight class: Light Heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal opponent: Alex Pereira.</p>
        
            <p>Savea's takedown prowess could seriously test the defence of the best. The one area the current king may be vulnerable, Savea may maul his way to a suffocating win over Poatan.</p>
