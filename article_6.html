            <p>Kiwi sailor Matt Mitchell, who won the America's Cup with three different teams, has died aged 53.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell, who had cancer, died in Auckland last week.</p>
        
            <p>He took part in six America's Cup regattas, winning with Team New Zealand in 2000, Alinghi in 2007 and Oracle in 2013. The third win was a famous one, with Oracle coming from 8-1 behind to beat Team NZ 9-8.</p>
        
            <p>Lifelong friend Craig Satterthwaite told Yachting NZ Mitchell was intensely determined and talented.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just a natural yachtie, and he could do anything on the boat. He was a bowman in the America's Cup, a mid-bow, a top Zephyr sailor, and he won a handful of nationals with us on the 5.9."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell's funeral service will be held at the Royal Akarana Yacht Club on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
