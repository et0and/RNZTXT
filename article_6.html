            <p>New Zealand driver Scott Dixon overcame the loss of his team radio to finish second in the IndyCars opening round in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon, who started sixth on the grid, finished behind Chip Ganassi team-mate and series champion Alex Palou.</p>
        
            <p>The 44-year old felt he would have had a better shot at winning if he'd had help from pit lane.</p>
        
            <p>"We had no radio so just flying blind out there .</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely frustrating I think we had the speed, we had a great car, would have just been nice to have a radio so I knew what was going on out there (in regard to pitting strategy).</p>
        
            <p>Dixon, 44, who was entering his 25th year in top class racing in North America, admits it was a tough not knowing if he was getting the fuel mileage he needed to get to the next (pit) window which then affected his total race strategy.</p>

            <p>"Ultimately it cost us the race."</p>
        
            <p>It was the third time Dixon has finished runner-up at the street race in St Petersburg.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Palou kicked off his pursuit of a fourth IndyCar championship with victory in the Firestone Grand Prix in St. Petersburg.</p>
        
            <p>It was the 12th career IndyCar victory for the 27-year-old Spaniard, who is seeking his third consecutive title.</p>
        
            <p>"It's huge. It's huge. I'm super happy," he said. "I've been working really hard. It's been a place that we've struggled a lot at in the past. Especially me, personally.</p>
        
            <p>"So to start with a win in 2025 is amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Pole-sitter Scott McLaughlin finished fourth while the third New Zealander in the field, Marcus Armstrong failed to finish.</p>
