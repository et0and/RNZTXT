            <p>The White Ferns are still working on finding the right balance between youth and experience as they look ahead to this year's T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand begin a five-game series against England in Dunedin today without two of their biggest run-scorers.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr aren't available for game one of the series as they travel back from India where they played in the Women's Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>Stand-in captain Suzie Bates said the team's newer members were starting to benefit from more time on the international scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Those younger players that got brought into international cricket at the Commonwealth Games (in 2022) are now further down the track in their international playing career," Bates said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got an opportunity to blood some players and see where they're at in international cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"The girls have trained their butts off and while that doesn't guarantee anything, we've done everything we can to make sure that we're ready for a quality England side."</p>
        
            <p>Devine and all-rounder Kerr will be back for game two in Nelson on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>In their absence Georgia Plimmer and Mikaela Greig have been called into the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Central Hinds batter Greig, who is 28, could make her White Ferns debut.</p>

            <p>Bates believes Greig will fill a hole for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"She's a hard hitting middle order batter which we're in search of so I know when she comes out to bat she's going to play one way.</p>
        
            <p>"She's also a great slips fielder with some of the best hands in the country."</p>
        
            <p>Four of England's best players will miss the first three T20s, with Nat Sciver-Brunt, Danni Wyatt, Sophie Ecclestone and Alice Capsey having played in the WPL.</p>
