            <p>NZ Warriors star Roger Tuivasa-Sheck has found himself correcting slightly ill-informed fans, as they grapple with the concept of rival rugby codes on the streets of Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland club is part of the league showcase at Allegiant Stadium this weekend, when they kick off their 2025 NRL campaign against Canberra Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>The season-opening doubleheader is the second staged in the United States, after a successful debut last year, but the presence of the Kiwis has added another level of confusion to the event.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been walking around and anytime we mention we're from New Zealand, they assume All Blacks straight away and we've had to correct them… no, rugby league… Warriors," insisted Tuivasa-Sheck.</p>
        
            <p>Of course, the former Warriors captain and Dally M Medal winner is also a former All Black himself, still adjusting back to his previous life in the 13-a-side game.</p>
        
            <p>Last season - his first back at Mt Smart, after two across town at Eden Park - Tuivasa-Sheck (31) desperately tried to fill a void in the centres for coach Andrew Webster, but they seem to have abandoned that experiment, returning him to the wing, where he first made his impact across the Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>"We spoke heading into Christmas and thought this would be a good dynamic for our team," he said. "I agreed and jumped on - at this stage of my career, I'm just glad to be on the field.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the coach had an idea of where he wanted to play me and the gameplan, and for me as a player, I was just keen to get on the field, so I bought into the gameplan.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but it's all part of the game of NRL - you just have to keep moving forward with it.</p>

            <p>"This year, I'm excited to be on the wing and we'll go from there."</p>
        
            <p>Traditionally, union has lured league players across with the promise of seeing more of the world at both professional and international levels, but the Vegas fixtures are as much about evening up that score as it is exposing the game to a lucrative new market.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you can see the world in both codes, you've just got to be fortune where you are," said Tuivasa-Sheck. "Today, I'm with the NRL and the Warriors in Vegas, and that's pretty cool.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been fun. Vegas is crazy, there's a lot going on all the time, and it's good to be here and experience it with the team.</p>
        
            <p>"Rugby league is definitely doing something great here and I love the whole concept of playing in this place, where it's all about entertainment and that's what we are."</p>
        
            <p>Keeping the team focused on the task ahead has been paramount, with the senior players setting a tone for their younger teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"At one stage, when we first got in, the boys were itching to see everything and were buzzing over this town and how it never sleeps - the lights and the colours everywhere - but we're a few trainings in and we're back to locking in," said Tuivasa-Sheck.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're just excited, because there's a bit of downtime and we can check out all the touristy stuff, but once we're on the field, we're keen to play and keen to rip into our season.</p>
        
            <p>"Our leaders are telling the boys to keep everything as normal as you can. Lock your doors and stay in your rooms, if you want to save some money as well, because it's pretty expensive out there."</p>
        
            <p>Webster has named starting line-up that features back-up fullback Taine Tuaupiki on the other wing, with incumbent Dallin Watene-Zelezniak sidelined for several weeks, after wrist surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki was probably the team's standout pre-season performer, scoring three tries across the two trial games against Cronulla Sharks and Melbourne Storm.</p>
        
            <p>"Taine's been playing really well and training really well, that's why he got the first shot on the right wing in Dallin's spot," said Tuivasa-Sheck.</p>
        
            <p>"He took it with both hands in the trials and he's earnt his way there. Congrats to him for getting the start."</p>
