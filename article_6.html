            <p>Auckland golfer Ryan Fox has had a tough start to the US Open in North Carolina.</p>
        
            <p>Fox fired an opening round three over par 73, which currently has him tied for 108th.</p>
        
            <p>Starting on the tenth hole at Pinehurst, Fox birdied the 11th before a bogey at the 13th and a double bogey at the 14th.</p>
        
            <p>He played par golf until the second with another bogey, a birdie at the fifth and then a bogey at the seventh.</p>
        
            <p>Fox, who moved to the US PGA Tour from Europe last year, is playing the US Open for the fifth time.</p>
        
            <p>He missed the cut in his first three outings and finished tied for 43rd last year.</p>
        
            <p>American Patrick Cantlay is the current leader at five under par.</p>
        
            <p>He mixed six birdies with a boey on his way to a 65.</p>
        
            <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler, who has won five tournaments since since including the Masters, is currently one over par early in his round and is in a tie for 54th.</p>
        
            <p>Pinehurst is where New Zealander Michael Campbell won the US Open in 2005.</p>
