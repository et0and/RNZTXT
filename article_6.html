            <p>Val Smith, one of New Zealand's most successful lawn bowls athletes is calling time on her career after more than 20-years at the top level.</p>
        
            <p>Smith, from Nelson, leaves elite bowls as New Zealand's most capped athlete, having played a staggering 667 international matches for her country.</p>
        
            <p>She has won two World Championship Titles (one singles, one pairs) and nine World Championship medals.</p>
        
            <p>Smith has competed at five Commonwealth Games, winning one silver and three bronze medals.</p>
        
            <p>The 59-year-old said the decision to retire came with mixed emotions, but she knew the time was right.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish it would never end, but after such a long career, this just feels like the right time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Smith took up up lawn bowls in 1992, making the national development squad in 2000 and with her New Zealand debut in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>"Never in my wildest dreams did I think my debut would lead to this many games."</p>

            <p>While it was hard to pin down one favourite memory, she said the World Championships titles were right up there.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had so many highlights but winning the World Championship Singles and winning the Pairs with my best friend, that's pretty difficult to beat. The 2023 World Championships was also really special where we won the Women's Team gold and the Taylor Trophy. That win really reflected our team spirit and passion so it was a great moment.</p>
        
            <p>"The silver medal at Delhi was another really special achievement for me, because I started that event so poorly, and then all of a sudden I found some form and just took off, and before I knew it I was in the final.</p>
        
            <p>As for what next, Smith is unsure but is looking forward to a break although she still plans to play at club and provincial level.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been the most incredible journey. The happiness that I've felt through being involved in something that feels bigger than anything you could possibly imagine has been amazing.</p>
        
            <p>"I put my dream of playing for New Zealand ahead of everything else because it meant so much to me. I don't know exactly what I'm going to be doing now but I'm looking forward to finding out!"</p>
