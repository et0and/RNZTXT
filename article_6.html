        <h2>A deep dive into the All Blacks' record at Eden Park</h2>
        <p>
A week after the 'Sky Stadium Curse', the All Blacks find themselves back on much happier ground. How have they fashioned a 30-year unbeaten run in Auckland?

            <p>Before last Saturday night, it is pretty unlikely anyone looked at the fixture list for this year and would've been particularly worried about the All Blacks' Eden Park streak ending against Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>Fair to say that perception has changed, especially since that the last time an Argentine side played on Eden Park they won and the last time captain Pablo Matera did, he won a Super Rugby Pacific title.</p>
        
            <p>But the streak itself is something that deserves a bit of a closer look because it says a great deal about who the All Blacks have played as much as the All Blacks themselves: specifically that it hass been the Wallabies more times than the Springboks, France, England and Ireland put together.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some of the notable moments:</p>

            <p>Much has been made about that French victory in 1994 and the Try from the end of the World, but not so much about when the All Blacks returned to Eden Park. The third test against the Springboks was a dead rubber because the All Blacks had ground out wins in the first two and ended up being a very boring 18-all draw. So boring, in fact, that the crowd that had bothered to stick around afterwards booed then-NZRFU president Peter Burke for suggesting otherwise.</p>
        
            <p>Despite dotting down numerous times for the Blues on Eden Park, Jonah Lomu only ever scored one test try on Eden Park. It was an important one, coming late in a tense 28-16 Bledisloe Cup test in 1995 after the team had returned home from that year's World Cup.</p>

            <p>The only really thing notable about Scotland's 48-14 loss to the All Blacks at Eden Park is that it's the last time they have ever played here, which makes it the last time the All Blacks have worn a change jersey on home soil. It also meant that current NZ Rugby CEO Mark Robinson is the last All Black to debut in such circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Believe it or not, but there was a time when not only were the Wallabies world champions, but they also held the Bledisloe Cup for five seasons. That is why the jubilation of the 21-17 win at Eden Park in 2003 is so pronounced from the All Blacks, because after that they have never had to hand the Bledisloe back.</p>

            <p>Probably the biggest threat to the Eden Park streak and its most notable phase was the All Blacks' successful World Cup campaign, which involved an increasingly tense and dramatic series of matches and injuries. Tonga, France, Argentina and Australia were all beaten before the All Blacks met France again in the final, which was won by a single point thanks to Stephen Donald's boot.</p>
        
            <p>The first test against Ireland in 2012, which was won 42-12, saw the debuts of young Manawatu halfback Aaron Smith, Hawkes' Bay lock Brodie Retallick and Wellington wing Julian Savea. Between them they'd play a combined 287 tests and Savea would finish as the All Blacks' equal-second highest try scorer of all time.</p>

            <p>Like his namesake did to the HMS Hood in 1941, Bismarck du Plessis utterly destroyed Dan Carter in a memorable but hotly debated tackle 15 minutes into the game. The Springbok hooker was then shown a second yellow early in the second half and that helped the All Blacks go on to win a spiteful test 29-15, despite being reduced to 13 men themselves in the dying stages. The result is also notable for being the last time the Boks have played at Eden Park, and that the All Blacks' unbeaten streak against them specifically now stretches back to 1937.</p>

            <p>The British & Irish Lions arrived in New Zealand with locals giving them little chance, but that perception had changed significantly by the time the third test kicked off. It finished 15-all, preserving the Eden Park streak but denying the All Blacks a series victory after they had been tipped up in the second test. The ending was extremely controversial, with a potential winning penalty attempt reversed by referee Jerome Garces.</p>
