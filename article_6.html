            <p>Taine Tuaupiki might have taken Warriors fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad's spot for their NRL season opener, but the two are great mates.</p>
        
            <p>Despite being in direct competition for the Warriors fullback jersey, Taine Tuaupiki and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad are each others biggest fans.</p>
        
            <p>"Charnze is probably my closest bro in the team and I don't know if that's common, two people in the same position being as close as we are," Tuaupiki said.</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki has been given the fullback jersey for the Warriors for their season opener in the absence of the injured Nicoll-Klokstad.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old said Nicoll-Klokstad will always be the first to complement his good work, but also call out his errors.</p>
        
            <p>"If I have done something wrong in the game, I'm probably walking around my tail a bit tucked because I'm just waiting for him to bring it up and when you have a relationship like that, when you can just be straight up and honest with each other, it's massive for my game and I'm sure it will benefit his game too."</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki also stepped up to play at the back on five occasions in 2023 when Nicoll-Klokstad was sidelined and said he got nothing but support.</p>
        
            <p>"It helps us both grow as players and just the relationship that we do have off the field, it's better for the team when you have that healthy competition."</p>
        
            <p>Born in Sydney, Tuaupiki moved to Aotearoa before his first birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up in Taharoa, he spent his childhood riding horses and motorbikes on the family farm and is still closely connected to the town.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to get out there whenever you can, it's always humbling. There's not much phone service. It's isolated and they don't care who you are out there. They just they see you as another cousin and another bro, so it's always good to get out of the big loud city life."</p>
        
            <p>When he turned 10 his family moved to the Gold Coast, where he lived for 12 years.</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki credits his time playing across the ditch as a junior for developing the player he is today.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a different style of rugby league and taught me the smarts of it. We don't have the big boys storming through, everyone is similar in size, so you have to be a little bit more tactical with your game plan."</p>
        
            <p>
Taine Tuaupiki said there was only ever one club he wanted to play for.

            <p>As well as tackling smaller bodies, Tuaupiki also misses the Gold Coast beaches.</p>
        
            <p>"I am still struggling to find hobbies and different sides of me than rugby league, because you do need them if you want to be as happy as you can</p>
        
            <p>be on the field. You have to be happy outside. So I do probably need to do a little bit more searching on the field side of things."</p>
        
            <p>However, he is unlikely to have a heap of time for hobbies, with his first child due around June.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a little girl on the way so me and my partner are very excited."</p>
        
            <p>He said knowing he is about to become a father has already changed him.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully it makes me grow up a little bit. I do enjoy having a beer with the boys after a game. But I think now I'll go home and have cuddles with the baby. I'm a pretty motivated guy, but even just since I found out that we're going to have a baby, I can feel doing things just that little bit more. I'll do all my work for our baby because you want to build a better life, it's for a bigger cause."</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki admitted he has had a quiet pre-season, however, now with the responsibility of starting across the opening rounds, he has "whipped his bum into shape."</p>
        
            <p>"Webby showing confidence last year when Charnze went down in round three and for him still to pump my tires up and let me know that the boys trust me, makes my job a little bit easier."</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki said he is not looking to set things alight from fullback, but rather do his core jobs well.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to do my role that helps us win games. I don't want to go out and score hat-tricks, but just start our sets with momentum, and be as reliable as I can under the high ball."</p>
        
            <p>A proud Warrior, while other NRL clubs did show interest in the young Tuaupiki, there was only one place he wanted to play.</p>
        
            <p>"This is home. When the Warriors came to the table. I was hoping another club didn't come with a crazy deal that my manager would look at me sideways if I said no to, because no matter what else came I was taking it because I just wanted to be home with my whanau."</p>
        
            <p>Although he has spent half his life across the Tasman, Tuaupiki has eyes only for the Kiwis after getting a taste of international footy with the A squad in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the dream. I spent a lot of years over in Aussie so people probably think I would have aspirations to play State of Origin or play for Aus, but I've always had the dream of being able to do that haka and wear that black jersey."</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki's first year in the NRL saw him as 18th man for a dozen Warriors games.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good to be a part of but when you're missing out on playing (NSW) Cup games and sitting on the bench watching the boys play as good as they did play, I just wanted to be out there, but just to experience what I did sitting on the sideline, it was mean."</p>
        
            <p>Currently a specialist fullback, Tuaupiki said he has aspirations of becoming a utility.</p>
        
            <p>"I did grow up playing in the halves honestly just played fullback about three four years ago. I've been trying to show Webby I can pass the ball of the deck and play bit of hooker but anywhere, in that 17, even 18, I'd just be grateful to be part of it."</p>
        
            <p>He said a win first up against the Sharks this weekend will be crucial in kick starting their campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"We do want to start the year off strong but we can only do that by ripping every day and just worry about that game when the game comes."</p>
