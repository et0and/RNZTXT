            <p>New Zealand Rugby has reached a settlement with INEOS after suing the petrochemical company for ending its sponsorship agreement early.</p>
        
            <p>In February, NZ rugby launched legal action against INEOS, alleging the company owned by British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe had prematurely ended its six-year sponsorship deal, estimated to be valued at $48 million, which began in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement today, NZR said it was dropping its lawsuit.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand Rugby and INEOS can confirm that a settlement has been reached between the two parties. Whilst the details remain confidential, both organisations are satisfied with the outcome and acknowledge a desire to now move forward."</p>
        
            <p>Last week New Zealand Rugby removed the INEOS branding from its uniforms after the company's logo was displayed on the Black Ferns Sevens and All Blacks Sevens uniforms at the Vancouver leg of the World Series in February.</p>
