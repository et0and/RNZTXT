            <p>New Zealand alpine skier Alice Robinson has claimed her seventh consecutive World Cup giant slalom podium finish to maintain her lead in the series standings.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson was second behind Italian archrival Federica Brignone at the eighth and penultimate World Cup round to notch her 17th career podium finish, setting up a thrilling finish to the series at Sun Valley, Idaho on 25 March, where Robinson and Brignone will battle for top spot.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi saw her lead reduced to a mere 20 points, with 100 still to be won, and said she would need to perform better in Idaho.</p>
        
            <p>"There are so many positives, although I wasn't very happy with my skiing in the first run and even the second run didn't feel very good," she said. "I think it was quite close with the times and I was lucky to come in second on the right side of the hundredths.</p>
        
            <p>"Federica has been amazing with all these wins, but I guess me sticking close in second, it's keeping the points. It's cool that we get to have a final shootout in Sun Valley in a couple weeks."</p>

            <p>Robinson of Queenstown became the first New Zealand skier to secure a world championships medal, when she clinched silver behind Brignone in the giant slalom in Austria last month.</p>
        
            <p>Brignone, 34, was fastest in both runs in Sweden and finished a hefty 1.36s ahead of Robinson, 23, to notch her ninth win of the season in all disciplines.</p>
        
            <p>"She [Robinson] is again second and it's an amazing fight," Brignone said. "She's an amazing skier.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good fight. I'm happy actually to fight for this and to have such a great skier that plays with me."</p>
        
            <p>High winds at the top of the course resulted in the use of a lower start and a shortened course for the athletes, who had to hunt for every hundredth of a second of speed.</p>
        
            <p>Brignone was the first athlete on course, putting down an error-free run and setting the time to beat for the first run. Robinson sat in fifth after her first run, 0.65s off Brignone's time in the tight race.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson tore down the course for her second run, skiing her way into the leader's seat, but with four athletes still to come, a podium was not yet guaranteed.</p>
        
            <p>Her time held strong right up until Brignone put down a blistering second run to take the win, while Albanian Lara Colturi, 18, rounded out the podium in third.</p>
        
            <p>Brignone's 36th career World Cup win increased her overall points lead to a mighty 322 points over closest rival Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland, who was ninth in the giant slalom.</p>
