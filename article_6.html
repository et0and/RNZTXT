            <p>New Zealand takes on India in the opening match of the three-test series in Bengaluru today.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps' new test captain Tom Latham said he expected pace bowlers to play a crucial role in what was likely to be a rain-interrupted match starting on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain hampered the final preparations for both teams on the eve of the contest in Bengaluru, and more showers are predicted throughout the week in which the Black Caps will aim to stop a rampant India from continuing their winning run at home.</p>
