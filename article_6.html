            <p>The wait is finally almost over for 'The Black Jag'.</p>
        
            <p>Much like his animal moniker, Kiwi MMA star Carlos Ulberg has had to be patient in order to catch his next prey.</p>
        
            <p>Ulberg will meet Alonzo Menifield at UFC Fight Night in Missouri this Sunday (NZ time), after having three scheduled fights cancelled since his last appearance in Sydney, in September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The light heavyweight was set to take on former title challenger Dominick Reyes in January before Ulberg was forced to withdraw with injury.</p>
        
            <p>Rebooked for March, the fight again fell through when Reyes was too hurt to make the card.</p>
        
            <p>American Menifield stepped in as a replacement, but wanted more time in camp, so the fight was moved to 11 May.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the multiple setbacks, Ulberg has not let the adversity break him as he looked to crack the UFC's top 15 rankings.</p>
        
            <p>"It gave us and him enough time to prepare for this fight. So we're both healthy, it's gonna be a good one."</p>
        
            <p>Ulberg said he will not only be chasing a 10th career win, but also the coveted 'Performance of the Night' bonus.</p>
        
            <p>"I like Alonzo, he's a respectful guy. He's got power. He's explosive. It could go either way. It could be a total mess, Fight of the Night kind of fight. Or it could just be a a pick him apart kind of fight. So it really depends on how he brings the fight but we'll see on the night... We both want that $50k."</p>
        
            <p>After a loss in his UFC debut, Ulberg has gone on a five-fight unbeaten run inside the octagon. His most recent win came via a third-round rear naked choke against Jung Da-un at UFC 293, the first submission of his career.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I've evolved, I'm continuously learning and wanting to better myself every day. So right now I feel like I deserve to be in this top 15 and it's my time now, and show myself."</p>

            <p>Menefield, 15-3-1, is coming off two strong wins over Jimmy Crute and Dustin Jacoby, but Ulberg did not believe his streak was under threat.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing is surprising. I've seen it all. And I've been around for a while so I know what to expect."</p>
        
            <p>UFC Fight Night will air on ESPN 2 on Sky from 11am Sunday (NZ time).</p>
