            <p>Lando Norris cut Max Verstappen's Formula One lead to 45 points after his McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri obeyed orders and gifted the Briton a sprint-race victory in Sao Paulo on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Piastri had started on pole position and led until handing over two laps from the end after Red Bull's Verstappen had passed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc for third and became an increasing threat.</p>
        
            <p>The switch came just before a virtual safety car (VSC) period left a tense final lap with Australian Piastri crossing the line 0.593 behind Norris in a one-two finish and Verstappen 0.904 further adrift.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen was then told he was under investigation for an alleged VSC infringement that could cost him a five-second penalty and drop him to fourth.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Liam Lawson, who started eighth on the grid, was overtaken by Red Bull driver Sergio Perez late in the race and finished ninth.</p>
        
            <p>Just the top eight receive points in a sprint race.</p>
        
            <p>"Oscar drove well and he deserved the win today. I'm not proud of winning a sprint race or any race like this, so I thank Oscar and the team," said Norris, who started second on the grid.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's our objective, it's what we have to work towards as a team. We get the points in the constructors and I get the points in the drivers. That's our target."</p>
        
            <p>Piastri's race engineer thanked the Australian, who is out of title contention, over the radio for his "massive support to the team".</p>
        
            <p>McLaren are now 35 points clear of Ferrari in the constructors' standings after a gain of six.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen and Leclerc had a lively battle for third before the champion passed on the 18th of 24 laps and Nico Hulkenberg then triggered the virtual safety car by stopping by the side of the track in a smouldering Haas on lap 21.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to wait for some mistakes and luckily they came, and I could use that to my advantage," said Verstappen, who will have a five-place grid penalty for Sunday's race due to an engine change.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time this season that Verstappen has been beaten in a sprint.</p>
        
            <p>Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fifth, with George Russell sixth for Mercedes and Pierre Gasly seventh for Renault-owned Alpine while Mexican Sergio Perez secured the final point in eighth for Red Bull ahead of RB's Liam Lawson.</p>
        
            <p>The main Sao Paulo Grand Prix is on Sunday (Monday NZ time), with qualifying later on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The race started with all drivers on the medium tyre and Piastri leading Norris away with Leclerc holding on to third place.</p>
        
            <p>Piastri showed no sign of moving aside, despite Norris saying over the radio that he was close and then sounding impatient.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure what we're doing here, mate," he said after slipping out of DRS range. "I thought we spoke about this."</p>
        
            <p>Piastri was told on lap 10 to give Norris, under threat from Leclerc, a drag reduction tow and McLaren then informed both drivers on lap 16 that they were happy to hold position until the last lap.</p>
        
            <p>The danger of a virtual safety car putting Verstappen right on their tail changed that position.</p>
        
            <p>"Ideally, you would do it earlier but the situation never materialised for this being done in a safe situation," said team boss Andrea Stella.</p>
        
            <p>"Because as soon as you swap you would have the guy in the third that has the possibility to overtake a McLaren, and this wouldn't fit our principle that the team result comes first."</p>
