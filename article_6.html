        <h2>Board, provincial unions to go head-to-head over NZ Rugby reform</h2>
        <p>
A vote on what has been labelled a generational change to the governance structure of New Zealand Rugby will take place at the end of the month.

            <p>The 26 provincial unions and the New Zealand MƒÅori Rugby Board will vote on two proposals at a special general meeting on 30 May which could fill the New Zealand Rugby board with independent directors.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, an independent review found NZR's constitution and governance was not fit for purpose and stressed the need, among other things, for a nine-person independent board.</p>
        
            <p>One of the proposals will have New Zealand Rugby (NZR) essentially implement the wholesale changes recommended by last year's Pilkington review.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the NZR board said the proposal would give effect to the key recommendations outlined in the review published last August and would move it to becoming independent rather than having provincial representation.</p>
        
            <p>The other proposal put forward by a group of provincial unions chairpersons would retain provincial representation on the board.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the NZR board said it was waiting for those provincial unions to complete their proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Initially, the NZR had discussed a modified proposal of the Pilkington Review which raised the ire of the New Zealand Rugby Players' Association which wants the review implemented in its entirety.</p>

            <p>The modified proposal has now been walked back.</p>
        
            <p>The special general meeting will take place on 30 May, in Wellington, where the two proposals will be considered by NZR's voting members.</p>
        
            <p>The NZR's annual general meeting (AGM) will be held on 26 July, the latest possible date under the constitution.</p>
        
            <p>If either of the governance proposals are approved at the special general meeting (SGM), the AGM may be held on 12 July.</p>
        
            <p>However, if neither proposal is approved at the SGM, there will be a scramble to get something agreed upon before the AGM.</p>
