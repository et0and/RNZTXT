            <p>SailGP says it is working with host city partners in New Zealand and around the world to finalise next season's event calendar, after its chief executive announced the tour will not return to Christchurch next year.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on the eve of the New Zealand race leg in Lyttelton this weekend, Russell Coutts told One News last night that Lyttelton Harbour was a fantastic venue but "minority interests" had made things too difficult.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch stepped in to host the event for a second time when Auckland pulled out of hosting duties in November.</p>
        
            <p>But there have been concerns about collisions with endangered Hector's dolphins which are found in and around the harbour.</p>
        
            <p>SailGP organisers are expecting a record crowd of 22,000 people to watch the high-speed sailing this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>A Lyttelton business owner said it is disappointing SailGP won't return next year because everyone was working together to keep the dolphins safe.</p>
        
            <p>Grace Uivel from Ata Ceramics said SailGP had been working "really well" with local hapÅ« and the Department of Conservation.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day the minority group would be the people who want to see these dolphins harmed.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're really all on the same team here so it's disappointing that we can't make it work."</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon's first first race was delayed by more than an hour after a dolphin sighting.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson told RNZ that Sail GP expected to confirm events for Season 5 next month, adding that it would include an expanded schedule.</p>
        
            <p>"That process includes extensive feasibility and planning to finalise a schedule that aligns with global shipping timelines."</p>
        
            <p>She said that for now, SailGP was "totally focused on delivering another spectacular event in Christchurch, which has proven to be one of the very best destinations in our global racing championship".</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch City Councillor for Banks Peninsula Ward Tyrone Fields told RNZ it was sad that Russell Coutts had felt compelled to make his announcement on the day before racing started.</p>
