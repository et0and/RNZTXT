        <p>

            <p>England have been "exposed" in India and have some "deep thinking" ahead, according to coach Brendon McCullum.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists won the first Test but then suffered four losses to go down to their first series defeat since McCullum took charge in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of good will come out of this tour. I'm 100% positive about that," McCullum told BBC Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be a better cricket team for the experience, although it hurts a lot at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>England's victory in the first Test in Hyderabad was one of their greatest overseas wins, particularly given India's formidable home record - the hosts have not lost a Test series in this country in 12 years.</p>
        
            <p>But the tourists squandered strong chances in the second, third and fourth Tests and were 100-1 on the first morning of the fifth before unravelling to lose by an innings and 64 runs.</p>
        
            <p>The latest reverse in Dharamsala means England have been beaten in seven of their past 12 Tests and are winless in three series.</p>
        
            <p>And New Zealander McCullum said this tour had "taught him more" about his team than ever before.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you can get away with things, but when you're exposed in the way we have been in the back end of this series in particular, it does require some pretty deep thinking and some adjustment to make sure we're staying true to what we believe in," added McCullum.</p>
        
            <p>"If anything we got more timid as the series went on and that was because of the pressure that was applied to us by the Indian line-up."</p>

            <p>England's next Test series is against West Indies in July, followed by Sri Lanka at the end of the home summer.</p>
        
            <p>There are tours of Pakistan and New Zealand next winter (summer in New Zealand), before India visit in 2025. The Ashes series in Australia in 2025-26 will be the last of McCullum's four-year contract.</p>
        
            <p>England's relaxed approach has led to criticism that the environment is too cosy and failure is too readily tolerated.</p>
        
            <p>Since McCullum and captain Ben Stokes took charge, only batter Alex Lees has been dropped following a prolonged period in the side.</p>
        
            <p>After the defeat in Dharamsala, Stokes said anyone who writes him or England off does so "at your own peril" and McCullum said the coach and captain are "fiercely competitive".</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst you guys know me as a pretty relaxed person, I still have a fierce drive to ensure that we will get this team to where we want to get to," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That will allow some reflection over the next few weeks, then we start plotting towards rectifying what has unfolded here and becoming the team we should be.</p>
        
            <p>"We like to operate in a really calm, enjoyable and positive environment, but we don't mistake that for not having tough conversations when they are required."</p>
