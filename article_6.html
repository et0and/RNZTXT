            <p>Both the Wellington Phoenix men's and women's football sides have enjoyed 2-nil wins, with the men's side retaining their top of table standing heading into Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The men's side beat Western Sydney but the two goals only came in time added with the teams locked at 0-0 at the 90-minute mark after a tight defensive tussle.</p>
        
            <p>The women bounced back from a surprise loss last round to beat the Newcastle Jets 2-nil and close in on on top spot.</p>
        
            <p>They will head into the Christmas break in third spot.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix striker Kosta Barbarouses broke the deadlock for the men's side.</p>
        
            <p>Picking up a lofted ball sent from Alex Rufer at the halfway mark, Barbarouses poked it to the side of the Western Sydney keeper Lawrence Thomas then regathered it and scoring off his left foot from an acute angle.</p>
        
            <p>Two minutes later Ben Old put the result beyond doubt with Barbarouses again involved after the Phoenix broke out of their own half.</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses slid a pass left to Old who drilled it into the back of the net.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix sit at the top of competition ladder on 20 points with six wins from nine games.</p>

            <p>In contrast the Phoenix women seemingly had their game wrapped up by halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Mariana Speckmaier (penalty) and Hope Breslin scored for the home side, the goals coming within five minutes of each other late in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix have five wins from nine games and sit on 16 points, one behind competition leaders Perth Glory.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Paul Temple said the result was an important one coming off the shock loss to competition strugglers Adelaide United.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a good performance. We needed that. It was nice to keep a clean sheet...and good to go into the festive period with a win."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will have a three-day break before turning their attentions to Friday night's match against defending champions Sydney FC.</p>
        
            <p>"They deserve to have a few days off to spend a few days off with family, and my family will be happy that we won today as I'll have a smile on my face for Christmas," said Temple.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have the chance to have a little break I think it's important to take it."</p>
        
            <p>Sitting just one point off the competition lead Mariana Speckmaier told Sky Sport the season was wide open for them: "we all expected to be able to do this well. We have a really talented squad and (our results) have shown that."</p>
