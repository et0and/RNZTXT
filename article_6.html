            <p>Rowers are looking to claim more medals and sprinter Zoe Hobbs will take her marks again on the eighth day of the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Those in New Zealand can also watch on Sky Sport, stream on Sky Sport Now, or watch free-to-air on Sky Open (available on Freeview Channel 15 or stream free via Sky Go).</p>
        
            <p>Due to the time difference, day eight of the Games starts on Saturday evening and stretches into Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Here's who to look out for. All times are in NZT.</p>
        
            <p>The matriarch of the New Zealand rowing team will be the one to beat in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Emma Twigg is the first-ever New Zealand rower to contest five Olympic Games and will be defending her single sculls gold from Tokyo 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg is so far unbeaten at these Games, winning her heat, quarterfinal and semifinal comfortably to book a spot in this final.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand rowers claimed three medals in quick succession on Thursday night, and odds are good that Twigg will add to that tally.</p>

            <p>Tom Mackintosh came second in his semifinal earlier this week and will be out to prove himself in the final on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old only made the switch to the single sculls from sweep boats 14 months ago, after taking a break to focus on his career as a financial analyst.</p>
        
            <p>He is no stranger to the podium, having won gold with the men's eight at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Zoe Hobbs - the first New Zealand woman to feature in a 100m Olympic sprint in nearly 50 years - breezed into the semifinal with a season's best time of 11:08 seconds in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>A confident Hobbs earlier said she believes she has "another edge" to bring to the semifinals and she's following her process to the letter.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs will race in the third of three semifinal heats, with the top two from each race advancing directly to the final, which is at 7.20am Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It's finals time again for swimmer Erika Fairweather.</p>
        
            <p>The swimmer will need to dig deep to claim a podium place after coming third in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>Fairweather has no far not medalled at these Games. Her best result was a fourth in the 400m freestyle finals.</p>
