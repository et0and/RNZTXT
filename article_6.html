            <p>A review into Yachting New Zealand (YNZ) has revealed cultural issues, a lack of transparency and perceived favouritism within the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>YNZ released the findings from the Project Arotake evaluation of the organisation, carried out by independent reviewer, former New Zealand Olympic Committee secretary general Kereyn Smith, with some uncomfortable reading for the governing body.</p>
        
            <p>The key findings are:</p>
        
            <p>The review of the past Olympic cycle took place while the Sport Integrity Commission deals with multiple athlete welfare, cultural and conduct complaints within yachting.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The evaluation found that some of the decision making processes at YNZ lack transparency and it is perceived there is favouritism and bias within the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>It revealed there is a lack of mutual trust and confidence and that yachting is a male-dominated sport, which can make it challenging to create a supportive environment for women and girls to thrive.</p>
        
            <p>The review also found discrepancies between stated values and actual behaviours within Yachting New Zealand and there was a perception that leadership operates within a traditional paradigm which may not embrace modern, inclusive or innovative approaches.</p>
        
            <p>Smith's report made a number of recommendations around culture and accountability and policy and procedures at YNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The evaluation pointed out the need for YNZ to be accountable for behaviours and performance within its environment.</p>
        
            <p>It also pointed out the need for YNZ to establish and uphold safety and standards, including establishing "and upholding appropriate boundaries and behaviours and ensuring safe sport practices".</p>
        
            <p>Smith recommended YNZ elevate wellbeing as a priority and embed a "people first" culture, which has consistently been a recommendation of other reviews into high performance sporting environments since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>With regards to gender equality, the review recommended YNZ commit to an increase in women's presence and contribution to the leadership and delivery of the</p>
        
            <p>high performance programme</p>
        
            <p>It recommended YNZ consider the further use of mentors, advisors, coaches, winning ways for women, creating the best female performance culture to retain and attract females into the programmes and suggests the organisation establish an advisory group to widen the voices, engagement and accountability.</p>
        
            <p>The report also talked about the need for YNZ to thoroughly review its approach to Olympic selection to give confidence the policy and panel are fit for purpose and deliver a robust, transparent and fair process.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ previously reported on issues raised about Yachting New Zealand's handling of its Olympic selections this year around conflicts of interest on the selection panel, with people serving dual roles among other issues.</p>
        
            <p>Yachting NZ was accused of mishandling its Olympic selections after one of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games, despite failing to meet the required performance standard.</p>

            <p>With five previous Games appearances and three Olympic medals between them, the pair had experience, but according to YNZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to be considered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10 placing at one of the designated selection regattas. The selection was signed off by the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC).</p>
        
            <p>The pair finished seventh in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Several athletes told RNZ they have reservations about the structure of the now completed review, pointing to its limited scope and the involvement of Yachting NZ chief executive David Abercrombie on the steering committee.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood at least one athlete has raised their concerns directly with a Yachting NZ board member.</p>
        
            <p>The design of the Yachting NZ review was the last straw for some athletes and others in the wider sailing community, who say they have lost faith in the leadership of the organisation following a series of messy selection disputes for this year's Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Windsurfer Bruce Trotter, who spoke out about Yachting NZ's "deeply troubling process issues" earlier this year confirmed to RNZ he was among those to lodge a complaint with the Sport Integrity Commission about the Project Arotake review.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ learned of at least four further complaints to the commission against Yachting NZ.</p>
        
            <p>The allegations broadly encompass leadership and cultural issues, ranging from claims Yachting NZ's selection and funding processes are systemically unfair, to concerns about the organisation's handling of serious conduct issues involving athlete behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>It is not believed any current athletes in YNZ's high performance programme are among the complainants.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understandood several complainants have been interviewed by the commission, but it is not clear whether officials have opened a formal investigation.</p>
