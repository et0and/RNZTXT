            <p>A sports academic says Auckland would need to stump up $200 million to secure hosting rights for the next America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland is back in the running to host the America's Cup after the council's event arm confirmed it had entered talks with cup holders Team New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The talks come after an economic impact report has revealed Barcelona benefited from a NZ$1.8 billion boost from hosting last year's regatta.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland University of Technology professor of sport and recreation Mark Orams who is also a former member of Team New Zealand says the money could come from the council, central government and private investors.</p>
        
            <p>"A large proportion of that's likely to come from taxpayers and ratepayers so it does require a careful analysis to be very confident that with that level of investment, that there would be a return for Aucklanders and New Zealanders to make that worthwhile."</p>
        
            <p>The $200m would be spent on some additional work as well as gaining the hosting rights and for the New Zealand team, Dr Orams said.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest thing Team New Zealand boss Grant Dalton has to sell was the hosting of the event "and in doing that it enables him to keep the team together".</p>
        
            <p>"So that's why he's shopping it around."</p>
        
            <p>He believed Valencia, in Spain, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Auckland were all in the mix as potential hosts.</p>
        
            <p>The formula of ratepayers, central government and private investors was how Barcelona had packaged it together and the recent study had shown it had paid off.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also significant that the city has not put its hand up for next time."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Orams said while the report had laid out the positives, he agreed people should be cautious of such studies because there were a lot of variants to how data was compiled.</p>
        
            <p>"There are benefits both economic and intangible non-economic benefits from hosting a large international event like the America's Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand won the America's Cup in Barcelona last October becoming the first team in modern history to lift the trophy three times in a row.</p>
