            <p>Wellington Phoenix have parted ways with club centurion David Ball, freeing up a spot ahead of the A-League's transfer window.</p>
        
            <p>The club and English striker Ball said in a statement they'd "mutually agreed" to terminate the remaining six months of his playing contract, ending five and a half years at the Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Ball's only appearance this year was as a substitute in the opening match of the season in mid-October, with coach Giancarlo Italianio preferring younger, less experienced players in his front line.</p>
        
            <p>The 35-year-old would leave a gap that Italiano would be eager to fill quickly, with the out-of-form Phoenix languishing in 10th place, having lost six of their 11 matches.</p>
        
            <p>The league's transfer window opens on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Ball scored 15 goals and provided 26 assists in his 122 appearances, helping the Phoenix reach the finals in four of his five full seasons.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been a lot of tears coming to this decision as the Phoenix have been a huge part of mine and my family's life," Ball said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've put my heart and soul into the club since I got here and I've fallen in love with the Nix, the people around it and the fans.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably been the toughest decision of my career."</p>
        
            <p>Ball was named player of the year in 2020 after scoring six goals and setting up four others to help the Phoenix to what was their highest regular season finish of third.</p>

            <p>He remained a key part of the side right through to last season's first-ever run all the way to the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to help solidify the Phoenix as a club that regularly plays in the finals and challenges for titles," Ball said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've surpassed every bit of history the club's had since I arrived and I believe I've left the club in a better place than when I first came to it."</p>
        
            <p>Ball said he wanted to keep playing - and indicated he would like to remain in New Zealand - but his short-term plan was simply to spend time with his family.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix director of football Shaun Gill described Ball as "the ultimate pro" and a role model for players coming through the club's academy.</p>

            <p>Club captain Alex Rufer said Ball had been a standout team-mate.</p>
        
            <p>"We've developed a very close friendship," Rufer said, reflecting on his influence during the difficult two seasons played under Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>"We went through possibly the toughest time any footballer has had to go through, relocating to Australia for two seasons, and Bally played a key role in keeping the group together.</p>
        
            <p>"He gave everything for the team and he was also a massive part of the success we had last season."</p>
