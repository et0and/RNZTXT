            <p>Capturing world class photos of surfing is not about equipment or training, but about recognising the right moment to hit the shutter, according to one of New Zealand's most respected surf photographers.</p>
        
            <p>Craig Levers of CPL Photography has been shooting surfing for more than three decades and is the official snapper for Surfing New Zealand's national championships which wrap up in Taranaki on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's like any sport where there's that critical moment, the critical moment where the surfer or the athlete is at that absolute point of no return.</p>
        
            <p>
Craig Levers got into surf photography as a 22-year-old and just a couple of years later was a staff photographer at New Zealand Surfing Magazine.

            <p>"Maybe they're at the very at point of being out of control before they're back in control again, and other surfers will recognise that moment, and so to capture that moment, that's what makes a great surf photo I think."</p>
        
            <p>Levers, 57, got into surf photography as a 22-year-old and just a couple of years later was a staff photographer at New Zealand Surfing Magazine where he worked for 15 years before starting his own publishing company.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a surfer first, and so really what I wanted to do was perpetuate a surfing lifestyle and to combine my two passions, photography and surfing together seemed like a good idea.</p>
        
            <p>"But of course, if you're taking photos of surfing, you're not surfing. So maybe it wasn't such a good career decision."</p>
        
            <p>The equipment had changed over time, Levers said.</p>
        
            <p>"It sure has, yeah, man, like we started with manual focus cameras, then we moved into auto focus. Then we were all shooting on film, on velvia, slide film, then we've moved on to digital.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, there's something nostalgic about shooting on film, but digital is just so amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Levers uses a wooden tripod.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, the wooden tripod looks like a vintage tripod, but it's actually quite a new tripod.</p>
        
            <p>"I shoot a lot of landscapes as well, and originally I got the wooden tripod because wood soaks up vibration better. So if you're doing a long exposure, you get less movement in the photo.</p>
        
            <p>"But also wood is really good in a harsh beach environment. So whereas carbon fibre and aluminium will rot out, wood, as long as you look after it, it's actually better at the beach."</p>
        
            <p>Levers has travelled the world on surf assignments but one destination was a particular favourite.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably the highlight of my career would be being able to go to Teahupo'o in Taihiti.</p>
        
            <p>"And last year, I was fortunate enough to travel with our Olympians, Billy Stairmand and Saffi Vette, and cover part of their training.</p>
        
            <p>"That was pretty amazing to return to Teahupo'o. I'd been two times previously, but not for a long time, so to return with our two Olympic hopefuls. I was really stoked to be able to do that."</p>

            <p>There was only one nagging regret.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're a surfer, you know, it's definitely very difficult because you are sacrificing going surfing at the best times.</p>
        
            <p>"So do I have any regrets? Sure every day when it's offshore ... but seriously no, no I have no regrets.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been very fortunate to live through halcyon times in New Zealand surfing, and also halcyon times in surf magazine culture, where there was no internet and print was king."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was the people that kept him coming back to surf events.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh, it's still the same thing. It's perpetuating the surfing lifestyle. I get to be immersed, especially with the nationals and things like that, I still get to be immersed in surfing at an elite level.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the community around surfing. I love catching up with old mates and meeting new mates."</p>
        
            <p>The Surfing New Zealand national championships open women's and men's finals are due to be surfed on Saturday.</p>
