            <p>Third-string hooker Tyrone Thompson has been named to start in the Chiefs' side for the Super Rugby Pacific final.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson, who earlier this season was linked to a move to the Newcastle Knights in the NRL, shifts into the starting hooker position following last weekend's injury to Samisoni Taukei'aho. Bradley Slater has been named as the reserve hooker, despite being injured as well in the Chiefs' semi-final victory over the Hurricanes last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>In other changes, Manaaki Selby-Rickit comes onto the bench, replacing Naitoa Ah Kuoi. Shaun Stevenson has been named after being a late scratching last weekend, his return sees Daniel Rona moved onto the bench.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unfortunate to have lost some key players through injury, but no team has been immune to this, and you won't see us worrying about something we can't control," said coach Clayton McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>"We are genuinely excited for the players who now get their opportunity. In Tyrone Thompson and Manaaki Selby-Rickit, we have two quality players who will serve the team extremely well."</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs and Blues played only three weeks ago, in the last regular season game. It ultimately meant nothing to the Chiefs, as any result wouldn't have shifted them out of fourth spot on the table, with the Blues winning 31-17.</p>
        
            <p>However, the performance denied a bonus point that, for a while at least, looked to have cost the Blues a home final. The Chiefs' subsequent win over the Hurricanes shifted back the finals action back to Eden Park, which has sold out for Saturday night.</p>
