            <p>The focus for the Wellington Phoenix and their supporters is now on next season.</p>
        
            <p>This season came to a disappointing end on Saturday night, beaten 2-1 by Melbourne Victory, to miss out on a first ever A-League grand final appearance.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix did record their highest ever finish on the table and managed their most points and wins.</p>
        
            <p>However, many were left with a feeling of what could have been.</p>
        
            <p>Club legend Paul Ifill doesn't believe the Phoenix got anything wrong tactically on the night, they were just unlucky.</p>
        
            <p>"All the games between themselves and Victory this season have been close tactical affairs and I think that on another day we'd be saying how proud we are of them for making a grand final," Ifill told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"If Alex Rufer had converted the penalty, if Ben Old had slipped that one inside the post. That's what it comes down to sometimes in big games, just a matter of inches."</p>
        
            <p>Can the Phoenix now build on this for next season?</p>
        
            <p>The club expects to lose two or three of their squad, including goal scorer Oskar Zawada, with the Polish striker already linked with expansion club Auckland FC.</p>

            <p>General Manager David Dome was happy with where they were at in their recruitment process.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think anyone from our club is at risk of leaving that we would otherwise want to keep," Dome told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been clear on the young players we've signed to long-term contracts that locks them in.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone decides to leave to go to Auckland, that's fair play to them, but at the moment the emergence of Auckland hasn't really affected us and our strategy of player recruitment."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Giancarlo Italiano was confident of retaining fellow striker Kosta Barbarouses.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano, who has just finished his first year in charge, said he had a solid squad to work with and the players who took part in Saturday night's game were now better prepared for next season.</p>
        
            <p>"We've built that experience now, we've got that as a part of our foundation of the club to move forward.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone says we can't finish in the top two, well we just lean back on this. Anyone says we can't match it with Victory for a spot in the grand final we look back to this and the little details will get us over the line next time."</p>

            <p>Of the squad that kitted up for the season ending game, eight of them are under-23 players and Italiano said they'll be sticking with their policy of developing youth.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a very good owner, a very good football committee, they've put a lot of investment into the club.</p>
        
            <p>"They want to be competitive next year again with the emphasis on youth and trying to build on what we've done so for me we just plan accordingly."</p>
        
            <p>Former club star Paul Ifill would like to see them recruit a couple of dominant overseas players.</p>
        
            <p>But one thing he feels will further benefit them next season is the coach.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys have really taken to his playing style and his playing model after one season and I imagine after two seasons it can be even better."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will be joined by Auckland FC in an expanded 14 team competition for the 24-25 season with Canberra the other team to be included.</p>
        
            <p>Central Coast Mariners and Melbourne Victory will meet in this season's grand final.</p>
