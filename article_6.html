            <p>Kiwi wildcard Ollie Dunbar's given the 2025 New Zealand Squash Open a shot in the arm on the opening day with a massive upset victory in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>The 18-year-old Wellingtonian has played the match of his life to beat Portugal's World No. 54 Rui Soares three games to one, to move through to the second round.</p>
        
            <p>Ranked more than 200 places below Soares at World No .257, Dunbar came out firing, taking the first game 11-6.</p>
        
            <p>And while he dropped the second 11-7, he bounced back to dominate the last two 11-3, 11-4, winning the match in 47 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"That's definitely the biggest win of my career," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was great to do that at home, I've got my Dad here and a few clubmates came to watch so it's pretty cool.</p>
        
            <p>Dunbar said he came in to the game with no expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"There was great support for me from the crowd and I just went out there and tried to keep it simple and play my game,"</p>
        
            <p>Dunbar faces a tough task in the second round, with his opponent being third seed and World No. 12, You Ng Eain of Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>Three other Kiwis were in action on day one, including five-time Commonwealth Games champion Joelle King who was battling a knee niggle.</p>
        
            <p>King's restricted movement meant she was unable to rely on her trademark retrievals and Malaysian Aira Azman took full advantage, winning in straight games.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day, Auckland wildcard Ella Lash put up a brave fight against another Malaysian Ainaa Amani, also going down in straight games.</p>
        
            <p>Wildcard Anthony Lepper from Auckland suffered the same result, beaten by Spain's Bernat Jaume.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Squash Open is being contested until Sunday at Christchurch's iconic Isaac Theatre Royal, where a glass court has been installed on stage, with defending mens champion, New Zealand's Paul Coll getting his campaign underway at 5.30pm tomorrow against Japan's RyÅ«nosuke Tsukue.</p>
        
            <p>Coll's wife, Belgium's Nele Gilis-Coll, is the defending womens champion.</p>
        
            <p>She starts her campaign at 6pm Wednesday against Egypt's Nour Heikal.</p>
