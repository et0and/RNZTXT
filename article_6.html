            <p>Black Caps assistant coach Jacob Oram believes a balance needs to be found over slow over rates in test cricket.</p>
        
            <p>Both New Zealand and England were fined and lost World Test Championships points for their slow over rates in the first Test in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>That further dents the Black Caps' slim hopes of making the World Test Championship final.</p>
        
            <p>The ICC match referee at the match David Boon imposed the sanctions after both sides were ruled to be three overs short of the target after time allowances were taken into consideration.</p>
        
            <p>The rules state that the bowling team needs to complete 90 overs in a day's play.</p>
        
            <p>Oram said rules needed to be adhered to, but the context of the game also needed to be taken into account.</p>
        
            <p>"There are results in most Test matches now and runs are being scored at a frenetic pace and wickets are falling all over the place, there is a lot of entertainment," Oram said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"If you bowl 90 overs or 85 overs there is a lot of stuff going on and I think we need to find a balance and getting some understanding."</p>
        
            <p>Oram said the side had discussed the matter and would endeavour to speed up their play in the field.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lesson we're going to have to take on the chin and learn from.</p>
        
            <p>"It just comes down to hustle, making sure guys are providing that energy and bowlers are doing their job and everyone is getting into position as quickly as they can."</p>

            <p>The other lesson the Black Caps might want to take on is their fielding.</p>
        
            <p>They dropped a number of catches as England scored an eight-wicket win at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>Oram said they were normally a good catching team so he did not think anything major had to change.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's a go and catch for another hour.</p>
        
            <p>"Tom Latham hasn't become a bad catcher from what happened in Christchurch, but it is about those guys making sure that they do the work beforehand, there is no complacency which I'm sure is the case and we're ready for when those nicks come here at the Basin."</p>
        
            <p>Oram didn't give any indication on what their bowling line-up will be other than to point out that the wicket looked green.</p>
        
            <p>The second Test starts at the Basin Reserve on Friday.</p>
