            <p>We have reached the final of UEFA's flagship men's international tournament, with two of Europe's biggest footballing nations, Spain and England, awaiting each other in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Spain have been the outstanding team of the tournament and dispatched France in the semis, with a little help from the prodigious talents of 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.</p>
        
            <p>England meanwhile left it late, substitute Ollie Watkins rifling home in the final minute against the Netherlands after manager Gareth Southgate's gamble off the bench paid dividends.</p>
        
            <p>So, what do you need to know ahead of the final?</p>

            <p>Luis de la Fuente's men are buoyed by the returns of defensive lynchpins Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand from suspension - shoring up the backline in the face of England's impressive firepower.</p>
        
            <p>Pedri remains absent, but Spain are otherwise at a full complement and it is hard to see many drastic changes for a side who have won every game inside the distance at this tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Probable starting line-up: Unai Simon; Dani Carvajal, Aymeric Laporte, Robin Le Normand, Marc Cucurella; Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, Dani Olmo; Nico Williams, Lamine Yamal, Alvaro Morata.</p>

            <p>Gareth Southgate has been handed a selection headache by the game-winning contributions of Watkins and Cole Palmer in their semi-final triumph over the Dutch.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Luke Shaw looks ready for a full 90 minutes and brings harmony to the side being a naturally left-footed defender.</p>
        
            <p>Despite all this, Southgate is likely to stick to the same starting XI from the final four, with the only question being whether it lines up as a back three or back four.</p>
        
            <p>Probable starting line-up: Jordan Pickford; Kyle Walker, John Stones, Marc Guehi, Kieran Trippier; Kobbie Mainoo, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka; Harry Kane.</p>

            <p>It's coming home? When the song which originally birthed this popular refrain was released in 1996, it sang of 30 years of hurt. That is fast approaching the 60 mark, given that England's men have not won a major tournament since the 1966 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>After last-minute overhead-kick equalisers, conquering penalty demons and Watkins' flash of brilliance, it certainly feels like this is finally England's year.</p>
        
            <p>But they face formidable opponents in Spain. La Roja having gone the entire competition without needing extra-time, or finishing 90 minutes without coming out victorious.</p>
        
            <p>Yet, despite logic dictating a Spanish victory, something about England's problematic and bumpy ride to this point makes it feel written in the stars that they will finally end the generational wait for a senior men's trophy.</p>
        
            <p>Spain 1-1 England (England to win in extra time)</p>
