            <p>The All Blacks Sevens are set to lose leadership and decades of experience as Scott Curry, Tim Mikkelson and Sam Dickson call time on their international careers.</p>
        
            <p>The trio have all captained the side at some point during their lengthy careers and have World Series, World Cup and Commonwealth Games titles to their names.</p>
        
            <p>Mikkelson is the most experienced player of the three, earning the most caps of any player in All Blacks Sevens history (104 caps) after making his debut in 2007 and is the second most capped player in international sevens history.</p>
        
            <p>He was also the fourth highest try scorer in the game.</p>
        
            <p>Long serving captain of the team, Curry goes out still as one of the world's leading forwards after an impressive performance at the Paris Olympics where the men missed out on the medals.</p>
        
            <p>Curry debuted in 2010 and had played 71 times for the team.</p>
        
            <p>Dickson, who was the most recent of the three to captain the side, made his debut in 2012 and attended three Commonwealth Games and three Sevens Rugby World Cups.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby's head of men's high performance Mike Anthony said the players had "made a significant contribution on and off the field" to the All Blacks Sevens.</p>
        
            <p>"They have left an incredible mark on the game and have added to the legacy of the All Blacks Sevens.</p>
        
            <p>"The success they have had in the black jersey is credit to their leadership, work ethic and dedication to the game."</p>
        
            <p>While Dickson has confirmed his retirement from all rugby, Mikkelson and Curry are stepping back from professional rugby.</p>
