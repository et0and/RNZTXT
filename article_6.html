            <p>Australia have beaten the Black Caps by 72 runs in the second T20 cricket match in Auckland to retain the Chappell-Hadlee trophy.</p>
        
            <p>A good bowling effort by the Black Caps meant they were left to chase an obtainable 175 to level the three match series but they will be disappointed with their batting.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors were threatening a huge total when they were 103 for 2 after just eight overs after being put into bat by New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But the Black Caps started to pick up regular wickets and dismissed Australia for 174 with one ball remaining.</p>
        
            <p>Lockie Ferguson (4-12) stared with the ball, backing up his performance in Wellington, while Ben Sears (2-27) was also in the wickets.</p>
        
            <p>But New Zealand suffered a blow when opening batsman Devon Conway had to leave the ground to undergo an X-ray on his left thumb after sustaining a knock while wicket-keeping.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Rachin Ravindra was ruled out of the match after experiencing knee pain following the first game in Wellington, where he was a stand-out with the bat.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>He was replaced by Will Young, while Trent Boult and Ben Sears also came into the side.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand lost their first three wickets cheaply but Glenn Phillips, who came in at number four, top scored for the home side with 42.</p>
        
            <p>But wickets continued to fall around him and when Phillips lost his wicket the game was as good as over.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were bowled out for 102 after 17 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra will be treated over the coming days before a decision is made on his availability for the third T20I on Sunday in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The X-ray later cleared Conway of an obvious fracture.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's Pat Cummins, who contributed with the bat and ball, was named player of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Cummins told TVNZ his team had a good night with the ball.</p>
        
            <p>"The wicket helped a little bit, it had a little bit in it," Cummins said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand batting order was disrupted by the absence of Conway, and captain Mitch Santner was promoted to number three.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unfortunate with Devon but the good news is it's not broken ...we'll see how he goes in a couple of days but we've obviously got Test matches coming up and they are pretty important as well," Santner said.</p>
        
            <p>Santner told TVNZ that the Australian bowlers really put them under pressure during the power play period.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe we could have soaked it up a little bit longer but they bowled extremely well and whenever you lose three or four in the power play it's always tough from there."</p>
        
            <p>The third and final T20 is on Sunday in Auckland.</p>
