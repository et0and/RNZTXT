            <p>After an ugly first 40, the Chiefs have stormed home in the second to crush Moana Pasifika 43-7 at Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead by just 12-0 after Moana were at one point reduced to 13 men, the Chiefs ran in seven tries to well and truly announce themeless as a top four contender as the business end of the season approaches.</p>
        
            <p>After his horror injury inflicted by Darcy Swain, Quinn Tupaea is hitting the form which saw him called up to the All Black midfield, while Wallace Sititi continues to impress in his rookie season, making 19 powerful carries.</p>
        
            <p>Josh Jacomb also put in an admirable performance in the absence of Damian MacKenzie, scoring a try and kicking four conversions.</p>
        
            <p>Moana meanwhile have their season hanging by a thread as they slip out of the top eight.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Luke Jacobson told Sky Sport it was a strong finish from his side.</p>
        
            <p>"A little bit shaky at halftime, I think we were just expecting things to happen, but once we got into some good work with some clean carries, things started to fall into place."</p>
        
            <p>He said it took a stern word from coach Clayton McMillan to click them into gear after oranges.</p>
        
            <p>"The forward pack got the finger pointed at them, we were probably being a bit passive, we were getting dominated, Moana brought a lot of physicality to the collision as we thought they would so we had to make a big shift there."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobson said he feels as though the Chiefs have turned a corner after their bye.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a lot of games on the trot and the boys maybe got a bit stale but we got away, took a hard look at ourselves and I think we have started to get a bit more constancy."</p>
        
            <p>It took more than twenty minutes before Tupaea opened the scoring with his first try since 2022 after a powerful bust through several Moana defenders.</p>

            <p>Things soon got worse for Moana as Miracle Fai'ilagi left the park injured and Irie Papuni was sent to the bin for shoulder on head contact.</p>
        
            <p>As Sititi went close with another strong surge, Aisea Halo kicked the ball out of Xavier Roe's hands and also found himself on the sideline for ten.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs took immediate advantage as Josh Jacomb weaved through the line to score and give his side a 12-0 lead.</p>
        
            <p>Coombes-Fabling looked to have extended the lead just on the siren, but it was scrubbed due to an earlier knock on.</p>
        
            <p>The halftime talk worked wonders for the Chiefs who kicked off the second with a stunner.</p>
        
            <p>Etene Nanai-Seturo conjured some individual magic, chipping ahead, regathering and pinning out of the final tackle attempt to streak away and score.</p>
        
            <p>Jacomb's quality shift at ten continued as he sent Simon Parker in under the sticks with a deft pass.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs would then hammer away at a brave Moana for 21 phases until Lienert-Brown finally crashed over for the Chief's fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Moana would get some solace with a consolation try, Neria Fomai chipped across to Anzelo Tuitavuki who showed off hs best Benji-step to skin the cover.</p>
        
            <p>As reward for his captains knock, Jacobson capped his night with a well-deserved meat pie and after being denied earlier, Coombes-Fabling iced the cake in the corner on the back of a beautiful pass from Lienert-Brown.</p>
        
            <p>Next week the Chiefs will travel to Melbourne to meet the Rebels while Moana have a tough task in Wellington against the high flying Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 43 (Tupaea, Nanai-Seturo, Lienert-Brown, Jacomb, Parker, Jacobson, Coombes-Fabling tries, Jacomb, 4 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Moana 7 (Tuitavuki, tries, Leuila con)</p>
