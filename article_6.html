            <p>Without A Fight won the 163rd running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse on Tuesday, with jockey Mark Zahra celebrating back-to-back triumphs in Australia's most prestigious race.</p>
        
            <p>Zahra, who rode Gold Trip for his first Cup win last year, steered the seven-year-old gelding in front 300 metres from the finish and burned away to claim the A$8 million ($5.15 million) race by two lengths from Soulcombe on a hot, blustery afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Victory in the two-mile handicap secured a rare double in Australian racing, with Zahra having ridden the Anthony and Sam Freedman-trained horse to glory at the A$5 million Caulfield Cup last month.</p>
        
            <p>The last winner of both the Melbourne spring races in a single season was Ethereal in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>"Unbelievable. To the trainer's credit, he was an absolute gentleman for me today," said Zahra.</p>
        
            <p>"He went to the rail, switched off. I just thought I'm going to stay here, they all made their moves, which opened it up for me and I was on a horse that you can just sit on.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got an electric turn of foot and he just pulled me all the way to the line and it was all over."</p>

            <p>Zahra became the first jockey to win back-to-back Melbourne Cups since Glen Boss rode Makybe Diva to a hat-trick of wins from 2003-05.</p>
        
            <p>He has shown a knack for timing on and off the track.</p>
        
            <p>Though guiding Gold Trip to the Turnbull Stakes win at Flemington a month ago, he ditched the Ciaron Maher and David Eustace-trained stallion last week in favour of Without A Fight for the Cup tilt.</p>
        
            <p>Gold Trip, carrying the top weight of 58.5kg on a firm track, slumped to 17th under replacement jockey James McDonald.</p>
        
            <p>'Extraordinary ride'</p>
        
            <p>Prepared by British duo Simon and Ed Crisford, Without A Fight ran 13th in last year's Melbourne Cup.</p>
        
            <p>However, the horse has come into its own since joining the Freedmans' Flemington stable.</p>
        
            <p>It was rated 7/1 by bookmakers pre-race on Tuesday despite hauling 56.5kg and jumping from a wide barrier.</p>
        
            <p>Zahra shook his fist in triumph in the saddle and waved two fingers in a V-sign at the crowd of 84,492, a gesture he later felt awkward about.</p>
        
            <p>"I got up on the hinds and gave it the two fingers. I was thinking the two winners, I don't know what I was thinking -- idiot," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Freedmans, a father-and-son training duo, added another major piece of silverware to the family's trophy cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>Anthony's brother Lee Freedman won five Melbourne Cups from 1989-2005.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a great race for the family, it's been a while between drinks and it's good to get another one," said Sam Freedman.</p>
        
            <p>"An extraordinary ride, (Zahra) got him onto the rail from a wide gate, relaxed, switched him off, made a run."</p>
        
            <p>Local trainer Chris Waller, famous for preparing the record-breaking mare Winx, missed out on the win but his horses Soulcombe and Sheraz, rated an 80/1 chance, placed second and third.</p>
        
            <p>Pre-race favourite Vauban, trained by Ireland's Willie Mullins, nosed in front at the final turn but faded badly to finish 14th.</p>
        
            <p>Three-times Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Damien Oliver rode Alenquer to 21st in his final Melbourne Cup, the gelding cleared by stewards in the morning after reported for foot bruising.</p>
        
            <p>However, Right You Are, trained by Maher and Eustace, failed to finish.</p>
        
            <p>Stewards said vets had cleared all runners of "significant findings" after post-race inspections.</p>
        
            <p>The field was reduced to 23 after the Kris Lees-trained Cleveland was scratched by stewards late on Monday.</p>
