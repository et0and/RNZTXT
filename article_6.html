            <p>Double Olympic champion Ellesse Andrews set a world record as New Zealand's endurance riders dominated on the final day of the Oceania track cycling championships in Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews set a world record in the time trial, an event which has been increased in distance this year to 1000m for women to match the distance contested internationally by men.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews one minute 04.697 seconds in qualifying to comfortably break the first world record over the new distance for women of 1:07.287, set recently by Belgian Marith Vanhove.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old Aucklander was slightly outside that time in winning the final, where she beat compatriot Shaane Fulton.</p>
        
            <p>Ellesse matched the deeds of compatriot Bryony Botha, who set a world record in the women's individual pursuit earlier this week, taking advantage of an increased distance in that event.</p>
        
            <p>There were further wins elsewhere for New Zealand on the final night, with Botha and Samantha Donnelly bagging victory in the women's Madison while Campbell Stewart and Tom Sexton did the same in the men's event.</p>

            <p>Stewart and Sexton had a ding-dong battle with leading Australians Oliver Bleddyn and Blake Agnoletto, winning the 200-lap, 50km race by just four points.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi pair won eight sprints, but were relegated from one sprint before finishing third in the final double-point sprint to secure the title.</p>

            <p>It was an all-New Zealand battle in the women's Madison over 120 laps with Botha and Donnelly edging out teammates Rylee McMullen and Emily Shearman by six points.</p>
        
            <p>They won four sprints each but Botha and Donnelly secured third in the double points final sprint to claim the title.</p>
