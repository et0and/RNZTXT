            <p>A superb bowling and fielding effort has helped the White Ferns qualify for the semi-finals of the women's T20 World Cup in the UAE.</p>
        
            <p>They beat Pakistan by 54 runs.</p>
        
            <p>On a difficult batting wicket in Dubai, New Zealand set a target of just 111, but then dismissed Pakistan for 56 in the 12th over.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time New Zealand has reached the last four at a T20 World Cup since 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan, who were chasing a big winning margin to have any chance of qualifying for the semi-finals, recorded their lowest ever total at a World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>After deciding to bat first New Zealand made 110 for six.</p>
        
            <p>Again Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer got them off to a good start putting on 41 for the opening wicket off six overs.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Sophie Devine added 19 and Brooke Halliday 22.</p>
        
            <p>Spinner Mashra Sandhu took three wickets.</p>
        
            <p>In reply Pakistan looked to score quickly but also lost top order wickets at regular intervals.</p>
        
            <p>They slipped to 28 for five before captain Fatima Sana and Nida Dar came together and put on 24 for the sixth wicket.</p>

            <p>Sana, who had just returned to the tournament following a family bereavement, top scored with 21, but as soon as she was dismissed, all hope for Pakistan had gone.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Kerr took three wickets for 14 runs and fellow spinner Eden Carson took two for seven.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably hasn't quite sunk in yet," said New Zealand captain Sophie Devine after the game.</p>
        
            <p>"So incredibly proud of this group and what we've gone through, it's been a long time between drinks so we'll certainly celebrate tonight."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand finish second in group A behind Australia and will play the winner of group B in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>The final positions in group B will be decided tomorrow when England play West Indies.</p>
        
            <p>England currently top that group with six points, South Africa have six and West Indies have four.</p>
