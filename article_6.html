            <p>The Warriors have signed middle forward Erin Clark for three seasons and he returns to Auckland in career-best form.</p>
        
            <p>Clark requested a return to his hometown for compassionate reasons.</p>
        
            <p>The Manurewa Marlins junior is closing in on 100 NRL games after reviving his first-grade career with the Gold Coast Titans.</p>
        
            <p>Clark debuted for the Warriors as a teenager in 2017, making only one appearance, before he left the Auckland-based side mid-season to take up a contract with the Canberra Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>He stepped aside from top level rugby league later that year, returning to Auckland to play local football for two years ahead of making a fresh start with the Titans in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors general manager recruitment, pathways and development Andrew McFadden said Clark's signing was a chance for the 27-year-old to reconnect with the Warriors where it all began for him in the under-20s.</p>
        
            <p>"The start of his career didn't pan out the way he planned but he has been so impressive since having a second shot in the NRL," McFadden said.</p>
        
            <p>Used in the halves in his NYC career with the Warriors, Clark made his NRL comeback four years ago at hooker in 10 appearances for the Titans that season.</p>
        
            <p>Since late 2022, he has operated as a middle forward, predominantly from the bench, a role which has seen him in career-best form in 2024, averaging 100 metres and 22 tackles a game.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was part of the Warriors NYC system when head coach Andrew Webster was first involved with the club as an assistant.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't work out for him initially but the way he has taken his second chance has been outstanding. He has developed into a tough middle forward, durable with a great work ethic, intensity and aggression," Webster said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's going to add real edge to our squad. It'll be exciting having him back home."</p>
        
            <p>Clark finished with 94 matches for the Titans including 84 of a possible 96 games over the last four seasons - and all 24 this year.</p>
        
            <p>He made 45 NYC appearances for the Warriors in 2015, 2016 and 2017 plus 15 New South Wales Cup games in 2016 and 2017.</p>
