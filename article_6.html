            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson hopes to know something about his Formula 1 future by next week.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson is in Abu Dhabi preparing for the final round of the 2024 season.</p>
        
            <p>It is the last of the six races he was contracted for by the RB team.</p>
        
            <p>He has impressed in his return to the sport and many commentators have suggested he could step up and join four-time world champion Max Verstappen in the Red Bull team in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen's current team-mate Sergio Perez is expected to be let go, despite having a contract for the next two years.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was asked if he knows anything about his future.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't, not right now. I think next week would be a time I'd expect to have some information but I would say definitely not before the weekend," Lawson told F1.com.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm focused on is having a seat. This weekend is my last chance to show that, and why I feel like I should be here. For the rest, it's up to the team to decide where I should go.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I made the most of each opportunity but I definitely didn't execute everything perfectly, and there's stuff that I'll learn from reflecting on these races.</p>
        
            <p>"I would say I definitely tried and gave my best at every opportunity. Every decision, whatever I did at the time felt like the best thing for me to do, but obviously you never do the perfect race."</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old Kiwi has scored four points so far with two ninth place finishes.</p>
        
            <p>However his RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda has outperformed him in that time.</p>
        
            <p>The Japanese has outqualified him on all but two occasions and scored double the number of points as Lawson.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson is excited about racing at Abu Dhabi.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the last race of the season, which is weird to say as it feels like it's only just started.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a track that I've raced in the past in F2. I made my debut in an F1 car back in 2021 in the young driver tests, so I'm excited to be back on the track.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a fun one to drive, especially with the new layout and the Team has had success here in the past, so I'm optimistic. I've had a tough couple of races, so I'm hoping to finish the season on a high."</p>
