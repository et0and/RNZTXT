            <p>Both patrons and organisers of Christchurch's premier racing day say Cantabrians "take ownership" over the traditional day out.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Trotting Cup is one of the Garden City's biggest annual sporting and social events, with a crowd of about 15,000 converging on Addington Raceway on Tuesday amid 17C weather.</p>
        
            <p>Alongside an afternoon of racing, fashion and entertainment were major features of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Debbie Handisides said it was her fourth time at the races.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pumped. Haven't been for a few years and I'm with great company. I'm just here to have a great time, be together… it's a girl's day, but also have a look at everyone else having a good time and win some money."</p>

            <p>For some younger patrons, the day's blueprint was straightforward.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey Huntley, Emma Young, Grace Burtenshaw and Kaylee Wilmott attended the event as a group. Asked what the plan of attack was for the day, Huntley said "drink".</p>
        
            <p>"A bit of people-watching, a bit of betting, but I leave that all to my partner," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a good day out - we go every year and the weather is pretty good most years. It's an excuse to dress up."</p>
        
            <p>Wilmott said the hype of the day was customary for local residents.</p>
        
            <p>"This is traditional Christchurch," she said. "This is like our thing."</p>

            <p>Elsewhere, patrons who went to extra effort with their attire lined up for the Cup Day Fashion Competition.</p>
        
            <p>Clad in a gold sequinned and black velvet suit, Dallas Williams decided on a whim to enter the contest.</p>
        
            <p>"I just wanted to be extra this year," he said. "Last year I was a bit plain, so I thought I'd go all-out this year."</p>

            <p>Although crowd numbers were down on what had been typical over the years, organisers were satisfied with the turnout. More than 600 lunches were prepared for staff and contractors on the day, with 10,000 bottles of water on site for spectators.</p>

            <p>Addington Raceway chief executive Brian Thompson said running the event did not get any easier.</p>
        
            <p>"The weather has played its part. We had a bit of wind yesterday which caused a bit of havoc with setup, but it's been really good."</p>
        
            <p>He said the cup remained something personal for Cantabrians.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Canterbury see it as their own day. They take ownership for it, they enjoy it and it's our opportunity to show other parts of the country what we can put on and they embrace it."</p>
        
            <p>The running of the 121st New Zealand Cup was expected at about 5.45pm, with Australian trotter and defending champion Swayzee bidding to become just the seventh champion to defend their title.</p>
        
            <p>It was also the first time in 15 years the cup will be worth $1 million.</p>

            <p>This was the first time the country's two biggest pacing and trotting races, the New Zealand Cup and the $400,000 Renwick Farms Dominion Trot, were to held on the same day. Both will be raced over 3200 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Previously the Dominion was held on Show Day, during the Friday of cup week.</p>

A crowd of about 15,000 is expected throughout the day.
