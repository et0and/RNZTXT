            <p>Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has returned to the top of women's snowboarding with her first Snowboard Big Air World Cup victory since 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old from Wanaka was strategic in warm and windy conditions in Aspen, putting down her winning tricks on her first two runs.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually can't believe it - the conditions were kind of challenging today with the firm, shady landing in contrast with the run-in being soft and bumpy.</p>
        
            <p>"To put those first two [tricks] down was kind of playing tactics, but I am stoked."</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott stomped a switch backside double-corked 1260 with a weddle grab for her first run, scoring the highest single jump score of the day with an 89.00 to take an early lead.</p>
        
            <p>She paired that with a backside double 1080 drunk driver grab (both hands on the board) to take the lead after run two, two points ahead of her nearest competitor, Kokomo Murase of Japan.</p>
        
            <p>With Murase recording a DNI (did not improve) for her third and final run, Sadowski-Synnott dropped into a victory lap as she once again rode her way to the top of the women's snowboarding big air podium.</p>
        
            <p>Japan's Momo Suzuki rounded out the podium in third.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott missed most of the 2024 season with an ankle injury, but has strongly signalled her comeback in the last few weeks with two X Games medals (gold and bronze) and two World Cup wins.</p>
        
            <p>This marks the final event of the 2025 FIS Big Air World Cup Tour. The FIS Snowboard Slopestyle World Cup circuit will resume on 18 February in Calgary, Canada.</p>
