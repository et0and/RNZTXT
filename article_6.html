            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson doesn't see the remaining five races of the Formula One season as a test for him to gain a seat at Red Bull next year.</p>
        
            <p>Following his impressive drive in the US last weekend the RB driver is a contender for a promotion with speculation over the future line-ups of both teams in the Red Bull stable.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson started at the back of the grid in Texas but came through to finish ninth.</p>
        
            <p>That performance immediately threw him into the conversation possibly joining Max Verstappen in the top team in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>However the 22 year old is more concerned about what is currently in front of him.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been with Red Bull now for six years, and it would be my absolute goal to drive with them in the future. But whether that's next year or any other year, I have no idea when that could be," Lawson told F1.</p>
        
            <p>"And for me it's about these races. I know I have five left - very, very important races - to have a seat in Formula 1, and honestly I'm not looking at it any way like it's five races to get a Red Bull seat or something like that.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not like that for me, it's just five races to do a job to try and stay in Formula 1."</p>

            <p>He doesn't automatically expect to have the same form he showed last weekend in the US.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't expect it to just happen every weekend, to improve. The track we're at now, Mexico's a very different style of circuit to Austin. We learned some great things in Austin, obviously for me getting used to the car I learned a huge deal.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't expect to come in and just carry on that form, I think we're going to be doing a lot of learning again."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was tenth fastest in practice in Mexico City.</p>
        
            <p>Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was quickest in a session that was cut short by a high speed crash for Mercedes' George Russell.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Red Bull team boss Christian Horner has announced that Lawson's RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda of Japan will have a test with Red Bull after the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Horner also said that Sergio Perez was still the Red Bull team's driver for 2025.</p>
