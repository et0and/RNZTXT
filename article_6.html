            <p>Opinion: Hero worshipping, appreciation, fandom, you name it. The impact the stars have at the Australian Open is huge and causing a few headaches for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>New crowd control security measures have had to be put in place for practice courts to cater for player popularity.</p>
        
            <p>Ten-time winner Novak Djokovic caused a commotion and a big operation for the Australian Open in Melbourne, bringing special security measures into effect.</p>
        
            <p>Court 16 is the biggest practice court with a stand which has a capacity of around 400, plus those who lean on the court fencing. Then there are the masses lining up along the walkway terrace overlooking the court.</p>
        
            <p>An hour before the scheduled practice the stand was 90 percent full, and the overhanging balcony and walkway were building up.</p>
        
            <p>Eventually, the balcony was six deep with limited chances of seeing anything if you weren't in the first couple of rows and the stand was packed.</p>

            <p>In the past court 16 didn't have the crowd control of this year and total chaos ensued when either Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal or Djokovic practised.</p>
        
            <p>On at least one occasion the player had to step in and physically lift a young child over the fence and on to the court so they wouldn't get crushed.</p>
        
            <p>Fortunately, 2024 has seen more control, but a slightly more sterile way of practice court operation. Security people stop spectators around 50 metres away and wait for their colleagues nearer the court to signal if there are any spare seats. The operation ran seamlessly on this occasion.</p>

Fans also take the chance to get photos after matches, on this occasion when Britain's Cameron Norrie beat Denmark's Holger Rune, on Saturday.

            <p>Ahead of Djokovic was Russian Karen Khachanov who played to the crowd on several occasions and at the completion of the practice signed autographs. Security stood alongside, but the fans were well pleased to see him up close as he even posed for selfies.</p>
        
            <p>When Djokovic appeared, many people were in total awe of their hero. Just to see arguably the greatest player ever up close is something special. And it really is the closest they'll get to Djokovic. Rod Laver Arena has seats much further away than leaning over the fence on court 16.</p>
        
            <p>There was applause for good shots, gasps, cheers and fascination as well as at least a million semi-out-of-focus photos taken.</p>
        
            <p>As soon as he finished crowds surged to the front of the fence in a bid to try and get an autograph. Unfortunately, Djokovic, who is usually very affable to fans, left without signing anything. He has been a bit ill of late and has been concerned about his health.</p>
        
            <p>However, the person who probably got more out of the practice was Jarrod Joyce, a 17-year-old Australian junior who was selected to hit with Djokovic. If you weren't nervous hitting in front of several hundred people, then try keeping it in the court with the Serb great, who has Croatian legend Goran Ivanisevic as his coach. Talk about pressure.</p>
        
            <p>Watching Djokovic in a match is something special, but viewing him warm up, stretch, deal with coaches and hit is sometimes better because you can see what makes a champion player tick.</p>
        
            <p>It's not just hitting a few tennis balls, it's a major operation on and off the court.</p>
