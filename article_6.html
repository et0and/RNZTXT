        <p>
The system has been used in the Southern Hemisphere's Rugby Championship since 2021.

            <p>This year's Six Nations rugby competition will feature 20-minute red cards for the first time after the law variation was trialled during November internationals, with France playing the opening match against Wales on Saturday week.</p>

            <p>Under the change, some red card offences will see a player sent to the sin bin for 20 minutes with the offender then able to be replaced on the field by a teammate off the bench when the punishment has been completed.</p>
        
            <p>Referees can still hand out permanent red cards to reduce a team by a player for the remainder of the contest for offences deemed deliberate and with a high level of danger.</p>
        
            <p>Last October, the proposed trial of the 20-minute red card in elite levels of the game drew criticism from French rugby chiefs saying it could encourage more aggressive play and expose players to greater risk of injury.</p>
        
            <p>Julie Paterson, Chief of Rugby at Six Nations Rugby, said the law change and other trials were among measures aimed at clarifying areas of the game for players and coaches as well as enhancing the experience for fans.</p>
        
            <p>Among other measures, referees will be going 'on mic' to explain key decisions and 'touch finder' technology will be introduced to support the decisions of the match official, organisers added.</p>
