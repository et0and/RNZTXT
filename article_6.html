            <p>Hagley Oval, the Basin Reserve, and Seddon Park will host the Black Caps test against England later this year.</p>
        
            <p>The tests will be played be played in Christchurch from 28 November - 2 December, in Wellington from 6-10 December, and in Hamilton from 14-18 December.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder of the 2024-25 home international schedule will be announced later in the year with the Australia and Sri Lanka women's teams, and the Sri Lanka and Pakistan men's teams also touring next summer.</p>
        
            <p>Interest in the England Test series follows sell-out crowds on seven of the eight days of the two Tests played against Australia earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past, there's often been a lot of talk in New Zealand about the popularity of Test cricket - without that translating into ticket sales or viewership numbers," NZC chief executive Scott Weenink said.</p>
        
            <p>"The difference over the past summer, and in terms of the upcoming Tests against England, is that the interest is being converted to bums on seats and is driving record viewership numbers.</p>
