            <p>Former New Zealand cricketer Grant Bradburn has been sacked as coach of English county side Glamorgan following a recent charge of misconduct by the independent cricket regulator.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Glamorgan said the club referred Bradburn to the independent body after "receiving allegations of inappropriate behaviour and we are confident that a fair and transparent process has been followed in this case".</p>
        
            <p>Glamorgan Cricket had a zero-tolerance policy towards discriminatory behaviour of any kind, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having completed our own internal investigation, it became clear that Mr Bradburn's position was untenable, and the club is now providing the appropriate support to those affected."</p>
        
            <p>Glamorgan Cricket chair Mark Rhydderch-Roberts said the club put the wellbeing of people first. It was providing support for those affected, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're incredibly proud of our track record in terms of making sure that everyone who is involved with the club feel they are respected, belong and are treated fairly."</p>
        
            <p>Bradburn, 58, played seven tests and 11 ODIs for New Zealand between 1990 and 2001.</p>
        
            <p>He started his coaching career with Northern Districts and was Scotland's head coach between 2014 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>The former off-spinner then became Pakistan's fielding coach, before signing a two-year deal as head coach in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>However, Bradburn left the role later that year after Pakistan missed out on the World Cup semi-finals.</p>
