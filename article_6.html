            <p>All Blacks v Italy</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 9.10am Sunday 24 November</p>
        
            <p>Allianz Stadium, Turin</p>

            <p>As if the challenge facing Italy wasn't hard enough this weekend, Scott Robertson has resisted the urge to rotate his players and has instead named almost his strongest side possible.</p>
        
            <p>Defying predictions that the wider All Blacks squad members would get a run, almost all of the changes that have been made to last weekend's starting side that narrowly lost to France are due to injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Ethan de Groot finally gets a reprieve from his off-field indiscretion that saw him leapfrogged by Tamaiti Williams for the England, Ireland and France tests - but presumably because Williams has been ruled out with a neck injury. Patrick Tuipulotu is the only straight change, starting at lock while Tupou Vaa'i moves to the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Cane comes back to start at openside after missing last weekend's match, which means Ardie Savea and Wallace Sititi go back to number eight and blindside respectively. It will be Cane's 105th and final test for the All Blacks before he takes up a contract in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Samipeni Finau has been ruled out after suffering a concussion last weekend, so Peter Lakai is loose forward cover once again.</p>

            <p>The rest of the pack sees Codie Taylor start at hooker and Tyrel Lomax at tighthead, with Asafo Aumua, Ofa Tu'ungafasi and Fletcher Newell on the bench. Newell replaces Pasilio Tosi, who has played the last three tests.</p>
        
            <p>Cam Roigard holds onto the starting halfback spot, however, there has been a change on the bench with TJ Perenara coming in to play his last test for the All Blacks as well. It is somewhat fitting that Perenara will end his test career coming off the bench - 61 of his 89 caps have been as a replacement.</p>

            <p>Anton Lienert-Brown comes in for the injured Jordie Barrett at second five, while Mark Tele'a returns to replace Sevu Reece on the right wing. Other than that the backline is unchanged, Beauden Barrett at first five, Rieko Ioane at centre, Caleb Clarke on the wing and Will Jordan at fullback.</p>
        
            <p>David Havili comes onto the bench for his first appearance since the easy win over Japan, while Damian McKenzie has been given the 23 jersey again.</p>
        
            <p>This will be the first time the All Blacks have played in Turin, with this also being the first ever rugby test at Juventus football club's 42,000-seat Allianz Stadium.</p>
