            <p>Warriors prop Addin Fonua-Blake will return to Australia for 2025 NRL season after securing a move to the Cronulla Sutherland Sharks.</p>
        
            <p>It was confirmed early last month that Fonua-Blake had requested a release on compassionate grounds from the last three years of his contract but agreement was subsequently reached for him to remain with the Warriors for the 2024 season.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors ceo Cameron George said the club had been in discussions with the Sharks and a deal had been reached for Fonua-Blake to join the Sharks from 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"The arrangement excludes a player swap but we will continue to consider our options," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Dally M Prop of the Year was a key part of the Warriors' run to the NRL preliminary finals this year but the 27-year-old was looking to move back to Sydney to be closer to his parents.</p>
        
            <p>Fonua-Blake joined the Warriors in 2021 from the Manly Sea Eagles where he debuted in 2016.</p>
