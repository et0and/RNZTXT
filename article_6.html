        <p>
The All Blacks are not "throwing out the bathwater" after their loss to the Pumas.

            <p>The All Blacks are looking to put their shock loss to the Pumas behind them as quickly as possible as they seek the comfort of Eden Park in the return test this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are back to the old fortress on Saturday where they are unbeaten for 49 matches.</p>
        
            <p>Lock Sam Darry, who scored a dazzling try in his debut, said they were not at panic stations just yet and supporters would not see a radical shift in the game plan.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really clear with how we wanted to play, it's not throwing the baby out with the bath water. We still know what works for us and want to stick to that. There's just a few things within that we want to tweak and do better."</p>
        
            <p>He said it had been a few days of deep self-reflection for the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's on everyone, everyone needs to have a look in the mirror, have a look at their prep, how they turned up for the game and how we can do better."</p>
        
            <p>Putting their unbeaten streak on the line, Darry said they were prepared for another passionate Pumas performance.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really excited about the opportunity at Eden Park, against a quality Argentinian team, it's a great test for us to go and see what we're made of."</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks have addressed some of the errors which ultimately cost them the game in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>A pair of inexplicably poor passes sent the All Blacks backpedalling 50 metres and they were forced to grass it over their own line, leading to the match winning try.</p>
        
            <p>"As you saw the ball bounces one way, you're not there and it's a try at the other end so constantly making sure we are always switched on, always focused and staying in the moment," Darry said.</p>

            <p>However, Will Jordan, who returned from the bench in Saturday's loss after a long injury layoff, said they were not blaming the single moment of madness as the cause of the loss.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a whole bunch of things that go into 80 minutes that lead into a result, not so much around one moment. I think just stacking moments is key, so if you make a mistake, then the ability to back that up with a change of momentum and relieve the pressure which is something we struggled with a bit. So finding a way to counter that."</p>
        
            <p>Making his return on the right wing, Jordan said the number on his back did not matter too much and he was just happy being back in black.</p>
        
            <p>"I am happy to flit between the two, aware that I have been out a lot of the year and haven't got a lot of footy under my belt."</p>
        
            <p>Jordan returned to the test arena after a pre-season match with Tasman having sat out the entire Super Rugby season.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming back in, I'm just trying to grow the combinations with the guys around me, get my timing, I have been splitting myself between the two. We will see what happens this week, but I am just trying to be comfortable in both roles, and no matter what position I am in, trying to have a big influence on the group, with my words and with my actions."</p>
