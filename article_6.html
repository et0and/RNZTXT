            <p>The England women's cricket team's tour of Aotearoa has one game remaining, but a 56-run win in the second ODI on Thursday cemented the visitors' dominance over the White Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>Having already won the T20 series, England have now also sealed the one-day series with a game to play.</p>
        
            <p>The odds were stacked against an understrength White Ferns side, who were missing captain Sophie Devine as she continued to recover from a leg injury picked up earlier in the series, coupled with the late withdrawal of bowler Rosemary Mair with a back injury on the morning of the match.</p>
        
            <p>England chose to bat first at Seddon Park and set the White Ferns a total of 253 to chase, which was the largest total New Zealand has had to chase in a couple of seasons.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand dismissed England for the first time this tour when they were all out in the 49th over, but the damage had already been done.</p>
        
            <p>England opener Tammy Beaumont generally has success when she plays against the White Ferns and it was no different in Hamilton as she brought up her 19th ODI 50 - and her 8th against New Zealand - before getting out for 81 in the 34th over.</p>
        
            <p>Beaumont held her ground while losing four batting partners, including Maia Bouchier (20) and Heather Knight (37), before playing a lofted shot off Hannah Rowe which was caught with ease by Georgia Plimmer.</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper Amy Jones was the next best with the bat for the visitors as she hit seven boundaries before she fell just short of a half century when Lea Tahuhu had her caught by Brooke Halliday for 48 in the 48th over.</p>
        
            <p>Pace and spin got wickets for New Zealand as all six bowlers used took a scalp. Spinner Fran Jonas took 2-47 from her 10 overs and medium pacer Jess Kerr had 2-50 from her full complement of overs while Lea Tahuhu took 2-50 from 8 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Stand-in captain Amelia Kerr's spin got 1-35, making her the most miserly of the New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's chase started strongly with Suzie Bates scoring 10 runs off the first over, but she would be out for 28 as the second wicket to fall.</p>
        
            <p>While New Zealand's top order struggled and lower order could not guide the side to victory, a 100-run fifth wicket partnership between Brooke Halliday and Izzy Gaze gave the hosts hope.</p>
        
            <p>Gaze was run out for 47 in the 40th over. It was her highest ODI score, bettering her previous top score of 26.</p>
        
            <p>Halliday followed three overs later for 57 after she was stumped. The Auckland representative has now scored three of her four 50s against England.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns' run-rate was ahead of England's until around the 10th over when it dipped and New Zealand never caught up.</p>
        
            <p>Medium pacer Nat Sciver-Brunt took 3-21 from her 7 overs to be England's best with the ball.</p>
        
            <p>The final match of the ODI series is in Hamilton on Sunday.</p>
