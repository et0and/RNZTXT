            <p>Her resignation comes after she missed the side's Paris Olympics campaign in the wake of an investigation into an employment matter in May.</p>
        
            <p>She also missed games against Japan in the lead up to the Olympics due to the employment investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Klimková, 39, was at the helm of the side for the past three years but was contracted for six years through until the 2027 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>She oversaw the first ever win for a New Zealand national team at a senior FIFA tournament with the 1-nil win over Norway at Eden Park in the opening game of last years World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement New Zealand Football CEO Andrew Pragnell said Klimkova played a major role in bringing through a new generation of players but there was no mention of the employment investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the Olympics Pragnell wrote to the players after the investigation, inviting both players and team management to be part of a "restorative process" to "build or rebuild constructive relationships".</p>
        
            <p>In the statement Pragnell said Klimokva "will forever be remembered as the coach who led us to our first ever FIFA Women's World Cup win, a historic, game-changing moment for football in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>There was no mention of the employment investigation with Klimkova saying she "very much enjoyed working with the players, the coaches, the support staff."</p>
        
            <p>"This experience was a challenge and made me stronger. I believe now is the right time to step away and let another coach carry on."</p>
        
            <p>Klimková will remain working for New Zealand Football for the next six months, supporting the high performance department and national team activity.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Mayne, who led the team in the June international window and in Paris, will continue as interim head coach.</p>
