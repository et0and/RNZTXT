        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific: So close, yet so far for Moana Pasifika</h2>
        <p>
WATCH: It's too early to say the side has completely turned a corner, because the results need to start coming - but this is a good sign, writes Jamie Wall.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - When you're in the position Moana Pasifika is, you take the wins wherever you can. OK, so they didn't get the ultimate one they wanted, but Tana Umaga's side at least showed that they had the resilience to claw themselves out of a hole, adapt on the fly and, probably most importantly, draw a crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-29 loss to the Highlanders on a beautiful Friday evening at North Harbour Stadium was an effort that ultimately fell short of the corner-turning moment that many have hoped Moana would have in 2025. It was still very much a loss, a frustrating one and means they're still winless in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't get away from the fact that we've lost three in a row," Umaga said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we can't dwell on it. If we can address the issues that we've got, we've got the heart, we've got the capability to do it. It's about stacking moments together - instead of doing something really well and then letting them straight back in."</p>

            <p>The most glaring issue was the way Moana started, leaking an admittedly very slick try to Highlanders halfback Nathan Hastie after only a couple of minutes. From there Umaga's side actually dominated possession and territory in the first half, only to have the score blown out by a 95 metre intercept try by Caleb Tangitau, and a couple of costly turnovers that saw Tanielu Tele'a and Mitch Dunshea score.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't start well … we weren't clinical enough to finish. It's a hard pill to swallow,' said Savea said.</p>
        
            <p>But even in that there's positives. Savea's second half solo try that sparked the side's comeback, efforts off the bench like Patrick Pellegrini's shift at first five added a lot of value and a friendly penalty count are the things that can be built on.</p>

            <p>While Savea and Umaga rightfully talked about what they'd done right on the field, they were clearly annoyed at the result and harboured a desire to rectify it next weekend. Their biggest issue, defence, was there for all to see in the first half but miraculously healed in the second to completely shut down the Highlanders. Despite some serious reservations about the team moving to North Harbour Stadium, it seems to have worked as the 7,000-strong crowd was easily the biggest one Moana have ever drawn for a home game.</p>
        
            <p>But most galling of all will be the fact that had it not been for a couple of missed conversions, Moana would've won.</p>
        
            <p>"At this level, when you make those kind of errors with the capabilities of the players that other teams have, they just capitalise on it. We made a lot of errors in that first 20 minutes that gave them opportunities to get points on us. It's only us that can cure what's happening," said Umaga.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, it's never easy to get a read on Highlanders coach Jamie Joseph, but his gruff demeanour was fairly predictable given that he'd just watched his side take even the tiniest chances presented to them in the first half, only to be completely shut out in the second.</p>

            <p>"We got out of jail, but we'll take the win," was his blunt assessment, although he fairly pointed out that losing replacement first five Cam Millar in the second half with a concussion didn't help.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically the person we had to control the game, we didn't have. So then we had to make some stuff along the way. That's unsettling…the players try too hard and give penalties away."</p>
        
            <p>Of course, it didn't take long for Savea to be asked about Moana's next fixture. He face off against his old side the Hurricanes back at North Harbour Stadium next Saturday, in front of what will hopefully be an even bigger crowd than the one they drew last night. Savea joked that he'd "have a target on his head", but for Umaga there might be a more serious issue around the fact that his skipper has been on the park for the entirety of their three games so far.</p>
        
            <p>Put simply, Savea was the best player in the Moana effort last night by a long way. He can't be relied upon to put in Herculean efforts every week, not because he doesn't have the will and ability to do so, but because Scott Robertson and his staff can't risk Savea's body being put through that for another 13 weeks.</p>
