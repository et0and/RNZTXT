            <p>Crusaders captain Scott Barrett has been scratched from tonight's southern derby with the Highlanders in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The 69-test All Black lock will miss the game as a precautionary measure due to a back issue.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett only lasted 13 minutes of last weekend's loss to the Reds in Christchurch, before withdrawing because of back spasms.</p>
        
            <p>Jamie Hannah moves off the Crusaders bench to take Barrett's place in the second row, while Antonio Shalfoon comes onto the bench for a potential Super Rugby Pacific debut.</p>
        
            <p>Codie Taylor and Tamaiti Williams make much-needed returns for the defending champions, with both All Blacks rushed straight back into the starting line-up after Taylor took a well-deserved break and Williams was injured in the first match of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett's absence is a big blow for the struggling Crusaders, who currently sit 10th on the Super Rugby Pacific ladder. They have not lost in Dunedin since 2018 - but if they can't get a result tonight, they will enter must-win territory in their remaining regular season fixtures.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders come in off tough wins over the Force and Moana Pasifika to end a six-match losing run.</p>
