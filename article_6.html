            <p>South Africa meet Argentina for the Rugby Championship crown at the Mbombela Stadium on Sunday morning where a point for the world champions will see them take the title against their fired-up visitors who are seeking a first trophy win.</p>
        
            <p>The showdown is in Nelspruit on the edge of the Kruger National Park where antelope fear big cats.</p>
        
            <p>But for the visit of Argentina's Pumas, it is the Springboks who will expect to win the battle in the bush despite their 29-28 loss in Santiago del Estero last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa have recalled several rested regulars and are unlikely to repeat their errors with a more experienced side.</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks need either a point or must deny Argentina five from the game to be crowned Rugby Championship winners for the first time since 2019 and clinch a fifth title overall.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Rassie Erasmus has selected Manie Libbok to start at first-five despite a costly missed kick in front of the poles in the dying minutes of last week's loss and several other displays when his percentage from the tee under pressure has been poor.</p>
        
            <p>Erasmus values Libbok for his creativity with ball in hand and is keen to stick with him as the Springboks expand their style, perhaps relying on scrumhalf Jaden Hendrikse or wing Cheslin Kolbe to assist with the kicking duties.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm comfortable kicking for goals," Kolbe told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been working on it throughout the season, and the kickers and [attack coach] Tony [Brown] have been giving me tips.</p>
        
            <p>"We have played in a few finals, but one can never bank on what happened in the past. This is going to be a big game against a determined team.</p>
        
            <p>"Argentina are a phenomenal side and have many players with an X-factor, while many of them come from a Sevens rugby background. Some of the guys who played last week gave me advice, so I know what to expect."</p>
        
            <p>Argentina flanker Juan Martin Gonzalez will also not be relying on the past and last weekend's victory likely has no bearing on Saturday, not least because Argentina have made eight changes for this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a good game, but we want to be consistent in our performances," Gonzalez told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course we want to win every single game, but what we are looking to do is play good rugby. Sometimes we are doing that, other times not.</p>
        
            <p>"If we win, we win, if we lose, so be it. But we have been training very well. We are thinking about just this moment and not what might happen after the game with the Rugby Championship."</p>
        
            <p>Lock Eben Etzebeth is set to become the most capped Springbok player in history by earning his 128th cap, which would move him past Victor Matfield to top the list.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina had a well-deserved reputation for indiscipline on the rugby field that often cost them dearly in test encounters, but this year they have turned that on its head in the Rugby Championship.</p>

            <p>In the past, the Pumas could often be relied upon to concede needless penalties through reckless play and hand opponents the chance to score easy points.</p>
        
            <p>Yet this year they are the only team yet to receive a red or yellow card in the annual southern hemisphere championship and have conceded the fewest penalties (50) of any team in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Felipe Contepomi said the turnaround was not because of any concerted effort to clean up their play but as a result of polishing their approach to matches.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't speak directly ... about discipline, but we want to be the best team we can play and maybe it's the end result of trying to insist on doing the right things," he told a press conference ahead of Sunday's test.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't take any shortcuts in training, and we keep hammering on our method and the way we want to play, working hard, especially in defence.</p>
        
            <p>"And, you know, we just don't cheat. I know it's part of our values, it's part of our behaviour, and we pride ourselves on that and the result is maybe giving away less penalties and not picking up cards.</p>
        
            <p>"But the real thing is not focusing on avoiding cards but rather doing the right thing and working hard."</p>
        
            <p>Argentina have not had a player sent from the field, either to the sin-bin or red carded, in their last 12 test matches.</p>
        
            <p>"Our philosophy is to trust in your teammates and in the system, and then work as a group, all together."</p>
        
            <p>Argentina have a remote chance of winning the Rugby Championship, needing a runaway victory against the Springboks at the Mbombela Stadium to lift the trophy for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>But with home wins over South Africa and Australia and an away victory over New Zealand, they have produced their best results in the competition since joining in 2012.</p>
