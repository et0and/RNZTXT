            <p>Queenstown skier Alice Robinson has finished her World Cup Giant Slalom season with a second place finish in Saalbach, Austria.</p>
        
            <p>She finished fourth overall.</p>
        
            <p>"I am really happy to end the season with another podium, I think this year I may not have got a win but I feel like the consistency in my skiing has been the best it's ever been so I am really happy with that," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>The result marks her fifth World Cup podium this season and the 10th of her career.</p>
        
            <p>With only the top giant slalom athletes qualifying to compete at the World Cup finals, it was always going to be a tightly-fought race.</p>
        
            <p>It started well for Robinson who had a start position of bib two.</p>
        
            <p>With warm spring temperatures in the forecast, it was certainly an advantage for the athletes who had a lower bib number as it meant they got to ski the first run while the course was still firm and rut-free.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson was quick off the mark, with the green light through the first section of the course. She continued to keep her foot on the gas and maintained her speed throughout her entire first run.</p>
        
            <p>After run one Robinson was sitting in third, +0.85 seconds behind leader Federica Brignone of Italy.</p>
        
            <p>Going into run two, Robinson was fast out the start gate, making quick work of the top three sections. As she came over the breakaway into the final pitch of the race, it was clear just how hard she was working to maintain her form down the increasingly rough course.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said, "Today was definitely tough, I find these conditions quite challenging with the softer, peeling snow, but this year I have made a lot of progress getting better on different conditions. It was hot and I was feeling pretty tired but I wanted to give the last GS run of the year a good crack!"</p>
        
            <p>Robinson had done enough to claim the top spot and with just two athletes left to go she knew she had secured a medal, with just the colour yet to be determined.</p>
        
            <p>Thea Louise Stjernesund (NOR) was no match for Robinson's pace but run one leader Brignone (ITA) put down an exceptional run to take the win by -1.36 seconds. Stjernesund rounded out the podium in third with her career second World Cup podium.</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland's Lara Gut-Behrami finished off an exceptional season by securing the 2024 Giant Slalom Crystal Globe for the first time in her decorated career.</p>
        
            <p>Saalbach is the venue for the 2025 FIS Alpine Ski World Championships, so a podium finish for Robinson today certainly bodes well for next season.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson will be in action for the final time this Northern Hemisphere season at the Saalbach speed races next weekend.</p>
