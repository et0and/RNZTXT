            <p>Rugby coach Leon MacDonald is back in business after leaving the All Blacks last year.</p>
        
            <p>Former All Blacks assistant McDonald has joined the Western Force in Perth as the Club's coaching consultant.</p>
        
            <p>It marks his return to Super Rugby after leaving the Blues at the end of the 2023 season to join the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>In August 2024 MacDonald quit Scott Robertson's All Black coaching lineup after a falling out over tactics with the head coach.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald, who will begin in his new role at the Force later this week, was in charge of the Blues for five years including leading the side to the 2022 Super Rugby Pacific grand final.</p>
        
            <p>A Western Force statement said MacDonald will work with Force CEO Niamh O'Connor to build the club to be a world class coaching hub and will also assist the current coaches across all programs.</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor said: "Leon's appointment is part of our three-stage plan and vision to make the Western Force the best club in the world as a player, as a coach, as a high performance staff member and as an administrator.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald said he was thrilled to take on the Force project and the opportunity to work with the Club's coaches to make the Club leaders in Australian rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited about taking on this position," MacDonald said. "It's a different role to that I'm accustomed to but I'm excited by that challenge and looking forward to supporting the coaches.</p>
        
            <p>"What stood out about this project is the Western Force are very aspirational as a rugby club, currently boasting nine Wallabies and eight Wallaroos.</p>
        
            <p>"The Club is determined to become a real force in the Super Rugby competition and their energy and enthusiasm really caught me. Of course, they are also based in a beautiful part of the world, so I'm looking forward to the move.</p>
        
            <p>"There's plenty of optimism and excitement building around Australia rugby again. I was excited to be a part of this resurgence."</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald will join a number of New Zealanders at the Western Force including Tom Donnelly and Jeremy Thrush.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald, who arrived in Perth on Tuesday, has signed on for the 2025 Super Rugby season.</p>
