        <h2>NRL: Capewell, Afoa named for Warriors clash with Knights</h2>
        <p>
Injured duo to bolster line up as the 12th-placed Warriors head to Newcastle.
</p>
        
            <p>Second rower Kurt Capewell and prop Bunty Afoa have been named to return for the Warriors' ninth-round NRL clash against the Knights at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It's an earlier than expected return for Afoa, who missed the last three fixtures against Sea Eagles, Dragons and Titan after leaving the field with a hamstring injury 25 minutes into the fifth-round win over the Rabbitohs on April 6. It was originally projected to be at least a six-week stint on the sideline for the middle forward, who slots back onto the interchange rotation alongside Tom Ale and Jacob Laban.</p>
        
            <p>Capewell sat out the Anzac Day loss to the Titans with a throat injury but will return as a starting second rower alongside Jackson Ford. Zyon Maiu'u drops to the reserves.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the side is unchanged from the Titans game, with Roger Tuivasa-Sheck saying that this weekend's match against the Knights was "all about building confidence back".</p>
        
            <p>"We started off in preseason when everything was going rightâ€¦but now it's one of those moments when you can start to get down on confidence, not believing in us," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's massive that we trust the system, trust in Webby (coach Andrew Webster), trust in what we're doing. It's about sticking together and just getting out there and just staying in a moment and doing a job."</p>
        
            <p>The Knights only sit one place below the Warriors in 13th place on the NRL ladder and are coming off a tough 18-14 win over the Dolphins last weekend. The result was a serious morale boost after an injury to Kalyn Ponga will see the star fullback out of action for at least three months.</p>
