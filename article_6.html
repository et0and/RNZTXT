            <p>The Wellington Phoenix women's side has suffered a 1-nil loss to defending champions Sydney FC in their A League encounter in Sydney on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney had the better of the first half with 19 shots on goal, but the two sides went to the break locked at 0-0.</p>
        
            <p>New Sydney signing MacKenzie Hawkesby had the best opportunity of the first half but her shot was cleared off the line by Phoenix defender Michaela Foster clearing the ball off the line.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix came out in the second half with more resolve and created several goal scoring chances.</p>
        
            <p>However it was Sydney who struck first with teenager Jynaya Dos Santos coming off the bench to score the match-winner with a strong header in the 78th minuted to give the home side the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington striker Mariana Speckmaier had a gilt edged opportunity to level the scores but her header from close range went over the top of the goal.</p>
        
            <p>The result continues the Phoenix struggles on the road away from home and leaves them third on the competition ladder although they could drop to fourth if Melbourne Victory beat Western Sydney over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix next game is away to Brisbane Roar on Sunday week - a side they beat 2-1 earlier in the competition.</p>
