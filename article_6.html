        <p>
AUT sport and recreation professor Dr Mark Orams said the large crowds that turned out showed the growing popularity of sailing.

            <p>A sailing expert wants SailGP to become a long-term fixture in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The two-day event at at WaitematƒÅ Harbour this past weekend was the third year of New Zealand's four-year SailGP regatta hosting commitment.</p>
        
            <p>AUT sport and recreation professor Dr Mark Orams said the large crowds that turned out showed the growing popularity of sailing.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm positive about the future. This weekend has shown Auckland can host an amazing on-water event and leverage all the benefits from that."</p>
        
            <p>"If it becomes a regular fixture that everybody knows about in advance and can plan for, people overseas can travel down to Auckland for a New Zealand summer and piggyback off tours around the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Superyachts will come down to do their refit and watch the event, and they'll do the Millennium Cup and go over the Tasman and watch the Sydney event.</p>
        
            <p>He said while Sir Russell Coutts had expressed enthusiasm about keeping SailGP in the city long-term, it would come down to whether it was financially worthwhile for the competition.</p>
