            <p>Auckland will once again host New Zealand's Sail GP regatta in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch stepped in to host the event for a second time earlier this year after Auckland pulled out of hosting duties in November.</p>
        
            <p>But organisers of the international sailing competition pulled the event from Lyttelton after this year's racing was marred in controversy when the first day of racing had to be cancelled due to dolphins on the course.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland event will take place on 18 and 19 January, 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven teams from around the world will compete across fourteen events for the largest cash prize in the competition's history.</p>
