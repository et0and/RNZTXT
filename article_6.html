            <p>The Wellington Phoenix's mid-season A-League slump has continued, with a 2-1 defeat at home to Adelaide United.</p>
        
            <p>The loss is the fifth in the team's last six games, and again was highlighted by errors which led to goals for their opposition.</p>
        
            <p>The first was in the seventh minute, when a tidy right wing attack by Adelaide's Zach Clough saw his cross deflected into the net by Phoenix midfielder Matt Sheridan for an own goal.</p>
        
            <p>It could have been two nil 20 minutes later, had it not been for a fantastic save from Phoenix goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi, after another Clough shot.</p>
        
            <p>Things turned much brighter though for the Phoenix just after half-time, when they equalised in the 50th minute.</p>
        
            <p>A solidly struck corner from Hideki Ishige was headed home by Corban Piper, his first goal for the Phoenix.</p>

            <p>But all that good work was undone in the 75th minute, when Oluwayemi spilled a routine catch in the six yard box.</p>
        
            <p>The ball fell right onto the foot of Adelaide striker Luka Jovanović, who tapped it home to give the visitors the lead for the second time.</p>
        
            <p>They were to hold that lead until the end, to secure the three points, with the result disappointing Phoenix captain Scott Wootton.</p>
        
            <p>"Massive disappointment any time you lose," he said on Sky Sport. "But did we really deserve to win today? I'm not so sure.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we created too much, and I feel like it's been a bit of a reflection of the story of our season, making too many mistakes for goals.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't give yourself a chance to win games if you make the mistakes we've made so far this season, and we need to eradicate it pretty quick."</p>
        
            <p>The loss means the Phoenix stay in 10th place in the 13 team league, with Adelaide moving to the top of the table, one point ahead of Auckland FC, who play later tonight against Perth Glory.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix's next A-League match is again in Wellington, in four days, against Sydney FC.</p>
