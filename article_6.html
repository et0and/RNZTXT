            <p>The Mystics overcame a major mental block after beating the Stars 56-51 in Auckland on Monday night without Silver Fern shooter Grace Nweke.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics strike shooter went down with an injury in the final quarter of their Round three game, which they lost against the Tactix.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics then lost to the Pulse last week after a major second half capitulation.</p>
        
            <p>A strained patella tendon in her right knee means Nweke won't be available for the Mystics for another three to five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022 the Mystics were on top of the ANZ Premiership ladder before Nweke rolled her ankle and the side lost four straight games without her.</p>
        
            <p>The defending champions would have been desperate to prove they can win without Nweke and shooters Hannah Glen and Filda Vui stepped up to the plate.</p>
        
            <p>Glen put up 31 goals at 91 percent accuracy and Vui was just as accurate.</p>
        
            <p>They were well supported by their vastly experienced midcourt of Peta Toeava and Tayla Earle.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics, who sit third on the ladder, will hope they get enough wins that they will still be in a good position on the table before they get their linchpin back.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars still haven't registered a win after five rounds of ANZ Premiership netball but have picked up four bonus points and are playing well in large parts of games.</p>
        
            <p>Stars' defender Kate Burley was at her tenacious best, picking up six intercepts.</p>

            <p>The Pulse-Tactix game on Sunday was a fascinating battle between the sides with the two best defensive records so far in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Before going into the match, the Pulse were conceding just 47 goals per match and the Tactix 50.</p>
        
            <p>Both defensive ends strangled their opponents attacking ends resulting in the equal lowest combined half-time score in the history of the ANZ Premiership and Championship competitions.</p>
        
            <p>But the Pulse were eventually able to break free from the shackles to a degree, thanks to the creativity of shooter Khiarna Williams and breakneck speed of wing attack Whitney Souness, to prevail 36-30 and go to the top of the ladder.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse are now the only unbeaten side in the competition and the fact they managed to beat the Tactix without Silver Ferns Maddy Gordon and Tiana Metuarau, who are both injured, will please new coach Anna Andrews-Tasola.</p>
        
            <p>It was a masterclass defensive effort by Silver Fern goal keeper Kelly Jackson and up and comer Parris Mason, with pressure applied up front by wing defence Fa'amu Ioane and centre Claire Kersten.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson leads the defensive stats in rebounds and deflections, and is second only to the Magic's Georgia Takarangi for intercepts.</p>
        
            <p>For the Tactix, Silver Ferns defenders Jane Watson and Karin Burger were also brilliant.</p>

            <p>After snapping their 21 match record losing run in round four, the Steel weren't able to follow that up with another win on the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Magic beat the Steel 54-45 after a strong second half in Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Ameliaranne Ekenasio and powerful young shooter Saviour Tui have been polishing their combination with each game and are one of the most dynamic duos in the league.</p>
        
            <p>Tui's move to the Magic was a smart one, as she gets to learn from Ekenasio - the best goal attack in the country and Silver Ferns captain.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up in Wellington, Tui started her career in the National Netball League with the Central Manawa before moving to Auckland where she spent two seasons with the Mystics.</p>
        
            <p>Tui then moved to the Steel for two years where she continued to blossom with more court time.</p>
        
            <p>Tui will be keen to stick with the Magic while Ekenasio is there.</p>
