            <p>Whether it's with words or punches, the unashamedly authentic Mea 'NightMea' Motu leaves an impression wherever she goes.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi bantamweight's bubbly yet brash personality has endeared her to the boxing world, and she is just as adept at throwing punches on the mic as she does in the ring.</p>
        
            <p>However, she can also be poignant and inspirational, courageously opening up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of a former partner.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of her historic world title unification fight with Britain's Ellie Scotney, RNZ looks back at the NightMea's ten most memorable moments on the mic.</p>
        
            <p>1. "I'm rough, rugged and hori, good luck taking this belt from me!" </p>
        
            <p>- Motu fresh off her IBO Bantamweight title win over Tania Walters in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>2. "I'm coming Eli Scott, you better watch it, you ain't seen this Māori girl. I'm coming to collect all those damn belts!"</p>
        
            <p>- Motu sends a stark warning to her British opponent.</p>
        
            <p>3. "I always had to run it straight at the bigger kids. I had to run it hard and I became aggressive."</p>
        
            <p>- Motu on her childhood bullrush days.</p>
        
            <p>4. "Once I hit those ropes, walk through the ring, that's home, and you ain't taking my tūpuna whenua from me." </p>
        
            <p>- Motu says she feels a sense of calm when boxing.</p>
        
            <p>5. "The only thing that kept me alive was these kids. I so wanted to give up. Every time I hit the concrete floor, I'd be like, 'I wish I could stay here and he just beats me to death and I don't have to ever wake up.' But then there's that little inch of me that was like, 'Who's going to look after my kids?'"</p>
        
            <p>- Motu speaks about escaping a horrific life of domestic abuse.</p>

            <p>6. "I already felt like I won because I had let everyone know who I am." </p>
        
            <p>- Motu said following her title win she didn't need a title in order to feel like a champion.</p>
        
            <p>7. "I look at it now and it's like, 'Wow, I actually came out on the other side.' Seriously, if you were to ask me eight years ago, I thought I was digging my own grave."</p>
        
            <p>- Motu reflects on her past life in an abusive relationship.</p>
        
            <p>8. "I learnt punching wasn't for just hurting people. It was actually a sport, it was art."</p>
        
            <p>- Motu is not all aggression, but also highly technical in the ring.</p>
        
            <p>9. "I'm willing to do everything that I can do to bring back those belts, I'm willing to die."</p>
        
            <p>- Motu's game plan for her upcoming world bantamweight title unification bout.</p>
        
            <p>10. "A feed! Every time a feed. It better be a good feed. A big burger or something. You can't get kina over there so that's the sad thing. Damn. I would love kina."</p>
        
            <p>- Motu's plans to celebrate her world bantamweight title unification win.</p>
