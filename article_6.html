            <p>All Black coach Scott Robertson has confirmed that the benching of Damian McKenzie was part of their wider plans. He's opted for 131-test veteran Beauden Barrett in the number 10 jersey for this Saturday's second Bledisloe Cup clash against the Wallabies.</p>
        
            <p>"We were always planning to give Beauden a go, you have to," Robertson said at the team's base at the NZCIS today.</p>
        
            <p>"Damian has started every game until now and he's shown some good form but you have to give guys an opportunity to build depth in your team and it's a chance for Beauden to play outside TJ. They've a combination that has played a lot of games together, and they've played a lot of games together at the Cake Tin so it lines up nicely."</p>
        
            <p>TJ Perenara has also been given a start at halfback in what will be his final test on NZ soil, fittingly in his hometown of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"He's playing good footy," Robertson said of Perenara's selection.</p>
        
            <p>"When he's started he's been great, when he's come off the bench he's been good as well. You've got a great 9-10 combo."</p>

            <p>Perenara said that it was "very cool" that the last test of the year was in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"To have my family at the game, to be able to have them at the last game, that will be cool too."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson also addressed the main negative narrative of the season, the All Blacks' inability to score points at the back end of games. He said the main focus of the bench was to "focus on solutions".</p>
        
            <p>"We've looked at the accuracy and the discipline, the experience of the group coming on. You focus on what you need to do, what does it look like and how you action it."</p>
        
            <p>He's named Patrick Tuipulotu, which should help with the experience issue, however discipline is now officially a worry. The All Blacks have conceded six yellow cards this season and five of them have been in the last 20 minutes of test matches, so the evidence is strong that correlation is equalling causation.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously they are linked. When you give cards away you give away six points on averageâ€¦that's something that's a little bit of individual and a bit of group and we've got to be better than that. That's what we're focused on."</p>
        
            <p>As for the Wellington curse, that's seen the All Blacks fail to win a test there since 2018, Robertson said it was "really important" that they got a result this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something we've addressed, someone we're aware of. It's not something we're proud of. But you deal with records with performances."</p>
