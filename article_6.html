            <p>England women's football manager and Chelsea have condemned online abuse of female players Sam Kerr and Kristie Mewis since the couple announced this week they are expecting a baby.</p>
        
            <p>Australia captain and Chelsea striker Kerr gave the news on Instagram with the words "Mewis-Kerr baby coming 2025!" plus photos of herself and pregnant partner Mewis, an American who plays for West Ham United.</p>
        
            <p>Among support from well-wishers, the post also attracted some homophobic vitriol.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very, very disappointing," England manager Sarina Wiegman told a news conference on Tuesday. "I'm really happy for them, they look really happy and I hope it all goes well."</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea said in a statement to Reuters that they were aware of "unacceptable and hateful homophobic comments" on various social media platforms.</p>

The Instagram announcement was captioned "Mewis-Kerr baby coming 2025!"

            <p>"There is no place in society for any form of discrimination and we will not accept any abuse directed towards our players, staff or supporters," a club spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are extremely proud to be a diverse, inclusive club that celebrates and welcomes people from all cultures, communities and identities."</p>
        
            <p>West Ham shared what they called Kerr's "heartwarming" baby announcement on the team's website.</p>
        
            <p>"Mewis has announced the wonderful news that she is expecting her first child," the club said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone at West Ham United would like to congratulate Kristie and Sam on their fantastic news!"</p>
        
            <p>Kerr is considered one of the world's top female strikers, scoring 199 career goals across the Women's Super League, Australia's W-League and the National Women's Soccer League, plus 69 goals for her country. But she has been sidelined since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in January.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old averaged nearly 30 goals in her previous three seasons for Chelsea. The 33-year-old Mewis has been capped more than 50 times for the U.S.</p>
        
            <p>The couple were engaged in 2023.</p>
