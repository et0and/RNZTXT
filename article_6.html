        <h2>Teenage wood chopping champ still needs parents' permission</h2>
        <p>
One of the country's most promising wood chopping talents is so young he needs parental consent to use a chainsaw.

            <p>One of the country's most promising wood chopping talents is so young he needs parental consent to use a chainsaw.</p>
        
            <p>Hokitika 16-year-old Jack Matthews is the youngest competitor to qualify for the Under-25s' Rookie division at the Timbersports National Championships and being nearly 10 years younger than some of his competitors has raised a few health and safety issues for organisers.</p>
        
            <p>Being under 18 means parental permission has to be gained so Matthews can use a chainsaw in one of the five disciplines he'll be competing in when he competes in the Rural Games in Palmerston North on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Jack himself - mature beyond his years - sees the irony in the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite hardcase really - especially cos I've been using a chainsaw on our family lifestyle block in the West Coast since I was 13," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Plus cutting firewood with an axe has been my afterschool job since as long as I can remember.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess I can see why it had to happen, but I don't think a signature from dad's gonna make any difference to how I go."</p>
        
            <p>And young Jack Matthews goes alright.</p>
        
            <p>He's won his fair share of age-group 'chops' and made the NZ Under 21 team that beat Australia 3-nil in a series in Adelaide last year.</p>
        
            <p>He was the youngest in that competition too. No chainsaws needed.</p>
        
            <p>This won't be the first time Jack's used a chainsaw in competition, but it's not a regular discipline his age group competes in - hence the required paperwork.</p>
        
            <p>But wait there's more. As in, another Matthews.</p>

            <p>Jack's brother Scott (aged 18) has also qualified for his first Timbersports Nationals this week and will be competing alongside his younger sibling in the Rookies.</p>
        
            <p>The Matthews boys are well known for their wood-chopping feats in hometown Hokitika - Scott won the South Island Under 21 Champs in 2022 aged just 17.</p>
        
            <p>It's less than three years since the brothers got into the sport, which came about after they helped tidy up at a local wood-chopping event.</p>
        
            <p>Jack, a Year 12 Westland High School 1st XV member, is pretty confident his joy of rugby won't overtake his passion for woodchopping.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got pretty big goals to keep going as far as I can as an axe-man. I really love the sport."</p>
        
            <p>The whole family (mum, dad and sister) is coming up to Palmerston North for the weekend to cheer on the boys.</p>
        
            <p>That could be a good thing for Jack, because if he goes alright, he might just need his dad again to get him a celebratory drink.</p>
