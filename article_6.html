            <p>It may be the biggest fight of his career, but Andrei Mikhailovich says after the fight he has had in life, he is undaunted by 12 rounds against an undefeated world champion.</p>
        
            <p>Mikhailovich was born in Russia and adopted from an orphanage when he was 18 months old.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of disparity and economic issues, kids had to be given up and I was given up," he said at this week's press conference.</p>
        
            <p>Being brought across the world to New Zealand, Mikhailovich struggled with identity issues and turned to drugs and alcohol by the time he was 11.</p>
        
            <p>With his future looking bleak, Mikhailovich turned to boxing, and his story took a drastic turn.</p>
        
            <p>"I fought the fight of life."</p>
        
            <p>Now 21 fights into his professional career, Mikhailovich has a shot at history.</p>
        
            <p>He will meet IBF and WBO world champion Janibek Alimkhanuly for the unified middleweight world title in Las Vegas on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old said he held no fear of his opponent, despite the Kazak being a huge favourite.</p>
        
            <p>"It's another dude in front of me with two arms, two legs, a heart, a soul and a body, he looks scary, he has the eyes of a killer but this is just a fight at the end of the day."</p>

            <p>Mikhailovich embodied the brash fighter and easily outshone his opponent on the mic at Thursday's press conference, opening by remarking that Las Vegas felt like a second home.</p>
        
            <p>"I just blend right in, I'm not ugly, everyone is very pretty, I'm very pretty, so I just fit the mould."</p>
        
            <p>His antics might have made his coach Isaac Peach facepalm with embarrassment, but the American audience quickly gravitated to the Russian-born Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>"It's crazy, they love him over here because of all the crap he talks and how he presents himself when even I cringe. It's different here," Peach said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you do it at home, people are like, 'what a d--k!' But here they are encouraging it."</p>
        
            <p>Also undefeated, Alimkhanuly boasts a 15-0 record with 10 knockouts.</p>
        
            <p>"They're definitely underestimating us. That's the weakness. Andrei can knock this guy out and shock the world, 100 percent."</p>

            <p>Peach said preparations in camp had been perfect.</p>
        
            <p>"He's in the shape of his life and he's been great in sparring. We've just got to do the job now."</p>
        
            <p>Peach said Mikhailovich's path to victory was simple.</p>
        
            <p>"Patience. If he can let this guy make mistakes, we can be really violent on the back of that and take him to bits, We've got to do stuff perfectly, really execute our game plan perfectly, and if we do, we win the fight."</p>
