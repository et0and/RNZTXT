            <p>The Warriors have announced a massive signing, with news that triple-premiership winning prop James Fisher-Harris is set to join the club next season on a four year deal.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Harris has been released from the Penrith Panthers with one year to go on his contract.</p>
        
            <p>It has ended months of speculation about the Warriors' contingency plans in the middle of the park after Addin Fonua-Blake announced his desire to move back to Sydney. Fonua-Blake subsequently signed with the Sharks, so the addition of Fisher-Harris should be a seamless transition from one elite prop to another.</p>
        
            <p>The Kohukohu-born Fisher-Harris brings in a wealth of experience, having played 183-game NRL games. That total most notably includes the last four grand finals, three of which resulted in premierships for the Panthers.</p>

            <p>Fisher-Harris has also played 14 tests for the Kiwis, including captaining the side to a record 30-0 victory over the Kangaroos in Hamilton last year. He was named New Zealand Rugby League's player of the year in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>His addition to Andrew Webster's side is another sign that the Warriors are seen as a genuine premiership contender and attractive destination for elite level players, with Queensland representative Kurt Capewell a big acquisition in the last off season.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will get a close-up look at their new teammate when they face the Panthers at the NRL Magic Round in Brisbane on 19 May.</p>
