            <p>The Central Pulse withstood a Southern Steel onslaught to prevail 54-46 in their ANZ Premiership Netball match in Wellington - but star midcourter Maddie Gordon was a casualty in the victory.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns midcourter Gordon inspired the home side's third-quarter blitz as the Wellington side overcame a two-goal half-time deficit to wrestle back the advantage.</p>
        
            <p>In the third quarter, the Pulse outscored the Steel by nine goals thanks to a strong defensive effort.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington team were romping to a one-sided victory until Gordon landed on another player's foot early in the final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Fern was carried off court with an ankle injury and did not return.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse captain Kelly Jackson (nee Jury) also saw strike shooter Amelia Walmsley go down in the final seconds of the game.</p>
        
            <p>She told SkySport she was fairly confident there was no serious damage to either of her teammates.</p>
        
            <p>With Pulse frontline shooter Tiana Metuarau sidelined with a foot injury for several more rounds, coach Anna Andrews-Tasola will also be hoping for their rapid return.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Amelia has got cramp over there. Maddie, I think, just tweaked an ankle," Jackson told SkySport.</p>

            <p>"Defensively, we just needed to get more ball, which started happening in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"We were packing back [at the beginning], so attacking forward and getting the momentum [did] the trick."</p>
        
            <p>The inclusion of Steel vice-captain Shannon Saunders made a huge difference to the Southern side, Jackson said - but with a heavily strapped knee the former Silver Fern was unable to last the full match.</p>
        
            <p>Steel captain Kate Heffernan credited her shooters Georgia Heffernan and Grace Namana for giving the home side a scare.</p>
        
            <p>"It's super frustrating; I do think that we did it to ourselves," Kate Heffernan said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see it coming together so there is definitely belief growing."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse shooters Amelia Walmsley and Khiarna Williams were a force for the Steel defenders.</p>
        
            <p>Williams was again superb, coming into the game in the second quarter after Kiana Pelasio went to the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Walmsley was unhappy with the attention she was receiving from Steel keeper Taneisha Fifita.</p>
        
            <p>Fifita was warned for a challenge that flung the Pulse shooter flat on her back and whiplashed her neck.</p>
        
            <p>But the physical Steel defender escaped a send-off by the umpires in that incident.</p>
        
            <p>Kate Heffernan also received a warning from the umpire for a challenge on Pulse midcourter Whitney Souness.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Walmsley 44/51 (86%)</p>
        
            <p>Khiarna Williams 9/12 (75%)</p>
        
            <p>Kiana Pelasio 1/1 (100%)</p>
        
            <p>Steel</p>
        
            <p>Grace Namana 27/35 (77%)</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Heffernan 19/25 (76%)</p>
