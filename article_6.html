        <h2>It's hope that kills the Wellington Phoenix</h2>
        <p>
It's the hope that kills you, and everyone connected to the Wellington Phoenix discovered the truth behind this old adage the hard way, writes Mathew Nash.

            <p>It's the hope that kills you, and everyone connected to the Wellington Phoenix discovered the truth behind this old adage the hard way over the weekend. Hope was at a premium at the start of the campaign yet, as the season progressed, the bigger this unquantifiable feeling became. A lingering belief that the Phoenix might actually lift their first-ever trophy.</p>
        
            <p>This notion only grew when Oskar Zawada, in what transpired to be his final game for the club, scored with one of the final touches of regular time to send the Phoenix into an additional 30 minutes of their semi-final clash with Melbourne Victory. Surely, with that momentum and in front of that sell-out crowd at Sky Stadium, the Phoenix were destined to reach this weekend's Grand Final.</p>
        
            <p>But here's the thing about football, hope can only lead you so far.</p>

            <p>I speak from personal experience. Aged six, I watched Everton beat Manchester United in the 1995 FA Cup Final and assumed they were the best team in the world. That day, I became an Everton fan. Nearly three decades later, there have been no additions to that trophy cabinet. Being English I have also suffered as 17 major international tournaments have passed during my lifetime in which the England men's national team could have triumphed. Germany, Denmark, Brazil, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Argentina fans have rejoiced in that time, but the same cannot be said for England. I should know better. To not get carried away. But when Zawada hammered home that equaliser it felt inevitable. Surely, the Phoenix were going all the way?</p>
        
            <p>Enter the villain of the piece, Tony Popovic and his motley Melbourne Victory crew. They deserve full credit for the win, edging an incredibly close contest over 210 minutes of football to book a Grand Final clash with defending champions Central Coast Mariners - who beat Sydney FC in the other final four contest.</p>
        
            <p>Victory survived a farcical penalty decision, goalkeeper Paul Izzo producing yet another spot-kick save to add to his recent collection. They bounced back from Zawada's late leveller. They rode out the turbulence of Phoenix phenomenon Ben Old, whose stock only rose in a stellar performance. Rubbing extra salt in the wound was the role Jake Brimmer played in the Phoenix's demise. The Victory sub's composed assist for Adama Traore's opener was followed by a wicked corner-kick delivery which led to Chris Ikonomidis' winner to make it 2-1. If you believe the rumour mill, Brimmer is bound for the Phoenix's new rivals, Auckland FC, for their debut campaign next season. Talk about sticking the knife in early.</p>

            <p>But despite the disappointment, the Phoenix must take massive positives from this campaign. They have never come closer to silverware in their 17-year existence, and they managed to sell out Sky Stadium - a feat few would have seen coming at the start of the season. With the incoming rivalry with Auckland only adding to the intrigue surrounding football in New Zealand, it's a good time to be a Phoenix fan, even if on the whole, news stories surrounding the A-League are continually bleak.</p>
        
            <p>Most of all, there is that hope. Sure, it's what kills you in the end, but it's also the very thing that makes this beautiful game so worthwhile.</p>
        
            <p>In other football news:</p>
        
            <p>The Premier League concluded this weekend, with Manchester City securing a fourth title in succession with a 3-1 win over West Ham United. A truly deserved title win, holding off the impressive Arsenal, but what's with the pitch invasion? You'd think these fans would be used to winning by now. Some must remember the dark days before an oil-rich state took over and shot them to the top of football's hierarchy</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood capped off an impressive season with two goals as Nottingham Forest secured their Premier League survival with a 2-1 win over already relegated Burnley. The All Whites' striker's 14th and 15th goals of the season ensured Luton Town join his former club and Sheffield United back in the Championship next season</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea secured European football next year, beating Bournemouth 2-1 in a game which saw Moises Caicedo score from the halfway line. Although, the idea it might be a goal of the season candidate perhaps ignores the fact Bournemouth goalie Neto was in a different postcode to his goalmouth at the time</p>

            <p>It was a weekend of goodbyes. Jurgen Klopp gave a rousing farewell to the Liverpool faithful at Anfield while Roberto De Zerbi and David Moyes also waved goodbye to Brighton and West Ham respectively. Only time will tell if a certain Dutchman in Manchester will join the manager exodus</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Football must be kicking themselves, as they had a gem of a football coach in their system in former U-20 boss Des Buckingham. Despite player petitions, he was let go as part of a reshape in 2021 and this weekend guided his hometown club, Oxford United back to England's second tier for the first time in 25 years</p>
        
            <p>Finally, the region's OFC Champions League has been thrown into disarray by the collapse of Air Vanuatu and the civil unrest in New Caledonia. Auckland City have advanced from Group A but await confirmation of their semi-final opponents from a disrupted Group B.</p>
