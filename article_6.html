            <p>The Central Pulse fought back from an 11-goal half-time deficit to beat the Northern Mystics 52-47 and remain at the top of netball's ANZ Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>A superb second-half defensive effort from Pulse defenders Kelly Jackson and Parris Mason spearheaded the Wellington side's comeback for their fourth straight win of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, experienced former Silver Ferns midcourter Claire Kersten was impressive after being rushed into the side for injured Pulse midcourter Maddy Gordon.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse captain Kelly Jackson told SkySport a flat start hurt her side after they went to the first quarter break trailing 17-7.</p>
        
            <p>"Ideally, we'd like to start games better in that first quarter," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The second quarter wasn't too bad - we were starting to find our momentum - but we let loose in that second half and showed so much heart and courage.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll walk away very happy with that one."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said her athletic defensive partner Parris Mason was "incredible" as she contested for multiple intercepts and gains.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm speechless - that was an incredible effort from the girls in the second half."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse shooter Khiarna Williams had another influential performance after entering the game in the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>And midcourter Whitney Souness provided 23 goal assists for the match, as she controlled the tempo of the Pulse midcourt and found space to send the ball into Amelia Walmsley.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics were unable to hold on to their significant half-time advantage.</p>
        
            <p>That was largely built on a stunning shooting display from benchwarmer Hannah Glen, who came in to the starting seven after Mystics strike weapon Grace Nweke was sidelined with a knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>"When you lose your shooter, just like [for] any team, it is hard," Mystics captain Michaela Sokolich-Beatson said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm really proud of how Filda Vui and Hannah stood up tonight."</p>
        
            <p>"It's not an easy ask, but I felt like they did well."</p>
        
            <p>The final game of round 3 will see the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic host the Tactix in Hamilton on Monday evening.</p>
