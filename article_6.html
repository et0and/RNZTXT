        <h2>Speedy Veitch aims for elusive long jump record</h2>
        <p>
He hopes an impressive personal best over 100m can also see him break New Zealand's oldest national athletics record.

            <p>Long jumper Shay Veitch is again plotting the demise of New Zealand's longest-standing athletics record this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>After Peter Snell's 1962 record 800m time of 1:44:3 was eclipsed by Wellington's James Preston last year - the men's long jump became the country's oldest Olympic record.</p>
        
            <p>Before all-weather tracks became commonplace, Bob Thomas flew 8.05m off a grass run-up at Whangārei's Okara Park in 1968, a performance that has survived almost 60 years.</p>
        
            <p>That's too long for Veitch's liking, as he hopes to finally erase it from the books at the Sir Graeme Douglas International Meet in Auckland on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"That record is something else," marvelled the 24-year-old Veitch.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how he did that on grass - it would probably be comparable to about 8.30 nowadays.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be lovely to have that though."</p>
        
            <p>Veitch is also making up for lost time in other ways after his career was stalled by a motorcycle accident that left him worse for wear.</p>
        
            <p>After clearing 7.99m at the 2023 Waitākere event, signalling his readiness to claim the throne, he managed just 7.42m, as he lost his national title last season.</p>
        
            <p>"I've pretty much got two years of progress coming in," said Veitch.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't speak about this too much last season, because I'm not a man of excuses, but I pretty much got wiped off my motorbike by a car.</p>
        
            <p>"That season didn't go to plan, but things are tracking well now."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the Ariki speedster - now relocated from Dunedin to Cambridge - showed he is back to top form with a stunning 10.34s, a personal best over 100m, defeating a classy field at the Potts Classic in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>His previous best of 10.54s was set on the same day as his long jump best two years ago and this latest time legitimises the wind-assisted 10.34s he ran for the national sprint title in 2021 at the same venue.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the second time I've run 10.34 in Hastings, but this time I didn't a plus-three wind on my back," reflected Veitch.</p>
        
            <p>"Training's going well - I was thinking 10.2, my coach was saying 10.3, but he's always right.</p>
        
            <p>"That sort of speed tends to help."</p>
        
            <p>But raw speed is not the entire answer, and Veitch admits his challenge has always been controlling that velocity and converting it into power off the take-off board. That may provide the key to his record aspirations this summer.</p>
        
            <p>With the 100m scheduled before the jump, he intends to bypass the sprint this week to focus on that elusive 8m and a big piece of history beyond.</p>
