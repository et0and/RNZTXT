            <p>It's been another big year for our national game, so it's time to acknowledge and congratulate all the achievers of 2024. NZ Rugby's official ceremony is on Thursday and covers the usual sort of best player/team/whatever else, but for the third year running we've taken it on ourselves to celebrate all the awards they will miss.</p>
        
            <p>Here are the unofficial 2024 NZ Rugby awards:</p>

            <p>The Blues had a great season on social media as an organisation, which shouldn't be discounted as a part of their overall Super Rugby Pacific success. Perhaps their boundary pushing emboldened Ioane to have a highly successful pop at retired Irish first five Johnny Sexton on the eve of the All Blacks' end of year tour.</p>
        
            <p>However, the coup de grace was the unveiling of Ioane as the kaea of the haka in Dublin, a test the All Blacks won 23-13.</p>

            <p>OK, so it's a long way away from where it was, but things certainly felt a bit healthier this season - especially considering the biggest provincial rugby story last season was Hawke's Bay breaking the Ranfurly Shield in half.</p>
        
            <p>It helped that the NPC was a cracking competition, the now-repaired Shield went on an exciting journey and the season culminated with a memorable final that went to extra time. So what does that mean for the NPC going forward? That remains to be seen as NZ Rugby's financial model for it will most likely change next year.</p>
        
            <p>On behalf of Aotearoa, it's important to acknowledge that while they didn't win many of them, all of England's tests this year were really entertaining.</p>

            <p>The only team in a black jersey to go through the year unbeaten - OK, it was two games but two comfortable wins - the All Blacks XV upheld the proud spirit of every club grade reserve team by playing like they all had a point to prove.</p>

            <p>We all had to learn how corporate governance worked this year, which was hard work made even less fun when the eventual outcome of it all was that nothing was going to change.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks played five matches at home this season, three of which were sold out and the other pulling a very healthy 41,000 to Eden Park on a very wet evening. However, according to some folks, Wellington's economic woes and rugby's general lack of appeal were to blame for the 25,000 that came to Sky Stadium to witness the shock 38-30 loss to the Pumas - even though this has been the exact crowd figure average for this fixture ever since it was first played back in 1978.</p>

            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens taking out the Olympic final was the culmination of an excellent lead up and tournament, in which they grabbed headlines on and off the field. Sarah Hirini managed to play through not only a barely repaired ACL, but also a broken cheekbone sustained in the 19-12 gold medal match win over Canada.</p>
        
            <p>The win saw legends Portia Woodman-Wickliffe and Tyla King (Nathan-Wong) bow out at the end of their illustrious careers.</p>

            <p>The Thames Valley Swamp Foxes triumphed over Mid Canterbury in an entertaining final Meads Cup final by 37-29. However, Swamp Fox fan Harper Sandford from Goldfields School stole the show by going viral with his iconic halftime ball delivery.</p>

            <p>The Hurricanes Poua started off the season by criticising the government through haka. Emirates Airlines flew a jumbo jet through the All Black haka at Ellis Park. Joe Marler said the haka was ridiculous. TJ Perenara then rounded off the last test of the year with [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/534675/tj-perenara-shows-support-for-hikoi-during-haka a haka referencing the Treaty.</p>
