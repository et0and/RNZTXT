            <p>Mate Ma'a Tonga have made the Pacific Championships final with a nerve-wracking, pulsating 25-24 win over the Kiwis at Mount Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>It was drama all the way, with Tonga leading by 24 points late in the first half, only to see the Kiwis draw level with a spirited second half comeback.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-year-old Isaiya Katoa nailed a field goal for Tonga from 30 metres in the 76th minute, sparking a frenetic last couple of minutes as the Kiwis tried to get in front. Their goal attempts went astray to the delight of the Tonga's red-and-white flag-waving, hymn-singing supporters, who dominated the 22,000-strong crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The result means Tonga will play Australia in the final next weekend, while the Kiwis will have a promotion-relegation match against the winner of the match between Cook Islands and Papua New Guinea on Sunday.</p>

            <p>The Tongan side followed up a stirring Sipi Tau challenge before kick-off with a try to Sione Katoa charged over the corner after just three minutes.</p>
        
            <p>They ran in four tries during a steamrolling first half performance, with the Kiwis only registering their first in the 36tth minute, to Isaiah Papali'i.</p>
        
            <p>In between times it was a bone-crunching attack with ferocious hard running, led by Jason Taumalolo, Eli Katoa and Addin Fonua-Blake, backed up by skilful passing.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis looked stunned but Papali's try gave them hope and their comeback in the second half was brilliant, with three tries including a stunner to Joe Tapine.</p>
        
            <p>After Katoa's field goal, Jamayne Isaako missed a chance for the Kiwis, hooking a penalty attempt, and then Shaun Johnson's field goal attempt was charged down before Keano Kini attempted another. A captain's challenge that Johnson's legs were illegally taken out failed to convince the officials, and seconds later the match was Tonga's.</p>
        
            <p>Taumalolo spoke of his pride at the win, telling Sky Sport: "To be back in Auckland playing before the red sea again is an unreal feeling. An honour to be back here playing before our fans.</p>
        
            <p>"We came out firing, a little bit disappointing that second half, but we still managed to win and that's all that matters at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis captain James Fisher-Harris said his players showed some mana with their second half comeback.</p>
        
            <p>"We had some opportunities at the end but we just couldn't get it done," he told Sky.</p>
        
            <p>"MMT came out firing, all credit to them, they just came out physical and we didn't match them. All the best to them for next week."</p>
