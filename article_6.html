            <p>After a summer plagued by injury and unavailability, the White Ferns will be close to full strength for a three match T20 series against Australia with the return of Melie Kerr and Sophie Devine.</p>
        
            <p>The experienced Devine is back after a wellbeing break that ruled her out of the domestic Super Smash, Women's Premier League and the home series against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>After last playing competitive cricket in December, Devine said she was excited to be back with the White Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to have had some time to reset and refocus and I'm really looking forward to getting back out there with the girls."</p>

            <p>Fresh off a successful Women's Premier League campaign with the Mumbai Indians Kerr will rejoin the national side after last playing for the White Ferns in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup grand final in October where she scored 43 off 38 balls and took three wickets for 24 runs to guide New Zealand to a 32-run victory.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr missed the Sri Lanka series, which ended 1-1 on Tuesday after the deciding game was abandoned due to wet weather in Dunedin, to take part in the WPL for a third time.</p>
        
            <p>The Mumbai Indians won the WPL and Kerr scored 287 runs and took 18 wickets in the 10 games she played.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr and Devine's return, alongside that of senior pace bowler Lea Tahuhu following hamstring injuries that have kept her sidelined from international cricket since December, come at a good time for the White Ferns squad that has been hit by injury late in the summer.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Sparks batter Bella James also returns following a quadricep strain that ruled her out of the recent ODI and T20I series against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>James, who is uncapped in international T20 cricket, passed fitness tests and will travel with the team to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper-batter Izzy Gaze, who was also ruled out of the T20I series against Sri Lanka with a hip flexor sprain she picked up during the 3rd ODI, will not take part in the series as she requires further rehabilitation before returning to play.</p>
        
            <p>Polly Inglis, who made her international debut in both white-ball formats this month, will replace Gaze.</p>
        
            <p>Youngsters Emma McLeod, Izzy Sharp, Flora Devonshire and Bree Illing are omitted from the squad that played against Sri Lanka to make way for Devine, Kerr, James and Tahuhu's return.</p>
        
            <p>Suzie Bates will continue as interim captain for the series after Devine stepped down as T20 captain at the conclusion of the T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The series against Australia begins in Auckland on Friday and coach Ben Sawyer was looking forward to having some experience back in the squad for the final series of the summer.</p>
        
            <p>"We're stoked to have Soph, Melie and Lea back for this series.</p>
        
            <p>"They're three key players who bring a wealth of experience and leadership to the group."</p>
        
            <p>Sawyer said Devine felt ready to return to cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"Soph's had some time away from the game and is now in a space where she's looking forward to getting back out on the park.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone knows the power she possesses and what an asset she is to any team, so we're really pleased to have her back for what we know will be a competitive series."</p>

            <p>The visitors will be without captain Alyssa Healy as she continues to rehabilitate a foot injury with Tahlia McGrath to lead the side.</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper-batter Nicole Faltum has been called up for the first time as a she travels as wicketkeeping cover for Beth Mooney. Mooney, who is the world number one ranked T20 batter, is taking the gloves in Healy's absence.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder of Australia's squad is the same group of women who swept the T20 leg of the Ashes against England 3-0.</p>
        
            <p>White Ferns squad: Suzie Bates (C), Eden Carson, Sophie Devine, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Polly Inglis, Bella James, Fran Jonas, Jess Kerr, Melie Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Georgia Plimmer, Lea Tahuhu.</p>
        
            <p>Australia squad: Tahlia McGrath (c), Ashleigh Gardner, Darcie Brown, Nicole Faltum, Kim Garth, Grace Harris, Alana King, Phoebe Litchfield, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland, Georgia Voll, Georgia Wareham.</p>
