        <p>
Analysis - Jamie Wall takes a look back at a season where Andrew Webster, Shaun Johnson and the Warriors seized back the initiative.

            <p>The act of thinking back a year and trying to imagine the Warriors would be in the position they are now is one that permeated the 2023 NRL season. It's still relevant now, as trading is happening to build the side into a force for next year. Just who would have thought that the side was capable of a deep playoff run, that a previously unheralded coach would be getting calls to be made prime minister, or that the long-suffering club would be responsible for one of the most memorable organic sports marketing campaigns of all time?</p>
        
            <p>Not many is the answer, meaning that the vast majority of league fans on both sides of the Tasman were proven wrong by the feel-good sporting story of the year. Here's how it unfolded:</p>
        
            <p>The end of 2022 saw the Warriors at arguably their lowest ebb. Just six wins from 24 games, with the season finishing with an embarrassing home loss to the Titans and a second-to-last place finish. The one positive from there was that things couldn't really get any worse.</p>
        
            <p>After an offseason that contained the usual chat from new coach Andrew Webster about the potential the Warriors had, the first chunk of the season proved they weren't just empty soundbites. Five wins and two losses, including a stunning comeback against the Sharks, was built off some excellent form by Shaun Johnson and Addin Fonua-Blake.</p>

            <p>The schedule was tough through the Anzac Day/Magic Round period, with consecutive games against the Storm, Roosters and Panthers all ending in losses. The bright side was that the one to the Storm wasn't anywhere near as bad as the last time they played on Anzac Day. Also, this was the last time the Warriors would drop consecutive games in the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>Primary sponsor One NZ CEO Jason Paris found out the hard way that it's not a good idea to indulge in the longest standing pastime: blaming referee bias for poor Warriors results. Paris was forced to publicly apologise by the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>The game against the Broncos in Napier won't so much be remembered for the 26-22 loss, but rather the dozens of locals who decided to see what the quality of the McLean Park pitch was like for themselves. It wouldn't be the last time in 2023 that Hawke's Bay would disgrace themselves, though.</p>

            <p>While there was a pretty big hiccup against the Rabbitohs in round 18, the newly-christened 'Wahs' would go on a seven game win streak afterwards. Most notable were floggings of the Eels and Sharks, and thriller against the Raiders. Off the field, the Up the Wahs slogan had transcended the sports pages and officially become a show of patriotism/response to literally any situation. Webster and the players jumped on the craze too, but more serious recognition loomed.</p>

            <p>By now, Johnson's incredible form revival was making him favourite for the Dally M Award. He didn't win in the end, just pipped by Kalyn Ponga, but Webster would be honoured as coach of the year. However, Johnson, Fonua-Blake and Dallin Watene-Zelezniak all were named in the team of the year.</p>

            <p>After maybe their best performance of the year in a playoff win against Newcastle, it all came to an end in Brisbane. The Warriors went down to a grand-final bound Broncos team that was just too good on the night, especially a gun performance by Reece Walsh. Thousands of Kiwis made the trip to Suncorp Stadium for the preliminary final, packing out pubs on the famous Caxton Street, with made for a unique and rowdy atmosphere. Johnson showed amazing class in defeat, honouring Webster and his team in an emotional interview in the sheds.</p>

            <p>Out of nowhere, Fonua-Blake sent a spanner in the works by demanding a trade in November. To make matters even more headscratching, it all seemed to get resolved within 24 hours when the prop reaffirmed his commitment to the Warriors. It was a rare case of an NRL club putting their foot down on a contract actually being honoured, but one that was set to leave a bit of a sour taste after such a hugely successful season.</p>
        
            <p>That was until last week, when Kurt Capewell was added to the 2024 roster. The Broncos second rower, who has also represented Queensland, will bring some added firepower to the pack. But the move also shows that the Warriors' reputation is changing to one of being a preferred option. While Capewell was probably moved on by the Broncos to free up cap space for Reece Walsh and Ezra Mam, he clearly wants to come to a club with a chance of winning a premiership. It creates an intriguing selection situation in the forwards, but not as much as what will happen in the backs: somehow Webster has to make a call on where Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Chanel Harris-Tavita fit in.</p>
        
            <p>There's a lot to look forward to when the season starts against the Sharks on 8 March.</p>
