            <p>Injured New Zealand basketballer Steven Adams has been traded to a new NBA team according to reports out of America.</p>
        
            <p>The Memphis Grizzlies have agreed to trade Adams to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Victor Oladipo and three second-round picks CBS is reporting.</p>
        
            <p>Adams has been sidelined for more than year with knee injuries and last played for the Grizzlies on 22 January 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old centre had expected to be back playing in the NBA this season but season-ending surgery on his knee in October meant the Grizzlies projected he'd return for the 2024-25 season.</p>
        
            <p>Adams' move frees up salary cap spaces for the Grizzlies.</p>
        
            <p>The Rockets believe Adams will bring the toughness and leadership the team needs.</p>
        
            <p>Adams entered the NBA in 2013 and has played 706 games across stints at Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans and the Grizzlies.</p>
        
            <p>Oladipo, who will replace Adams at the Grizzlies, is a part owner of the New Zealand Breakers.</p>
