            <p>The All Blacks have kicked off their end-of-year tour in winning - albeit frustratingly familiar - style.</p>
        
            <p>A blistering first half against Japan made way for a sloppy and disjointed second, but they got the job done 64-19 in Yokohama.</p>
        
            <p>A late brace on debut for Ruben Love sweetened a slightly sour second spell, as New Zealand ran riot early on.</p>
        
            <p>While the scoreboard looks flattering, and the All Blacks did score 10 tries, their inability to close out games will continue to be of concern.</p>
        
            <p>It was an electric opening for the hosts, Jone Raikabula exploding up the centre and gassing the cover to slam the ball over the line and send the home crowd into raptures.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Telea kicked off the scoring for the All Blacks, taking a pop pass from Billy Proctor and muscling through three defenders to crash over.</p>
        
            <p>It was back-to-back for the men in black, skipper Patrick Tuipulotu marking his first test in charge with a bulldozing charge in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>Japan struck back as Faulua Makisi waltzed over through a yawning gap close to the chalk with the kiwi defence found wanting.</p>

            <p>The Brave Blossoms very nearly took the lead in stunning style, Damian McKenzie crunched in a tackle with lock Warner Dearns swooping on the loose ball, kicking ahead, regathering and outsprinting Reece to gallop his way over.</p>
        
            <p>However, the piece of individual brilliance was scrubbed as replays showed a knock on in the McKenzie tackle.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks rubbed salt into the wound as Billy Proctor finished off a slick set piece move, followed by another strong run from Telea setting up Sam Cane for a fifth.</p>
        
            <p>Japan began falling off their tackles, Samipeni Finau going in again on the left flank as the scorecard started to blow out.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks bagged a seventh before the break -Tamaiti Williams rumbled over on the back of a powerful lineout drive for a 43-12 halftime lead.</p>
        
            <p>It didn't take long for more points after the break, the returning Cam Roigard showing he has not lost any pace or power as he broke three tackles en route to the line.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie slotted the extras to bring up the half-century.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Robertson cleared the pine, Peter Lakai and Ruben Love both making their test debuts, both sides committing several errors.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks' issues were compounded when Opeti Helu found himself in a hole and stepped McKenzie to go in under the bar.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, after more than half an hour without scoring, debutant Love went back-to-back to put a finishing flourish on the win.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 64 (Love 2, Telea, Tuipulotu, Cane, Proctor, Finau, Tosi, Williams, Roigard, tries, Mckenzie 7 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Japan 19 (Raikabula, Makisi, Helu tries, Tatekawa 2 cons)</p>
