            <p>Despite being down to 13 men at one stage and without any props, the Highlanders have pulled off a massive 29-21 upset win over the Blues in Dunedin. Two tries to pint-sized fullback Finn Hurley, including one that'll be a candidate for best of the season, were the difference although the defending champs will be bitterly disappointed with another lacklustre performance.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors certainly looked like they'd turned a corner after last weekend's loss to the Chiefs, scoring after only a couple of minutes through halfback Finlay Christie. Beauden Barrett then touched down under the posts to make it a 14-3 lead after 20 minutes, but from there the Highlanders suddenly found form after a magical effort from Hurley off his own 22.</p>
        
            <p>After fielding a kick, the fullback chipped back upfield and regathered, showing excellent pace to outrun the Blues' cover defence in an 80 metre effort. Sam Gilbert's try and penalty goal mean the Highlanders were only down 14-13 at the break, although they'd lost prop Saula Ma'u to a failed HIA.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues looked to have steadied things with a Ricky Riccitelli lineout drive try, however it was another false dawn as the Highlanders simply proved to be better at hanging onto the ball and making the most of it. Hurley got his second shortly after but then Highlanders prop Daniel Lienert-Brown was carded for a reckless cleanout, which was later upgraded to a red card by the TMO.</p>
        
            <p>Confusion reigned at scrum time as injuries to Ethan de Groot and Sefo Kautai meant the Highlanders couldn't field a front row and were reduced to 13 players at one point. However, this only seemed to steel their resolve and two huge lineout steals on their line by Fabian Holland and a couple more penalties by Gilbert ultimately snuffed out any last hopes of a Blues win.</p>
        
            <p>This is a massive result for the Highlanders, who will be treasuring every derby win this season. They face Moana Pasifika next Friday in Auckland, while the Blues will be looking to fix things quickly before they play the Hurricanes in Wellington on Saturday.</p>
