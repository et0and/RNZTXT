        <h2>US player Madison Keys given top seed status for ASB Classic after late entry</h2>
        <p>
The former US Open runner-up and world No 21 is a late replacement for Canadian Bianca Andreescu, who pulled out of the tournament for personal reasons.

            <p>Seasoned American Madison Keys is a late inclusion in the ASB Classic field and will be top seed for the tournament in Auckland in January.</p>
        
            <p>Tournament director Nicolas Lamperin confirmed the 22 players with direct entry, along with the top eight seeds for the WTA tournament, with New Zealand's Lulu Sun seeded fourth on current world rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Former US Open runner-up and world No 21 Keys is a late replacement for Canadian Bianca Andreescu, who pulled out of the tournament for personal reasons, Lamperin told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old Keys has been ranked inside the world top 20 for each of the last 10 years and snared the eighth title of her career at Strasbourg this year.</p>
        
            <p>Another eight-time WTA tournament winner, Belgian Elise Mertens, is ranked second seed, while world No 36 American Amanda Anisimova is third seed.</p>

            <p>Sun's seeding comes off a world ranking of 40th, built primarily on her run to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.</p>
        
            <p>Other big names among the top eight are former US Open champion Emma Raducanu (sixth) and four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka (seventh).</p>
        
            <p>Lamperin said he was delighted with the quality of a field which boasts the winners of a combined seven grand slams, and a mix of proven performers and rising players.</p>
        
            <p>"To have Lulu Sun back home at the tournament as the No 4 seed is evidence of her incredible year, given she was a qualifier at the last ASB Classic. Lulu is an extremely talented and an exciting player. This is a wonderful opportunity for Kiwi fans to watch our own New Zealand star playing at home."</p>
        
            <p>Two further New Zealand players will be given the chance to compete, at a singles qualifying tournament in Auckland after Christmas, ahead of the tournament proper beginning on 30 December.</p>
