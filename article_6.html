            <p>The fine margins of international netball are playing on Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua's mind.</p>
        
            <p>A one-goal loss to the England Roses in game one of the Taini Jamison Trophy series in Auckland on Sunday night did not sit well with Dame Noeline.</p>
        
            <p>The long-time coach said she was not a good loser whether the margin was one or 100 goals.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly I hate it. I always hate it.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been on the end of a lot of these [close] games and I really feel that there is some really good stuff happening in this team and I really feel we're on the brink we've just got to crack it."</p>
        
            <p>After winning the first quarter by one goal and being level at 29-all at half time Dame Noeline could pinpoint a moment late in the game that her side did not recover from - something she viewed as costing them an opportunity to win.</p>
        
            <p>In her first game for the Silver Ferns midcourt player Claire O'Brien did a lot right but she also committed an error in the fourth quarter when the game was in the balance.</p>
        
            <p>In a game with minimal turnovers from either side an errant pass from O'Brien stuck out.</p>
        
            <p>"Every pass every error is going to make a difference and especially that we were up by one going into that space in time then that put us back and they had the next centre pass so these are the things that make a difference and these are the things we learn on the job," Dame Noeline said.</p>
        
            <p>For her part O'Brien acknowledged the step up in intensity in international netball.</p>
        
            <p>"It's every ball it's every catch so definitely [there is] a big emphasis on staying in the moment and working each pass at a time rather than trying to get too ahead of yourself," O'Brien said.</p>
        
            <p>Their first time on court against a battle hardened Roses side, who had just finished a three-match series against the Australia Diamonds earlier in the week, was always going to be tough but getting O'Brien and fellow debutant defender Parris Mason on the court in the second half was important for Dame Noeline.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams kept the starting seven on court throughout the first half but switching goal attacks Ameliaranne Ekenasio and Maia Wilson for short bursts was a tactic Dame Noeline employed in close third and fourth quarters.</p>
        
            <p>"When I do make the switch the momentum changes. Maia, she's going to keep the ball in hand and she's just going to work it to the circle so she brings that element of very strategic and it slows the play down and very methodical. Obviously when [Ameliaranne] comes out it opens it up again and we know she can go to the post.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't afford to have errors so it opens the opportunities for people to come out on court but also those to stay warm so when we do make the switch again we can make an impact and get ahead."</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns relied on goal shooter Grace Nweke (49 goals from 55 attempts) who had a height advantage over her England defenders to keeping the goals coming in game one but Dame Noeline knew that was not always going to be the answer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awesome to have Grace there but also we've got to have something else. So we've got to change that up get to circle edge, get in circle and put the shot up to change the momentum."</p>

            <p>England Roses coach Jess Thirlby said she knew what to expect from the Silver Ferns and it was a challenge she had been wrestling with for a few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"I love playing New Zealand because I think it's a game for the best thinkers, it's problem solving at it's best and I think it's a big game for our attacking play.</p>
        
            <p>"The off mark doesn't just give the illusion of no space there really is very little space but if done smartly you can find gaps."</p>
        
            <p>With changes to the squad since last year's world cup and even since touching down in Australia Thirlby was proud of what her side achieved in the 59-58 win in the opening game of the series.</p>
        
            <p>"The will to win and to find a way is something we've been getting better at and it's slow progress and it's a bit up and down but I think it's really pleasing to see this group to be able to find a way to beat both Australia on their home soil and New Zealand at the start of what is going to be exciting series is obviously where we want to be."</p>
        
            <p>Thirlby said some of the Silver Ferns tactics on Sunday were smart, including the rolling subs.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they used that really well that wasn't something that I think would have worked for us today to get us over the line."</p>
        
            <p>She expected the Silver Ferns to fight back in game two in Porirua on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"They're going to hurt, we've been on that side of the fence as well and not that long ago we are that team that bounced back in a test two just a couple of weeks ago against Aussie so of course it galvanizes a team for sure.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't swap places right now we want to be a team that can win the opening match and then go again and we too have to keep finding a way to elevate our performance."</p>
