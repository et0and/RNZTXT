            <p>Malaysia's Olympic Council on Monday proposed holding a "downsized" Commonwealth Games in 2026 as the southeast Asian country considers replacing the original host, the Australian state of Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>The Commonwealth Games Federation has offered Malaysia Â£100 million (NZ$209m) in supporting funds if it decides to take over as host, after Victoria pulled out last year citing ballooning costs.</p>
        
            <p>The offer has received a mixed response in Malaysia amid concerns over spending costs and lack of preparation time. The cabinet is expected to discuss the matter this week, Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh has said.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria's withdrawal as host placed the future of the quadrennial multi-sport event in doubt and raised questions about the benefits and continued relevance of the Games.</p>
        
            <p>Malaysia previously hosted the event in 1998.</p>
        
            <p>Mohd Nazifuddin Najib, the secretary-general of the Olympic Council of Malaysia, on Monday suggested several measures to reduce costs, such as using standard hotels and accommodation to house athletes and officials instead of building a dedicated Games village.</p>
        
            <p>Malaysia could also redirect some of its budget for the Southeast Asian Games, which it is hosting in 2027, towards the Commonwealth event, he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel that this can be a downsized Games," he said. "For example, it doesn't have to be 15 sports, it can be 10 sports. And then we have a smaller opening and smaller closing (ceremonies).</p>
        
            <p>"We can discuss all of this but it's best for this decision to come from the government."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had a team of 233 athletes competing across 19 sports at the last Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022.</p>
