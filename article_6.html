            <p>Triple Formula One world champion Max Verstappen set an ominous pace as Red Bull picked up where they left off on the first day of pre-season testing in Bahrain on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Even if the timesheets could be easily dismissed, with teams running different programmes, there was no denying that the new Red Bull already looked a step up from last year's dominant RB19.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen was comfortably faster than the quickest lap of the opening day of testing last year, completing 143 laps -- two race distances -- and wrapping up 1.140 clear of closest rival Lando Norris in the McLaren.</p>
        
            <p>The Dutch driver's best lap of one minute 31.344 seconds under the evening floodlights compared to last year's opening day best of 1:32.837 at the same circuit.</p>
        
            <p>The sense of business as usual contrasted with the uncertainty surrounding Verstappen's team boss Christian Horner, who has denied allegations of inappropriate behaviour levelled against him by a female employee.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen, who won a record 19 of 22 races last season with Red Bull's Sergio Perez winning two more, was also top of the morning session in 1:32.548 when he completed 65 laps without any problem.</p>
        
            <p>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was second in that one with Fernando Alonso third for Aston Martin and the last driver within a second of Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Oscar Piastri lapped fourth fastest for McLaren, handing over to Norris for the second stint.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Albon of Williams was the first driver to experience any notable problem, stopping his car on track due to a fuel pump problem with 21 minutes remaining of the first session.</p>
        
            <p>Team mate Logan Sargeant had a suspected driveshaft problem later on.</p>
        
            <p>Mercedes had George Russell in their car, whose front wing gained plenty of attention, all day -- completing 116 laps -- with seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton driving on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Team boss Toto Wolff said the mood in the team was positive, with Mercedes putting the emphasis on creating a stable platform for development and spending time making changes to the car in the garage.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a filming day yesterday and then some aero running this morning with no relevant lap times," added the Austrian.</p>
        
            <p>"So far the feedback from the drivers was yes, this is something we can start to work with and that is encouraging."</p>
        
            <p>Teams have only three days of testing before the season starts in Bahrain next week.</p>
