            <p>Christchurch high jumper Hamish Kerr carries the title of world champion into the Olympic Games in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>His career highlight occurred in March in Glasgow when he soared to 2.36 at the world indoor championships, claiming the gold medal and setting a national record.</p>
        
            <p>His clearance is the second best recorded in the world this year. Tokyo joint gold medallist Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy recorded 2.37 at a meeting in Rome in June.</p>

            <p>Kerr has enhanced his status for Paris with wins at the prestigious Diamond meetings held in Europe in the last few months, notching wins in Shanghai, Monaco, and London on 21 July.</p>
        
            <p>While he can be confident in his form, Kerr's main aim is Olympic success.</p>
        
            <p>If he won a medal he would be the first Kiwi high jumper to achieve the feat.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that something like a world indoors is easy to put to bed in that you don't grow up wanting to win world indoors, you grow up wanting to be an Olympian," Kerr told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think there is a different mindset, a different expectation going into what is such a massively bigger event."</p>

            <p>Buddy: Shotputter Tom Walsh</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said he jumped his best when he was enjoying it - a feeling he shared with champion shot putter Tom Walsh.</p>
        
            <p>The pair share a laugh whenever they can. It helps them both cope with the intensity of competition when they enter the arena.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last few years we've travelled together more and he's definitely a guy I love spending a lot of time with and so and we definitely have similar attitudes towards what performance looks like," Kerr told RNZ earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr will be hoping he has found the right formula for a peak performance when his event takes place on 8 August (NZ time).</p>
