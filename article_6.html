        <h2>ASB Classic: Big day for the men’s top seeds</h2>

Sun's out, big guns out on Wednesday at Stanley Street, writes Jamie Wall.

            <p>It's fair to say things haven't being going that great for some of the big names in the men's ASB Classic so far this week. Number five seed Chris Eubanks Jr is out, beaten in straight sets by Dutchman Botic van de Znadschlup. Gaël Monfils couldn't match his wife Elina Svitolina's heroics, even though he provided an entertaining match that he ultimately lost to Hungarian Fábián Marozsán.</p>
        
            <p>Two-time champion Roberto Bautista Agut has been sent packing by fellow Spaniard Roberto Carballés Baena, and last year's winner Richard Gasquet went down to fellow Frenchman Arthur Fils - but given both Bautista Agut and Gasquet are tour veterans it's not that much of a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>Canadian Dennis Shapovalov came and went in straight sets thanks to Sebastian Ofner of Austria, but at least that was predictable given Shapovalov's ranking has plummeted almost 100 places since this time last year.</p>
        
            <p>So, what happens today when the top seeds take the court? Fourth seeded Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime opens proceedings at Stanley Street when he takes on German Daniel Altmaier, then top seed Ben Shelton faces Marozsán.</p>
        
            <p>It should provide some serious entertainment on what should be another scorching day on centre court. Temperatures on Tuesday were soaring, with Gasquet's shirt drenched with sweat before they'd even completed the second game.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton in particular is the big drawcard, the big-serving American having a special connection to the ASB Classic as it was not only his first ATP 250 tournament, but the first time he'd even travelled outside of the United States. After picking up his first win, Shelton made a run to the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, which justified the hype that had come with him to Auckland as American men's tennis's next big thing.</p>
        
            <p>Later in 2023 he had his real breakout moment, going all the way to the semi-finals at the US Open and eventually losing to Novak Djokovic. It's fair to say Shelton has returned to Auckland with his star firmly risen.</p>
        
            <p>"I learned a lot of things throughout the year but it started here in Auckland," said Shelton, who paid a visit to The All Blacks Experience in his downtime during the week.</p>
        
            <p>"This was my first main draw outside of the United States - I was lucky that the tournament gave me a wild card."</p>
        
            <p>It's that sort of loyalty that kept Coco Gauff coming back, now she and Shelton stand on the brink of breaking into superstardom in the States if they can continue to live up to the hype. Gauff pretty much already has by defending her title last week, so the door is open for Shelton to etch his name on the ASB Classic as well. They stand as the new generation of talent for US tennis, somewhere that hasn't had quite as much representation as it should in the winner's circle since Serena Williams called it a day.</p>
        
            <p>Then, later on in the night session, number two seed Cam Norrie will attempt to win the tournament in the city he grew up in. He will play qualifier Luca van Assche of France, but while locals will be claiming him for the actual NZ representatives it's once again all over.</p>

            <p>Wildcard Kiranpal Pannu provided some entertaining shots and got the crowd going at the most sweltering part of Tuesday's day session, before falling 6-4 6-4 to Max Purcell, a rare Australian entrant in the ASB Classic field.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pretty disappointed because I threw in some sloppy service games, so I gifted it to him on a platter but he is top 50 for a reason, he served his way through it," said Pannu.</p>
        
            <p>"It's special playing at home, they were getting behind me so I tried to use it."</p>

            <p>It was the same in the doubles, with the Kiwi pair of Rubin Statham and Artem Sitak beaten in a thriller by Romain Arneodo and Sam Weissborn. The 7-5 3-6 8-10 result brings down the curtain on Sitak's career, with the former doubles world number 32 and 2018 Wimbledon quarter finalist said that it was a special moment to finish in front of a full house on centre court at Stanley Street.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely brutal and heartbreaking, but the atmosphere was amazing. We loved every moment out there. It was so close, so many unbelievable points."</p>
