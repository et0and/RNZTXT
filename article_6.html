            <p>Pakistan allrounder Khushdil Shah has been penalised for running into Black Caps bowler Zak Foulkes during the first T20 international between the two sides in Christchurch on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Shah was fined 50 percent of his match fees for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.</p>
        
            <p>Khushdil was also handed three demerit points. It was his first offence in a 24-month period.</p>
        
            <p>He was found in violation of Article 2.12 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to "inappropriate physical contact with a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire, Match Referee or any other person (including a spectator during an International Match)."</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened during the eighth over of Pakistan's innings when Khushdil barged into the back of bowler Zak Foulkes.</p>
        
            <p>The act was classified as 'inappropriate physical contact with a high degree of force' and was deemed 'reckless, negligent and avoidable.'</p>
        
            <p>It was a forgettable outing for Pakistan on Sunday, as they were bundled out for just 91 in Salman Ali Agha's first match as full-time T20 captain.</p>
        
            <p>Khushdil was the top scorer with 32.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand cruised to victory in 11 overs for the loss of one wicket.</p>
        
            <p>The second game of the five-match series is in Dunedin on Tuesday.</p>
