            <p>All Blacks prop Fletcher Newell is set to miss both of this month's Bledisloe Cup tests against Australia because of a calf injury.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders tighthead Newell will definitely sit out this Saturday's match in Sydney, and will be reassessed ahead of the return fixture in Wellington on 28 September, the final match of the Rugby Championship for both teams.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby said 24-year-old Newell suffered the injury late in their most recent match against South Africa in Cape Town on 7 September, and would not travel to Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>He was a substitute in the 18-12 loss to the Springboks, a result that ensured New Zealand would not defend the Rugby Championship title, having lost three of four matches.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Rugby said it was estimated Newell would return to play in "three to four weeks", leaving him doubtful to add to his 20 test caps in the Wellington fixture.</p>

            <p>Fellow Crusaders front-rower George Bower has been added to the squad to travel to Sydney to boost the propping stocks.</p>
        
            <p>Ethan de Groot will also be in the tour squad, having missed the last three All Blacks tests with a neck injury.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders loosehead de Groot was unavailable for the victory over Argentina in Auckland and both test losses in South Africa.</p>
