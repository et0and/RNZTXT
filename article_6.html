            <p>The Warriors bar has officially been named - with 'Full Time' the favourite amongst fans.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, it was announced the rugby league team had purchased a bar and asked fans for name suggestions.</p>
        
            <p>Creative names like 'It's Our Beer', 'Wah Bar' and 'Up The Bars' were among the favourites, with 'The Backfence', 'Wahs Ki Runga' and 'Church' - for those who kept the faith - trailing closely behind.</p>
        
            <p>Other notable suggestions included 'Ma Te Wah', 'The Gym' ("so we can tell our Mrs we are going to The Gym") and 'Pinot Wahs'.</p>
        
            <p>But on Wednesday, the Warriors revealed the venue, located in Auckland's Kingsland, would be known as Full Time Sports Bar & Eatery.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Cameron George said it was a great name.</p>

            <p>"We look forward to everyone having a fantastic experience at Full Time once it opens for business.</p>
        
            <p>"The venue's refurbishment is well underway now and ticking along nicely and anticipate it being open in time for the spring season."</p>
        
            <p>With its close proximity to Eden Park, George said the bar was expected to become a hub for Warriors fans and a "lively spot" for game days.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an important business venture to create diverse revenue," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Options to use our platforms and brand to promote and engage in our own business ventures is a great way to not only generate new revenue but equally as important to engage with the public and fan base."</p>
        
            <p>The venue's open date has yet to be announced.</p>
