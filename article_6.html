            <p>Squash star Paul Coll has opened his New Zealand Open title defence in Christchurch with a convincing 3-0 victory inside 25 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The World No.4 was in top form as he took on Japanese No.1 Ryunosuke Tsukue in front of a loud home crowd, which included 50 friends and family who travelled from the West Coast to support him.</p>
        
            <p>After winning the first game 11-3, Coll used every inch of the court to force Tsukue to cover plenty of ground, and took out the second and third games 11-6 for a comfortable 3-0 win.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very happy with my first performance. It was an amazing intro that I got from the crowd, so I was just out there trying to enjoy it.</p>
        
            <p>"I played my shots and felt pretty relaxed and I'm very happy with how that went," Coll said.</p>
        
            <p>A glass court had been installed on stage in Christchurch's Isaac Theatre Royal for the New Zealand Squash Open.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been so good playing in Christchurch. I've been here for a few days now and this is where I grew up, playing all my squash. It does really feel like home to me, which is a pretty cool feeling.</p>
        
            <p>"I never, ever thought I'd have a New Zealand Open in Christchurch and I'm so stoked for the people of Canterbury, they've had a big 10 years, so to be able to pull this off is really special."</p>
        
            <p>Coll will take on France's Sébastien Bonmalais in his quarter-final at 6pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day, 18-year-old local Wellington wildcard Oliver Dunbar's dream run ended at the hands of No.3 seed Eain Yow Ng of Malaysia.</p>

            <p>Dunbar tore up the script at the Isaac Theatre Royal on day one with a win over Rui Soares, ranked more than 200 places above him.</p>
        
            <p>Dunbar matched Ng well during the opening spell and earned a narrow 4-3 lead before the Malaysian opened up the court, putting some brutal rallies into the teen's legs as the No.3 seed scored eight points in a row to take game one.</p>
        
            <p>Ng picked up where he left off in game two and three, with the Malaysian No.1 pulling away to wrap up the win.</p>
        
            <p>Friday will see the quarterfinals contested, with semi-finals Saturday, and finals Sunday.</p>
