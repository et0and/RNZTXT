            <p>The All Whites are one step closer to qualification for a third World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's path to the global football showcase has been made easier through a change in the qualification system, but they were made to work hard for a 3-0 victory in their tournament opener against the Tahitians in Port Vila.</p>
        
            <p>A pair of late goals flattered the scoreboard for the All Whites, who let several scoring opportunities go begging.</p>
        
            <p>They next meet hosts Vanuatu on 15 November. The winner of the Oceania qualifiers will be granted automatic entry to the 2026 Football World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>All Whites coach Darren Bazeley said it was a frustrating encounter.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a difficult game, we knew it was going to be challenging. The conditions were a bit of a leveller. We got that great start but fair play to Tahiti, they sat very deep and killed the game a little bit. We had a lot of possession but we know we can be better with how we break these teams down."</p>
        
            <p>It took just 90 seconds, and the Kiwis were on the board in stunning style.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Rufer latched onto a poor Vanuatu pass and linked with Elijah Just right on the edge of the box. He sent a superb strike curling beyond the grasp of keeper François Decoret and thundering into the top left of the net.</p>
        
            <p>A further blow came for Tahiti as Téva Lossec found himself the worse for wear after a strong challenge.</p>
        
            <p>With sweltering heat and humidity enveloping the island, players took a water break at the 30-minute mark.</p>
        
            <p>After a slight lull in the action, the All Whites began to pepper Tahiti with halftime looming, Ben Old finding the post, in what was the closest of several shots at goal.</p>
        
            <p>With six minutes of added time, the pressure did not relent, Tahiti's desperate scramble defence keeping the Kiwis at bay despite plenty of chances for a second.</p>
        
            <p>Tyler Bindon had one final shot at a second before oranges, only for his attempted header to sail wide.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood had the first real chance of the second spell, though his header had no power behind it and was easily negotiated by Decoret.</p>
        
            <p>Continuing to dominate both territory and possession, the All Whites could not cash in.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Sutton and Ben Waine made their way onto the pitch for the final quarter of what was becoming an increasingly tense match.</p>
        
            <p>Sutton would make an immediate impact as he lay one on a platter for veteran Wood to net another just before the 70-minute mark.</p>
        
            <p>Decoret was called on again shortly after to make back to back saves, first for a strong strike by Waine and then a high ball courtesy of Kosta Barbarouses.</p>
        
            <p>A third and game sealing goal came with just minutes remaining. Waine expertly guided one past Decoret to ensure a much healthier scoreline for the All Whites.</p>
