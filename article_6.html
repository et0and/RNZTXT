        <h2>Retiring Woodman-Wickliffe says she saved her worst for last</h2>
        <p>
The Black Fern says her retirement plans after winning a gold medal include "lounging on the couch, eating Maccas and KFC, and popping out babies".

            <p>Double Olympic gold medallist Portia Woodman-Wickliffe says she saved her worst for last in Olympic final.</p>
        
            <p>She announced before the Games that she would retire from international rugby after Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old went out on top Wednesday when the Black Fern sevens team beat Canada to make it back-to-back gold medals, and snag New Zealand's first in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>But Woodman-Wickliffe was less than kind about her own performance.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I played my worst game out there - a yellow card and another penalty. Man, that was terrible, I thought I learned my lesson from Rio," she told media afterwards.</p>

            <p>It wasn't just her yellow card for a high tackle on Charity Williams, New Zealand was trailing Canada 12-7 at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Woodman-Wickliffe said even then the team still believed they could win.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just about being who we are and keeping things simple and just loving the game. I think that's what we showed out there."</p>

            <p>It was a "privilege" to win gold, and to wear the fern.</p>
        
            <p>"To do it with these girls, we've got some young players coming through the ranks and then we've got players who have been together a long time, through a lot of highs and lows. [I'm] Grateful."</p>
        
            <p>So what was next for her? "Lounging on the couch, eating Maccas and KFC and popping out babies".</p>

            <p>Woodman-Wickliffe is married to Renee and they have a daughter.</p>
        
            <p>She also won two 15-a-side Rugby World Cups, two Commonwealth Games medals, has a silver Olympics medal from Rio and became the first woman to score 200 tries in Rugby World Sevens Series.</p>
        
            <p>Tyla King, New Zealand's most capped women's sevens player, also announced Paris would be her last tournament.</p>

            <p>Teamate Stacey Waaka described the pair as "awesome humans" as well as being highly skilled players.</p>
        
            <p>"The mana and the respect they hold within the girls within the group - it's going to be missed but we send them off with our blessings."</p>

            <p>Waaka told Sky Sport it was special to help them win gold in their final match.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a surreal feeling, surreal moment. Some [players] in their first Olympic campaign, some second and for some it's their last.</p>
        
            <p>"To see those girls off and to seize this opportunity we had I'm speechless really."</p>
