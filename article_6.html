            <p>The US Open doubles reign of Erin Routliffe and Gabi Dabrowski is over.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand-Canadian combination were beaten in the quarter-finals of the women's doubles in New York by Hao-Ching Chan of Chinese Taipei and Veronika Kudermetova of Russia.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Dabrowski won the opening set 6-4 before losing the next two 7-5, 6-3.</p>
        
            <p>The top seeds and defending champions had cruised through the early part of the tournament, but made significantly more unforced errors in today's match at Flushing Meadow.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi admits they did not take all their opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt we still had a lot of chances to break almost every time," Routliffe said.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't serve as well as we could have to keep that break that we had, but all credit to them they played a really good match."</p>
        
            <p>She admits they made too many unforced errors especially in the third set.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we were as aggressive and a little less brave when we had the break but they did a really good job of changing their game and making us uncomfortable when we were up."</p>
        
            <p>Chan and Kudermetova, the tenth seeds, now move on to play seventh seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok of Ukraine and Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe is the current world number one ranked doubles player.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Dabrowski lost in the final at Wimbledon this year and reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open.</p>
        
            <p>They have another couple of tournaments before the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia in November.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely makes me hungrier because that loss hurt."</p>
