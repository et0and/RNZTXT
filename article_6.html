            <p>The All Blacks open their end of year tour with an interesting game against Japan, if nothing else than for seeing how a few players who have been kept in reserve perform. They head in as big favourites and for good reason - the Japanese haven't been particularly great this year and shouldn't pose much of a threat.</p>
        
            <p>Really, the hard work starts next weekend in London where the All Blacks face off with England. But this tune up after a month's break is an important one for Scott Robertson and his coaching staff, who need to prove that they are developing their attacking game plan. Meanwhile, Eddie Jones and Japan will just be hoping they can compete after a run of disappointing losses so far this year.</p>

            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Japan: 15 Yoshitaka Yazaki, 14 Jone Naikabula, 13 Dylan Riley, 12 Nicholas McCurran, 11 Malo Tuitama, 10 Harumichi Tatekawa (c), 9 Shinobu Fujiwara, 8 Faulua Makisi, 7 Kazuki Himeno, 6 Amato Fakatava, 5 Warner Dearns, 4 Sanaila Waqa, 3 Shuhei Takeuchi, 2 Atsushi Sakate, 1 Takato Okabe</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Mamoru Harada, 17 Takayoshi Mohara, 18 Opeti Helu, 19 Epineri Uluiviti, 20 Kanji Shimokawa, 21 Taiki Koyama, 22 Tomoki Osada, 23 Takuro Matsunaga</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks: 15 Stephen Perofeta, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Billy Proctor, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 Mark Tele'a, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Cam Roigard, 8 Wallace Sititi, 7 Sam Cane, 6 Samipeni Finau, 5 Patrick Tuipulotu (c), 4 Sam Darry, 3 Pasilio Tosi, 2 Asafo Aumua, 1 Tamaiti Williams</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 George Bell, 17 Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 18 Fletcher Newell, 19 Josh Lord, 20 Peter Lakai, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 David Havili, 23 Ruben Love</p>
        
            <p>It's a big chance for Billy Proctor, who was really good in his one test appearance so far this year, to press his case for a call up to the top side. Cam Roigard is rushed straight back into the starting side, his battle with Cortez Ratima as to who takes the halfback spot going forward will be interesting. Wallace Sititi gets to start at number eight as part of a 950kg pack, most of that belonging to Pasilio Tosi and Tamaiti Williams. Also debuts will be coming for the Hurricanes duo of Peter Lakai and Ruben Love. Patrick Tuipulotu will captain the side for the first time, just reward after leading the Blues to a breakthrough Super Rugby Pacific title earlier this season.</p>

            <p>There's a couple of kiwi connections in the Brave Blossoms: lock Warner Dearns, son of former Silver Fern Tanya, and second five Nik McCurran who came through Hamilton Boys High. Dearns scored a try the last time these sides met, two years ago, and is still only 22. Kazuki Himeno starts on the openside, he played a season for the Highlanders back in 2021, these days he lines up alongside Aaron Smith at Toyota Verblitz.</p>

            <p>"You have always got to be careful around Eddie Jones firstly. There have been a few big names other than the All Blacks, he's got great innovation, he pushes his teams to the limit and gets the best out of people. He's done that at some key moments in his career so we're aware of Eddie." - All Black coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the ultimate test. You've got to be able to do it for 80 minutes. That's what we've been preparing for, and I feel the players are ready to play the best game that Japan's ever played against New Zealand. That's the opportunity ahead of them." - Japan coach Eddie Jones.</p>

            <p>All Blacks 38 - 31 Japan</p>
        
            <p>Easily the closest game between the two - every other has had a 77 point All Black average winning margin - the Japanese never gave up against a heavily rotated All Black side that never really got out of second gear. Things weren't helped with 15 minutes to go when Brodie Retallick was sent off for a clumsy clean out at a ruck.</p>
        
            <p>This should be a comfortable victory for the All Blacks, along the lines of the Fiji test earlier in the year. How the likes of Proctor and Roigard go after such a big build up will be interesting, as will the impact of Lakai off the bench. Love's role will likely see Stephen Perofeta get a decent stint at first five, which is another chance for the Blues utility to prove his overall value. Really though, the biggest win Scott Robertson can get out of this one is to simply get this one out of the way and move on, which is a very All Black-like way of doing things and something we need to see more of.</p>
