            <p>The All Blacks insist the sudden departure of assistant coach Leon MacDonald hasn't been a disruption as they prepare face the World Champion Springboks at their Ellis Park cauldron.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald quit last week following a difference in coaching views with head coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>Forwards coach Jason Ryan said the All Blacks can't afford to be distracted in Johannesburg.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just got on with it. Obviously the conversations were had and decisions were made and we move on pretty quickly and you have to.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a massive amount of respect for Leon as a man and as a coach, as I have Razor (Robertson) and they've come to that decision.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as we're concerned it's last week's news and we're moving forward," Ryan said.</p>

            <p>MacDonald's duties have been divided among the other assistant coaches, largely Scott Hansen and Tamati Ellison, but Ryan said there hasn't been any problems.</p>
        
            <p>He believes the players have adjusted "seamlessly" to the loss of their attack coach.</p>
        
            <p>He said the All Blacks were fully focused on trying to upset the world champion South Africans in Johannesburg on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys are across the detail and come up to speed really quick. We've got done what we needed to earlier in the week and looking forward to it. I think the adjustments have been pretty seamlessly to be fair."</p>

            <p>The Springboks have won nine of the 15 games they've played against New Zealand at Ellis Park, however the All Blacks won their most recent test at the ground, a 35-23 victory in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said playing in Johannesburg was a unique experience.</p>
        
            <p>"As Dane Coles (former All Blacks hooker), it's probably the greatest challenge and the best arena you can test yourself in the All Blacks," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really excited by that and we'll embrace that and we'll walk towards it. They're the world champions and 64 odd thousand sold out roaring Africans, it's actually no better."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan will lean on his previous experience coaching the All Blacks in Johannesburg as he tries to prepare his forwards to meet fire with fire against a large and aggressive Springboks pack, who are likely to select 7-1 forwards/backs split on their bench.</p>
        
            <p>"Even the bus trip (to the stadium) cab be pretty feral. There's a few hand signals going on and a few empty beer cans coming towards the windows and that sort of thing. But I think it's coming from a good place. It's a hell of a rivalry and as much as they want to beat us, there's a good amount of respect there I feel and I know there is from us. I just can't wait for it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the best contest you can judge yourself, especially in the forwards and that's where the contest is really won or lost. Making sure they're (players) are really clear and don't have to much clutter. When you're playing in this arena... you can't be thinking too much about things if you want that physicality."</p>
