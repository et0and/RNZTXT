            <p>New Zealand golfer Steven Alker has held on to win the Charles Schwab Cup Championship event in Arizona by one stroke, earning him almost $2 million.</p>
        
            <p>Alker went into the final round of the US Seniors event with a four shot lead but saw that whittled down to one shot over the final few holes as South African Ernie Els and Canadian Stephen Ames closed in.</p>
        
            <p>The pair eventually finished at 17-under, meaning Alker had to par the final hole to avoid a playoff.</p>
        
            <p>He duly completed his round with with one under par 70, holding his nerve over the back nine to par all the holes extricating himself from a couple of situations where he could easily have dropped a shot.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament win earns him $895,000, with the victory also promoting him to second on the overall season standings which earns him a further $850,000.</p>
        
            <p>The victory is Alker's second of the season and his seventh at seniors level.</p>
        
            <p>American Steve Stricker won his first Schwab Cup title after winning six tournaments in 2023, including three major championships.</p>
        
            <p>He clinched the title after the first leg of the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>Stricker withdrew from this week's tournament at Phoenix Country Club after his father was admitted to the hospital for a medical emergency.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't get it done this year," said Alker, who won the Schwab Cup in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"Stricker had an amazing year, he was phenomenal, so we were chasing him all year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But to get second after going first last year, that means a lot just to keep the consistency. And I get a couple of wins, it's nice. The guys are just getting better out here and just pushing harder, so you've just got to try a little bit better every year."</p>
        
            <p>"I made it exciting here at 18, but that wasn't the plan, I'll tell ya," Alker said.</p>
