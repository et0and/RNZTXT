            <p>All Whites captain Chris Wood extends his contract with English Premier League high-flyers Nottingham Forest until 2027 on the back of his prolific goal-scoring form.</p>
        
            <p>Wood has found the net a remarkable 14 times in 22 league appearances to be one of the stars of the English season, sparking reported interest from other clubs in the January transfer window.</p>
        
            <p>With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, Forest have moved to ensure the 33-year-old striker stays put on Trentside, where he joined on loan from Newcastle two years ago and completed a permanent move in June, 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very excited and very happy to have it completed and done, and I'm looking forward to the next couple of years, at least," Wood said in a club statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw the ambition when I first arrived. When I spoke to the owner and his family and saw where they want to be and where they see this club to be - it was clear they have high ambitions and big dreams.</p>
        
            <p>"He has backed the club for years, even before promotion to the Premier League, which is fantastic, and the team is pushing in the right direction.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't thank the fans enough, they always come in voice and they're always behind the team and myself, it's a pleasure playing in front of them. Here's to a few more years together."</p>

            <p>Despite only being at the club for two years, Wood is their leading Premier League goalscorer, overtaking Bryan Roy's record of 24 in December.</p>
        
            <p>He was named as Forest's first Premier League Player of the Month in November, becoming the first New Zealand player to achieve that feat.</p>
        
            <p>With Wood the spearhead, Forest have defied all expectations to be second-equal on the standings with Arsenal, six points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
        
            <p>His returns and attitude were praised by club owner Evangelos Marinakis.</p>
        
            <p>"He has performed exceptionally well with us," Marinakis said.</p>
        
            <p>"More than just his goals, he epitomises everything that it means to wear the Garibaldi red - hard work, a fighting and winning spirit, and the attitude to never give up. He is a winner and a role model to inspire all of us, and we reward his dedication with ours."</p>
