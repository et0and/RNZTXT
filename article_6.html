            <p>Auckland FC has revealed a quartet of locals as the first official player signings for the new A-League side.</p>
        
            <p>All Whites Michael Woud, Francis De Vries, Cameron Howieson and under-23 international Jesse Randall represent a mix of some of the best upcoming and established New Zealand talent.</p>
        
            <p>None of the players have played in the A-League before.</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeeper Woud returns to his hometown after nearly a decade away playing in England with Sunderland AFC, in the Netherlands and most recently with Kyoto Sanga in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old six-cap All White has played at three age-group world cups and at the last Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Woud played for west Auckland club Bay Olympic before he headed overseas and said it was special to be back.</p>
        
            <p>"This is special for me because I grew up here, having spent my childhood playing club football in Auckland. I have been away from home for the last nine years and I'm so excited to come back and prove myself in front of my friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>"It is about time Auckland had a football team to call its own and I can't wait to see the home fans at Mt Smart this October."</p>

            <p>Making the move of out Auckland club football to the A-League is 29-year-old left back De Vries.</p>
        
            <p>De Vries has played in Sweden's second league with IFK VÃ¤rnamo but has most recently been playing for Eastern Suburbs in the Northern League.</p>
        
            <p>"Now you can feel the excitement through all age grades at suburb level and in schools. It's an honour to be part of what Auckland FC will create for young players, their families and the wider Auckland communities in getting everyone motivated and inspired by football."</p>
        
            <p>De Vries hoped to get a recall to the All Whites via the A-League. He has six senior caps.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielder Howieson is making the switch from one Auckland team (Auckland City) to another.</p>
        
            <p>He was part of Auckland City's recent OFC Champions League title-winning side and was looking forward to returning to professional football with Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>Howieson has won a plethora of accolades domestically and played more than 115 times for Auckland City after getting limited game time with Burnley's senior side in England.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>He did play a season in Scotland, where his father is from, but he has made his biggest impact in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Football growth in New Zealand has exploded massively. Having a second club in Auckland FC will give the country a healthy dose of rivalry between the two clubs which makes it entertaining.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so excited to be part of this movement in our home country...playing professionally again is something I've been working towards since coming back home."</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-one-year-old left winger Randall is the youngest of the first four players announced.</p>
        
            <p>The prolific goal-scorer has been picked up out of Wellington where he plays for Wellington Olympic.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up he played his junior years for Miramar Ranges, Island Bay United and North Wellington before joining Northern Kentucky University on scholarship when he was 18.</p>
        
            <p>Randall joined the second tier United States League club on a professional contract with Charleston Battery last year before returning to Aotearoa.</p>

            <p>"I grew up watching Winston Reid and more recently, Chris Wood in the English Premier League, and it just felt so far away from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"With Auckland now having a team in the A-League and part of a wider group of clubs across the world, younger players can now see a pathway into professional football."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC coach Steve Corica said the club wanted their first player announcements to be talented New Zealanders who have experience both locally and internationally.</p>
        
            <p>"Michael is a great shot stopper and is really excited to be returning home. I know he will be fighting for the chance to play in front of his friends and family. Both Francis and Cameron have been two of the most consistent players at a national level and we have been tracking Jesse for a while now and he has a huge amount of potential.</p>
        
            <p>"All four players suit our attacking style of football, they will all be making their A-League debuts next season and will want to impress the home crowds."</p>
        
            <p>More players will be announced in the coming weeks now that the recent A-League season has officially ended.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC is majority owned by Bill Foley, with Ali Williams and Anna Mowbray as local co-owners, and will play their home games at Mt Smart's Go Media Stadium when the 2024/25 season starts in October.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland-based franchise join the Wellington Phoenix in the A-League.</p>
