        <h2>Warren Gatland leaves Wales job after horror record</h2>
        <p>
The New Zealander had been under contract until the 2027 World Cup, but recent results made his position look untenable.

            <p>Warren Gatland's second tenure as Wales coach has ended by mutual agreement after a record-extending 14th successive loss with a Six Nations defeat by Italy.</p>
        
            <p>Cardiff Rugby head coach Matt Sherratt has been appointed to take the reins for the remaining three Six Nations matches, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealander Gatland had been under contract until the 2027 World Cup, but recent results made the 61-year-old's position look untenable.</p>
        
            <p>"The WRU and Warren have agreed that making this change now is in the best interests of the Wales squad as it continues to compete in the 2025 Six Nations tournament," WRU chief executive Abi Tierney said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are grateful to Warren for all he has done for the game in Wales. He remains our longest-serving and most decorated head coach in terms of the silverware he has won."</p>
        
            <p>Tierney added that Wales were looking to hire a permanent coach before this summer's two-test tour to Japan.</p>
        
            <p>"Matt Sherratt takes over at a pivotal time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a credit to him that he has not hesitated to answer Wales's call and is also testament to the strong relationship that now exists throughout the Welsh professional game that Cardiff Rugby are fully supportive of the move.</p>
        
            <p>"Matt will return to Cardiff Rugby after the Six Nations in order to concentrate his efforts on what is already a promising campaign for our capital club."</p>
        
            <p>In December 2022, Wales reappointed Gatland, their most successful and longest-serving coach from his first 12-year spell, to replace Wayne Pivac after a poor showing in that year's autumn internationals.</p>

            <p>Last week, Gatland conceded that trying to turn around Wales's dire fortunes was challenging and he questioned his ability to do so after their 22-15 Six Nations loss in Italy.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to thank the WRU Board for the faith shown in me after a tough campaign throughout 2024 and affording me the time and resource to try to turn things around for this 2025 tournament," Gatland said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We have worked hard, we have a talented young squad that are developing and have been desperate to turn potential into results but now is the right time for a change.</p>
        
            <p>"I've reached the end of this particular chapter, but I remain grateful to all those in Wales who have supported me ... I wish whoever takes over all the best for the future. Finally, I want to say a big thank you to the Welsh fans."</p>
        
            <p>Gatland completed his first Six Nations clean sweep in his maiden season with Wales in 2008 and repeated the feat in 2012 and 2013.</p>
        
            <p>He guided the Welsh to victory in the 2019 Six Nations and led them at three World Cups, reaching the semi-finals in 2011 and 2019. He resigned after the latter.</p>
