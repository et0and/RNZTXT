            <p>Seven years ago as teenagers Maya Hahn, Kelli Brown and Geo Candy were part of the first New Zealand national team to claim a medal at any FIFA tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Brown started in the play-off for third place at the women's under-17 world cup against Canada, Hahn came on in the 55th minute and goalkeeper Candy was on the bench.</p>
        
            <p>The trio are now all professional footballers in different parts of the world who have been called up for the first time to the senior Football Ferns squad, for two games against Costa Rica, on Sunday and Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>For midfielder Hahn it is a return to the New Zealand environment after also being eligible to play for Germany through her father's heritage.</p>
        
            <p>Hahn believes she has made the right choice in committing to New Zealand for senior football.</p>
        
            <p>Also in the squad for the games against the world number 43 are Mackenzie Barry and Macey Fraser, who were part of the bronze medal winning age-group side.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't seen some of them in years but it doesn't really feel like it has been that long ... it's just nice to catch up and share old stories and the football side it's been fun to play with some old team mates again," 23-year-old Hahn said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really nice feeling, it's that mix of familiarity but also something new and exciting. The timing when I'm joining, when we're starting a new project, and there are some other new faces - but then it's also that feeling of being around people from New Zealand, you feel that connection and people that I've known for some time as well, and being able to reconnect has definitely made the transition easier for me and it doesn't feel like a completely new environment."</p>
        
            <p>Hahn plays club football for FFC Turbine Potsdam in the German Frauen-Bundesliga, Brown plays for Perth Glory in the A-League, and Candy is also in the A-League with Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>Barry is with the Wellington Phoenix and Fraser plays in America with the Utah Royals in the US National Women's Soccer League.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns squad selected by interim coach Michael Mayne for the Costa Rica games is drawn from 17 different club sides.</p>

            <p>"It's honestly surreal, I was talking with an old team mate and we had a photo from our under-17s team and I think 18 of us are playing professionally - and it's kinda crazy when you think about that.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was growing up you didn't really know what the options were [to play professionally] or what was out there, and I think it is constantly growing and I think it's a super exciting space right now because I think the potential is limitless and it's about pushing to keep that moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>Hahn said she enjoyed comparing notes about the different club environments that Football Ferns were playing in around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm also noticing in conversations that I've had that there's still a lot of work to be done when you're comparing how it is in different environments also through my experiences, but it's also cool to see the direction it's going in, in terms of the professionalism."</p>
        
            <p>Hahn believes some people would be shocked by the "crazy things that happen in women's football," but she is heartened to also hear about the progress too.</p>
        
            <p>For as comfortable Hahn feels in the Football Ferns environment she was also finding her feet in how she would fit into the side, as they look ahead to the next Football World Cup in 2027.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped to establish herself in the side in the next two games, and thought her experience playing in America and Germany would give her an edge.</p>
        
            <p>"Adaptability and playing in different systems ... my creativity in possession and wanting to always get on the ball and always play with my team mates, that's something I'm trying to bring in my game all of the time and hopefully that is something that is beneficial to the team here."</p>
        
            <p>Mayne was pushing for all players he had selected to want to get on the pitch.</p>
        
            <p>"Competition in the squad is a massively important piece of this puzzle going forward and there's nobody here that doesn't understand that, and we're competing every day to push each other," Mayne said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's new ways I am trying to manifest that and I think there's some opportunities for the [uncapped] players on this tour for sure."</p>
        
            <p>Mayne had a fresh approach to the game plan that he wanted the players to embrace.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a challenge for the group. I'm trying to attack in a different way and I'm asking different things of the players and they've been really open to this point, in terms of taking that challenge on. I also think it is a bit of a challenge to us in terms of our pathway and the direction I see our game going and the types of players I want to see in the future in this shirt as well."</p>
        
            <p>Defender Claudia Bunge said the players had bought into Mayne's style and needed to keep up the intra-squad competitive spirit if they were to be successful.</p>
        
            <p>"Football is a dynamic game and you need to be ready to be adaptable, and I think this is maybe something this team has lacked in the past, but I am definitely a fan of the way we're going to approach these next few games and I think it complements our team really well," Bunge said.</p>
        
            <p>Mayne said the style of Costa Rica was exactly what his assembled squad needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Very typical central American team, lots of flair in the team and they like to get on the ball and they're sometimes quite off the cuff, so those are challenges we've discussed, so we've got to learn to be really flexible but then impose ourselves pretty quickly."</p>
