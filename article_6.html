            <p>Winger Filipo Daugunu scored a try in each half to help Australia claim a 36-28 win over struggling Wales and sweep the series 2-0 in a rainy test in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Daugunu crossed first and last for the home side who charged out to a 17-0 lead early and weathered a Welsh comeback to continue their positive start under new coach Joe Schmidt.</p>
        
            <p>The Wallabies, 25-16 winners in the series-opener in Sydney, also had tries from scrumhalf Jake Gordon and Allan Alaalatoa, the prop scoring the first five-pointer of his 69-test career.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the tries were spectacular and were on the back of some really good skill but were a little bit fortuitous, too," Schmidt told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"We were made to work by a group who were desperate.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just relieved that we've got a couple of results because it will help build belief."</p>
        
            <p>Wales hooker and captain Dewi Lake scored two tries from the back of mauls, while Liam Williams and Rio Dyer crossed after the break to keep them in the game.</p>
        
            <p>But the undisciplined visitors finished their season with a ninth successive defeat, heaping further pressure on coach Warren Gatland.</p>
        
            <p>The Welsh are now only one defeat away from their record losing streak of 10 under Steve Hansen in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>"It was frustrating how hard we worked for our points and how easy we conceded our points," Gatland told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to learn some tough lesssons and test match rugby is about being accurate."</p>
        
            <p>Rain-showers throughout the night put skills at a premium, and a piece of Andrew Kellaway magic conjured the opening try for the Wallabies in the seventh minute.</p>
        
            <p>From deep in defence, Kellaway chipped and chased down his own ball, tapped it down to flanker Fraser McReight who bolted half the length of the field before dishing wide to Daugunu to cross at the right corner.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon produced another dazzling try, swooping on a ball spilled by Cameron Winnett then stepping through two Welsh defenders before the half-hour mark.</p>
        
            <p>The Wallabies' fast start was squandered by poor maul defence, though, as Lake rumbled over for a pair of tries from near-identical lineout drives.</p>
        
            <p>The second came four minutes from the break and straight after Wallabies lock Lukhan Salakaia-Loto drew a yellow card for head-high contact on prop Archie Griffin.</p>
        
            <p>Wales trailed 23-14 but closed the gap to two points seven minutes after the restart.</p>
        
            <p>With another strong maul they muscled the ball forward and after bashing away at the goal-line for a few phases, Wales had their third try when winger Williams burst through left of the posts.</p>
        
            <p>With a drought-breaking win within reach, Wales handed possession and momentum back to the home side with a needless ruck penalty.</p>
        
            <p>The Welsh foiled a couple of lineout drives but could not stop Alaalatoa who burrowed over for a pick-and-go try.</p>
        
            <p>Williams then served up Daugunu's second try on a platter with a howling mistake.</p>
        
            <p>Jumping at the touch-line to keep a Lolesio penalty kick in play, he tapped the ball down to a charging Daugunu who cantered over unopposed with a grin on his face.</p>
        
            <p>Wales were quick to respond, though. A Nic White box kick was blocked by Christ Tshiunza, allowing Dyer to gather the ball and beat three tacklers in an exhilarating dart down the right touch-line for a try in the 69th minute.</p>
        
            <p>That was to be Wales' final flourish as the hosts defended strongly to the finish, with Ben Donaldson booting a penalty three minutes from the siren to seal victory.</p>
