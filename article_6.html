        <h2>‘They aren’t well-informed’ – Rieko Ioane to critics</h2>
        <p>
The outspoken Blues and All Blacks centre had a message for rugby fans across the country.

            <p>Outspoken Blues and All Blacks midfielder Rieko Ioane is ready to defy the critics on the eve of this year's edition of Super Rugby Pacific kicking off. Ioane's Blues take on the Chiefs at Eden Park on Saturday night in a rematch of last year's final, however as one of the most talked about players in the game right now, he is aware of what he called the "downside of the fanbase".</p>
        
            <p>"They aren't well informed and if they were, you know, they'd be standing out on the field with me," the 81-test veteran said about fans who have voiced their opinions on him throughout his career.</p>
        
            <p>"That's just the downside of the fan base sometimes. It's not all the time, but yeah, I just ignore it. I've been around long enough and sort of had my fair share with hecklers and whatnot."</p>
        
            <p>An online battle between Ioane and former Irish first five Johnny Sexton produced the most feedback last season, however Ioane's quick-witted Instagram posts on the matter certainly drew a great deal of support outside of Ireland . Ioane joked that the spat had made him a "fan favourite up in Dublin", in a memorable test win where he led the haka for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>He has often found himself a lightning rod for criticism since his test debut in 2017, however a great deal of that was answered last season when he was a major part of the Blues' breakthrough Super Rugby Pacific title win. Ioane stated immediately after the game that the win meant more to him than a World Cup, a serious nod to the fact that when he'd started out with the Blues in 2016, the former powerhouse was at the lowest ebb in its history.</p>

            <p>Now, it stands on the verge of being able to potentially build a dynasty. Vern Cotter's Blues 2.0 is essentially the same team but with Beauden Barrett, however Ioane wasn't keen for the champs to get ahead of themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"That's obviously the dream and the goal of this club. But, you know, you can't talk dynasties until won another one and start doing that consistently. So our only focus is taking each game, week by week. And if we can put together the performances that we know we can, that's when you have those conversations."</p>

            <p>Cotter has made no secret of the fact that the Blues' direct style that worked so well last season would be getting another go around in 2025. Ioane admitted it was a tough adjustment going from that to Scott Robertson's vastly different plan for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything's real tight and abrasive sort of contact. Midfields running those short balls and suicide lines. Whereas in the All Blacks we're expected to be one side of the field, to the other side, it's real expansive. So it was definitely a juggle and something that I had to get the body used to."</p>
        
            <p>Ioane is expecting a tough game against the Chiefs this Saturday night in front fans that he said are "the best", however as long as the Blues win, he's not fussed how they go about it.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year getting wins was more important than getting the ball. So whatever that looks like (this year), I just want our team to succeed and win. However my role looks, I'm happy to play that."</p>
