            <p>Dame Lydia Ko is third equal, heading into the final round of the LPGA season-opening Tournament of Champions in Orlando, a title she won last year.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander carded a flawless seven-under 65 third round on Sunday NZT to be 11-under, four strokes behind Korean leader A-Lim Kim.</p>
        
            <p>Ko notched seven birdies in her round at the Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, which bettered her 5-under second round after an indifferent 1-over on the opening day.</p>
        
            <p>She revealed after the second round she had changed from a new putter after the first round to the one she used in winning this tournament last year, and also the Paris Olympics and British Open. She had been bogey-free in the two rounds since the change.</p>
        
            <p>But she still had a big job to overtake Kim, who had been in irrepressible form from the opening round.</p>
        
            <p>Kim's only mistake in the third round was a bogey on the last hole, after an eagle on the par-5 ninth hole and four birdies.</p>
        
            <p>Sweden's Linn Grant birdied the final hole to take second spot off Ko, who was joined by world No 1 Nelly Korda after the American's scorching finish four birdies in the last five holes.</p>
        
            <p>Ko is ranked number two in the world off the back of a stunning 2024, which included the Olympics gold medal, which earned her a place in golf's Hall of Fame and the British Open title.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's been pretty solid, even the first day I hit the ball decent, just really struggled on the greens," she said after the third round.</p>
        
            <p>"And I think that part of my game has improved the most the last couple of days."</p>
        
            <p>Ko said she felt she played better in the second round despite scoring two strokes lower today.</p>
        
            <p>"Golf is strange, I feel like I technically played better yesterday,'' she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely some momentum going into tomorrow."</p>
