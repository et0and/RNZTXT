            <p>The 'beef' between Rieko Ioane and Johnny Sexton has been put to bed, according to All Blacks coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>Ioane and Sexton engaged in a war of words during and after last year's Rugby World Cup quarter-final in Paris, which the All Blacks won 28-24.</p>
        
            <p>In the recently released book, Obsessed - The Autobiography of Johnny Sexton, the 118-capped and Irish points scoring record-holder detailed the dying moments of the match.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't bring myself to watch the quarterfinal back. I don't think I ever will. I don't need to. I've mentally replayed every second, over and over," Sexton wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"It finishes the same way every time. Rónan Kelleher still ploughs into Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock. Whitelock goes in for the poach, clearly without releasing, but somehow Wayne Barnes awards him the penalty, even though it has all happened under his nose - and it's all over.</p>

            <p>"And as I stand there, hands on hips, staring in disbelief at Barnes, Rieko Ioane still comes up to me and tells me, "Get back 10 metres.</p>
        
            <p>"Huh?"</p>
        
            <p>"Penalty," he says. "Back 10." And then, after Barnes blows the final whistle, he says, "Don't miss your flight tomorrow. Enjoy your retirement, you c…."</p>
        
            <p>"So much for the All Blacks' famous "no d…heads" policy. So much for their humility. I walk after Ioane and call him a fake-humble f…er. It doesn't look great, me having a go at one of them just after we've lost. But I can't be expected to ignore that."</p>
        
            <p>Ioane then responded and [embed https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/529775/ioane-doubles-down-on-sexton-feud-lights-fuse-for-dublin-showdownand potentially lit the fuse] for what should be a blockbuster clash with Ireland next month in Dublin, posting an Instagram story with a photo of himself and Sexton during the World Cup quarter-final, with the song Zombie by Irish band The Cranberries, which has the lyrics 'in your head', laid over top.</p>

            <p>All Blacks coach Robertson spoke to media after confirming his squad for their end of year tour to Japan, England, Ireland, France and Italy and he was asked if he or the team had received any recent fan mail from Sexton.</p>
        
            <p>"Not personally," Robertson joked, before confirming he had no issues with Ioane's behaviour and that the midfielder had moved on.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit of a story isn't it. A bit of history in the annals of time.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a quick talk to Rieko about it and asked how he thought I should discuss it (with the media) and he said, 'nah, nah, it's all done coach'," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"When people write books and bring up those moments it's going to create chat and talk and that's part of the game. It doesn't matter what game or what sport, you have those rivalries, but there's still a lot of respect that we need to show."</p>

            <p>The All Blacks take on Ireland in their third match of the tour, which starts on 26 October against Japan in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said the Dublin test won't be the only tense one with games against France and England either side of the Irish test.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at the stats, the competition has evened up.</p>
        
            <p>"Smaller margins, tighter matches, defensively teams are better, they're more aggressive, they turn you in, but there are still opportunities. So that's what we're looking for and if people go into the match wondering what's going to happen that's great, that's the entertainment part of the game."</p>
