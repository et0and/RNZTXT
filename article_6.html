            <p>Charlie Woods, the 15-year-old son of golf great Tiger Woods, hit his first ever hole-in-one during the final round of the PNC Championship in Orlando, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>The moment came on the par-three fourth hole and propelled the Woods duo into the lead at the family-centred tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Team Woods had opened the final round with back-to-back birdies, followed by a par on the par-five third hole before the stunning hole-in-one.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a perfect seven-iron," Charlie Woods told the Golf Channel. "It was awesome. I didn't think it went in ... until I go up there and see it."</p>

            <p>Tiger and his son, Charlie, are chasing their first title at the event, which features 20 champions competing alongside a member of their family. The pair have competed for the last four years and were runners-up in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who underwent microdecompression surgery for nerve impingement on his lower back in September, is playing in his first competitive event since the US Open in July.</p>
        
            <p>Not to be outdone, Padraig Harrington's son, Paddy, sank his first career ace on the 214-yard, par-3 eighth a few minutes later, lifting that pair to within a stroke of the leaders.</p>
