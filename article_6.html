        <h2>Netball NZ defends policy which rules NZ's best player out of Silver Ferns</h2>
        <p>
The Netball New Zealand board is backing its eligibility policy, despite it meaning the Silver Ferns will be without their best player next year.

            <p>The Netball New Zealand board is backing its eligibility policy, despite it meaning that the Silver Ferns will be without their best player next year.</p>
        
            <p>It was announced yesterday that star shooter Grace Nweke will play netball in Australia next year.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old has signed with the Sydney-based New South Wales Swifts to play in the Australian domestic competition.</p>
        
            <p>She will still be eligible for New Zealand's tests against England and Australia later this year, having played domestically for the title winning Mystics in the ANZ Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>But Netball New Zealand (NNZ) rules state for a player to be eligible for the Silver Ferns they must play in the domestic competition, which will rule her out of the black dress next year.</p>
        
            <p>When Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua was reappointed earlier this year she used the interview process to express with some urgency the need for players to get more international exposure and she felt NNZ was "on the same page".</p>
        
            <p>So is there a disconnect between Dame Noeline and the board?</p>
        
            <p>"There are different ways of doing that, they don't have to go and play in the SSN (Australian competition Suncorp Super Netball) for example," NNZ Board chair Matt Whineray said.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to look for ways to increase that exposure. This step by Grace for example is consistent with that. It does mean that she's out of the Silver Ferns environment for the 2025 year but it is consistent with that desire to get increased exposure to different playing styles."</p>
        
            <p>Whineray said the rationale for the policy was to maintain a strong domestic league.</p>
        
            <p>"What we would like to have is all of our top players in the domestic league to preserve and protect that player pathway here and that's something we've been very focussed on in the last few years. To provide a strong domestic league to be able to develop the best Silver Ferns that we can."</p>

            <p>Nweke did not apply for an exemption from the Netball New Zealand board because it was clear she would not get one.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is players need 100 Test caps so that was already quite clear to me what the result would be and it never really got as far as formally addressing the board. I did deliver a letter of intent to Netball New Zealand and that was well received but it was made very clear that I didn't meet the criteria," Nweke said.</p>
        
            <p>"That is quite challenging but I fully respect the protocols that Netball New Zealand has in place and their why and I'm hopeful that whatever happens in the future I will be in the black dress again at some point."</p>
        
            <p>The board gave rare exemptions to Maria Folau and Laura Langman to play in Australia in 2019, but there haven't been any since.</p>
        
            <p>"They were I guess you would say towards the end of their careers, they were 100 Test centurions at that point. They had had an extensive contribution to the Silver Ferns and to netball in New Zealand and it was decided that that would have less of an impact on the rationale for that policy about maintaining the domestic league," Whineray said.</p>
        
            <p>But given there are currently no players in the Silver Ferns squad with over 100 Test caps, would any player get an exemption?</p>
        
            <p>Whineray said it was at the board's discretion.</p>
        
            <p>"You always look at an application on its merits each time. We have reaffirmed the importance of that policy for the strength of the domestic game and you consider each one based on its merits.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately it's a judgement call for the board which is trying to weigh up how do we protect the long term interests of the sport, while still providing opportunities for our players."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had its worse finish at a World Cup last year, finishing fourth but the board is not too concerned that the Silver Ferns will be without their strongest player next year as they build-up to the 2027 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"Grace has expressed a desire to go and face some new challenges and different playing styles and she's decided to do that for a year and in a year when there are no pinnacle events.</p>
        
            <p>"She's been very clear about her commitment to the black dress so we look forward to getting her back into that Silver Ferns environment with that new growth and bringing that new development back into the Silver Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the long term I think it's going to positive for all of us."</p>
        
            <p>Is the board keen to see New Zealand domestic teams compete against the Australian sides?</p>
        
            <p>"We're still going through what the league will look like from 2026 and beyond and there are a range of options in that and we continue to talk to Australia as well. We're still going with that, we're talking with our broadcast partner Sky and also TVNZ and we've got a bit of work to do before we land on any particular decisions around what that looks like."</p>
        
            <p>Nweke said she went into the ANZ Premiership grand final two weeks ago knowing it might be her last game for a while in the blue dress.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew that it very well could be but I wasn't 100 percent, I hadn't signed at that point but I knew it's what I wanted. I just wanted to see the season through and then put pen to paper," Nweke said.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke got to know Swifts coach Briony Akle earlier this year when the Australian assisted the Silver Ferns as a specialist at the Nations Cup. Akle will also assist the Ferns as a specialist attack coach in their international series later this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Something feels really perfect about the timing â€¦having that opportunity to meet Briony and be coached by her. And it was an experience I really enjoyed and we really clicked."</p>

            <p>Nweke reached out to Akle when it became clear the Swifts would be looking for a shooter for 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"She's been very supportive and allowing me to take my time with my decision."</p>
        
            <p>The 31-Test cap Silver Fern is excited about teaming up with England shooter Helen Housby, who was named player of the tournament at the 2023 Netball World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"She is one of the best goal attacks in the world so to have that kind of experience and talent in front of me, and across the whole Swifts roster there is some amazing players. Just that opportunity to grow and to play against some top defenders it's very very exciting."</p>
        
            <p>Nweke sought advice from a number of people as she weighed up her decision, including Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua.</p>
        
            <p>"And my Mystics assistant coach Rob [Wright] who actually coached at the Swifts for a very long time so having that insight to the culture of the club was really helpful. I was supported by all the people who I came to for advice and they really backed my decision."</p>
        
            <p>She is signed with the Swifts for one year, and it's impossible to say if she might be tempted to stay longer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so hard to say, I'm just taking it one game at a time, one season at a time. This time next year whatever the landscape looks like whatever success we've had and whatever the Netball New Zealand broadcasting landscape looks like then that's an opportunity to have more information to figure out what's next for me."</p>
        
            <p>The SSN has had a record year in terms of crowds and viewership and Nweke is excited about playing in stadiums that can hold 10,000 fans.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke is looking forward to throwing herself into the Silver Ferns series later this year but is trying not to think about how it will feel to miss out on the black dress next year.</p>
        
            <p>"I will be really heartbroken I think when push comes to shove and I am ineligible to wear the dress in 2025 but I understand the rules. I love being able to play for New Zealand, I love the team that we're building and I guess having a little bit more skin in the game now, I feel like I'm stepping into more of a leadership role there and so to miss out on that will be really challenging but I'm going to cross that bridge when it comes to it."</p>
