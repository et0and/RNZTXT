        <h2>The big loser in the latest High Performance Sport funding</h2>
        <p>
Hockey, squash and E-sports are among several sports to receive a funding cut.

            <p>Cuts across hockey's elite programme are inevitable following a drastic funding reduction.</p>
        
            <p>Hockey is the big loser in the latest sports funding announced by High Performance Sport New Zealand for the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>Funding has been slashed by almost $1.5 million after the Black Sticks women failed to qualify for this year's Olympics, while the men did not win a game in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Swimming and equestrian have had their funding cut by more than $600,000 each after failing to win any medals in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Rowing, which won a gold, 2 silver and a bronze medal in Paris this year, has had its funding increased to $6 million annually, the most for any sport.</p>
        
            <p>Cycling's five track medals in Paris helped them get the biggest increase, up $770,000 to $5.25 million annually.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Hockey chief executive Anthony Crummy said it was a tough pill to swallow.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really disappointed to say the least but we work in a results based industry. So we knew we didn't have the Olympic success, so we expected some reduction, but this is pretty significant."</p>
        
            <p>Crummy said the finding cut represents about 30 to 40 percent of their programme.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very hard for us to absorb a loss in funding of that size without ultimately, it affecting people, we will have to look at our broader operation across the community and and figure out how to best prioritise every resource we have."</p>
        
            <p>He also said about a third went directly to supporting the players.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not professional. They all work, study or ply their trade around the world playing hockey. They sacrifice a hell of a lot, so we will do everything we can to bridge the gap for them. It affects everyone, coaches, staff, players, everyone, to some degree."</p>
        
            <p>HPSNZ will provide funding for the first quarter of 2025 under the previous model, which Hockey NZ said will give them time to adjust.</p>
        
            <p>But Crummy said it will be a tough road back.</p>
        
            <p>"While the Olympics didn't go exactly how we wanted, they challenged the world's best pretty regularly in the last two years, we think they're on a great trajectory.</p>
        
            <p>And the girls had a massive change of the guard. We've got a new young group. So we're excited to where they can go. We can get back there, no doubt. But it's not going to be easy and this certainly doesn't help."</p>
        
            <p>However, he is confident that despite the hit to their wallet, they can once again be a force on the international scene.</p>
        
            <p>"We think we offer something very special and important to the New Zealand sporting landscape. And we're more than just the Olympics and we know that's recognised by the public, we'll get ourselves back back to that top table."</p>
        
            <p>Another sport disappointed with their funding reduction is squash.</p>

            <p>Squash New Zealand has seen a 25 percent reduction in investment in the sport and no renewal of one-off funding received in the last cycle, equating to a total of a 45 percent reduction.</p>
        
            <p>HPSNZ has offered Squash a $250,000 annual investment for the 2025 - 2028 cycle, a significant funding cut to what it had been receiving between 2021 - 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Squash New Zealand Poipātū Aotearoa Chief Executive Martin Dowson said the funding reduction will have ramifications for the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"The reduction in funding will directly impact the pathways for our emerging athletes, making it much harder to develop world-class squash players capable of representing New Zealand and winning medals at future Commonwealth Games and the 2032 Olympic Games."</p>
        
            <p>While acknowledging the challenging economic environment, Dowson said the extent of the funding cut is difficult to accept.</p>
        
            <p>"This has come as a real surprise and will put a lot of pressure on our organisation. We understand that the Government is focused on reducing spending, but to see our core funding cut so significantly is a tough pill to swallow."</p>
        
            <p>Squash is set to make its Olympic debut at the LA 2028 Games, we have a unique opportunity to inspire the next generation of world-class squash athletes from New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, E-sports have labelled their funding cut as "short-sighted."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Esport President Conor English said it was a big blow ahead of first ever E-sport Olympics in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite a track record of Kiwi gamers stepping onto global podiums, these achievements have been brushed aside, casting serious doubt on whether New Zealand is serious about embracing a critical and growing part of the future of sport."</p>
        
            <p>While traditional sports would receive millions, Kiwi E-sports received $15,000 in services "spread thinly" across a three-year period, English said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is that young New Zealanders are increasingly drawn to E-sports.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps they just don't get it?"</p>
