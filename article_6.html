            <p>The new coach of the Canterbury Rams admits the prospect of an historic three-peat has been touched upon by his players ahead of their NBL season opener.</p>
        
            <p>Following back-to-back triumphs in 2023 and last year, the Rams are set to embark on another title defence, in a quest to become only the second outfit in league history to complete a championship three-peat.</p>
        
            <p>Only the defunct Auckland Stars achieved the feat of three straight championships, between 1995 and 1997.</p>
        
            <p>Despite movement within both playing and management ranks, the notion of "picking up where they left off" remains front of mind.</p>
        
            <p>One of the biggest alterations for the impending campaign is at head coach with former assistant Quinn Clinton elevated to the helm.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old replaces Judd Flavell after the championship-winning coach and former Breakers assistant was promoted to the Tall Blacks head coaching role last October.</p>
        
            <p>Flavell will remain with the Rams as the team's high performance director.</p>
        
            <p>"Me and Judd see basketball really similar," Clinton said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a good challenge and I just feel real lucky to be part of the group again.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a really strong support staff, assistant coaches that could easily be head coaches in the league so I feel like I'm going in there with a really strong support crew."</p>
        
            <p>Retaining as much continuity from the last two NBL campaigns is understandable, given both seasons resulted in silverware.</p>
        
            <p>Keeping his players grounded and focused on the task at hand is one of the biggest challenge facing the young mentor.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely been some talk of [completing a three-peat]," Clinton said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we all realise that a lot comes before that.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just taking it day-by-day and working on our processes and just trying to get better.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll take care of itself if we do the work early."</p>

            <p>Rams captain Taylor Britt has given a ringing endorsement of his new coach, who is two years his junior.</p>
        
            <p>Their connection dates back about 15 years to when the pair were youngsters.</p>
        
            <p>Britt recalls first encountering an 11-year-old Clinton when he coached him at intermediate level.</p>
        
            <p>"He was in my younger brother's team," Britt said.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's a bit interesting having him as my coach now.</p>
        
            <p>"You could always see when Quinn got back from America and took over Christ's College that he was going to be an amazing coach.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got nothing but full confidence in him for this year."</p>
        
            <p>A shot at a third consecutive championship loomed large for the skipper, with the subject proving to be a talking point among fans and the public.</p>
        
            <p>"People are asking us about it, but we're trying to win it every year," Britt said.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess there is a bit of pressure because we've won the last two and we want to continue to keep winning,"</p>
        
            <p>Returning for his eighth season, Britt again shapes as a key senior figure among a fresh-faced squad.</p>
        
            <p>After leading the Rams to a second consecutive championship, the 28-year-old guard finished 2024 with multiple individual plaudits, including Most Outstanding New Zealand Guard and Most Improved Player gongs.</p>
        
            <p>He also earned his first All Star Five nod, an honour bestowed upon the best five players in the league each season.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Britt's recognition came off the back of a season average of 16.3 points, 6.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game.</p>
        
            <p>Among the quintet was the Rams' 6-foot-10 Australian import Lachlan Olbrich who clinched league MVP honours, and topped the defensive rebound season count.</p>
        
            <p>Although Olbrich was no longer a factor, Britt felt the side's blueprint needed little adjustment with their "local core" primed for another championship push.</p>
        
            <p>"We've always done a great job by committee here in Canterbury," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Like Tama Isaac, the stuff they've done in the off-season, I'm sure they want to take another leap in terms of what they did last season, same with all of the other local boys."</p>
        
            <p>Heading into his second season with the Rams, 18-year-old guard Tama Isaac was already exercising his leadership potential.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still new to this environment, but after a year here, it just makes me take a step up for the younger boys, link arms with them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The group is also bolstered by three fresh imports including American forward CJ Penha Jr, alongside Australian pair Kyle Bowen and Sean Macdonald.</p>
        
            <p>The 44th edition of the national competition tips off on Wednesday with the Hawke's Bay Hawks hosting NBL debutantes the Indian Panthers.</p>
        
            <p>The South Auckland-based newcomers are set to be largely depleted for their first ever clash, with at least eight of their front-line players unavailable due to "visa issues" and national team commitments.</p>
        
            <p>The Rams are on the road to begin their campaign, facing the Tauranga Whai at Mercury Baypark on Thursday.</p>
