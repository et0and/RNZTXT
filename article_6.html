            <p>Alex Iwobi scored deep in stoppage time as Fulham shocked sub-par Manchester United 2-1 in the Premier League, the London side's first win at Old Trafford since 2003 and second since 1963.</p>
        
            <p>United, who lost for the first time in six league matches, are sixth in the table on 44 points, eight behind fourth-placed Aston Villa. Fulham are 12th on 32 points.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm over the moon right now to come back into the team and get the win here -- there is no better feeling," Iwobi said. "We feel we performed really well and have been performing really well recently, it is just about getting the results."</p>
        
            <p>Fulham struck first when Calvin Bassey scored in the 65th minute, firing his own rebound into the roof of the net for his first goal for the Cottagers.</p>
        
            <p>United defender Harry Maguire equalised in the 89th minute with a half volley from inside the penalty area after the ball came off keeper Bernd Leno and the home team looked poised to salvage at least a point.</p>
        
            <p>But Iwobi, who earlier squandered two good chances, swept a shot past Andre Onana, who stood rooted in his goal, into the bottom corner in the 97th minute following a counter-attack to leave the home fans shell-shocked.</p>
        
            <p>Fulham manager Marco Silva joined his players to celebrate in front of the delirious visiting fans after the final whistle.</p>
        
            <p>United were missing injured striker Rasmus Hojlund, who scored in their six previous league games, and Alejandro Garnacho was their most dangerous forward with a shot cleared off the line by defender Antonee Robinson and another that Leno pushed away with a diving save.</p>
        
            <p>Fulham's victory was their first in 12 Premier League away games. United have suffered 10 league losses this season, more than in the whole of their 2022-23 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester City secured a hard-earned 1-0 victory at Bournemouth as Phil Foden's first-half goal moved them one point behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.</p>
        
            <p>Foden converted from close range in the 24th minute and it proved enough for Pep Guardiola's side who were well below their best against a feisty Bournemouth.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts looked capable of an equaliser after the break when Marcus Tavernier had two decent opportunities in quick succession and Enes Unal headed just wide at the death.</p>
        
            <p>City have 59 points from 26 games with Liverpool, who play Chelsea in the League Cup final on Sunday, on 60.</p>
