            <p>A New Zealand women's team has exceeded expectations to reach the quarterfinals of the inaugural Kho Kho World Cup in New Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>However, their journey came to an end after losing 71-26 to Uganda in the knockout stages of the competition on 17 January.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the defeat, the team's performance represented a significant milestone for the sport in New Zealand, where kho kho is slowly gaining recognition thanks to efforts by the Indian community to promote the ancient game.</p>
        
            <p>India dominated the tournament, winning both the men's and women's titles.</p>
        
            <p>The World Cup showcased kho kho's global appeal, with teams from 23 nations competing in this fast-paced, strategic sport.</p>

            <p>New Zealand captain Khushmeet Kaur Sidhu was proud of her team's efforts.</p>
        
            <p>"It was absolutely wonderful representing New Zealand on an international platform," she said. "Reaching the quarterfinals made me incredibly proud of the team."</p>
        
            <p>Sidhu credited the team's training programme and match strategy for getting into the knockout stages of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team was good at chasing, so we preferred chasing after winning the toss," she said. "That decision worked in our favor in most games."</p>
        
            <p>One of the highlights of the tournament was 11-year-old Parinoor Sidhu, the youngest player on the New Zealand team, who received a best player award in two matches.</p>
        
            <p>"Parinoor gained a lot of popularity among coaches from different teams," Sidhu said, praising the young player's impact. "She's incredibly talented in both chasing and defending."</p>

            <p>Other standout players included Eknoor Kaur, who won a best attacker award in one game, and Alyssa Fenemor, who secured both best attacker and best player awards in two matches.</p>
        
            <p>Sidhu said the tournament was a valuable learning experience for the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a great opportunity to see and learn from other teams and federations," she said. "Our aim is to make kho kho popular in New Zealand, and the next step is to get recognition from Sports New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, Sidhu was optimistic about kho kho's global future.</p>
        
            <p>"Kho kho is spreading globally and, hopefully, it will be included in the Olympics in the future," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Indian Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has also called for traditional Indian sports to be promoted on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, he reiterated the Indian government's commitment to making sure that kho kho is included in the Asian Games as well as the 2036 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>India has submitted a letter of intent to host the 2036 Olympics, with kho kho among six events the Sport Ministry's Mission Olympic Cell plans to recommend for inclusion, alongside Twenty20 cricket, kabaddi, chess and squash.</p>
        
            <p>"We did a splendid job organizing the Kho Kho World Cup, and we need to ensure these players get a chance to compete in the Asian Games," Mandaviya told Indian media.</p>
        
            <p>Kho kho was included as a demonstration sport at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and is a medal sport in the South Asian Games.</p>
        
            <p>Sidhu, who also serves as the general secretary of the New Zealand Kho Kho Federation, said her team is committed to growing the sport locally.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working hard to gain recognition from the New Zealand government so we can spread this game nationally, develop world-class players and compete against teams like India," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Sidhu said the New Zealand team was unique in possessing a couple of mother-daughter duos.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team stood out because we had two mums and daughters playing together," she said. "It was inspiring to see our ladies being active in sports at this age, and they received a lot of appreciation."</p>
