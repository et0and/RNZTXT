            <p>The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) has confirmed Britain's INEOS Britannia as the Challenger of Record for the 38th America's Cup, setting the stage for the next edition of sailing's most prestigious competition.</p>
        
            <p>The Challenger of Record will work with defender Emirates Team New Zealand to establish and finalise race rules and manage other challengers.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers have agreed to stick with the AC75 foiling monohull vessels, limit teams to building one new boat, and expand the number of preliminary regattas. The next Cup is expected within three years of the 2024 event, with the venue to be announced in the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>Additional challengers can enter the competition through qualifying regattas. The America's Cup is an open competition for any yacht club that meets the entry requirements, but the Challenger of Record plays a pivotal role in shaping the structure and ensuring the participation of other challengers.</p>
        
            <p>"This partnership ensures the America's Cup continues to grow," Emirates Team New Zealand chief executive Grant Dalton said.</p>
        
            <p>INEOS Britannia Chairman Bertie Bicket highlighted plans to cut costs and boost participation, including expanding the Women's and Youth America's Cups.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 America's Cup in Barcelona, where Emirates Team New Zealand defeated INEOS Britannia 7-2, drew record audiences. Both teams now aim to build on that success, further expanding the event's global appeal and commercial reach for the 38th edition.</p>
        
            <p>Britain has never won the America's Cup, which began in 1851 with a race around the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England.</p>
