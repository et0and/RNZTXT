            <p>The PGA Tour-LIV Golf made-for-TV matchup next month, featuring four of the sport's biggest names, will have a purse worth a minimum of $17 million in cryptocurrency.</p>
        
            <p>The newly named Crypto.com Showdown will see Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy of the PGA compete against Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau of LIV, in an 18-hole event at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>The match will feature "a multimillion-dollar purse to be paid in CRO cryptocurrency." It's unclear how much the winning and losing teams will receive.</p>
        
            <p>The prize money is more than most tournaments on the PGA Tour, other than majors and signature events, which are usually in the $14 -$15 million range.</p>
        
            <p>The winners of PGA events often take more than $1.7m.</p>
        
            <p>Crypto.com chief marketing officer Steve Kalifowitz said each of the four players will need to register with Crypto.com to be paid.</p>
        
            <p>Kalifowitz added that the players don't have to keep the cryptocurrency and can sell or trade their winnings.</p>
        
            <p>The contest is lined up as a Ryder Cup-style event, with match-play rounds of four-ball, singles and alternate shot.</p>
        
            <p>In a similar event in 2018, Phil Mickleson beat Tiger Woods in the first edition of "The Match" and took home the entire $15m prize.</p>
        
            <p>In February of this year, McIlroy won $4m after beating Max Homa, Rose Zhang and Lexi Thompson.</p>
