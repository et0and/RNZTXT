            <p>Returning from a potentially career-ending injury has cyclist Finn Fisher-Black excited about qualifying for the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Black recorded his best season as a pro-cyclist in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Riding for his UAE Team Emirates squad he won a stage on the Tour of Sicily and made the podium on a stage of the Vuelta a Espana.</p>
        
            <p>However in 2022 his fledgling career came crashing down to earth almost as hard as he did when he fell during the Boucles de la Mayene in France.</p>
        
            <p>He broke his femur close to the hip joint, possibly one of the worst places to suffer a fracture for a cyclist.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one you don't want to have in your first year as a pro and a broken leg can sometimes end a career," he told RNZ.</p>

            <p>"So I feel I can take a lot from how well I've come back this year and so hopefully I can keep it going.</p>
        
            <p>"I now feel I can cope with setbacks because I'm sure there will be a few more in my career."</p>
        
            <p>He said the team was fantastic during his recovery so he never felt under any stress about not riding and they built a programme for him to build towards the Vuelta Espana.</p>
        
            <p>"I came back (after ten months off) amped up to race again and I thought I'd return and just win.</p>
        
            <p>"But it was a reality check in my first race back and I crashed and I thought okay I'm a lot further back than I thought I was and so it was just about building that confidence again.</p>
        
            <p>However the 21 year old admits it wasn't easy at first and it took him some time to feel comfortable on the bike again.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just scared I was going to crash again and break my leg but I think that was normal and with each race I just got a bit more comfortable in the bunch.</p>
        
            <p>He does admit that 2023 had him on a good trajectory and he finished the season well at the Vuelta which will set him up for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Black said he and his team are both expecting him to take another step up in his career.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like i've gained a lot of respect within the team this year so hopefully next year they can give me some leadership roles.</p>
        
            <p>"So at some races I just have to say this is my day and go for a result and build from there.</p>
        
            <p>While he accepts that if he's selected to ride with the likes of Tadej Pogacar and Adam Yates then he has a support role, but he's not going to just settle on being a domestique (team rider).</p>
        
            <p>"Any 21 year old on the world tour wants to show themselves and get more of those leadership roles especially in the smaller races.</p>

            <p>"I really want to do another grand tour again as I learnt a lot from the Vuelta, it made a lot better rider both physically and with the experience."</p>
        
            <p>He is also very keen to get to the Paris Olympics where New Zealand has been allocated two road race spots and one for the time trial.</p>
        
            <p>"A grand tour I'd still consider an opportunity to gain experience as it's hard for me to get results, whereas growing up as a kiwi the Olympics is the biggest thing you can do in sports so its always going to be the main goal.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the time trial would be good for me, I did ten of them this year and was given a good programme for them so it'll be good if I can get a few in in early 2024."</p>
        
            <p>He does face some tough competition to gain the TT spot with New Zealand having a number of world class riders including Patrick Bevan and Aaron Gate.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Black is based in Andorra but is currently back in New Zealand for christmas with his family including sister Niamh who is also a pro cyclist.</p>
        
            <p>He's back in full training with his first race of the season the Tour Down Under in South Australia in January.</p>
        
            <p>He hopes to share the leadership role there with UAE Team Emirates team-mate, Australian Jay Vine, who is the defending champion.</p>
