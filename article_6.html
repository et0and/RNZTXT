            <p>The White Ferns beat South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Dubai on Monday to win almost $4 million in prizemoney, with each player receiving $256,000.</p>
        
            <p>The win was New Zealand's first T20 World Cup win, having finished runners-up to Australia at the 2010 tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The one-off win outstrips the money-leading White Ferns receive under their New Zealand Cricket contracts.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, New Zealand Cricket made match payments the same for men and women at both international and domestic level.</p>
        
            <p>This meant the highest-ranked White Ferns would be able to receive a maximum of $163,246 a year, with match-fee payments of $4250 per one-day international and $2750 for each T20.</p>
        
            <p>The ICC said the historic prize money not only aligned with their vision for parity between the men's and women's games, but further elevates the status of the women's T20 World Cup as one of the premier events in the calendar.</p>
        
            <p>The win couldn't have come at a better time according to those involved in the women's game in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket Head of Female Engagement Jess Davidson said the win has already had an impact.</p>
        
            <p>"Just this week, we've already seen an increase in the number of girls eager to register for cricket this summer," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"NZC has been investing significantly into the women's game at the community and pathway level for some time, and a watershed moment like this is exactly what we need.</p>
        
            <p>"For young wāhine, we hope this highlights the opportunities to earn a really good living, travel the world playing at amazing venues - all while being a full-time contracted cricketer and representing your country."</p>
        
            <p>The side is currently in India playing a three-match one-day series but arrive home on Friday, 1 November with NZC planning events around the country to celebrate the team's success.</p>
