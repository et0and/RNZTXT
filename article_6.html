            <p>Many of the world's top golfers are chasing a medal at Le Golf National in Guyancourt near Paris - among them Kiwis Ryan Fox and Daniel Hillier.</p>
        
            <p>Hillier played the French Open on the same course last year and says the players will have to be on top of their game once the first round starts tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're slightly off you'll get punished."</p>
        
            <p>The Olympics was different because everyone was chasing just three medals.</p>
        
            <p>"Usually you walk out into a tournament and you knock off a top ten [finish] and you're pretty happy with your work.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty cut-throat in that regard but you've got to finish in the top three to earn anything for your country. If you do manage that it's a pretty amazing achievement."</p>
        
            <p>All the golfers would be adjusting their game plans slightly to give themselves the best chance of a podium finish, Hillier says.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Football Ferns have lost their Group A match 2-1 against France at the Olympic Games in Paris this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders finished bottom of the group while France are top and advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
        
            <p>Last night Hamish Wilde won New Zealand's second medal of the Games - silver in the men's triathlon.</p>
