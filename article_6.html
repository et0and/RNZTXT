            <p>Canberra Raiders have overpowered NZ Warriors 30-8 in the 2025 NRL season-opener at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, dealing an early blow to the Auckland club's hopes of reaching the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>The 'home' side in the US showcase needed only six minutes to grab the lead through a try to Kiwi centre Seb Kris and extended their advantage through winger Xavier Savage before the half hour.</p>
        
            <p>Moments later, Savage doubled down with a length-of-the-field try that may have been the defining moment of the contest. The Warriors were pressing hard on attack, but Luke Metcalf's final pass to winger Roger Tuivasa-Sheck was picked off by Savage, who went untouched, as he sprinted away.</p>
        
            <p>Second-rower Kurt Capewell had the Warriors on the scoreboard with a try before halftime, but Kris also had his second soon after the restart, when fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad spilled a high kick near his goal-line.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis centre Matt Timoko had a try disallowed for Canberra, through obstruction, but wasn't to be denied, when he received a pass on halfway and beat the last defender to score.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors had plenty of chances to score and finally responded, when Raiders captain Joseph Tapine was sin-binned for a shoulder charge on counterpart Mitch Barnett. With a numerical advantage, they put Tuivasa-Sheck into the left corner for a try, but had run out of time to make any kind of comeback.</p>
        
            <p>"Awesome experience, but very disappointed not to get the two points," reflected hooker Wayde Egan. "We just gave them too much ball in the first half and didn't complete well.</p>
        
            <p>"We gave them too many chances - they took their chances and we probably didn't. A lot to build on for next week.</p>
        
            <p>"Raiders are tough and fit, and showed they will be hard to beat."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors' next outing will be against Manly Sea Eagles at Go Media Stadium on Friday, 14 March.</p>
