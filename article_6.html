            <p>The unbeaten Wellington Phoenix have climbed to the top of the men's A-League standings with a 1-0 win over Melbourne City at Auckland's Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The home side's winning goal came just after halftime through a slick move to set up Bozhidar Kraev, before holding out a late charge from Melbourne City, highlighted by penalty save in the 74th minute from goalkeeper Alex Paulsen, denying the visitors' prolific striker Jamie Maclaren.</p>
        
            <p>Paulsen was a standout figure throughout, even standing tall in the final act of the game when he produced a reaction save to a point blank-range from Terry Antonis.</p>

            <p>Bulgarian Kraev stepped up in the absence of injured star striker Oskar Zawada to score the crucial goal.</p>
        
            <p>It completed a move that began when midfielder Mohamed Al-Taay provided a neat pass to David Ball, whose low cross found Kraev at the far post.</p>
        
            <p>Kraev was nearly the villain when his foul conceded the penalty, when he brought down Hamza Sakhi off the ball in the penalty box, picking up a yellow card in the process.</p>
        
            <p>The result continued Wellington's proud record in Auckland, where they've only been beaten once in 17 matches.</p>
        
            <p>It could be their final "home" game in Auckland following the midweek announcement New Zealand's largest city will be home to an A-League franchise from next season.</p>
        
            <p>It means the Phoenix - thriving under first-year coach Giancarlo Italiano - have notched three wins and two draws from their opening five games, their best start to any campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's next game is away to Western United on Saturday next week.</p>
