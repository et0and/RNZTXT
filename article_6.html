            <p>New Zealand rebounded from their Olympic qualifying disappointment by beating Japan 1-0 in a women's hockey series in Albany.</p>
        
            <p>A late winner from Rose Tynan lifted the Black Sticks women to a 2-1 win in Albany on Sunday, a day after the teams played out a 1-1 draw at the same venue.</p>
        
            <p>It was a positive return to the fray, three months after New Zealand failed to advance from their pool at the Paris Olympics qualiying tournament in India, leaving them shut out of the Games for the first time in 28 years.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Olivia Shannon was delighted with the nature of the victory, having often struggled in the closing stages of matches, including Saturday's game, when Japan found a late equaliser.</p>
        
            <p>"The girls really stepped up today," Shannon told TVNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in the past, we've really not put that fourth quarter to bed so to be able to put that fourth quarter to bed was really good. So proud of the girls."</p>

            <p>After a scoreless first half on Sunday, the Black Sticks took control after the interval, forcing three successive penalty corners, with Fran Davies converting from the third.</p>
        
            <p>Japan threatened a repeat of game one when Miyu Hasugawa scored with four minutes remaining but New Zealand responded less than a minute late with Tynan's winner via a powerful reverse shot.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Sticks' next assignment is the eight-team Nations Cup in Spain in early June.</p>
