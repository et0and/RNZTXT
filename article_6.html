            <p>Minnows Uruguay stunned rugby sevens powerhouses Fiji and New Zealand on a remarkable opening day of the world sevens series' Perth leg on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The South Americans launched an epic comeback to beat Olympic silver medalists Fiji 24-17 and followed that with an audacious 17-12 win over the All Black Sevens.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji, who had beaten Uruguay 70-7 in Cape Town in December, took a 17-0 lead before the Uruguayans pulled off a jaw dropping comeback with Pedro Hoblog's late try sealing an historic win.</p>
        
            <p>They then shocked the 14-time champions New Zealand to earn their first-ever sevens win over the All Blacks Sevens.</p>
        
            <p>Uruguay outlasted New Zealand in a tense battle in the second half, dominating possession and capitalising on Kiwi errors with Juan Manuel Tafernaberry slotting a penalty attempt from close range in the 15th minute to complete the win.</p>
        
            <p>"Amazing! It's unbelievable what we have achieved here," Uruguay men's captain Diego Ardao said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more than just two games, it's about who we faced and proving we can beat them. For us it is huge and helps us to build our confidence for what awaits next. We give everything for the team and for each other on the pitch."</p>
