            <p>Competition leaders the Wellington Phoenix drew nil-all with Perth Glory in the A-League to extend their lead to six points at the top of table.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides went close to breaking the deadlock with Phoenix striker Ben Old hitting the post and Perth's Adam Taggart sending two efforts just wide.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano said the result was pleasing given the run of injuries to key players the side has been managing in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that we picked up four points in two games away from home, I'm very happy," Giancarlo Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had some injury concerns and bringing back players."</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington coach said the decision to stay in Australia ahead of the game had paid dividends.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix beat Macarthur 2-1 in Sydney last weekend in the first leg of their Australian trip.</p>
        
            <p>"The long trip is difficult. If we had gone home and come back I think we would have been in all sorts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"More importantly the time zone...even though there's a five hour difference, it's just that travel, and all those things are very important."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix's six-point lead on the points table is likely to come under threat sooner rather than later.</p>
        
            <p>Nearest rivals Central Coast Mariners and Melbourne Victory play each other on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>If there is a winner, Wellington's lead will be cut to three.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix return home to host Adelaide United next Sunday.</p>
