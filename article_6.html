        <h2>England recover to beat Italy 27-24 in opening Six Nations clash</h2>
        <p>
England recovered from a scruffy start and a 17-8 deficit to beat Italy 27-24 in their opening Six Nations game in Rome, ending a run of four successive opening round defeats in the championship.

            <p>England recovered from a scruffy start and a 17-8 deficit to beat Italy 27-24 in their opening Six Nations game in Rome, ending a run of four successive opening round defeats in the championship.</p>
        
            <p>Italy flew out of the blocks with a Tommaso Allan penalty and a well-created try for Alessandro Garbisi and though Elliot Daly hit back for England, their new-look side looked disorganised, not least when Allan flew through for the hosts' second try.</p>
        
            <p>Two George Ford penalties closed the gap to 17-14 at halftime, somewhat flattering for England, but they took control in the second period, starting when scrumhalf Alex Mitchell showed great determination to claim their second try.</p>
        
            <p>Ford's boot stretched the lead and more aggressive defence kept Italy at bay until Monty Ioane broke through for a converted try in added time to earn Italy a losing bonus point.</p>
