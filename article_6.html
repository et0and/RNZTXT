            <p>Rugby Australia's board has elected former Wallaby Daniel Herbert as the new Chair of the governing body in the wake of the resignation of Hamish McLennan.</p>
        
            <p>According to The Guardian the embattled McLennan, who had vowed to continue in the position, was handed a deadline on the weekend to consider his future as leader of the sport's governing body.</p>
        
            <p>It continues a tumultuous period for Australian rugby, highlighted by a disastrous World Cup campaign overseen by coach Eddie Jones, who has since departed.</p>
        
            <p>The sacking of coach Dave Rennie and appointment of Jones, which some dubbed as McLennan's "captain's pick", proved an utter failure.</p>
        
            <p>Wallaby number 715, Herbert played 67 Tests for Australia, and was a part of the Wallabies teams that won the 1999 Rugby World Cup, 2001 British and Irish Lions Series, The Rugby Championship and five straight Bledisloe Cups.</p>
        
            <p>Following his playing career, Herbert held roles with the Queensland Rugby Union before embarking on a corporate career. He has been on the board of Rugby Australia since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>A Rugby Australia media release said the board considered that Herbert's experience was ideally suited to leading the development of the game from the grassroots to the elite level, across women's and men's Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, he is well placed to lead the board's continued and unwavering commitment to Rugby Australia's strategy of aligning the game across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby Australia's new Chair Dan Herbert said: "It has never been more important for the Rugby Australia board, working with Member Unions, to come together and execute the reform we absolutely need for an aligned high-performance system and to deliver on the commitments we have made, including to invest in Community and Women's Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"Australia will host the British and Irish Lions Tour in 2025, the Men's 2027 Rugby World Cup and the Women's 2029 Rugby World Cup and the 2032 Olympic Games - the reform we progress now will underpin the competitiveness of our national teams, as well as building deeper engagement with the Rugby community and fans everywhere."</p>
        
            <p>"We note that the different Member Unions are not opposing Rugby Australia's centralisation proposals and remain committed to supporting high performance alignment."</p>
        
            <p>The board acknowledged the strategic agenda that McLennan had been instrumental in driving, through COVID and other challenges, ensuring that Rugby in Australia continued through very challenging times.</p>
        
            <p>He departs the role of Chair having been a central figure in Australia securing the hosting rights to major Rugby events that will inspire generations of players and supporters, as well as delivering the current broadcast rights deal and helping to turn around the governing body's financial position.</p>
