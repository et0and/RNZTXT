        <h2>NBA: Timberwolves keep finals hopes alive</h2>
        <p>
The Minnesota Timberwolves have kept alive their hopes of making the NBA finals with a 105-100 win over the Dallas Mavericks in game four of the best of seven Western Conference finals.

            <p>With their first win in the best-of-seven series, the Timberwolves are hoping to become the first team in NBA history to come back from 3-nil down and make it to the finals.</p>
        
            <p>The win came on the back of Anthony Edwards' game-high 29 points and Karl-Anthony Towns' recalibrated long-range shooting form.</p>
        
            <p>Winning the series was not on the team's radar in Game 4, Edwards insisted afterward.</p>
        
            <p>"We just wanted to get one game and extend the series," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been swept in my career. I didn't want to get swept. Not on their home court, hearing their fans talk trash all day."</p>
        
            <p>Luka Doncic posted a 28-point, 15-rebound, 10-assist triple-double for the fifth-seeded Mavericks, who won the first two games of the series in a previous trip to Minneapolis.</p>
        
            <p>After Minnesota led by as many as 12 early on, the teams battled on even terms for the first 18-plus minutes of the second-half, with a Towns 3-pointer with 5:41 remaining giving the Timberwolves a 92-90 lead.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors never trailed again, thanks in large part to Towns, whose 3-pointer on Minnesota's next possession made it a five-point game.</p>

            <p>Dallas' best chance to draw even down the stretch came when Doncic misfired on a 3-pointer with the hosts trailing 95-92 with 3:18 to go.</p>
        
            <p>When Towns connected again from beyond the arc with 2:54 to go, and Edwards followed with a bank shot in the lane 67 seconds later, the Timberwolves had broken things open at 100-92.</p>
        
            <p>"That was on me," shouldered Doncic. " didn't give enough energy."</p>
        
            <p>A desperation 3-pointer by Doncic as he was being fouled with 13.2 seconds left kept the Mavericks alive at 103-100, but Doncic missed the subsequent free throw.</p>
        
            <p>After a timeout, Naz Reid got behind the Dallas defence for a game-clinching layup with 11.3 seconds remaining.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd never lost three in a row until earlier in the playoffs. We've never lost four in a row," Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said.</p>
        
            <p>"The guys responded. Fun team to coach because they always believe they can win no matter what."</p>
        
            <p>"They won one game," Doncic said. "We got to focus on the next one."</p>
