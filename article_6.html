            <p>New Zealand golfer Daniel Hillier has grabbed the lead after the third round of the $16 million Dubai Desert Classic.</p>
        
            <p>Hillier started the day a shot off the lead but after a scintillating start was soon in front.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellingtonian had been four shots clear at one stage after three birdies in his first five holes.</p>
        
            <p>However, three consecutive bogeys from the 13th closed the field up again.</p>
        
            <p>Hillier birdied the 17th and parred the last for a two under par 70 and 13 under for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>He is one shot ahead of England's Tyrrell Hatton, while fellow-kiwi improved to fourth, four shots behind Hillier.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a grind," Hillier told the DP World Tour.</p>
        
            <p>"I figured it was going to be that at the start of the day with all that wind. It was tough but I enjoyed it out there. Have a crack at it tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Hillier has won once before on the tour, with victory at the 2023 British Masters.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think I've played with Tyrrell before, so that should be fun. It will be a good test. He'll be raring to get his hands on that trophy but I'd love to do the same. It will be a fun day.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be life-changing. Last year was pretty tough. It was a bit of a grind. I was getting pretty frustrated with myself towards the end of the year. Gave myself a little bit of a break and time to reset, and I'm feeling refreshed. Yeah, excited for tomorrow."</p>
