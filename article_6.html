            <p>Shattered All Blacks Sevens players have spoken of their devastation in the wake of being shunted out of medal contention at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders' momentum in the men's sevens had been building nicely with a win over Ireland to make the quarter-finals, but came to a shuddering halt at the hands of a defensively brilliant South African team, who now advance to the semifinals, while the highest the All Blacks Sevens can finish is fifth.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa won 14-7, with both teams scoreless in the second half, as the Kiwi side turned over too much ball under pressure.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Scott Curry called it a ''massive disappointment'' as fellow players struggled to find words.</p>
        
            <p>"One minute you think you are all right, the next minute you are in tears. It's tough.''</p>

            <p>Curry praised South Africa for their defensive effort.</p>
        
            <p>"They just scrambled so well, we made a lot of half-breaks, half opportunities but they just shut them all down.''</p>
        
            <p>Captain Dylan Collier was close to tears as he said dealing with the defeat was extremely difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely a lot of hurt in that changing room,'' he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we started the tournament really well and were building into our games, and we just weren't good enough tonight and couldn't quite execute when it counted.''</p>
        
            <p>Collier said his immediate priority after media interviews was family.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just looking forward to getting back to the village and calling my kids, because it will definitely take my mind off it. They are still getting up and going to school, they are still love me for me, for being a dad, so I am actually looking forward to doing that and taking my mind off it.''</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks Sevens have a day off before two games at the weekend as they try to finish with a likely farewell to some of their veterans.</p>
        
            <p>Curry wasn't saying whether the Olympics signalled the end of his long career.</p>
        
            <p>"You never know when your last chance is to put that jersey on so I just cherish every time I get that opportunity. We have two more chances this weekend,'' he said.</p>
        
            <p>Curry, 36, who made his Sevens international debut in 2010, and Collier are among those in the veteran stage and coach Tomasi Cama acknowledged that "some of the players are getting on" as he indicated a review after the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to make sure we do the right thing by the team. If they have to move on we have to make sure they do that right as well, because they have been long servants for this team and great ambassadors for the team and for a lot of young players coming through."</p>
        
            <p>Cama lamented the team not getting "flow'' into their game, instead forcing matters and being pressured into mistakes.</p>
        
            <p>The coach said he felt for his players. "We came here and tried to give everything, but it wasn't our night and South African took their chances.</p>
        
            <p>"The game is ruthless. In finals footy you can't hesitate, you have to be decisive and take the opportunities. We created errors and weren't patient enough to build phases and create more opportunities."</p>
        
            <p>Injuries to Regan Ware and Ngarohi McGarvey-Black meant they missed the South African match and that had an effect, but wasn't an excuse for the loss, Cama said.</p>
