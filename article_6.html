        <h2>Breakers' Christmas Day game a NZ first</h2>
        <p>
Games on 25 December are popular in the NBA, but Breakers chief executive officer Lisa Edser says the concept is harder to sell in New Zealand.

            <p>The Breakers will take to the basketball court in a New Zealand sporting first on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Their NBL game against the Tasmania JackJumpers in Hobart marks the first time a New Zealand sports team has played on Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>Historically, such games were popular in basketball, with the NBA first playing on 25 December in 1947.</p>
        
            <p>The NBL introduced Christmas Day games in 2022 and this year two games are on the schedule - the JackJumpers versus Breakers, followed by a top of the table clash between the Sydney Kings and Illawarra Hawks in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>All four teams have Christmas-themed playing kit.</p>

            <p>Breakers chief executive officer Lisa Edser said the concept suited the Australians and Americans but might be harder to sell in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't imagine a New Zealand audience going to a game on Christmas Day. I could be completely wrong, but we haven't had to do it for a number of years so it is our turn.</p>
        
            <p>"We're somewhat fortunate this season that we don't have a lot of players with children. If this had been last year there would have been a lot of guys affected by it ... but that's not the case."</p>
        
            <p>With three Americans, six Australians and a Mexican teenager on the roster, Edser saw an upside to the team playing on the holiday when many of them were away from family.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be nice for the guys to be together, I guess - at least they're not alone."</p>
        
            <p>Playing on Christmas Day had an impact on the whole Breakers organisation, Edser said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though it is an away game [the team's] social media is following it, our marketing manager is still [working] - so pretty much all of us will be involved in one way or another."</p>
        
            <p>Hosting a Christmas Day NBL game in New Zealand could come with complications due to venue availability, Edser said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we had an amazing outdoor venue [such as] an open roof arena, like [Melbourne's] Rod Laver Arena or something, I think it could be quite exciting."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers had spent most of the current season on the road, travelling to different venues within New Zealand and Australia - including their last 11 games in 11 different venues.</p>
        
            <p>Following the game against the JackJumpers, the Breakers travel to Cairns to play the Taipans on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers are on a seven-game losing streak, having not won at all in December. Their last victory was over the Taipans on 16 November.</p>
