            <p>All Blacks assistant coach Jason Ryan says the team has made 'good gains' despite losing their last two test matches. The team has arrived in Sydney for Saturday's first Bledisloe Cup test of the year, after a week where Ryan said they'd "looked hard at ourselves".</p>
        
            <p>"(We've looked) at areas where we can improve and areas where we've made good gains," said Ryan, after the recent trip to South Africa yielded two close losses to the Springboks.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a big series against the best team in the world. We've learned from the different pressure cycles in the games."</p>
        
            <p>Given the Springboks are back-to-back world champions, it is tempting to treat the two results as a net positive given the immense challenge and hostile atmosphere. However, Ryan admitted the All Blacks are seeing the trip as a missed opportunity.</p>

            <p>"I think it's a bit of both to be honest with you. We feel like we've missed the opportunities and we need to finish better, in all honesty. There are different areas of the game that we need to be honest about.</p>
        
            <p>"Full credit to the South Africans, they're world champions and right on top of their game. That's where we want to get to. But we are still praising the boys for the effort, in that intensity over there is pretty special. I think optimistic is a great word to use. We are excited by how hard we pushed South Africa but we're not satisfied by not getting across the line. In a weird way when you don't get the victories you look harder at yourself."</p>
        
            <p>However, Ryan was in no doubt about the extremely high standards the All Blacks have set for themselves.</p>

            <p>"Let's not sugarcoat it, we've lost two tests in a row. But we're optimistic about where we're heading."</p>
        
            <p>The All Black forward effort was solid, with the much vaunted Springbok lineout drive generally taken care of. Ryan said that there were still things to work on, though.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some areas we're tidying up, the big rocks of our set piece we've had guys standing up and competing for their spots, which I think is quite satisfying."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan will come against his former colleague Joe Schmidt, who has taken over the Wallabies and enlisted the help of long time All Black scrum coach Mike Cron as well. He expects a fast-paced game against the Australians, who are reeling after a record 67-27 defeat to Argentina.</p>

            <p>"They'll want to play fast, (Schmidt) puts a lot of work into the breakdown side of things and he's had a good influence on their side already. We've got so much respect for Australia. This test match is different, it's the Bledisloe Cup. It's a trophy that's really dear to the All Blacks' heartâ€¦every Bledisloe Cup match you have to earn and we'll prepare accordingly."</p>
        
            <p>Despite being comfortable favourites for the test, the pressure is on the All Blacks to start turning around a four-win, three-loss season already.</p>
        
            <p>"Pressure is a privilege," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"It should never be a burden, especially when you're coaching this team."</p>
