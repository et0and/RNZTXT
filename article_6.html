            <p>Despite their dream A-League run, Auckland FC won't be sleeping on their final five fixtures as the business end of the season approaches.</p>
        
            <p>The competition's newest franchise continue to make a mockery of their pre-season expectations, as they sit seven points clear at the top of the points table.</p>
        
            <p>With just five rounds remaining until the playoffs, the Premiers Plate is quickly becoming Auckland's to lose.</p>
        
            <p>However, coach Steve Corica is not allowing his players to look beyond their immediate future.</p>
        
            <p>"Week by week, until it's done, anything can happen. We have got some really important games coming up against teams that are going to be in the finals starting this week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it's imperative that his side remains grounded.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to finish the season strong, we want to win the premiership. That's our main focus right now. We treat the finals a little bit differently and it's a long way off in my mind. Obviously, we will be in the finals. That's a positive for a new club that's in the first year. But our focus is on winning trophies right now and there's a fair bit of work to do before that happens."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's 2-0 defeat of Brisbane at the weekend stretched the side's unbeaten run to 10 games.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys have worked extremely hard to get in this position, we had a few little hiccups along the way with the draws, but that makes you stronger and the way we came back against Brisbane, and got through unscathed was really pleasing."</p>
        
            <p>Those hiccups included a 4-4 draw with Adelaide United which while thrilling for fans, was a frustrating watch for Corica.</p>
        
            <p>"We've conceded a few goals of late so we wanted to really make sure we get back to our best and that's defending as a unit, everyone doing their job, working hard for each other."</p>
        
            <p>The next challenge awaiting Auckland will be Western Sydney Wanderers back at Mount Smart on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"They are a very good attacking team. They are the highest goal scorers in the league. So defensively, we'll have to be very strong again this week."</p>
        
            <p>Several squad members are of course still riding high from the All Whites World Cup qualification, among them Nando Pijnaker who reiterated the need to not start thinking about finals just yet.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to keep pushing, keep trying to get results, get wins and then we'll see. So I'm trying not to think too much about it and I don't think anyone else is. The coaches are keeping us humble."</p>
