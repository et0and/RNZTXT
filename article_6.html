            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko dropped down the leaderboard but is still in contention heading into the final round of the Women's Scottish Open.</p>
        
            <p>Ko was in a three-way tie for third, just two shots off the pace after two rounds.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic gold medallist is now sixth on the leaderboard, after firing a 71 to sit at 7-under, five shots off new leader American Lauren Coughlin.</p>
        
            <p>Coughlin carded a 6-under-par 66 to seize a one-stroke lead.</p>
        
            <p>Coughlin, who earned her first career LPGA win last month at the CPKC Women's Open, collected six birdies during her round to reside at 12-under 204 for the tournament at Dundonald Links.</p>
        
            <p>She rolled in a birdie on the 18th hole to give her a one-shot lead over Megan Khang, who shared the 36-hole lead with two-time major champion Minjee Lee of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Khang totalled three birdies during her bogey-free round, with her final one coming after a long putt on the 17th hole.</p>
        
            <p>Olympic silver medalist Esther Henseleit (66) of Germany recorded an eagle on the par-5 14th hole to go along with five birdies and one bogey.</p>
        
            <p>Henseleit and Charley Hull (69) of England are tied for third place at 9-under, one stroke ahead of Lee (72).</p>
