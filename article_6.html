        <p>
The Black Caps have "ticked al the boxes so far" and need one final effort in Dubai, wicketkeeper Tom Latham says. Audio

            <p>New Zealand booked their place in the final of the Champions Trophy against India after sparkling hundreds by Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson helped them earn a 50-run victory over South Africa in the second semi-final on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Electing to bat, the Black Caps racked up a tournament record 362-6 on the back of a 164-run stand between Ravindra and Williamson.</p>
        
            <p>David Miller smashed an unbeaten 100 off 67 balls while Rassie van der Dussen and Temba Bavuma struck half-centuries as South Africa managed 312-9 in reply.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Santner, captaining New Zealand in a global tournament for the first time, used seven bowlers and led by example with a match-turning 3-43.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a cool feeling (to make the final). We were challenged by a good side," Santner said after the runfest at the Gaddafi Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"We were pretty happy with 360 obviously but we know with the power South Africa have, it was going to be a challenge."</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper Tom Latham told Morning Report it was another all round performance by the side.</p>
        
            <p>"It was obviously set up by Rachin and Kane who put on a fantastic partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"The bowlers did the job and the spinners through the middle have been fantastic all tour and they managed to do the job again today.</p>
        
            <p>"Captain Mitch Santner led by example and I thought his spell to pick up three crucial wickets was probably the difference in the game."</p>
        
            <p>Looking at the final, Latham said it was fortunate that they have experienced the wickets in the UAE.</p>
        
            <p>"You go in with an idea of what the wicket might play like and the one we played on there certainly got a lot harder to bat on.</p>
        
            <p>"The one they (India) played on in their semi-final looked a lot better so hopefully it's a good surface.</p>
        
            <p>"We've obviously ticked all the boxes so far in terms of where we want to be and one more big push in a couple of days' time and hopefully we can be where we want to be at the end."</p>

            <p>Ravindra and Williamson combined in a mammoth second-wicket stand in what looked like the coming together of the present and future of New Zealand's batting.</p>
        
            <p>The curly-haired Ravindra and the cool-as-a-cucumber Williamson scored over a run-a-ball rate to deflate South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson got a reprieve after completing his fifty when Heinrich Klaasen dived to his right but could not hold on to the catch.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra was flawless at the other end and raced to a 93-ball hundred before Kagiso Rabada dismissed him for 108, which included 13 fours and a six.</p>
        
            <p>All of Ravindra's five hundreds in one-day internationals have come in ICC events.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson played two ramp shots in Wiaan Mulder's sixth over - the first brought up his 15th ODI hundred and the second his downfall. Williamson's 102 was studded with 10 fours and two sixes.</p>

            <p>Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips chipped in with brisk 49s as New Zealand eclipsed Australia's 356-5 against England last month as the highest team total in the tournament's history.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand began their defence well as Kyle Jamieson started with a maiden over and Matt Henry got rid of Ryan Rickelton in his third.</p>
        
            <p>Bavuma (56) and Van der Dussen (69) revived South Africa with a run-a-ball stand of 105 before Santner hollowed out their middle order.</p>
        
            <p>The spinner removed both the set batters and dismissed Heinrich Klaasen to put New Zealand on top.</p>
        
            <p>Player of the match Ravindra dismissed Aiden Markram (31) but Miller would not go down without a fight.</p>
        
            <p>He smacked four sixes and 10 fours in his blistering knock that proved South Africa could have done better with enough wickets in hand.</p>
        
            <p>"363 was always going to be tough," Bavuma said.</p>
        
            <p>"We needed someone to play well. David did that but we needed someone else."</p>
        
            <p>"Credit to their batters, they put us under pressure."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will fly to Dubai for Sunday's final against India, who prevailed when the sides faced each other in a group match.</p>
        
            <p>India have refused to tour Pakistan because of the strained political relations between the Asian neighbours and have played all their matches in Dubai.</p>
