            <p>Japan's Naomi Osaka will meet Denmark's Clara Tauson in the final of the ASB Classic in Auckland after an action-packed day.</p>
        
            <p>Osaka, a two-time winner of both the Australian and US Opens, was too strong for American Alsyha Parks in her semi final winning 6-4 6-2, while the fifth seeded Tauson beat the hard-hitting American Robin Montgomery 6-4 6-3.</p>
        
            <p>The performance from Tauson was all the more impressive, having also beaten top seed Madison Keys earlier in the day 6-4 7-6, after that match couldn't be completed last night due to poor weather.</p>
        
            <p>Remarkably, she will have to play a third match later tonight, the women's doubles semi-final, with her American partner Sloane Stephens against Aleksandra Krunic and Sabrina Santamaria.</p>
        
            <p>Parks also had to double up on day six of the Classic.</p>
        
            <p>She beat Katie Volynets 6-1 6-4 in an all-American quarter-final, but couldn't repeat Tauson's feats beaten comfortably by Osaka.</p>

            <p>The final will be Tauson's third of her professional career, and while the 22-year-old won those past two WTA finals, she told Sky Sport it was a while ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think I can take anything [from those wins], it's been some years since I've been in a final so I'm just going to try and enjoy it as much as I can.</p>
        
            <p>"It means everything, I've really worked hard to get to this level again after many injuries so I'm super happy with this result."</p>
        
            <p>Osaka will be in her 12th career final, but her first for three years, after having time out of the game for the birth of her daughter in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's final will start just after 5pm.</p>
