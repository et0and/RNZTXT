            <p>A century from Rachin Ravindra has guided the Black Caps to a comfortable victory over Bangladesh and a place in the Champions Trophy semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand won by five wickets in Rawalpindi.</p>
        
            <p>After being put into bat Bangladesh scored 236 for nine in their 50 overs with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto top scoring with 77.</p>
        
            <p>Spinner Michael Bracewell took four wickets for 26 runs, while fast bowler Will O'Rourke took two for 48.</p>
        
            <p>In reply New Zealand lost Will Young in the first over without scoring while Kane Williamson made just five.</p>
        
            <p>They were 15 for two at one stage.</p>
        
            <p>However Ravindra and Devon Conway (30) put on 57 runs for the third wicket and then in combination with Tom Latham, Ravindra helped guide the Black Caps towards victory.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra was dismissed for 112. His innings including 12 fours and one six. It was his fourth ODI century.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Latham was dismissed for 55.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips finished unbeaten on 21 and Michael Bracewell was 11 not out.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand got home with 23 balls to spare.</p>
