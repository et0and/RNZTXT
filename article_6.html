            <p>The Black Caps have lost two key players to injury ahead of the side's five-match T20 tour of Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>Opening batter Finn Allen has suffered a back injury and pace bowler Adam Milne an ankle injury, both while training in the lead-up to the tour.</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper batsman Tom Blundell and all-rounder Zak Foulkes have been called into the squad as replacements.</p>
        
            <p>Foulkes, from Canterbury, will join a Black Caps squad for the first time, while the experienced Blundell toured Pakistan last year and will provide solid cover in terms of wicket-keeping and top-order batting.</p>
        
            <p>The team flies out for Pakistan on Friday night, with the opening match in Rawalpindi next Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel for both Finn and Adam, suffering injuries so close to the start of the tour. They have been strong performers for us in the T20 format since the last World Cup," coach Gary Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our support staff and medical networks will be working closely with both players over the next few weeks to complete plans for their treatment and subsequent return to cricket."</p>

            <p>"Zak has had an impressive season for Canterbury including being their leading wicket -taker in all three competitions. He has displayed impressive skills with the ball, particularly in T20 cricket for the Kings.</p>
        
            <p>"We also know he has skills with the bat, and it will be an excellent opportunity for him to be part of the group."</p>
        
            <p>Tom Bruce was considered for selection, but made himself unavailable for family reasons and to continue with his current contract with Lancashire.</p>

            <p>All-rounder Michael Bracewell will lead the side, returning to international cricket for the first time in over a year after injury problems.</p>
        
            <p>Many first-choice players were unavailable for the tour, with Trent Boult, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner and Kane Williamson all unavailable due to Indian Premier League commitments.</p>
        
            <p>Will Young was also unavailable for selection as he takes up a winter contract with Nottinghamshire, as was Tom Latham, who is awaiting the birth of his second child.</p>
        
            <p>Test skipper Tim Southee is being rested while Colin Munro was also unavailable for selection.</p>
