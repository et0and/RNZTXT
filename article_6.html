            <p>A hattrick to debutant Kyle Preston has powered the Crusaders to a 33-25 win over the Hurricanes at Apollo Projects Stadium in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The effort would have felt more than a little ironic for Hurricanes fans, since the halfback was lured south last season from Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was the visitors that got the brighter start: two tries to hooker Jacob Devery gave them a 14-0 lead into a stiff easterly breeze.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders hit back through Preston, who had come on inside the opening 10 minutes for Noah Hotham.</p>
        
            <p>He was sent under the posts by Will Jordan for his first, however, the Hurricanes headed into the break with an eight point-lead thanks to a stunning finish in the corner by Kini Naholo.</p>
        
            <p>Preston scored his second off a beautiful counter-attack started by Jordan, who got the ball wide to Sevu Reece.</p>
        
            <p>The All Black winger sent a kick back infield and Preston was on hand to score under the posts.</p>
        
            <p>Reece then scored the go ahead try with 15 minutes to go, finishing off another Jordan bust with former Wallaby James O'Connor who played a leading hand.</p>
        
            <p>Preston then completed his dream debut by darting over from a ruck with seven minutes left.</p>
        
            <p>It was exactly the start the Crusaders needed after last year's disastrous season.</p>
        
            <p>They face a tough challenge next weekend in Hamilton against the Chiefs. While the Hurricanes will host the Drua in Napier.</p>
