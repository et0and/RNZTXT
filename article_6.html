            <p>Lydia Ko has made a good start to the season-ending LPGA Tour Championship in Florida, moving onto the leaderboard late in her round.</p>
        
            <p>Ko fired a five under par 67 to be tied for fifth.</p>
        
            <p>The 2022 winner is three shots off the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Ko mixed an early bogey with six birdies, not missing any fairways and having just 26 putts.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew it was going to be windy and the first few holes were going to be key," she told the LPGA Tour afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"The first five holes are the hardest on this course so when you're turning those holes in under par or even you're off to a pretty good start.</p>
        
            <p>"I was able to do that and then capitalise on some good birdie opportunities from there so it was really steady and hopefully some more of that golf the next few days."</p>
        
            <p>Ko has had a remarkable season, winning Olympic gold, claiming her third major title and becoming eligible for the Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>However, 2023 didn't go so well for the Kiwi and she failed to qualify for this tournament having won it the year before (2022).</p>
        
            <p>South Korean An Na-rin has a one shot lead at eight under par with American Angel Yin second.</p>
        
            <p>World no.1 American Nelly Korda fired an even par 72 to be tied for 44th.</p>
        
            <p>The Tour Championship has a record prize purse of US$11 million with the winner taking home US$4 million.</p>
