            <p>Samoan New Zealand-born Sarai Bareman has been made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to football governance.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Sarai was appointed the first ever FIFA's Chief Women's Football Officer in 2016 and has overseen the delivery of Women's World Cups including the 2023 tournament co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand - the most attended women's sporting event in history.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm humbled. I'm completely honored, it just feels like such an incredible way to cap off an incredible year. I'm so grateful." Dame Bareman said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the accolade ranks as of the greatest achievements of her life.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not often that you receive a letter which gets acknowledgment from the King. I think it's also important to show that women from New Zealand with a Pacific background can achieve great things at a global scale and that's not lost on me, the visibility of this."</p>
        
            <p>Much of her career has been spent repairing damage caused by corruption in the game.</p>
        
            <p>Her journey began in finance for the Samoa Football Federation where she helped to rebuild the sport following a embezzlement scandal.</p>
        
            <p>Bareman quickly progressed to CEO with her next role coming at the Oceania Football Federation as a member of the reform committee after several high profile FIFA officials were arrested.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, she was appointed FIFA's first Chief Women's Football Officer, tasked with growing the womens game on a global scale.</p>
        
            <p>"What we see at a World Cup is incredible but the truth is, for the vast majority of female football players around the world they're still amateur. They're a long way away from being anywhere near a woman's World Cup. There are only a handful of woman that can earn a living playing football. So it's continuing to drive the professionalisation of the sport."</p>
        
            <p>Bareman has been bold in her strategy, including the goal of increasing female player numbers worldwide to 60 million by 2026.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so passionate about what I do that it's easy for me to stay motivated for such an incredible task and I see the positive impact that the sport has particularly on young girls. It's our obligation to deliver the sport to those young girls around the world."</p>
        
            <p>Equality has always been a driving factor behind her success.</p>
        
            <p>"The ultimate goal is that every opportunity that is given to young boys in every country around the world through football, is also given to young girls. Having access to a field and being able to kick a ball, having a coach and infrastructure around it."</p>
        
            <p>With back to back record breaking World Cups, it's clear her impact has been significant.</p>
        
            <p>"The tournament absolutely blew away all of our expectations. We had more than two billion people around the world watching and close to two million in the stadiums across New Zealand and Australia. The momentum is with us now. we've got to keep moving."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Sarai is one of four New Zealand women from the football community to be included on the honours list.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something that I've known for quite some time that we have some really incredible, wonderful, powerful and passionate woman in our sport."</p>
        
            <p>Also honoured for her extensive contributions to football is New Zealand Football President Dr Johanna Wood, who has been made a companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.</p>
        
            <p>After a decade chairing the Central Football Federation, Dr Wood was elected President of the nation's governing body in March 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Also an Oceania Football Confederation Fifa Council Member, Wood was awarded the Sport New Zealand Leadership Award at the prestigious Halberg Awards. In 2021.</p>

            <p>FIFA Women's World Cup chief executive Dave Beeche has also been made a companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.</p>
        
            <p>Beeche served as CEO for the successful FIFA Under-20 World Cup tournament in New Zealand in 2015 and led delivery of the 2023 FIFA WWC, navigating the Trans-Tasman model and COVID-19, to deliver a tournament which broke multiple records.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament attendance totalled just shy of 2million spectators across 64 matches, beating the attendance of the last World Cup hosted by France.</p>
