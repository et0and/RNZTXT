            <p>Englishman Tom Savage has been welcomed into the Moana family, even given an honorary Pasifika title of 'Tomasi'.</p>
        
            <p>The tireless lock has been named captain of his side for Friday's clash with the Chiefs, with Ardie Savea nursing a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>Savage said he has been embraced by his team-mates ever since making the shift in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a variation of nicknames within the group, probably some I can't mention. But I feel like I've been pretty accepted pretty quickly. As long as you buy in, I think people generally will accept you anyway."</p>
        
            <p>Savage said the move to Moana was about challenging himself personally and professionally.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to have the opportunity to play Super Rugby. Not many people from my part of the world get the chance to come and do that, and an opportunity arose here, so I just thought, let's just go for it, take it on and buy in. I knew it was going to be some different bits culturally and rugby wise, but I've loved learning it."</p>
        
            <p>He said he has been in awe of the culture.</p>

            <p>"The connections these boys have to their home and their family, their religion, and they pay homage to that on a daily basis and when they go out they're really playing for where they're from, which I think is an unbelievable thing to do and super powerful as well."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Tana Umaga said Savage was an easy choice for skipper.</p>
        
            <p>"He's experienced, that's the big one. He's very calm under pressure. I don't think we'll see too much different in terms of what he brings on the field, but just that calm head is probably something that really ticked it off for us that he'd be best to lead us this week."</p>
        
            <p>Umaga said Savage brought a workhorse mentality week in week out.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what everyone loves about him. He is a tireless worker and I think that's where the respect comes from."</p>
        
            <p>The former All Black commended the bravery of Savage moving from England to a team of predominantly Pasifika players.</p>
        
            <p>"He knew what he was getting himself into and he still came. When I arrived here, I thought, 'man, that's a bit courageous to do that, get out of his comfort zone.' And then he's just been so open and welcoming to learning our culture and adding his flavour to it as we expect that too."</p>
        
            <p>Umaga said it was not just the players who have taken to Savage.</p>
        
            <p>"He's definitely one of the favourites of our Pacific people and our fans."</p>
