            <p>Otago wicketkeeper-batter Polly Inglis has earned her maiden call-up to the White Ferns for the ODI series against India which starts on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The uncapped 28-year-old received her first New Zealand Cricket central contract in June, and has previously played for New Zealand A.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland batter Lauren Down has also been included in the 15-player squad, after making her return to international cricket in July following a maternity break.</p>
        
            <p>Central pace-bowler Rosemary Mair has been rested for the series as part of her long-term rehabilitation from a serious back injury sustained earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Mair's bowling loads were managed through the recent T20 World Cup, and it was determined further management was needed before she returned to 50-over cricket.</p>
        
            <p>Mair and off-spinner Leigh Kasperek were the only omissions from the squad who competed in the recent T20 World Cup-winning campaign in the UAE.</p>

            <p>Head coach Ben Sawyer said the selection of Inglis was a nod to the future.</p>
        
            <p>"She put her hand up in last season's Hallyburton Johnstone Shield one-day competition and throughout the New Zealand A series against England, so it's a great next step for her."</p>
        
            <p>Sawyer said the tour was an exciting opportunity for the full tour party.</p>
        
            <p>"Touring India is one of the great experiences in world cricket. It's such a special place to come and I know everyone is looking forward to the challenge ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"Alongside trying to win the series, the tour will serve as important preparation for next year's ODI World Cup in India."</p>
        
            <p>"We're relishing the [World Cup final] win, but when we get to India we'll need to refocus and set our sights on the next challenge."</p>
