        <h2>Where did it all go wrong for the Warriors in 2024?</h2>
        <p>
From fourth to 14th, the fall from grace was a long one.

            <p>It all started with so much hope. Riding the high of 2023, the 'Wahs' bandwagon was overflowing.</p>
        
            <p>But the wheels fell off early and the campaign couldn't get back on track. From fourth to 14th, the fall from grace was a long one.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ looks back at the rollercoaster run.</p>
        
            <p>Webster was surely wondering what he did to upset the rugby league gods as his side was struck with a horrendous and constant run of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Tohu Harris, Shaun Johnson, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, Marcello Montoya, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Rocco Berry, Freddy Lussick, Kurt Capewell, Marata Niukore, Chanel Harris-Tavita, Luke Metcalf, Dylan Walker, Bunty Afoa and Jazz Tevaga all faced stints on the sideline.</p>
        
            <p>It became a common sight for NRL referees boss Graham Annesley to front up and apologise to the Warriors after being the victims of several absolute howlers, and Webby was fed up.</p>
        
            <p>Though the players and coaches were adamant the rumours surrounding a rift with Addin Fonua-Blake were just that, whether true or not, the noise was no doubt a distraction for the side.</p>
        
            <p>With Johnson in and out of the side through injuries, Chanel Harris-Tavita and Te Maire Martin were given plenty of chances to shine, but just as they were starting to click, the combination would be changed again upon Johnson's return.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors left plenty of points on the pitch through missed shots at goal, none more costly than the sitter Chanel Harris-Tavita sprayed against Canberra.</p>
        
            <p>The constant debate surrounding who should play fullback was exhausting for Webster and his players.</p>
        
            <p>Round One - A worrying omen. Lost to Sharks 16-12 in Auckland. Ladder - 10th.</p>
        
            <p>A blistering start with tries for Fonua Blake and a cracker for Metcalf before an obvious penalty try was not awarded, which would have seen the Warriors go up three tries to nil. The Sharks struck before half-time, and kept the Warriors scoreless after the break. Despite a wealth of possession and territory, the hosts could not convert it into more points. "Our first 20 minutes was outstanding. The period after halftime was really poor - we were just clunky, didn't have the right timing." - Webster.</p>

            <p>Round Two - A Storm stunner. Lost to Storm 30-26 in Melbourne. Ladder - 14th.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing dead and buried with just two minutes remaining and eight points down, Storm winger Xavier Coates leapt into the heavens and came down with an absolute miracle. A 12th straight loss to Melbourne came in heart-breaking fashion, with the side staging a brilliant comeback after trailing by 12 at halftime, only for Melbourne to score twice in two minutes - Coates' aerial special one of the greatest finishes of the season. The Warriors were largely in control of the second spell, before both Harris and Berry went off for HIAs - the latter through a shoulder to the head from eventual match-winner Coates. "We shouldn't have been in that situation. It was a freakish try, but I'm looking forward to getting rid of that yuck feeling from the weekend. I genuinely think our footy is some of the best footy in the NRL right now." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round Three - On the board. Beat Raiders 18-10 in Christchurch. Ladder - 11th.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors produced some magic in Christchurch for their first win of the season. Down 10-6, they scored a pair of brilliant tries - first to Metcalf after Watene-Zalezniak went dancing across the turf before throwing a perfect ball, followed by Tuivasa-Sheck announcing his return to league with a spectacular effort in the 65th to seal the win. "It's been a tough three weeks, against some tough opposition. While we weren't perfect tonight we did enough." - Harris.</p>
        
            <p>Round Four - Getting the Easter treats. Beat Knights 20-12 in Auckland. Ladder - 10th.</p>
        
            <p>With both Tuapiki and Nicoll-Klokstad out, the Warriors moved Tuivasa-Sheck to fullback for the clash and another big blow followed when Metcalf was forced from the field with a broken leg. This opened the door for Harris-Tavita to step up in the halves and he did just that, with a try less than 10 minutes after his introduction. His cross kick then put Montoya over early in the second. Johnson was flawless off the tee with four from four.</p>
        
            <p>"We're learning how to close out these games." - Harris-Tavita.</p>

            <p>Round Five - Three on the trot. Beat Rabbitohs 34-4 in Sydney. Ladder - 6th. </p>
        
            <p>The Warriors finally beat their bunny side, snapping an eight-match losing streak against the South Sydney side. Nicoll-Klokstad resumed his fullback duties while Johnson delivered a masterclass from halfback, scoring twice and setting up two tries as his side crossed the chalk on six occasions. More controversy in this one as Latrell Mitchell was cited for an elbow to the head and a tip tackle, but remained on the field throughout. "We spoke about being disciplined and we did that. We put the ball in the right spots and our defence backed it up." - Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Round Six - A dramatic draw. Drew with Sea Eagles 22-all in Auckland. Ladder - 7th. </p>
        
            <p>On the right side of the whistle for a change, a late charge on Johnson as he attempted a field goal led to a penalty, which he duly converted to send the sides to golden point. However, after the extra period, the teams could still not be separated and shared the spoils. Conceding a 16-point lead, the hosts stormed back with some individual brilliance from Johnson and a fortuitous late intercept try to Watene Zalezniak to get them back in the contest. "I got a cork in the leg, the ref reviewed it and that's the call they made. I'm glad that it didn't end up worse because I've been in that position before and come out a lot worse." - Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Round Seven - Dragons deliver a reality check. Lost to Dragons 30-12 in Wollongong. Ladder - 10th. </p>
        
            <p>The first injury crisis for the year but far from the last as the Warriors saw Marata Niukore, Dylan Walker, Bunty Afoa and Jazz Tevaga all sidelined for the trip to Sydney. The Warriors opened and closed the scoring in Wollongong, but that was as good as things got as the Dragons dealt them a harsh lesson with a four-try blitz to close out the first 40. "They blew us away and off the back of some poor discipline I thought we lost our way defensively." - Webster.</p>

            <p>Round Eight - Anzac curse strikes. Lost to Titans 27-24 in Auckland. Ladder - 12th.</p>
        
            <p>First real low point of the year as the side followed up the emotional tribute to the troops with a listless effort against the bottom-placed Titans. They did come out firing with two quick tries inside the opening 10. However, a poor period either side of halftime saw them slump to a 27-18 deficit, one which they couldn't pull back despite several shots at a winner, continuing their decade-long drought in Anzac Day games. "Our worst is as bad as anyone in the competition." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round Nine - Nullified in Newcastle. Lost to Knights 14-8 in Newcastle. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>The Warriors could muster just one try against the Novocastrians, in the 26th minute to Dylan Walker. They had a chance to force golden point in the 79th minute, but a poor Johnson kick on the final play sealed their fate. The result saw the Warriors drop to 14th on the NRL ladder after three consecutive losses and a draw. "It's not do or die. But we're not where we want to be. It's no secret." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round 10 - Roosters run riot. Lost to Roosters 38-18 in Sydney. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>It was over before oranges. Four tries in the first 10 minutes had the Warriors chasing the game just as it started at 22-0 down. Compounding the Warrior's woes, Johnson was forced from the field with an injury after having his muscle hyper-extended in a chicken wing tackle. Following the match, four Roosters were cited for various indiscretions during the match, including a Joseph Sauili knee to Egan's head that split him open, though none were sent off during the match. Meanwhile, for the Warriors, the injuries were adding up: Harris, Johnson, Tuivasa-Sheck, Metcalf, Capewell, Leiataua, Berry, Nicoll-Klokstad, Lussick and Kosi all ruled out ahead of the Panthers clash.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt sick - let's be honest, I think every Warriors fan did. We did fight, but it wasn't good enough." - Webster.</p>

            <p>Round 11 - A magic round. Beat Panthers 22-20 in Brisbane. Ladder - 13th.</p>
        
            <p>It had been 43 days since a Warriors win, but this one was worth the wait. Already short 10 players through injury, they also lost Egan early. But the rookies stepped up - Tuaupiki enjoying his finest hour at fullback, scoring his maiden NRL try and nailing a crucial sideline conversion that proved the difference. Penrith had a chance to level late with a penalty, but pushed it wide to end a four-match losing streak for the Warriors. Their effort was summed up with this bone rattler from Pompey. So inspired by the performance Ngāhinapōuri School principal Mark Harrop delivered an impassioned speech to his students about resilience. "We've been in a bit of a rut for the last couple of weeks and to come out with a win like that was huge." - Martin.</p>
        
            <p>Round 12 - Pompey perfect at the posts. Beat Dolphins 24-20 in Auckland. Ladder - 13th. </p>
        
            <p>Another turbulent week for the Warriors, with star forward Fonua-Blake dropped for the Dolphins match after leaving the prior week's team celebrations early, Tuaupiki away for the birth of his child, and Nicoll-Klokstad ruled out with illness. Martin was superb for the hosts. Trailing 16-12 at half time, the Warriors came back with tries to Watene-Zelezniak and Niukore. While their four tries were matched by Redcliffe, it was Adam Pompey's four from four off the tee that got the Warriors over the line. Discipline was a key factor, with the Warriors not conceding a single penalty in the win. The victory was capped with the inclusion of Barnett in the Blues State of Origin squad. "That was no fluke tonight. It was just energy, they literally believed they could beat a top-four side." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round 13 - A welcome rest. Bye. Ladder - 13th. </p>
        
            <p>A much-needed break for the bruised and battered Warriors. Though languishing in 13th, the fans were clearly keeping the faith.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Round 14 - Turning it on in Townsville. Beat Cowboys 42-12 in Townsville. Ladder - 10th. </p>
        
            <p>The Warriors welcomed back Nicoll-Klokstad, Capewell, Berry, Tuaupiki, Harris and Egan, with both Berry and Nicoll-Klokstad bagging braces in the rout. Martin was again superb at halfback, notching four try assists while Nicoll-Klokstad ran for over 250 metres. Roaring out of the gates with three early tries to lead 22-6 at the break, the Warriors kept the foot on the gas in the second with a spectacular finish for CNK to close it out. "I just loved how ruthless we were." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round 15 - The Storm drought drags on. Lost to Storm 38-24 in Auckland. Ladder - 12th. </p>
        
            <p>A good news week for fans with the imminent return of Johnson and Barnett securing his future at the club, but the smiles soon vanished when the Storm blew into town to halt the three-match winning run. Surging out to 14-0 after 20 minutes with Melbourne able to complete just one set, the Storm slowly but surely ground their way back, taking a lead before halftime, which they would not relinquish. When the Warriors were reduced to 11 after two cards, the Storm cashed in and the loss kept the Warriors out of the top eight and ensured the nine-year losing streak against the Storm continues. "Every error had an unbelievably negative result." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round 16 - Rock bottom. Lost to Titans 66-6 in Robina. Ladder - 13th. </p>
        
            <p>There was plenty of optimism after some positive signs against the Storm, Tuivasa-Sheck was back from injury and Capewell was called into the Maroons for Origin two. However, what we saw on the Gold Coast was one of the low points in Warriors' history: 11 tries to one. A further blow came with Johnson sidelined for up to four weeks with an Achilles injury. "It was embarrassing, we got what we deserved. My lowest point as coach." - Webster.</p>

            <p>Round 17 - Bouncing back to buck the Broncos. Beat Broncos 32-16 in Auckland. Ladder - 13th. </p>
        
            <p>They needed a response and they got it. It was a case of no Shaun, no worries as Harris-Tavita and Martin orchestrated a symphony of excellence. The Origin duo of Barnett and Capewell as well as DWZ were back for this one, and the demons from the Gold Coast were quickly banished as the halves pairing quickly established the ascendancy for their side. With three tries in each half, the Warriors put together one of their best 80-minute efforts all season. It was all aboard the bandwagon, as it seemed the Warriors were back. "Obviously we'll take the two points but we're not getting carried away with it." - Martin.</p>
        
            <p>Round 18 - All guts but no glory. Lost to Bulldogs 13-12 in Sydney. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>One of the games of the season, and one of the most valiant displays from a deeply depleted team, but ultimately one that got away. A staggering string of injuries left the Warriors without both wingers and their fullback to close out this golden-point thriller: Nicoll-Klokstad, Watene-Zelezniak and Montoya all forced from the field while captain Harris was again out nursing his wrist. The casualties meant a call-up for Leka Halasima who came within inches of scoring a stunner on debut. Locked up at 12 apiece after regulation time, both sides traded several field goal attempts until Matt Burton finally got one to sail through the sticks to call curtains on a classic. Another apology from the referees boss following this one after a late hit on Martin went unpunished. "So resilient, so many injuries, people in different spots, but we didn't get what we wanted today." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round 19 - Viva Wahs Vegas. Bye. Ladder - 12th. </p>
        
            <p>The week off coincided with the announcement that the Warriors will play in Sin City next season. However, it also marked the official end of a stop-start season for Harris.</p>

            <p>Round 20 - A costly miss. Lost to Raiders 20-18 in Canberra. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>Recovering from 14-0 down, Capewell and Barnett - who were both backing up from State of Origin duty - crossed to get their side back in range. However, goal kicking cost the Warriors dearly as Harris-Tavita took over the duties from the injured Pompey and missed all three shots, including a sitter to equalise in the dying minutes. The Warriors outscored the Raiders four tries to three, but were only able to convert one of them. It left the Warriors fighting for survival after losing four of their last five. "We'd love to be 100 percent on our goal-kicking every week. The goalkicking's not the thing that decided the game." - Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Round 21 - Chanel's redemption. Beat Tigers 28-16 in Auckland. Ladder - 12th. </p>
        
            <p>Fans weren't ready to write the Warriors off in 2024 just yet, but they were keeping the pen close. The Warriors kept their slim hopes alive with a scratchy win over the Tigers, and Harris-Tavita enjoyed redemption off the tee. So deep was the injury crisis, the Warriors now had a full backline on the sidelines with Nicoll-Klokstad, Montoya, Tuaupiki, Pompey, Berry, Metcalf and Johnson all ruled out of action. This left Tuivasa-Sheck needing to step up as the senior back and he did just that at Mount Smart, running for almost 300 metres. Fonua-Blake was at his bulldozing best, breaking six tackles and bagging a try. After scoring inside the opening 10, there was a slight lull for the home side before two tries before the break gave them a handy 14-0 lead. The Tigers staged a slight fight back with two tries to start the second, before the result was put to bed by Fonua Blake and DWZ in the 75th. "I needed that, if I missed that I was giving the tee away." - Harris-Tavita.</p>
        
            <p>Round 22- Eels sink season. Lost to Eels 30-20. Ladder - 13th. </p>
        
            <p>Having spent the past few weeks on life support, the Warriors' shambolic season was finally put out of its misery against the Eels. The 16th-placed Paramatta embarrassed the Warriors and all but ended any hopes of a play-off appearance. Another departure was announced with Tevaga the latest to leave the club while Johnson and Nicoll-Klokstad were back from injury, pushing the in-form Martin to the pine. Down 12-0 early on, and 18-4 at halftime, the Warriors never really fired a shot until a late flurry helped to flatter the scoreline. "We're not giving up." Webster.</p>

            <p>Round 23 - More golden point heartbreak. Lost to Dolphins 34-32. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>It was the news fans had been dreading. Shaun Johnson, arguably the greatest Warrior of all time, was hanging up his boots. The match that followed certainly didn't help heal the wound. Another pulsating clash, another gutting defeat. Johnson would not start the first leg of his farewell tour; out with a quad injury. The Warriors looked dead and buried at the break, with the Dolphins taking a commanding 20-6 lead. But the Warriors refused to lie down, storming back with tries for Capewell, Leiataua, Martin and Sifakula squaring the ledger. After Redcliffe reclaimed the advantage, a rampaging Mitch Barnett was set to score as he chased through a grubber, but was held back resulting in a penalty try and a 32-all scoreline forcing extra time. As was the case against the Bulldogs, the Warriors had their chances to snatch victory, but couldn't get one over the bar only for Sean O'Sullivan to nail his two-point shot and break Warrior hearts. "This is a team that care about the result, that's why we've been in so many close contests." - Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Round 24 - The final nail. Lost to Sea Eagles 24-10 in Sydney. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>A mathematical miracle was required for the Warriors to sneak into an unlikely play-off spot, but that equation was answered with the most faithful fans' hopes officially quashed and the calculators shelved. After breaking his leg against the Knights, Metcalf was back for the Warriors who also saw the returns of Pompey, Montoya and Johnson. The Warriors were well in the contest at halftime with the scores all square at 10-all, but a downpour in the second 40 led to a flood of handling errors which kept them score-less and allowed Sea Eagles to snatch the victory. "We need to show pride in our jersey." - Barnett.</p>
        
            <p>Round 25 - Johnson's party spoiled. Lost to Bulldogs 34-18 in Auckland. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>The NRL is no fairytale world. 'The Prince of Penrose' couldn't produce any final pieces of magic for the faithful, as the Warriors succumbed to the Bulldogs 34-18 in Shaun Johnson's last outing in Auckland. The final chapter of his story was scripted like much of his 10-year career with the Warriors - beginning with promise, but ending in heartache. Tuivasa-Sheck's season was ended as he wore a shoulder to the head from Bulldogs captain Stephen Crichton. While Tuivasa-Sheck left the pitch, Crichton did not. The fallout from this one saw another referees boss apology to the Warriors, but Webster said he was fed up with the stack of poor decisions going against them.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have loved to win tonight and that's probably the only disappointment that I feel. It sucks not winning, but it is what it is. I've still got so much to smile about." - Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Round 26 - One last act for 'Magic'. Warriors v Sharks in Sydney. Ladder - 14th. </p>
        
            <p>Will we see a fitting farewell for three club favourites? "We get one more crack this weekend to set us in good stead for next season." - Webster.</p>
