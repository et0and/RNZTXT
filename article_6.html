        <h2>Why are more people running marathons?</h2>
        <p>
Running is uncomplicated and easily accessible, making it a good option for everyone, advocates say.

            <p>What was once a physical endeavour reserved for only the most devoted of athletes, marathon running is now the sport of choice for thousands of ordinary Australians.</p>
        
            <p>But how and why has a gruelling 42.2 kilometre test of mental and physical strength become the new norm for people just wanting to keep fit?</p>
        
            <p>Long time endurance runner and coach Jamie Hunter believes the answer is as simple as putting one foot in front of the other.</p>
        
            <p>"Running is not a complicated sport. It's something we were born to do, so of course we love it," Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>For most newcomers to the running scene, the love affair with pounding the pavement began during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>With gyms closed and group fitness a no-go, jogging became the most accessible exercise.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the run club phenomenon has taken over with hundreds of grassroots groups popping up across the country.</p>
        
            <p>For many new players, a weekly 5 kilometre run with friends, followed by a coffee and a croissant, was a gateway to a whole new world.</p>
        
            <p>Caitlin Dorrough started running because of all her friends, and quickly fell in love with the community the sport gave her.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old Brisbane woman said training for her first half-marathon last year was "an incredible experience".</p>
        
            <p>"I started running with a group who consistently backed me to meet my goals, which made it feel a lot less scary," Dorrough said.</p>
        
            <p>"The more I got involved in the scene, the more common I realised it was to aim for these big, long runs and just have a crack.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as I finished the race, I knew 100 percent I was doing another one in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Shelby Tillett is another young woman who recently caught run-fever.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old pilot is a self-described "ordinary girl" who has gone on to achieve truly extraordinary things.</p>
        
            <p>Tillett only started running 18 months ago - she now has a marathon and an Ironman 70.3 triathlon under her belt.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember I'd heard of Ironman but always thought of it as something totally unachievable for an average person," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Being part of the running community, you're so motivated by the people around you and all these other busy, normal people achieving amazing things."</p>
        
            <p>Tillett splits her time between the cockpit of a Boeing 737 and a gruelling training regime of swimming, riding and running as she trains for her biggest goal yet.</p>
        
            <p>In May she will tackle a full Ironman, which will see her swim 3.8km before cycling 180km and finishing with a marathon.</p>
        
            <p>Record entries for running events across the country show the appetite for a challenge among Australians is continuing to grow.</p>
        
            <p>Tickets to the 2025 Gold Coast Marathon sold out in record time, with 15,000 people signing up in a matter of days.</p>
        
            <p>Griffith University's director of sports engagement Naomi McCarthy said there had been an increase in young people in particular training for marathons, which have historically been dominated by middle-aged, life-long athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"Ten to 20 years ago, that sort of distance was really mainly run by people over 40, because it takes a lot of maturity to be that dedicated to your training," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now though, this trend of running as a social activity has brought younger people to it as well."</p>
        
            <p>Jamie Hunter, who owns a running supply store in Brisbane, said there had been a surge in beginner runners seeking advice and gear for their first long runs.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had to shift what we stock a bit so we can accommodate the entry level runners," Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's just so many more these days, it's so good to see.</p>
        
            <p>"Once people start, it's very hard to not want to stay involved - your run club becomes like an extended family."</p>
        
            <p>Sport and exercise psychologist Vanessa Wergin believes there's two factors that make running-fever easy to catch.</p>
        
            <p>"With running especially because it's very beginner friendly and you get a feeling of getting better very quickly," Wergin said.</p>
        
            <p>She believes endurance events draw in people wanting to set big personal goals because they're challenging but not overly competitive.</p>
        
            <p>"In marathon running, the ultimate goal is really just to participateâ€¦ because really everyone who does those insane distances is already a winner," Wergin said.</p>
