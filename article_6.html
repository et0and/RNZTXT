            <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are through to their fifth Super Bowl final in six years, after narrowly beating the Buffalo Bills 32-29 to win the AFC Championship.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs who are the defending NFL champions will become the first team to win the NFL three years in a row if they beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl in New Orleans in two weeks time.</p>
        
            <p>Philadelphia beat the Washington Commanders 55-23 to win the NFC title.</p>
        
            <p>Super Bowl LIX</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes ran in two touchdowns to help set up a Super Bowl rematch with the Eagles, whom they beat for the title in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The Bills have not won a road playoff game since 1993 and while they staged an inspired second-half fightback they eventually buckled under the deafening roar of the Kansas City fans at Arrowhead Stadium in the final moments.</p>
