        <h2>Can Auckland steady the ship amid A-League chaos?</h2>
        <p>
While a share of the spoils was the right result the manner in which the game was decided will concern the league leaders, writes Mathew Nash.

            <p>Chaos. That single word sums up the weekend's A-League Men's action. A record 33 goals were scored across six fixtures, including sensational score lines of 5-4 and 6-2-more reminiscent of the ice hockey rinks Auckland owner Bill Foley's Vegas Golden Knights frequent rather than football stadiums.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Knights recorded their third consecutive draw on Sunday, this time 2-2 against the Central Coast Mariners, in a match that delivered yet another dramatic finale. But whereas the A-League newcomers had previously benefited from such chaos, this time they were on the receiving end, conceding a scrappy equaliser from Nico Duarte.</p>
        
            <p>But as Heath Ledger's Joker, clad in a nurse's gown, once said: 'The thing about chaos: it's fair.' Auckland FC learned that the hard way. The reigning champions may have forsaken their bid for a third straight A-League championship a while ago but they certainly played like last season's treble winners at Mount Smart and fully deserved to come away with a point.</p>
        
            <p>While a share of the spoils was the right result the manner in which the game was decided will concern the league leaders. Much like the 4-4 draw with Adelaide that began this stretch of form, Auckland conceded at the death to drop two points. It is a sharp contrast from the team which was so good at seeing games out until recently, Steve Corica's penchant to going with five at the back to close proving fruitful.</p>

            <p>But it seems that amid the wider maelstrom Auckland are being punished. Even the manner of the equaliser came amid penalty box pandemonium as the ball bobbled and hopped around until Duarte nodded it goalwards. It was painfully similar to the goal Bart Vriends heaved over the line in that 4-4 draw against Adelaide at the start of the month.</p>
        
            <p>Since their epic 6-1 win over Kiwi rivals Wellington Phoenix, Auckland have dropped six points from nine while Western United, who look like their biggest rivals for the Premier Plate spot, are on a four-game winning streak, including a 6-2 romp over Newcastle during the March madness of this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>But in the midst of a storm the one thing to do is remain calm and Auckland are in no position to panic. They remain four points clear of their nearest rivals and have a game in hand, not to mention an international break in which to recharge and refocus.</p>

            <p>Auckland are still in the driving seat to finish top of the table and claim much-coveted silverware in their debut campaign. Meanwhile a top-two placing seems almost assured, giving them an advanced seat at the play-off table.</p>
        
            <p>But if their form does continue to dither, and Western continue their blitz, it could set up a blockbuster final game of the season between the two on May 3.</p>
        
            <p>In other football news …</p>
        
            <p>Amid the feeding frenzy that was the A-League Mens this weekend the faltering Wellington Phoenix might have feared the worst but they had a strong showing in a 1-1 draw with Sydney FC. The returning Josh Oluwayemi also exorcised some demons between the sticks, with some top saves in place of the injured Alby Kelly-Heald.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix's women lost another game in which they were the better side, as bottom-placed Sydney defeated them 2-1, scoring with their only two shots of the game, in New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites face Fiji and potentially the winners of New Caledonia v Tahiti this weekend with a place at the FIFA World cup at stake. Darren Bazeley has picked a strong squad to face their Oceania rivals, including Premier League star Chris Wood.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand men's domestic game is underway with the first game of the Regional Phase of the National League taking place on Saturday. Reigning champs Auckland City overcame a plucky Tauranga City side 2-1 in Sandringham, despite playing the final stages of the game with nine-men. The women's league begins this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Newcastle United won their first silverware in over half a century by defeating Liverpool 2-1 in the League Cup final at Wembley. Dan Burn's bullet header and Alexander Isak's snapshot proved decisive, despite Federico Chiesa's late consolation.</p>
