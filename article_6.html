            <p>Blackcaps coach Gary Stead's talking up the "positive emotions" on their return to Lahore for tonight's Champions Trophy semi-final against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Despite losing to India in its final pool match in Dubai on Sunday, New Zealand has good momentum heading into the match following two big wins at Gaddifi Stadium in a Tri-Nations series last month, one of which was against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand successfuly chased down 304 in that match, to win by six wickets, two days after beating Pakistan at the same venue in warmups for theChampins Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>"We are lucky. We've had some experience playing here in the tri-series before the tournament actually kicked off," Stead told reporters on a video call.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some on-ground experience and I guess some positive emotions to fall back on the way we played here as well."</p>
        
            <p>Stead said it was likely New Zealand would stick with the same trio and complement them with spin from their contingent of all-rounders as they did against India and in the previous win against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa though, will have a very different team than the lineup that played in the tri-series.</p>
        
            <p>Tabraiz Shamsi has not appeared at the Champions Trophy but Stead suggested the left-arm wrist spinner might be called up in place of paceman Lungi Ngidi.</p>
        
            <p>"They're a very, very good side and we're going to have to play right near our best to beat them," he added.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa will pack much more of a punch in the bowling department this time round, with fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen as well as wily spinner Keshav Maharaj in their attack.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got all bases covered in terms of batting, bowling and in the field. I'm sure it'll be a fantastic game," New Zealand batter Tom Latham said.</p>
        
            <p>The match is another chance for South Africa to end their long drought for victory in an ICC tournament, which stretches back to 1998.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa has reached the semi-finals or finals of ICC tournaments on 13 occasions across both limited-overs formats and only have the 1998 Champions Trophy title to show for it.</p>
        
            <p>The winner of the match will face in India in Sunday's final in Dubai, after they beat Australia in the first semi final.</p>
        
            <p>India won by four wickets, after successfully chasing down Australia's 264 all out, with 11 balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Virat Kohli was named player of the match, after top scoring for India with 84 from 98 balls.</p>
