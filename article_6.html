            <p>Kiwi Formula One driver Liam Lawson has shown he is just as adept driving on dirt.</p>
        
            <p>Two of New Zealand's biggest names in motorsport came together for a Formula One/NASCAR crossover, which saw Lawson try his hand at a completely unfamiliar style of racing.</p>
        
            <p>Shane van Gisbergen was called on to coach Lawson on handling the 500 horsepower, V8 machine on a dirt oval track in Texas.</p>
        
            <p>The three-time Australian Supercar Champion turned NASCAR Cup Series competitor recently set the fastest lap in a modern NASCAR Cup Series car at 199.438 mph at Talladega Superspeedway.</p>
        
            <p>Van Gisbergen offered some sound advice to his fellow countryman.</p>
        
            <p>"When you brake, it helps pull the car into the corner. Rely on the brake and the throttle more than the steering to guide the car's direction," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Taking part alongside fellow F1 driver Yuki Tsunoda, the pair were challenged with handling a stock car.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson and Tsunoda completed three challenges before a final winner-take-all head-to-head race.</p>
        
            <p>Challenges included navigating through cones, corners and a qualifying lap to decide the starting grid fro the final.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson failed the first and passed the second, and was just pipped in the qualifier.</p>
        
            <p>Tsunoda would also claim the final five-lap head to head race.</p>
