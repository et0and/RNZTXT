        <h2>Black Caps face rain again in Sri Lanka</h2>
        <p>
The Black Caps have managed to get some training in since arriving in Sri Lanka, but the rain appears to be following them.

            <p>The Black Caps have managed to get some training in since arriving in Sri Lanka, but they appear set to face a similar situation to what they had last week.</p>
        
            <p>Not one ball was bowled in the abandoned one-off test against Afghanistan in Greater Noida in India last week.</p>
        
            <p>There was plenty of frustration for both sides as the game fizzled out and the New Zealanders flew to Galle hoping to see some dry conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"It was frustrating, but obviously the weather is something we can't control and so when we got here we just had to move forward and get stuck into our preparation," opener Tom Latham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone has been doing their own stuff over the winter and we had a couple of great camps [before leaving] and we played here in 2019 so we do have knowledge of the conditions."</p>
        
            <p>However some rain was forecast for all five days of the test, which starts on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The drainage is better in Galle which has hosted 34 tests since it's debut in 1998 when Sri Lanka beat New Zealand by an innings and 16 runs.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps have played there four times, losing all four.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka have played 34 tests at the ground, winning 19 and losing just eight. They were also coming off a win over England in the third test at The Oval.</p>
        
            <p>All-rounder Rachin Ravindra has enjoyed the limited amount of bowling the spinners have managed so far on tour.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to bowled in tandem with Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel and from Rangana Herath, who has taken a hundred test wickets at Galle, I've tried to pick their brains as much as I can really."</p>

            <p>The first test will be played over six days.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday will be a rest day owing to presidential elections in the country. The last time there was a rest day in a test was when Sri Lanka played Zimbabwe in Colombo in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>The weather could also put an end to the Black Caps' hopes of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's in June next year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is currently third in the WTC rankings behind India and Australia, and would probably have to win both tests against Sri Lanka to keep their finals hopes alive.</p>
        
            <p>Latham said they weren't thinking about every game being 'must win'.</p>
        
            <p>"For us it's about putting ourselves into a position to win, as sportsmen you want to win every game, but first and foremost its about doing the best we can as individuals.</p>
        
            <p>After the Sri Lanka series New Zealand play three tests in India, with their last WTC games at home against England in December.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand could well go into the test with just two quick bowlers and four spinning options.</p>
        
            <p>Possible playing eleven: Devon Conway, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Tom Blundell, Matt Henry, Tim Southee (c) and Ajaz Patel.</p>
