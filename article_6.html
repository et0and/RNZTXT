            <p>New Zealand finished with nine medals; one gold, four silver and four bronze. China led the medals table by a long way, with 94 golds, followed by Great Britain with 49 and the US 36 golds.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers hailed the event as a huge success with a record 12 million tickets sold Paralympics and 9.5 million for the Olympics. The total beat the record previously set by London 2012, organisers said.</p>

            <p>"Nobody wants these Games to come to an end," Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet said as Paris passes the baton to Los Angeles for the next Summer Games.</p>
        
            <p>"We beat a lot of records so tonight let's beat another one. I'm asking you to give the para athletes the longest, loudest, craziest ovation they ever received," he added to deafening cheers from the 64,000 spectators, in sharp contrast to boos from the crowd when French President Emmanuel Macron appeared.</p>
        
            <p>Estanguet also urged the spectators and viewers not to forget "this summer when France was happy."</p>
