            <p>The runs keep coming for Black Cap Rachin Ravindra.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year old has scored a maiden double century in just his fourth test match.</p>
        
            <p>Finishing day one unbeaten on 118, Ravindra notched 200 runs off 341 balls early on the second session of day two of the first test agains South Africa in Mount Maunganui.</p>
        
            <p>Stuck in the 190s for more than 10 overs and seeing two of his teammates dismissed, Ravindra kept his cool, cutting a wide delivery through ssquare to bring up the miletone.</p>
        
            <p>A Ravindra boundary brought up the 400 for the Black Caps shortly before tea.</p>
        
            <p>After scoring his 30th test century yesterday, skipper Kane Williamson added just six runs to his tally before he skied one to mid on to depart for 118.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell joined Rvindra and made a brisk 34 before he was out caught and bowled to Neil Band.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell was dismissed shortly after for 14 to bring Glenn Phillips to the crease with New Zealand 394/5.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson told Cricinfo that all batters have gone in and tried really hard with a moving the ball which is holding in the surface.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a strong position to be in. It was a matter of being patient and getting yourself into a position where we are. The ball would hold a little bit and they've been accurate."</p>
        
            <p>He said the challenge was to be patient and take advantage of wayward deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>"Ravindra is an exceptional talent as we've seen in the other formats. Test cricket is really dear to his heart and getting his first hundred was really special."</p>
