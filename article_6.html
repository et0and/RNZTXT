            <p>All Blacks halfback Cam Roigard is set to miss the entire international season after suffering a serious knee injury in the Hurricanes win over the Highlanders in Dunedin at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Roigard ruptured his left patella tendon in the match and underwent surgery in Auckland yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>The prognosis, if all goes well with his rehabilitation, means he could be back playing in six months.</p>
        
            <p>That will see him miss the All Blacks tests against England and Fiji in July along with the Rugby Championship.</p>
        
            <p>It will be touch-and-go, however, as to whether he is fit of the end of year Northern Hemisphere tour in November, with tests against England, Ireland, France and Italy.</p>
        
            <p>Roigard will be sorely missed by the Hurricanes who currently lead the Super Rugby Pacific competition, unbeaten in all their six games so far.</p>
        
            <p>
The injury to Cam Roigard means TJ Perenara may get to extend his All Blacks career.

            <p>Roigard's stock rose quickly last year when Hurricanes half back TJ Perenara missed the entire season with an achilles injury.</p>
        
            <p>His strong Super Rugby form then saw him included in the All Blacks World Cup squad and he was was in line to be the All Blacks starting halfback this season under new coach Scott Robertson, following the retirement of veteran Aaron Smith post the World Cup final.</p>
        
            <p>It means Blues halfback Matt Christie now shapes as the All Blacks first choice half back for the year.</p>
        
            <p>The loss of Roigard will see veteran Perenara regain the Hurricanes number nine jersey and may well extend his international career.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara has played 77 tests the last of which was against Wales in 2021.</p>
