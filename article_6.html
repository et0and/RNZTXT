            <p>The Central Pulse extended their winning run in netball's ANZ Premiership beating the Tactix 36-30 in a gruelling top-of-the-table clash.</p>
        
            <p>Unbeaten after five games, the Pulse maintain their place at the top of the standings despite key players Maddie Gordon and Tiana Metuarau watching the action unfold from the sidelines for successive weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Finding the attacking answer in a defence-heavy battle was a factor for both sides in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns pairing of Jane Watson and Karin Burger put the brakes on the Pulse attackers.</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the court, outstanding Pulse captain Kelly Jackson and her defensive partner Parris Mason pressured the ball into the Tactix shooters.</p>
        
            <p>The 16-13 scoreline in favour of the Pulse at halftime was testimony to the immense battle unfolding at either end of the court.</p>
        
            <p>Goals were scarce as the attacking ends struggled to navigate their way through the defensive pressure.</p>
        
            <p>The fiercest battle on display was the match-up between Pulse shooter Amelia Walmsley and Tactix defender Jane Watson.</p>
        
            <p>Walmsley's ability to hold her space under immense physical pressure saw the Pulse come through.</p>
        
            <p>For the second week, former Silver Ferns midcourter Claire Kersten came into the Pulse starting seven to replace the injured Maddie Gordon at centre.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Pulse midcourter Whitney Souness and shooter Khiarna Williams continued their impressive form.</p>
        
            <p>Souness showcased her speed and feeding abilities as she repeatedly found the 1.92m Walmsley through the wall of red and black.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse captain Kelly Jackson - who pulled in a standout eight intercepts for the game - told SkySport she was savouring the win.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very much a defensive game for both teams, but we're glad to walk away with the win and deny them the bonus point," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to start the season like this...It's been unsettling with injuries and illnesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Claire has just slotted in and it's a full team effort, which gives us a bit more confidence at the back."</p>
        
            <p>Disappointed Tactix captain Kimiora Poi said errors cost her side.</p>
        
            <p>"I think [the Pulse are] incredible and I guess that just shows what their team is like as a full defensive unit.</p>
        
            <p>"We got lots of ball on defence, but we just couldn't score off it."</p>
        
            <p>The Stars will play the Mystics in the final match of round five on Monday evening.</p>
