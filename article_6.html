            <p>Shot put thrower Maddi Wesche flexed her muscles with a comfortable win at the national athletics championships in Dunedin to warm up for the world indoor showpiece.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche overcame a wobbly start in what was her first competition on home soil since clinching a silver medal at the Paris Olympics seven months ago.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old threw three successive fouls at the start of her series at the Caledonian Ground before unleashing an 18.49m effort, more than three metres clear of her nearest rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche did not threaten her personal best of 19.86m, achieved in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Her focus will switch to the world indoor championships in Nanjing, China later this month before competing on the Diamond League circuit and lining up at the outdoor world championships in Tokyo in September.</p>
