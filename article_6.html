            <p>Boxing legend Mike Tyson said he had no regrets about his defeat to social media influencer-turned-prizefighter Jake Paul, adding that he had nearly died in June because of health issues.</p>
        
            <p>Tyson was beaten by unanimous decision on Friday in Texas, with fans largely disappointed as the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion showed his age and was never able to generate any offence against his younger opponent.</p>
        
            <p>Initially set for July, the fight was pushed back after Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up.</p>
        
            <p>"This is one of those situations when you lost but still won. I'm grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time," Tyson wrote in a post on X.</p>
        
            <p>"I almost died in June. Had eight blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25 lb (11 kg) in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won.</p>
        
            <p>"To have my children see me stand toe-to-toe and finish eight rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you."</p>
        
            <p>The bout was streamed live on Netflix, though hiccups during the livestreaming prompted more than 90,000 users to report problems at the peak, outage tracking website Downdetector showed.</p>
        
            <p>The streaming platform was back up on Saturday, however, after the outage lasted about six hours in the United States.</p>
