            <p>Though the Blues scored some scintillating tries in their 50-3 rout of the Force, what pleased captain Dalton Papali'i more was keeping the opposition try-less.</p>
        
            <p>Papali'i said it is indicative of the attitude of the Blues in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"We pride ourselves on that because defence wins championships, it's about working hard for each other."</p>
        
            <p>The win sees the Blues move to first equal on the points table with the unbeaten Hurricanes, who have a game in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Akira Ioane, Hoskins Sotutu were both immense for the Auckland side, while Corey Evans continue to make the most of his opportunity in the midfield.</p>
        
            <p>Papali'i said his side were disciplined and nailed their roles.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of senior players work hard on and off the field and I think it's contagious for those younger players coming through."</p>
        
            <p>Ofa Tu'ungafasi kicked things off for the hosts, the All Black prop proving too hard to stop close to the chalk.</p>
        
            <p>Hooker Ricky Riccitelli then rumbled his way over from a surging maul, with the assistance of a few backs.</p>
        
            <p>The Force finally got on the board courtesy of a Ben Donaldson penalty, but the Blues responded straight away as the Force fumbled the restart and Laghlan McWhannell cashed in, Dalton Papali'i powering through some feeble defence and linking with his lock looming on the inside.</p>
        
            <p>The Ioane brothers then set alight an attack down the right flank, with some sharp interplay with Corey Evans tipped over short of the line, but he managed to find Taufa Funaki who gave his side a 28-3 halftime lead.</p>

            <p>It took just three minutes of the second half for the Blues to strike again, an AJ Lam break setting up Sotutu for a fifth.</p>
        
            <p>Caleb Clarke then showcased his strength as he returned a kick and bulldozed his way through three Force tackles before he found Funakai in support.</p>
        
            <p>Rubbing salt in the Force's wounds, Evans then snagged an intercept and streaked 50 metres away for the Blues' seventh.</p>
        
            <p>Lucas Cashmore made his way onto the park for his Super Rugby debut, while AJ Lam brought up the half century, slicing through the line and out gassing the cover.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues will have the bye next weekend, and Akira Ioane said they wanted a statement performance before getting the week off.</p>
        
            <p>"We now get a week with our families to get away and rejuvenate and come back stronger."</p>
        
            <p>Ioane said clarity in their game plan was allowing them to flourish under coach Vern Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>"We have got good ball runners, boys who like to play, and forwards who like to roll their sleeves up. I think we are slowly getting on a roll."</p>
