        <h2>Home losses, coach’s departure sour start to Indian Panthers’ debut season</h2>
        <p>
Jonathan Goodman is named interim head coach after Miles Pearch resigned in a turbulent start to the team's inclusion in the national basketball league.
</p>
        
            <p>The Indian Panthers' much-vaunted inclusion in the national basketball league has got off to a nightmare start after the head coach's resignation and successive losses in the first three games of their season.</p>
        
            <p>The latest defeats were posted in the Panthers' first two home games of the season, losing 93-107 to the Franklin Bulls on Friday before being trounced 77-122 by the Manawatū Jets on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Miles Pearce announced his departure from the franchise on Wednesday, two days before the Panthers' debut home game of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The franchise said Jonathan Goodman had stepped in as interim head coach in an Instagram post on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes, you know, things don't work out quite right, and he [Pearce] stepped down," said Parveen Batish, CEO of the Indian Panthers.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a great interim head coach, and he's been working with us for some time."</p>
        
            <p>Batish said Goodman had been involved with the team for a while and was part of the recruitment process for the INBL Pro, the Indian basketball league.</p>
        
            <p>"He knows all the players, so he's a perfect fit as the interim coach until we find a replacement," he said.</p>

            <p>The consecutive home losses dampened the enthusiasm that hundreds of fans brought to Takanini's Bruce Pullman Arena on Friday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The franchise brought Indian music, dance and food to captivate the South Auckland community, and even managed to include two Indian players in the starting line-up for Friday's game against the Bulls.</p>
        
            <p>Overseas commitments had delayed the arrival of Indian players who had been included in the squad from being in New Zealand before the season commenced.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to playing in New Zealand," said Aaron Blessen, who hails from Kerala and has previously played in the INBL Pro with the Mumbai Titans.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm here to improve myself, and the team has told me that South Auckland has a good Indian population, which is great," he said.</p>

            <p>Blessen said more players were expected to join the franchise shortly, but international duties had caused delays in their arrival.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my first time in New Zealand and, so far, it's great," said Sejin Mathew, who arrived in New Zealand on Friday morning to join the Panthers. "I can't wait to play."</p>
        
            <p>Mathew is also from Kerala, previously playing in the INBL Pro for the Chennai Heat.</p>
        
            <p>"I was at the Indian national team camp, which delayed my trip," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Basketball here and at home are a bit different, so I'm looking forward to adapting to these conditions and learning as much as possible," he said.</p>

            <p>Batish was satisfied with the turnout at Takanini but acknowledged room for growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got lots of seats but as a first game, first time in this area, I'm very happy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believed a fully Indian squad would attract more Indian spectators to the Panthers' home games.</p>
        
            <p>On the arrival of additional Indian players, Batish said "We're hoping to bring them soon, hopefully in a week or so."</p>

            <p>Spectator Jithin Chittibomma thought the game he watched on Friday was worth the effort.</p>
        
            <p>"The Indian Panthers are putting up a good fight," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Indian food anywhere is a nice addition, so no complaints," he said with a smile.</p>
        
            <p>"Culture attached to sport is always nice. Once the word is out that it's quality sport, I'm sure it'll catch on with the Indian community."</p>
