            <p>The Wellington Blaze have won another women's Super Smash T20 title after only making 89 runs in a rain reduced final at Eden Park in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The Blaze won the final against the Central Hinds by 1 run, their eighth title and showed once again that they know how to win.</p>
        
            <p>The Central Hinds had a golden opportunity to beat the favourites after a fine bowling effort but a too cautious approach in their run chase probably cost them the game.</p>
        
            <p>Early rain meant the final was reduced to 17 overs each.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Blaze won the toss and decided to bat first.</p>
        
            <p>But the Central Hinds had a dream start when they took the prized wicket of White Fern Sophie Devine, dismissing her for 5 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Amelia Kerr tried to do what she could to build a decent total and finished with the highest score of 35 but wickets fell at regular intervals around her.</p>
        
            <p>Rosemary Mair was the standout bowler for the Hinds, picking up four wickets while conceding just 5 runs off her four overs.</p>

            <p>The Blaze were dismissed for 89 on the final ball of their innings.</p>
        
            <p>The Central Hinds looked like they were building a nice launching pad but they didn't accelerate when they needed to, with the Blaze bowlers being very miserly.</p>
        
            <p>It meant the Central Hinds needed 10 runs from final over, with 7 wickets in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Devine bowled an eventful final over, which included two wides, a failed run-out attempt, and a missed catch, before Devine made sure of a second run-out chance.</p>
        
            <p>The Hinds finished 88 for 5 when Claudia Green was run-out on the final ball of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Thamsyn Newton top scored with 27 for the Hinds.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Aces were later crowned men's T20 champions after today's final against the Canterbury Kings was rained off.</p>
        
            <p>With less than 15 overs bowled in the decider at Eden Park, Auckland's position as top qualifier saw them handed the trophy.</p>
        
            <p>The washout gave Auckland the Super Smash title for the fifth time, while Canterbury have now finished runner up in the last four successive finals.</p>
        
            <p>Before the rain, the Kings appeared on course for a big total, as opener Tom Latham made an unbeaten 58 from just 33 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Henry Nicholls added 42 from 35, as the pair put on 90 runs for the second wicket.</p>
        
            <p>But the rain had the final say with the score at 133/2.</p>
