            <p>Australia have the upper hand at lunch on day one of the second cricket test against New Zealand, with the hosts 71 for three at the break at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The batters out are Tom Latham (38) Will Young (14) and Rachin Ravindra (4).</p>
        
            <p>Australia skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bowl.</p>
        
            <p>Josh Hazelwood has taken two wickets so far while Mitchell Starc picked up the other.</p>
        
            <p>Heading into the final over before lunch the session had been evenly poised given the Black Caps had lost just two wicket but a loose shot from Ravindra saw him fall on the last ball before the break and giving Australia the edge.</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson in his 100th test is unbeaten on 9 and will be joined after lunch by Daryl Mitchell.</p>
        
            <p>Australia lead the two test series 1-nil.</p>
