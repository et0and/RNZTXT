            <p>New Zealand raised British tennis No.1 Cameron Norrie came through his first match at the ASB Classic unscathed as three of the top six seeds advanced to Thrusday's quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>French 19-year-old Arthur Fils breezed past Portugal's Nuno Borges while second seed Norrie, who grew up in Auckland, beat French teenager Luca van Assche in three sets.</p>
        
            <p>Top seeded American Ben Shelton also moved into the last eight with a straight sets win.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton, ranked 16 in the world at just 21 years, bludgeoned his way to a 6-4 6-3 victory over Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, who had beaten Gail Monfils on opening day.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Fils, just 19 years, impressed in his dismantling of Borges 6-2 6-0.</p>
        
            <p>28-year-old Cameron Norrie, a regular playing and watching at this arena as a youth, who produced an impressive and courageous display infront of a packed house.</p>
        
            <p>Norrie, who grew up in Auckland before moving to the UK, beat off the outstanding junior Luca van Assche (FRA) 6-3 6-7 6-1 to move into the quarterfinals.</p>
        
            <p>"That was pretty special. Like the old Cam Norrie win, having to tough it out, had a match point in the second set. Credit it to him, it was a tough match and I was happy with the way I responded when I went down a break in the third," said Norrie.</p>
        
            <p>"It was so special to play out here tonight. They do it so well here at this tournament. A lot of people here know me from playing as a junior here, so nice to be ab le to put a performance on infront of them all. And it keeps my chances alive."</p>
        
            <p>Both Fils and Shelton were pleased with their performances.</p>
        
            <p>"I was playing pretty good and I was feeling great on the court," said Fils.</p>
        
            <p>"The crowd helped me a little bit in the first set because it was a little tough, but from then I was feeling pretty good and I am happy with the win."</p>
        
            <p>Fils knows it will be a more difficult assignment against German Daniel Altmaier, who upset fourth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime (CAN) 7-6 7-5.</p>
        
            <p>"I lost to Altmaier last time so tomorrow (Thursday) will be a tough match but I will try my best to win. Let's see tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Shelton will take on Spain's Roberto Carballes Baena in his quarterfinal, after he disposed of Austria's Sebastian Ofner 7-5 6-3, while Norrie will meet Chilean qualifier Alejandro Tabilo.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining quarterfinal will see another qualifier, Alexandre Muller (FRA) play Japan's Taro Daniel.</p>
        
            <p>The doubles competition continued with most interest on New Zealand's Michael Venus, who has a career-high sixth in the world rankings, who began his campaign with regular partner Jamie Murray.</p>
        
            <p>However their late-night clash went the way of the super-talented Belgian pair of Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen who won 10-4 in the super-tiebreak.</p>
