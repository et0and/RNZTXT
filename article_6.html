            <p>It was the hardest call in Halberg history.</p>
        
            <p>Lydia Ko or Lisa Carrington?</p>
        
            <p>Both dames. Both GOATs.</p>
        
            <p>But only one could be crowned and it was Queen Ko who reigned supreme at last night's sports awards in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It was a stunning year for Ko, who won Olympic gold in Paris and the British Open in the same month, was later inducted into golf's Hall of Fame and now caps it off with sportswoman and supreme Halberg awards for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Unable to attend the event, Ko spoke via video link from overseas, 11 years after last winning the country's most prestigious sporting prize.</p>
        
            <p>"2024 was a very special year for me and definitely one of the biggest highlights of my career.</p>
        
            <p>"So to get recognised as the Halberg Sportswoman of the Year is a huge honour especially as there were so many decorated female athletes that represented New Zealand all year round.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very thankful for this amazing award and thank you to the whole of New Zealand for supporting me unconditionally and I am very grateful that I could bring the gold medal to my country."</p>
        
            <p>Carrington did not go home empty handed, spearheading the team of the year winners, the K4 sprint team.</p>
        
            <p>She said this year presented the greatest field of female finalists for the supreme award.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredible, right? You've got three other gold medallists in there. I'm absolutely inspired by every one of those women."</p>
        
            <p>Presenting the supreme award was All Black legend Dan Carter, who said any one of the six female finalists could have won the top prize.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pretty lucky to be leading the way in women's sports, it could have gone to a number of the nominees today. It's just another reminder that us Kiwis, we punch above our weight when it comes to sport."</p>
        
            <p>For the heights he reached in Paris, Olympic gold medallist Hamish Kerr won sportsman of the year.</p>

            <p>Kerr said it was an honour to etch his name alongside so many certified Kiwi legends.</p>
        
            <p>"I grew up just adoring New Zealand sport and watching so much of it. Probably a little bit too much of it sometimes, but to be able to add my name to the legacy is very special."</p>
        
            <p>The high-jumper says he is still becoming accustomed to his new found celebrity status.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely weird. I have to be a bit more aware of what I buy at the supermarket, but no, for the most part it's been really cool. I think if I can inspire more young people to get outside and just enjoy movement that's something that I'm super grateful to be able to do."</p>
        
            <p>Also, following in the footsteps of her heroes was Para athlete of the year Anna Grimaldi, who was presented with her award by former winner Sophie Pascoe in a full circle moment.</p>
        
            <p>"I did my year 12 speech on her, so it's a really cool moment to have it presented by such a legend," Grimaldi said.</p>
        
            <p>As a child she hid her disability, before para-sports helped her see it differently, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Being a little girl I was super shy, I didn't want anyone to know I had one hand, it wasn't until I was exposed to para-sport that it showed me a disability is a blessing.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish I had let people in sooner, I am very proud of who I am, and I wish little Anna found the courage to do that sooner but I hope now the little Annas of today will see themselves reflected."</p>
        
            <p>She said she vividly recalls her gold medal winning moment.</p>
        
            <p>"I still remember every footstep, every thought, there were 70,000 people in the crowd and it was deafening out there, but it couldn't have been more silent in my lane."</p>
        
            <p>Another category which was incredibly tough to pick was team of the year, which went the way of the women's K4 sprint kayak crew.</p>
        
            <p>Alicia Hopkins said despite having the GOAT in the boat as a teammate, Carrington ensured all members felt valued.</p>

            <p>"I first paddled with Lisa when I was about 18 and my legs wouldn't stop shaking. I was so nervous and excited and not much has changed, but what has changed is just our relationship as a team. We are all equals in the team and that's what I think gets us across the line."</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately there won't be a lot of time to celebrate for the crew.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got training in the morning. We get a bit of a sleep in, but 8am on the water."</p>
        
            <p>Not ignoring the ones who helped guide our athletes to their success, coach of the year went to the man at the helm of the K4 winning crew, Gordon Walker, who won for a staggering sixth time.</p>
        
            <p>The fans also got to have their say, picking Finn Butcher's Paris win in the canoe slalom as their favourite moment of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher believed having his parents in the crowd to celebrate with him after all the sacrifice was what resonated with Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"And so to be able to share that with the country as well, and obviously people like to see that and could relate to it."</p>
        
            <p>He said his viral mana wave probably didn't hurt either.</p>
        
            <p>"It also probably contributed to me winning the gold I think!"</p>
        
            <p>But the night belonged to Ko, who added yet another trophy to her substantial cabinet.</p>
