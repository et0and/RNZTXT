            <p>Joaquin Reinoso might just be New Zealand's top teenage sporting talent that you've never heard of.</p>
        
            <p>The 13-year-old footballer is about to take on his second year at Velez Sarsfield youth academy, playing at the club's 2011-born age group team.</p>
        
            <p>The Buenos Aires club plays in Argentina's top division and has one of the most esteemed academies in world football.</p>
        
            <p>"They want the best from you. You know, they they try to bring the best out of you," Reinoso said.</p>
        
            <p>"In Argentina they're more direct with you, if you want to be professional you have to do these things... they push you to perfection."</p>
        
            <p>Reinoso was born in New Zealand to Argentinean parents, Vanesa and Lautaro, who immigrated here in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Joaquin's father, a once promising footballer himself in Argentina, has developed his son's skills from an early age, helped by Wynton Rufer's WYNRS academy and Auckland United.</p>
        
            <p>Reinoso's talents were spotted by a football agent and former Argentine international Federico Domínguez during a family holiday in Argentina in 2021, leading to Velez offering Joaquin a chance at the club and a scholarship at a local school.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager moving to Buenos Aires with his mother in late 2023 to take up the opportunity despite not being fluent in Spanish.</p>
        
            <p>"The difference I think with football in New Zealand is the attitude and the passion with the game, they're more rough, they want it, they'll foul you to get the ball," the teenager said.</p>
        
            <p>
In 2025, Joaquin Reinoso will play against teens from across Argentina, not just Buenos Aires.

            <p>The family said a Kiwi boy playing in Buenos Aires naturally raised a few eyebrows among locals at first, but the winger has proven he belongs earning another year in the academy.</p>
        
            <p>This year represents a big step-up in his development where he will play against kids from across Argentina, not just Buenos Aires.</p>
        
            <p>It is why the family moved quickly to get him a sports psychologist.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that if you're not good in your mind, it would be very, very, very hard to become professional," Lautaro said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just about the extra gym or the extra touches on the ball and he knows that even though it was hard for him to step up and say, yeah, I wanna do these lessons with the psychology.</p>
        
            <p>"He understood this would help for his future."</p>

            <p>According to those who have coached Joaquin in New Zealand, that future has plenty of promise.</p>
        
            <p>"From what I've seen, I don't see any reason why he won't be an international footballer," said veteran football coach Kim Beale.</p>
        
            <p>"There's not many Kiwi kids playing at clubs like Velez around the world, I'd be very surprised if anybody's playing as high as that. You know, most of them go into clubs in Europe at low divisions."</p>
        
            <p>Beale coaches Joaquin while he is home in Auckland between seasons as Velez.</p>
        
            <p>"It's rated 17th in the world, and the only English academy higher is Manchester United, so it's very high," Beale said.</p>
        
            <p>"They've had a very successful year this year, right through the youth teams into their first team. So he is at the very top in South America, I'd be surprised if any other kid is playing higher than that."</p>

            <p>Previous interest from European clubs like Manchester United and Valencia has been shown but were unable to materialise due to Joaquin not holding a European passport.</p>
        
            <p>"Without a passport in Europe now is very hard. FIFA doesn't allow young kids to move countries just for football, which used to happen before," Lautaro said.</p>
        
            <p>But that could play in New Zealand Football's favour who have yet to identify Joaquin's talents.</p>
        
            <p>Eligible for Argentina and Italy, Reinoso wants to wear the silver fern.</p>
        
            <p>"I would love to and hope to play for New Zealand," said the rising Kiwi star.</p>
