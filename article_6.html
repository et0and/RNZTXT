            <p>Australian Jack Doohan, son of motorcycle great Mick, will make his Formula One debut for Alpine in Monday's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after departing Esteban Ocon was released early, the Renault-owned team said.</p>
        
            <p>Ocon has signed for Haas and the switch will allow him to take part in the post-season test at Yas Marina next week, while also preparing Doohan for next season when he graduates from reserve to full race driver.</p>
        
            <p>Doohan, 21, joins French driver Pierre Gasly at a team currently fighting Haas in a close battle for sixth place in the championship.</p>
        
            <p>Alpine moved five points clear of their U.S.-owned rivals on Monday after Gasly finished fifth at the Qatar Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>Ocon, a race winner for the team in Hungary in 2021, was caught up in a collision at the start and retired.</p>
        
            <p>Doohan will debut with his reserve driver number 61 and will also take part in the end-of-season test.</p>
        
            <p>The switch had been flagged up already after the race at Lusail, with team boss Oliver Oakes telling reporters it would suit everybody concerned.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess you could say it's good to get Jack in early. I think you could say from Esteban's side it's good to move on early," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Oakes said Doohan would be able to "get those butterflies gone now rather than next year in Australia", with Melbourne the opening race of 2025 on 16 March.</p>
