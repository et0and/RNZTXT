        <h2>'Easier said than done’ – Savea reflects on tough All Blacks loss</h2>
        <p>
The disappointment on the vice-captain's face was evident as the All Blacks search for answers.
</p>
        
            <p>All Black vice-captain Ardie Savea said that the team was "gutted" following their tough 18-12 defeat to the Springboks in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel for the boys," he said after the match, the first since 2018 where the All Blacks have failed to score a try.</p>
        
            <p>"We had the opportunities to close it out and finish it, but we didn't. It's a testament to the Springboks and what they do. The boys are really gutted."</p>
        
            <p>That inability to convert possession and territory into points will be a major narrative as the All Blacks now prepare to face the Wallabies in the two-test Bledisloe Cup series.</p>
        
            <p>When asked why it was such a common theme - they have failed to score in the last 20 minutes of their last four tests - Savea said that it was down to "individual skillsets".</p>
        
            <p>"As a leader, it starts with us. We've got to front foot things…we're getting in the right areas of the field and giving the Springboks penalties or losing the ball. We've got to try and stop those, but it's easier said than done."</p>
        
            <p>Savea said it was crucial that the All Blacks recharge on their week off before they assemble and travel to Sydney.</p>

            <p>"Obviously we feel the hurt tonight. But I'm a bit of an optimistic fella, my baby son turned two today. So even though I'm hurt, I'm still grateful for the little things in life. I'll go home, see the family and I'm sure most of the other boys will too. Then we'll come in, ready to work and take the lessons instead of talking about it…then come back together with a hiss and a roar."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the losses, Savea said that the All Blacks had gained plenty as a team on their first visit to South Africa in two years. Both tests were played in front of full houses at Ellis Park and DHL Stadium, with demand for tickets reportedly so high they could've sold out both venues three times over.</p>
        
            <p>It has played nicely into the now very strong rumours that the All Blacks will return for a full, three test match tour with an additional six midweek games in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been amazing being in South Africa. The people have been welcoming, coming to meet us at our hotels, making us feel like it's a second home. Then when we play, the atmosphere is crazy. We love playing here, it's the ultimate test match."</p>
