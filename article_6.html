            <p>Auckland-based canoe sprint siblings Tuva'a and Samalulu Clifton are in Paris to represent Samoa at the Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>They both have heats starting tonight, Tuva'a in the men's K1 1000m and Samalulu in the K1 500m.</p>
        
            <p>They are the only kayakers in Samoa's 24-strong team.</p>

            <p>The pair have spent 12 years honing their skills at Lake Pupuke, but this is the first time both have made it to the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Tuva'a told Morning Report he competed for Samoa in Tokyo, while Samalulu is making her debut.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about competing at the same regatta as his younger sister he responded: "She can really annoy me at times but it is quite nice to have her [here]."</p>
        
            <p>He had recently moved home to save on costs for the Olympics trip and while there were obviously some ups and downs,Tuva'a said it had its advantages too.</p>
        
            <p>They could go to training and the gym together as both focused on getting to Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"So it has helped with our trainings working together and aiming for the Olympics together, and it is a bonus we both managed to qualify."</p>

            <p>It felt good to compete for Samoa and be representing such a small country on the big stage, Tuva'a said. Although New Zealand raised they have Samoan heritage on their mother's side.</p>
        
            <p>"By competing for Samoa we do get amongst our heritage and everyone in Samoa watches us ...we're really excited to be competing for Samoa."</p>
        
            <p>For his Games buildup Tuva'a competed at the kayak world championships in Duisberg in Germany a year ago and the Oceania champs at Sydney where the siblings both qualified for the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'm looking forward to getting out there ...to race for Samoa ... and I'm in the deep end with the world's best which I'm excited about.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to try not to fangirl over some of the other competitors that are in my heat with me because I have grown up watching them race and been like 'wow those guys are amazing' and I'm going to be on the start line with them so it's going to be a lot of mixed emotions."</p>
        
            <p>Both got into canoeing via surf lifesaving at Muriwai beach.</p>
        
            <p>Part of surf sports with lifesaving is the surf ski which is like a kayak that can go in waves.</p>
        
            <p>They wanted to get better so they joined the local kayak club.</p>
        
            <p>"That was 12 years ago and now kayaking is our main sport and we're at the Olympics."</p>
