            <p>It's showtime in New York as the US Open 2024 gets underway and tries to be the biggest, "baddest" and craziest tennis event in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Once again, the prizemoney has been upgraded, from U$60 million 9NZ$96.2m) to US$75 million in total player compensation, the most of a Grand Slam in total. The men's and women's singles winners get US$3.6m each while a first-round loser takes home US$160,000.</p>
        
            <p>Already the Open is claiming a record of breaking its own attendance record at Kids Day. Approximately 47,875 (up 7000) went through the gates to see entertainers and players on court as well as legend Andre Agassi hit with lucky prize winners.</p>
        
            <p>Previous entertainers included the Jonas Brothers, Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen - all before they became famous.</p>
        
            <p>The following day Arthur Ashe stadium featured around 18,000 spectators to watch Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Coco Gauff among others practise. Every shot in practice was applauded and cheered. There is an appetite for tennis in New York.</p>

            <p>The US Open crowd figure for 2023 was 950,000, but the Australian Open hit the one million total in January. Watch as tournament organisers in New York try and beat their Aussie rivals. Sometimes it's not about the tennis, but egos.</p>
        
            <p>As for the New Zealanders as the tournament gets underway there are four players in total.</p>
        
            <p>The in-form Lulu Sun becomes the first New Zealander to play in singles in New York since Marina Erakovic in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Sun missed out on her chance of a first Women's Tennis Association title, losing to Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic at the Monterrey Open in Mexico on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>In doubles there's world No 1 and defending champion Erin Routliffe with regular partner Gaby Dabrowski from Canada, although they have a tough first round draw to try and retain their title.</p>
        
            <p>In men's doubles there's two pairs, Michael Venus and Britain's Neal Skupski are the eighth seeds. Strangely, for all of his success throughout his career Venus has never passed the third round in men's doubles at the US Open.</p>
        
            <p>In his last Grand Slam Marcus Daniell is teaming with Mexican Miguel Reyes-Varela.</p>
        
            <p>Daniell claimed a bronze with Venus at the Tokyo Olympics, has won five ATP titles as well as reached a career high ranking of 34 and made the quarters at three Grand Slams.</p>
        
            <p>He's now heavily involved in charity and leadership in sport around the world.</p>
