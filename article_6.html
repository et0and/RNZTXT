            <p>Blues prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi has been ruled out of the rest of the Super Rugby Pacific season with a neck injury in a further blow for the struggling defending champions.</p>
        
            <p>The 68-test All Black will undergo surgery, the Blues said.</p>
        
            <p>It puts Tu'ungafasi in doubt for New Zealand's three-test series against France, with the first match starting on 5 July.</p>
        
            <p>Dates for the Super Rugby playoffs have yet to be confirmed but the championship-deciding grand final will be in the second half of June.</p>
        
            <p>The Vern Cotter-coached Blues are second from bottom in the table with a 1-5 record ahead of a home clash against the seventh-placed Hurricanes on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>While Tu'ungafasi will be missed, the Blues have welcomed back reinforcements in the form of playmaker Beauden Barrett and captain Patrick Tuipulotu.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett will start at first-five after recovering from a hand injury while lock Tuipulotu slots back into the second row in the match-day squad announced on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Though named in the squad, the pair must still get through heavy contact training on Thursday, Cotter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully they will come through a big week of effort on the training field, and the team can focus on getting our processes right for a positive performance," he added.</p>
