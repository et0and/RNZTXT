            <p>A "devastated" Sinéad Diver has hit out at the criticism she has faced online after failing to finish the women's marathon at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The 47-year-old, who ran the best time in the Australian women's marathon qualifiers, lasted just over a kilometre before succumbing to cramping in her quadriceps.</p>
        
            <p>Diver's withdrawal reignited controversy surrounding the selection for Australia's women's marathon, with questions asked over why Athletics Australia didn't fly Lisa Weightman to Paris as a potential back-up while knowing Diver had been battling injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Weightman, 45, was denied the opportunity to become the first Australian athletics competitor to compete in five Olympics when she was overlooked for Diver, Genevieve Gregson and Jess Stenson, despite running a faster qualification time than Stenson. Her appeal over the selection was denied.</p>
        
            <p>National bodies are allowed to select as many as three runners in their marathon squad, as long as they all have achieved a time under the qualification standard within the allotted period - in this case by running a time of 2 hours, 26 minutes and 50 seconds between 6 November, 2022, to 5 May, 2024. Six Australian women ran under the required time: Diver, Gregson, Weightman, Isobel Batt-Doyle, Stenson and Eloise Wellings.</p>
        
            <p>In a lengthy Instagram post following her withdrawal, Diver revealed she'd been dealing with a "plantar issue" in the lead-up to the race, but denied claims she wasn't fit enough to start.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm absolutely devastated to have had to dnf at my second Olympic Games. I was dealing with a plantar issue in the lead in to this race. It was manageable and I was training, fit and ready to race. That had nothing to do with why I pulled out," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"In the warm-up, my quads started to spasm without any warning. I hoped it would resolve as I started running but it didn't and they seized up within the first km to the point that I couldn't bend my knees. I don't fully understand what's caused this.</p>
        
            <p>"The lead in to this race has been one of the most challenging times of my life. The vitriol online has had a significant impact on my mental health and I have no doubt that has played a part in my body breaking down in this way. The culmination of stress over the last few weeks has finally taken its toll.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm aware of some of the negative commentary during (and) since the race but this time I'm not going to listen. This is what happened. If you choose not to believe it, then so be it."</p>
        
            <p>Diver's statement followed one from the AOC, which also stated that she was medically cleared to start the marathon in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"Sinéad Diver withdrew from the marathon after experiencing bilateral cramping in both quadriceps at Paris 2024," the AOC statement read.</p>
        
            <p>"She is devastated and being supported by team officials and medical staff.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite managing plantar fasciitis at times this year, there was no physical reason for Sinéad to not compete today."</p>
        
            <p>Stenson was Australia's best performer in the marathon, finishing 13th with a time of 2:26:45, while Gregson finished 24th running a 2:29:56 in the race that was won by Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.</p>
