        <h2>NRL: Johnson 'open-minded' for another year at the Warriors</h2>
        <p>
Despite the disappointment of a big loss on the weekend, Shaun Johnson isn't ruling out spending another season at Mt Smart.

            <p>Despite the disappointment of a big loss on the weekend, Shaun Johnson certainly isn't ruling out another year with the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old halfback says that while contract renegotiations won't happen until later in the season, he is "open-minded about everything",</p>
        
            <p>"So much goes into a decision that goes into playing on," Johnson said at Mt Smart Stadium on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially at the tender age (of 33). I'm just so open-minded about everything. I'm not down one path as opposed to the other anymore, so I'm taking it week by week. To actually make the decision to play on, I have to receive a contract offer, and that hasn't happened yet."</p>
        
            <p>However, coach Andrew Webster was unequivocal when it came to the matter.</p>
        
            <p>"Hundred percent. Love to have Shaun around again. We spoke at the start of the season that we are going to have that conversation later in the year. I think he's huge for the team, I think he's important and I love the way he's playing. It's only early in the season, we've got a good relationship, we'll work it when we can."</p>
        
            <p>Webster admitted that while it was the same narrative that played out last year - which ultimately ended with Johnson agreeing to come back for another tilt at the Warriors' first ever premiership - the halfback's form would mean "the conversation is different, given what's he's got behind him".</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't really know that last year and he'd admit that himself. He's got 12 months of amazing football under his belt (now)."</p>

            <p>Webster also confirmed that Johnson was currently playing through an Achilles tendon injury.</p>
        
            <p>"He wants to win so bad he's willing to do what it takes, but he hasn't trained much in the last few weeks and didn't train today. But got every confidence he'll be right (for Thursday's match)."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson paid tribute to the work done behind the scenes at the Warriors, especially the environment that saw the shock announcement last week about the arrival of James Fisher-Harris in 2025. He admitted that signing was another factor in what Johnson's eventual decision will be regarding his playing future.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty cool, it's certainly something to celebrate and want to play on for. A massive scoop for the club."</p>
        
            <p>If he does decide to hang up the boots, Johnson was confident the Warriors were well-placed for life without him.</p>
        
            <p>"Our roster is extremely talented and we've got a lot of depth. What I love about it is that we're enticing players, Kiwi-born players, to come back and represent this club. That's through the hard work that the coaching staff and the direction Webby (coach Andrew Webster) has taken us in. A few years ago we didn't have many with that desire to come back and be a part of this. So it shows that we're doing something rightâ€¦ I think that the whole movement of rugby league is trending in the right direction."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors face the Gold Coast Titans on Thursday, the first home Anzac Day fixture for the club since 2015.</p>
        
            <p>The Titans are currently winless in 2024, but have been unlucky in their past two games, losing 21-20 to the Raiders and 34-30 to the Sea Eagles.</p>
