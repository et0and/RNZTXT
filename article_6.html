            <p>Luna Rossa and Britannia have moved to the brink of qualification for the America's Cup challenger series final.</p>
        
            <p>In strong winds with the boats reaching speeds of more than 90km/h, the Italians beat American Magic by 26 seconds in their first race, but came from behind to win by just two seconds in the second race of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Luna Rossa skipper Jimmy Spithill was not getting too excited after the day's racing.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys did a very good job today - very, very, consistent and we knew we had to try and take some steps forward after yesterday," he said afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just taking one race at a time whether we're four up or four down. It's really the same process, same preparation, we're two very evenly matched teams."</p>
        
            <p>The British are also 4-0 up in their semi-final after another two dominant wins over Alinghi of Switzerland.</p>
        
            <p>Britannia won the first by two minutes and 20 seconds and the second by 48 seconds, but they almost collided in the pre-start of race one.</p>
        
            <p>Dylan Fletcher from Britannia said they were just focusing on the progress.</p>
        
            <p>"We're focusing on each day as it comes and certainly just trying to keep the boat going faster. We've just got to keep getting better, and we know that in the history of the Cup it's the boat that progresses and gets the fastest that wins. You don't have to be the fastest at the start, you just need to be the fastest by the end. So, we're just focusing on ourselves and working hard."</p>
        
            <p>The first to five wins qualification for the challenger series final.</p>
        
            <p>Racing continues on Monday.</p>
