            <p>The Black Ferns sevens have won two trophies in two weeks after beating Australia 29-14 in the Los Angeles round of the World series.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Michaela Blyde scored a hat-trick for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand now sits just four points behind series leaders Australia on the overall ladder after winning the Vancouver leg last week.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens suffered a blow when Jorja Miller went down with an injury inside the first 30 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Play was paused for a couple minutes and Miller did not return to the field but was up on her feet on the sideline.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns sevens scored two tries in the first half courtesy of Blyde to lead 12-7 at the main break.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after half-time New Zealand captain Risi Pouri-Lane scored a try, taking advantage of Australia being a player down with Madison Levi given a yellow card.</p>

            <p>Portia Woodman-Wickliffe then scored before Blyde had the final say of the game by crossing for her third try.</p>
        
            <p>The last two meetings between the sides have gone Australia's way and Pouri-Lane, who was named the player of the final, told Sky Sport </p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to continue momentum, continue having composure amongst our team ...it was about getting that flow together and being able to express the gifts that the girls have."</p>
        
            <p>"The depth is awesome within our team ...we know we can trust the whole group of girls to get the job done," Pouri-Lane said.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks Sevens finished 10th in LA after losing to Samoa in the ninth place playoff.</p>
