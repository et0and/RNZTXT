            <p>Daryl Mitchell will miss the final match of the Twenty20 Series against Pakistan in Christchurch tomorrow as part of management his workload.</p>
        
            <p>With Mitchell withdrawn from consideration for selection, Wellington Firebird Rachin Ravindra will join the squad in Christchurch for tomorrow's match.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead said the decision to have Mitchell sit the match out was based on the team's position in the current series and the upcoming schedule.</p>
        
            <p>"Daryl is an important player for us across all three formats and ensuring he's in the best place to perform in international cricket is vital.</p>
        
            <p>"Rachin is coming off a period of rest himself and will bring a valuable skill set to the group in this final match as he continues his return to cricket," said Stead.</p>
        
            <p>Scoring 72 runs off 44 balls Mitchell helped the Black Caps claim the fourth T20 International in Christchurch on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell combined with Glenn Phillips for an unbroken 139-run stand, to power them to a fourth straight victory.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra's last T20 for New Zealand was against England in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>A decision on Devon Conway's availability for the final match of the series will be made tomorrow morning.</p>
        
            <p>Conway was ruled out of the fourth Twenty20 against Pakistan after testing positive for COVID.</p>
