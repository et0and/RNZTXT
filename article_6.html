        <h2>Black gold – what this Olympic Sevens tournament means for women’s rugby</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - The Black Ferns' triumph is big for Aotearoa, but something much bigger might come out of their podium moment, Jamie Wall writes.

            <p>Analysis - You have to hand it to the Black Ferns Sevens, they certainly know how to live up to the expectations that come with a black jersey. Their 19-12 win over Canada in the Olympic final was a perfect way for New Zealand to wake up on Wednesday, not least because it finally got us off the mark on the medal table.</p>
        
            <p>Firstly, it's important to recognise that it sent out a legend of the sport in the way she deserved. Portia Woodman-Wickliffe added another gold medal to her incomparable list of career achievements and cemented her legacy as the greatest women's player ever. Never mind the fact that she got sinbinned and readily admitted post-match that she'd had a horrible game - everything else she'd given to the Sevens and XVs programmes up until then more than makes up for it.</p>
        
            <p>Then there's the ones we may not see again: Tyla King (nee Nathan-Wong) and Stacey Waaka are headed to the NRLW and may or may not be back, while Sarah Hirini's incredible recovery from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee may be the last campaign for another legend of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>That's for later, though. But while the focus here has rightly been on the Black Ferns Sevens and their golden moment, as well as just how incredible it was to see it being played in front of 66,000 at Stade de France, the much wider victory for rugby is probably who was standing next to them on the podium.</p>

            <p>The narrative around the United States being the 'sleeping giant' of the sport has been around so long it's turned into a running joke, which has been causing some severe worries given that's where World Rugby has awarded the hosting rights to the 2031 World Cup. While they have a claim to actually being a successful Olympic side (albeit a century ago), the idea of rugby taking a foothold in America has remained a pipe dream for decades.</p>
        
            <p>That might change, given their women's Sevens side just picked up a bronze medal in a thrilling third-place play-off game against the seemingly cursed Australians. The attention on the US women has been immense, at least in rugby terms, with the side becoming social media darlings overnight thanks in no small part to some typical over the top reactions by Americans who had never seen rugby before.</p>

            <p>Included in those gushing praise were former first lady Michelle Obama, as well as many high profile sports pundits trying to put the achievement in American Football terms.</p>
        
            <p>But the real kicker is what happens next, given the US Sevens side has now proven itself. The next Olympic Games are being held in Los Angeles, meaning that the already formidable investment in elite level American sport will go even further to make sure they dominate on home turf.</p>
        
            <p>Already, Kynisca Sports International's Michele Kang has pledged a US$4 million investment in the Sevens programme. Kynisca is the first global, female owned, multi-club organisation in women's football, who own the Washington Spirit, Olympique Lyonnais Feminin and London City Lionesses clubs.</p>

            <p>So what does this mean for the Black Ferns Sevens and NZ Rugby? If this American revolution happens, it'll obviously provide a serious challenge on the field, but it's not bad news at all for our governing body. NZR have long been trying to grow their brand in the US, with the latest attempt at San Diego's Snapdragon Stadium success. There are probably a few dollar signs in the eyes after this morning's result, which has to be seen as a win/win for those committed to the America First doctrine.</p>
        
            <p>But until then, let's just enjoy the very welcome golden glow the Black Ferns Sevens side have once again brought - just as almost everyone thought they would.</p>
