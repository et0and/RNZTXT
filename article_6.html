            <p>The Fiji men's sevens rugby team has booked a quarterfinal spot at the Hong Kong Sevens tournament after winning both pool matches Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>A record crowd of 120,000 fans are expected to watch the three-day action of the 5th World Sevens series event at the new Kai Tak Park.</p>
        
            <p>Fijian fans have already packed into the arena's north stand behind the goalposts.</p>
        
            <p>Pumped by their fans' backing, the Fijians fought hard to beat Ireland 21-19 in a gripping Pool A encounter, having trailed 7-12 in the first few minutes.</p>

            <p>Earlier that afternoon they defeated the USA team 26-21 in another thrilling encounter.</p>
        
            <p>The two wins have guaranteed the team a quarterfinal spot, with their last pool match against Argentina set for Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>But the Fijian women's team will have to win their last pool match against Great Britain to claim a quarterfinal berth. The side was beaten 24-14 by France.</p>
        
            <p>The French side led 17-0 at halftime, taking advantage of some ill decisions by the Fijians. Fiji struck back with two tries, but it was not enough to stop the French from winning the clash.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand also started their campaigns well, both in the men's and women's competition.</p>
        
            <p>The men's team claimed two victories, a strong 21-12 win over Australia plus a 29-0 beating of Uruguay. The women's team thrashed China 45-0 before recording a 33-21 win over USA.</p>
        
            <p>Men's current top team, Argentina, had two big outings on Friday night, winning both their pool matches and keeping their campaign to win the Hong Kong title on track. They defeated Ireland 35-7, before thrashing USA 52-5 to close their first-day appearances on a high.</p>
        
            <p>Spain, the current second-placed team on the points table, lost their first pool match 19-0 to Kenya but came back strong to win 19-12 over France.</p>
        
            <p>In the women's competition, Australia were also on the dot with their two pool games, winning both. They defeated Spain 54-12 and Canada 26-15.</p>
