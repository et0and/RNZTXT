        <h2>NRL: Warriors happy to be hanging on to Luke Metcalf</h2>
        <p>
The 25-year-old has signed a two-year contract extension at the club.
</p>
        
            <p>Newly re-signed Warriors half Luke Metcalf said it was an easy decision to extend his stay at the club for another two years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to have the coach have confidence and trusting you," he said at the team's media session on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to repay the faith that he's shown in me."</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Webster has selected Metcalf out of a crowded halves picture at the Warriors, with Te Maire Martin and Chanel Harris-Tavita currently playing in the reserves.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old from Coffs Harbour, NSW, said at the start of the season that his role was to "do the things that Shaun (Johnson) didn't have to", but his confidence was growing in the role.</p>

            <p>"I want to make sure I'm doing what's best for the team, and make sure I'm getting better individually as well. I feel like confidence is a big part of my game, getting my hands on the ball and scheming around the ruck… that's where I'm at my best."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said it was "awesome for the club, awesome for Luke. I'm so glad he's here".</p>
        
            <p>"He got the nod in round one because he's worked hard, he's playing really good footy. He needs to keep doing that."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the re-signing being a clear indication of what Webster's long-term plans were, Metcalf played down any talk of him being immediately elevated to a more senior role.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a lot of good leaders here, a lot of older boys…I don't think they really need me to be that yet. It's something I want to be as I get older, I want to be someone the younger boys can look up to, if it happens sooner rather than later that'd be good."</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf said that he was "over" the Warriors' dramatic loss to the Storm last weekend, a game that finished 30-26 after a spectacular Xavier Coates try settled the result.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't believe it when it happened…as soon as I opened my phone after the game it was just every Instagram post was about that. It was crazy, how he jumped from five, six metres out and got it down…like it was cool to watch as a fan."</p>
        
            <p>Friday night sees the Warriors up against the unbeaten Raiders at a sold-out Apollo Projects Stadium in Christchurch. Metcalf was expecting a tough battle.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got a really good forward pack, two big boys up the front. Whenever I can inject myself, take the short side or just whatever it is. Playing confident, that's when I play my best.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like the main thing is putting together an 80-minute performance. In the Sharks game we started well, then against the Storm it was the opposite. I feel like it's just putting together a consistent performance."</p>
        
            <p>They will need to, with matches coming up against the Knights, Rabbitohs and high-flying Sea Eagles in the next month. The Warriors currently sit 14th on the NRL ladder.</p>
