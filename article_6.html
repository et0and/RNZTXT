        <h2>'Cinderella story' to win gold in Paris, Lydia Ko says</h2>
        <p>
But not even a gold medal is likely to persuade Lydia Ko to get another tattoo.

            <p>Not even a gold medal is likely to persuade Lydia Ko to get another tattoo.</p>
        
            <p>Ko was preparing herself for her third Olympic golf tournament in Paris with two medals already in the trophy cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>She won silver in Rio in 2016 and bronze in Tokyo three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>A gold medal in Paris would mean she would become just the sixth New Zealander to have won a medal of every colour at a summer Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes it would be the Cinderella story if I win gold here," Ko told RNZ.</p>

            <p>"I went into Rio hoping to medal, while Tokyo was a bit of a surprise as I wasn't playing at my highest level of golf."</p>
        
            <p>Since winning in January, Ko has had just three top ten finishes including a tie for eighth at last week's Canadian Open.</p>
        
            <p>However she was not too concerned about her form.</p>
        
            <p>"I've definitely played better coming into the games and these kind of events bring out the good in you.</p>
        
            <p>"There is good adrenaline and hopefully I can channel all of that in and have a good week."</p>
        
            <p>So what about the Olympic rings with ferns she has tattooed on her bicep?</p>
        
            <p>"I got the tattoo because I wanted to mark the date I won the medal in Rio because it was my first one.</p>
        
            <p>" I already have a lot of ink on my body so I'm not sure if I should be adding any more.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got the ferns also so it reminds me of that special moment and it gives me a lot of confidence and something I can be really proud of also."</p>
        
            <p>Will she add to it somehow?</p>
        
            <p>"No extra ink, but if I do win gold then maybe, but I can't promise anything."</p>
        
            <p>Ko was last in New Zealand in early 2023 for her honeymoon.</p>
        
            <p>She admitted she was now used to life in the United States but still craved time back home.</p>
        
            <p>"When I go back home I realise what I'm missingâ€¦ the people, the food and how calm everything is, I miss the pace of life in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Like the rest of the New Zealand team, Ko was presented with a pounamu pendant on her arrival and while she would not be wearing it while she was playing, she would have it in her golf bag.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very proud to represent New Zealand so will have all of that good energy with me and feel like I'm not alone when I'm on the golf course."</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old said the plan for Paris would be similar to what has got her on the podium at previous games - being aggressive and confident.</p>
        
            <p>"If you come fourth or top ten at any event it's great, but at the end of the day all 60 something players are playing for the three medal spots.</p>
        
            <p>"I did play more aggressively at the past two games, but this golf course (Le Golf National) is a bit more difficult so I have to decide whether being aggressive is smart or not.</p>
        
            <p>"Being aggressive doesn't just mean going at everything, it's also about managing your round and being strategic on how you play."</p>

            <p>Is she in the form that can win her another medal?</p>
        
            <p>"I played really well in Canada and it's nice to say that my last event coming into the games was one of my best results this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully I can channel a lot of the goods from that, and I worked with my coach before leaving America so I feel I've done a lot of good preparation.</p>
        
            <p>"Let the golfing gods decide what is going to happen from here."</p>
        
            <p>The women's golf tournament starts on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders to have won an Olympic medal of every colour are; Paul MacDonald, Dame Valerie Adams, Blyth Tait, Barbara Kendall, Kerri Williams and Zoi Sadowski-Synnott (Winter Olympics).</p>
