            <p>The equation should be simple for the Blues once they hit the field: match or do better than the Hurricanes managed in the early game. If they can, top spot is theirs thanks to their superior points difference. Both these teams are coming in off disappointing losses last weekend, with the Blues getting kneecapped by the Crusaders and the Chiefs bamboozled by the Canes, so there's a bit of form needing to be found before the play-offs start next weekend.</p>

            <p>This is a very powerful looking Blues side, with Finlay Christie back in the match-day squad and creating a nice problem for Vern Cotter as Taufa Funaki has been playing the house down in his absence. AJ Lam comes in at second five for the injured Bryce Heem, pairing up with Rieko Ioane in what should be a fun battle in the midfield. Ricky Riccitelli takes back over at hooker after some Blues set-piece problems last weekend.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs can't actually move out of fourth spot on the table unless the Brumbies lose to the Force and don't get a bonus point, which is unlikely, but Clayton McMillan has named a very strong side for this game anyway. Wallace Sititi gets a start at number eight, while Samipeni Finau returns from injury to play blindside. McMillan has rotated his locks, with Jimmy Tupou and Naitoa Ah Kuoi getting the nod, Tupou Vaa'i and Manaaki Selby-Rickit getting the night off.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going up there to win, so whether it's a one-point win or a six-point win, a 21-point win, we'll take whatever." - Chiefs assistant coach David Hill.</p>
        
            <p>"Our performance wasn't good enough last week, we know that, we've talked about it and we aim to improve it against the Chiefs." - Blues coach Vern Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 20 - 13 Blues</p>
        
            <p>Despite being less than two hours' drive (on a good day) away from each other, this is the first time in a while these sides have played. Last April saw the Chiefs prevail on a rainy evening in Hamilton, in a game that saw Emoni Narawa and Samipeni Finau make some really strong cases for eventual All Black call ups. It was also notable for probably the low point of Beauden Barrett's illustrious career, when he embarrassingly stepped on the dead ball line before grounding the ball for a try.</p>
        
            <p>McMillan does have a bit of a safety option that he'll most probably utilise if the game is not heading the Chiefs' way, which is to pull all his important players. So, it'll be interesting to see at which point he might think that way, but there is every chance the Chiefs aren't even in that position at all. The Blues did expose some pretty glaring weaknesses in their game last weekend, Cotter said the set piece had a reset during training, but that's certainly a place for the Chiefs to target. In saying that, the Blues aren't first equal by accident and have been formidable at Eden Park this season.</p>
