        <h2>Pulse down to training partners in shooting end after another injury</h2>
        <p>
The top of the table Pulse will have to rely completely on training partners in their shooting end while they wait for the return of their frontline shooters, who are now all injured.

            <p>Shooter Khiarna Williams has become the latest casualty in a wretched run of injuries for the Pulse in this year's ANZ Premiership netball league.</p>
        
            <p>Williams suffered a calf strain during the warm-up of last weekend's match between the Pulse and Magic and is expected to be out for up to six weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Williams has been impressive for the Pulse but only managed nine minutes on court during last weekend's game, when the Pulse suffered their first loss of the season.</p>
        
            <p>She joins fellow shooters Tiana Metuarau and Amelia Walmsley on the sidelines.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse are now without the services of any of the shooters named in their original team for this season. Adding to the depleted side is midcourter Maddy Gordon who is out with ankle ligament damage.</p>
        
            <p>It's hoped Walmsley and Gordon might be ready to return to court in time for the finals.</p>
        
            <p>"This is so disappointing for Khiarna and for us as a team," Pulse coach Anna Andrews-Tasola said.</p>

            <p>"In her first year back after two years out with injury, Khiarna was doing so well in her comeback. She has had some great game-winning moments for us this year performing under immense pressure while showing her potential as a strong up-and-coming shooter.</p>
        
            <p>"We're rallying around, offering her all the support she needs and look forward to seeing her back out there when fully recovered."</p>
        
            <p>As a result, Central Manawa injury replacement player Martina Salmon has been fully contracted to the Pulse for the rest of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Salmon, who has played the last two rounds for the Pulse, joins training partner Kiana Pelasio, who has been with the team for much of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Comets National Netball League player Crystal Maro has been drafted into the ranks for this weekend as a temporary replacement player to round out the shooting end.</p>
        
            <p>On a brighter note Metuarau is now back to full running, and this week took part in training with the rest of the team. While she won't suit up this weekend, she's inching closer to a return.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old has not stepped on court so far this season due to an injury she picked up in mid-March. Metuarau suffered a stress reaction in her foot, which has been frustrating for the Silver Fern.</p>

            <p>"...I also know how much I can contribute to our team, and I'm just a bit gutted that because of how well I was doing during pre-season and how hard I had worked, that it all just came to a halt.</p>
        
            <p>"I have never sat out such a huge portion of the season, in fact, I've never been unavailable for a match, so it's new and something I'm experiencing for the first time," Metuarau said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had pretty much done all the pre-season, about 10 weeks of it, didn't miss a session, was feeling probably the fittest and playing the best netball I had in a really long time."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the adversity the team has faced, the Pulse went through the first six rounds unbeaten and are on equal points on the ladder with the Tactix, who just edge them slightly with a superior goal percentage.</p>
        
            <p>Keeping their blemish-free record intact proved a bridge too far when they were upended by the Magic last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I suppose the wheels were going to fall off eventually, like they did at the weekend but there's lots to be proud of and we won't and can't be dwelling on that loss,"' Metuarau said.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse meet the Steel in a Round 8 clash in Invercargill tomorrow.</p>
