            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington and Aimee Fisher will go head to head again this weekend in another intriguing battle ahead of the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The pair will line up in the second World Cup Canoe Sprint regatta in Poland, the final major canoe sprint competition before Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The regatta has attracted all the big names in what is a final dress rehearsal for the Olympics with the six-strong New Zealand team taking part.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher pipped Carrington by 0.33 seconds to win the K1 500m at the first World Cup regatta in Hungary.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher, who walked from the New Zealand team in the lead-up to the Tokyo Olympics because of an internal dispute, announced her return to the big stage with an incredible finishing burst to relegate Olympic and world champion Carrington to a silver medal.</p>
        
            <p>After that race Fisher admitted it was very emotional for her.</p>
        
            <p>"There were definitely some tears afterwards. It was a really special moment. It's been tough, I feel like I have walked through fire at times, but it's transformed me as a person and as an athlete. It's been a good ride."</p>
        
            <p>Both paddlers went under the previous world best time.</p>
        
            <p>All six members of the New Zealand team will be racing in Poland.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington and Alicia Hoskin will be looking to follow up their K2 500 gold in Hungary with another win this weekend, but will face strong opposition from Polish and German crews along with Fisher and Lucy Matehaere.</p>
        
            <p>The K4 of Carrington, Hoskin, Tara Vaughan and Olivia Brett will be out to improve on their forth placed finish last week.</p>
        
            <p>The Poland World Cup events starts Friday night.</p>
