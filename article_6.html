            <p>One of New Zealand rugby's great servants is heading off shore.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks and Hurricanes veteran halfback TJ Perenara will leave New Zealand Rugby at the end of 2024 after signing a three year deal to play in Japan League One.</p>
        
            <p>A Rugby World Cup winner in 2015, Perenara made his All Blacks debut at Eden Park in 2014 as a 22-year-old and 10 years later is still among the premier number nines in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara spent the majority of his test career in the shadow of incumbent Aaron Smith, before being named to start in Scott Robertson's first test in charge following Smith's retirement.</p>
        
            <p>However, just before halftime, he suffered a cruel injury which forced him from the field.</p>
        
            <p>Though set to return for the Rugby Championship, competition for the jersey has become fierce, with rising stars Noah Hotham, Cortez Ratima and Cam Roigard all having made their mark in black.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara said he was excited about a new chapter for himself and his family, but remained fully focused on representing the All Blacks through the 2024 Test season.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm grateful for every opportunity in the black jersey and as long as I can, I'll keep competing and contributing to the All Blacks. It's an exciting time to be involved with a new coaching group, and the motivation to represent New Zealand is as strong now as it was when I made my debut more than a decade ago."</p>

            <p>The Hurricanes' most capped player of all time with 163 games and Super Rugby's record try scorer with 63 tries since making his debut in 2012, Perenara was also an integral part of winning the Super Rugby title with the Hurricanes in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Born in Porirua, Perenara's potential was first spotted at Mana College in Wellington, where he was picked for the New Zealand Schools side in 2009 and 2010.</p>
        
            <p>While in his last year at school, at just 18 years old, he made his provincial debut for the Wellington Lions.</p>
        
            <p>In that same year, Perenara debuted at senior club level for Northern United, the club he has remained loyal to throughout his professional career.</p>
        
            <p>However, his move to Japan will spell the end of his time with the Hurricanes and Wellington Lions, who he debuted for as an 18-year-old while still at Mana College.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm incredibly grateful for the journey I've had with the Hurricanes. Each experience has shaped me, and the unwavering support from our fans has made it even more special. Thank you for being behind me every step of the way."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson said Perenara's service to the game in New Zealand had been immense.</p>
        
            <p>"From his time in club rugby through to the NPC and into Super Rugby and the All Blacks, he's given everything regardless of the jersey. We look forward to seeing him continue with the All Blacks through 2024 and he will certainly leave with our thanks and best wishes to him and his family in Japan."</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes head coach Clark Laidlaw said he was sad to see Perenara leave, but acknowledged the legacy he would leave behind.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure there's enough we could say about TJ. An amazing rugby player, an amazing man, that is a true legend of the Hurricanes club.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember way back, watching him play for the Hurricanes schools when he was 17. It's incredible to see where he is now, having won a Championship with the club, the top try-scorer and the most capped Hurricane in history."</p>
