            <p>The Breakers have decided not to appeal the suspension handed out to guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright was charged with grabbing, pushing or mishandling a game official in their Christmas Day Australian NBL game and later handed a five game suspension.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened late in the fourth quarter of the Breakers' 97-82 loss to Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright was knocked to the floor by former Breaker Reuben Te Rangi with 3:33 remaining in Wednesday's game in Hobart. In response the American import got to his feet and charged at Te Rangi before referees stepped in.</p>
        
            <p>One official was knocked over while attempting to restrain Jackson-Cartwright.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the Breakers say they acknowledge the decision of the NBL's Single Member Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>After careful consideration alongside Jackson-Cartwright, the club has decided not to appeal the suspension.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the ruling made by the Tribunal," BNZ Breakers chief executive Lisa Edser said.</p>
        
            <p>"Parker has fully owned and apologised for his actions which we stand beside. While his reaction in the heat of the moment was careless, there was certainly no intent to target any of the referees.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to support Parker and the rest of the team as they shift focus to their next run of important games."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright's suspension comes into effect immediately and he will miss Tuesday night's match-up against the Cairns Taipans.</p>
        
            <p>His first game back on court will be Thursday 16 January against Tasmania JackJumpers at Spark Arena in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers sit second to bottom on the NBL ladder with seven wins and 11 losses.</p>
