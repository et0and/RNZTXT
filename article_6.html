            <p>Juergen Klopp stunned the world of football on Saturday when he announced he would stand down as Liverpool manager at the end of season, saying that after more than eight hugely successful years in charge he was running out of energy.</p>
        
            <p>The German, who led Liverpool to the League Cup final on Wednesday and is hugely popular with the fans, told the club's hierarchy in November that he would end his eight-and-a-half year stay at Anfield after this season.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also leaving the club.</p>
        
            <p>"It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy," Klopp, 56, said on Liverpool's website.</p>
        
            <p>"I can understand that it's a shock for a lot of people in this moment, when you hear it for the first time, but obviously I can explain it - or at least try to explain it.</p>
        
            <p>"I love absolutely everything about this club, I love everything about the city, I love everything about our supporters, I love the team, I love the staff. But that I still take this decision shows you that I am convinced it is the one I have to take.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no problem now, obviously, I knew it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point, but I am absolutely fine now. I know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again."</p>
        
            <p>The German joined Liverpool in October 2015 and has won the Champions League, Premier League, Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and Super Cup, as well as the Community Shield during his time in charge.</p>
        
            <p>"In keeping with Juergen's expressed wishes, we will save the comprehensive tributes for a more appropriate time but nevertheless, we would be remiss if we did not take this opportunity to reaffirm that his appointment remains one of the greatest blessings of our time as owners," Mike Gordon, Fenway Sports Group president, said.</p>
        
            <p>"The incredible achievements of the intervening years speak for themselves, so too does the joy that Juergen and his team have brought to all of us supporters. His many accomplishments will never be taken for granted."</p>
        
            <p>Klopp has won seven trophies at Liverpool and will always be remembered as the manager who brought the glory days back to the club, tasting success at home and abroad.</p>
        
            <p>Champions League</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool lifted the Champions League trophy in 2019, defeating Tottenham Hotspur in the final, having finished as runners-up to Real Madrid the previous year, and won the UEFA Super Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties.</p>
        
            <p>In December 2019, Liverpool won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, and the 2019-20 season brought a 30-year wait for the English league title to an end.</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool won the league for the first time since 1990, their first Premier League crown, finishing 18 points ahead of Manchester City.</p>
        
            <p>They won the FA Cup and League Cup in 2022 and went close to a quadruple as they were beaten to the league title by Manchester City on the last day of the season and lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid.</p>
        
            <p>Last season was a relatively poor one, with a fifth-placed finish in the league, but they have roared back to their best this campaign and lead the Premier League standings.</p>
        
            <p>"For me it was super, super, super-important that I can help to bring this team back onto the rails," Klopp said in relation to last season's struggles.</p>
        
            <p>"It was all I was thinking about. When I realised pretty early that happened, it's a really good team with massive potential and a super age group, super characters and all that, then I could start thinking about myself again and that was the outcome. It is not what I want to (do), it is just what I think is 100 per cent right."</p>
        
            <p>The love that Klopp has for the club and their fans means, that despite not knowing what his future holds, he could make one promise to them.</p>
        
            <p>"What I know definitely - I will never, ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool, 100 percent," Klopp said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not possible. My love for this club, my respect for the people is too big. I couldn't. I couldn't for a second think about it. There's no chance."</p>
