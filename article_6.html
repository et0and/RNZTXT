            <p>Superb performances from Damian McKenzie and Etene Nanai-Seturo has led the Chiefs to a big win over the Brumbies in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs ran in six tries in a 46-12 rout, backing up their impressive first up win over the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>However, a late blight for the Chiefs was a red card to Jared Proffit for an ugly headbutt tackle on Cadyn Neville.</p>
        
            <p>After McKenzie opened the scoring with a penalty, the Chiefs would cross for the first try as Nanai-Seturo broke through the line and linked with his halfback Xavier Rowe.</p>
        
            <p>Corey Toole struck straight back for the Brumbies with a piece of individual brilliance, a deft chip and chase giving the speedster a third try of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Nanai-Seturo then crossed for one of his own, a superb long ball by Stevenson finding the wing unmarked on the corner.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs should have extended their lead but butchered what would have been a stunner.</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Stevenson sliced through the defence and Roe was again looming in support, however threw the final pass too late, Noah Lolesio knocking the ball free.</p>
        
            <p>It wouldn't cost the Chiefs much, as McKenzie went under the posts, taking a long lineout throw and turning it inside to Nanai-Seturo, staying in support for a well deserved five pointer.</p>
        
            <p>A blistering first fourty saw the Chiefs take a 25-7 halftime lead, but Toole's second try early after the break brought the Brumbies right back.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Chiefs responded straight away, Josh Ioane finishing off some brilliant interplay.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement Cortez Ratima then bagged back to back tries running great halfback support lines, each set up by his locks, the first Naitoa Ah Kuoi and the second Manaaki Selby-Rickit.</p>
        
            <p>Proffit's indiscretion took some gloss off the victory, however Nanai-Seturo told Stan Sports it was a satisfying result nonetheless.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a good start, in the second half we started a bit slow, coach gave us a bit of a tune up to put the foot on the throat, but the boys who came off the bench did the job for us."</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 46 (Ratima 2, Nanai-Seturo, Roe, McKenzie, Ioane, tries, Mackenzie 2 pens, 5 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies 12 (Toole 2, tries, Lolesio, 1 con)</p>
