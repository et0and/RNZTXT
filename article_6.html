            <p>Fight organisers have rushed in American Tommy Karpency as a late replacement to fight David Nyika, as the Olympic bronze medallist takes the next steps in his bid to gain a cruiserweight world title challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika was due to fight Australian Blake Caparello in Auckland next week but the former WBO title challenger failed a test for elevated testosterone levels, forcing fight organisers to scramble for a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika, who won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is also a two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist, and has had nine professional fights so far, winning all of them - eight of them by knockout.</p>
        
            <p>Karpency, 38, however, is vastly experienced.</p>
        
            <p>A 1.84m tall southpaw, he has challenged for the IBO, WBO and WBC light heavyweight world titles in an 18-year career.</p>
        
            <p>He has had 40 fights with 31 wins - 19 of them by knockout.</p>
        
            <p>Karpency has also had several title challenges taking on Adonis Stevenson (WBC light heavyweight title fight), Andrzej Fonfara (IBO light heavyweight title fight) and Nathan Cleverly (WBO light heavyweight title fight).</p>
        
            <p>His latest fight was just last month against fellow American Joe Jones, which Karpency won.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland fight will see the IBF and WBO intercontinental cruiserweight belts on the line.</p>
        
            <p>"Securing such a high-quality opponent at short notice is incredibly difficult so we're delighted with this result," said fight promoter David Higgins.</p>
        
            <p>"If anything, [Karpency is] a step up from Caparello."</p>

            <p>Nyika is unfazed by the late change in opponent.</p>
        
            <p>"That's boxing. My job is to take out whoever my promoters put in front of me - and that's what I'm going to do," said Nyika.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a huge amount of respect for a guy like Tommy who has been in with the best and still continues to perform at an elite level - but it's my time now."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika's co-promoter Joseph Parker has no doubt Nyika will step up to the challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"David's experienced enough to know a late change of opponent can happen in boxing and he has the ability and temperament to deal with this type of disruption just fine," Parker said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge challenge - but one he will pass."</p>
