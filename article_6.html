            <p>White Ferns captain Sophie Devine is extending her break from the game and won't take part in next month's series against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>Devine pulled out of the domestic T20 competition and the Women's Premier League in India in January citing well-being issues.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket's head of women's high performance Liz Green said they are "fully supportive" of Devine's decision to withdraw from the Sri Lanka series.</p>
        
            <p>"Player well-being is our highest priority and it's important Sophie feels fit and well before returning to professional cricket," Green said.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns are due to play three ODI's and three T20's against the tourists with the team to be named later this month.</p>
        
            <p>In five T20 games for Wellington this summer, Devine scored 38 runs and took eight wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Devine led New Zealand to victory in the T20 World Cup in the UAE last year.</p>
