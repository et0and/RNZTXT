            <p>Silver Ferns captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio is set to miss next month's Netball Nations Cup in England after a hectic year.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old has requested to sit out the start of the Ferns' 2024 international campaign which begins when they take on hosts England, Australia, and Uganda in Leeds and London from 20-27 January.</p>
        
            <p>Ekenasio, who has 70 Test caps, captained the Silver Ferns at this year's Netball World Cup in South Africa, and also guided the team to the Taini Jamison Trophy win over England, and a narrow Constellation Cup series defeat to Australia last month.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua said player welfare remained at the forefront of management's planning and she backed Ekenasio in her request for some time away from the game.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of our World Cup build-up this year, Ameliaranne, as Silver Ferns captain, has had a particularly heavy workload which was followed by a busy international season over the last two months," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"She captains our team with immense pride and brings experience and a calming presence to the Silver Ferns. The physical loading in any pinnacle year is massive, and we want all athletes to have longevity in our game.</p>
        
            <p>"We are mindful of the commitment that is required to keep body and mind balanced and it's important that she takes time to rest and rejuvenate.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline said they would miss Ekenasio but it was an opportunity for another player to lead the side, and extend the depth of the Silver Ferns' shooting circle.</p>
        
            <p>Ekenasio made her Silver Ferns debut in 2014 against the Australian Diamonds and has gone on to become an influential attacker in the Ferns' game.</p>
        
            <p>Ekenasio was first named captain in 2020 ahead of the Nations Cup.</p>
        
            <p>She is set to play for the Magic in the 2024 ANZ Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time Ekenasio has asked to take time out from the game.</p>
        
            <p>Before the 2021 ANZ Premiership season Ekenasio went on extended medical leave from the Pulse, as a result of fatigue.</p>
        
            <p>Ekenasio said it was a tough decision to take a break in January, but it was important to have some time away to rest the body after what had been a huge year of netball.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an opportunity to recharge the batteries, freshen up and spend some quality time with family ahead to the build-up to next year's ANZ Premiership," Ekenasio said.</p>
        
            <p>A three-day Silver Ferns trial begins in Auckland on Sunday with the team for the Nations Cup to be announced on 14 December. A Silver Ferns touring captain will be named at a later date.</p>
