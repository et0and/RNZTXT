            <p>Wellington Phoenix women's coach Paul Temple says he'll reach out to departed midfielder Chloe Knott at some stage.</p>
        
            <p>Knott abruptly quit the team last week citing pay concerns and then took to social media saying her values no longer aligned with the club or current management.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Annalie Longo insisted complaints about the culture of the A-League club came as a surprise to her.</p>
        
            <p>Temple didn't think there was an underlying problem or a big issue.</p>

            <p>"It's a quite unique situation and it's important that we make sure she is okay and it's my understanding that she is happy and content with that decision," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"We left on pretty amicable terms, we had a hug and then she went her way and we've had to carry on."</p>
        
            <p>Temple felt that they parted on good terms.</p>
        
            <p>"I asked her 'are we good', and she said 'yes we're good',Â there was no heated debates or arguments.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll reach out to her soon, I'll let the dust settle and then we'll have another conversation."</p>
        
            <p>Temple said they were trying to be a people-focused club and it was their intention to listen to every player.</p>
        
            <p>"Are we going to get that perfect every time... no, but we are really striving to be the best at doing that.</p>
        
            <p>"We listened to her and we took on feedback (from her)."</p>
        
            <p>Temple said he would maintain a relationship with Knott, whom he had known since she was in his under-17 group.</p>
        
            <p>"We've known each other for years and years so I want to do that and I think it's important for Chloe and the club that we keep having a good relationship moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>He said the morale in the squad was good, but it had been a challenging time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been tough, there's been a lot of soul searching and it's been hard.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to come together and meet that challenge and we have to try to keep moving forward because that's elite sport."</p>
