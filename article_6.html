            <p>Auckland City are set to face a World Cup winner and a multiple Champions League winner in their opening game at the FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Making their eleventh appearance at the tournament Auckland City take on home side Al-Ittihad who are likely to feature two former French stars.</p>
        
            <p>Striker Karim Benzama, who won the Champions League five times with Real Madrid, has recovered from injury and is expected to play.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Frenchman and 2018 World Cup winner N'Golo Kante is also likely to start in the midfield for the Saudi side.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland, who finished third in 2014, know what awaits them.</p>

            <p>"They've brought in some world-class players, some of the best in the world," midfielder Cameron Howieson told FIFA.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be very challenging. Sometimes when you mix the best players in the world, it doesn't gel, but I've been watching their games and it has gelled."</p>
        
            <p>Al Ittihad's Brazilian goalkeeper Marcelo Grohe expects to be challenged by the New Zealand side.</p>
        
            <p>"Any game in the Club World Cup is always very tough."</p>
        
            <p>"The first game always has the nervousness factor too. It's one game only, a knockout match, you need to win to stay alive in the competition. We know Auckland will be tough to beat."</p>
        
            <p>In recent years many of the world's top players have been attracted to the lucrative Saudi Pro League, with Benzama reported to earn $353 million and Kante $172 million.</p>
        
            <p>Neymar and Ronaldo also play there.</p>
        
            <p>The Saudi Pro League spent $1.5 billion on signing top players in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City has a full squad to choose from and if Emiliano Tade plays he will equal the record of 12 Club World Cup appearances.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City's 11th appearance at the tournament is the most by any club.</p>
        
            <p>The winner of the Al-Ittihad-Auckland City game will earn a second-round tie against Egypt's Al Ahly, who are the current African champions.</p>
