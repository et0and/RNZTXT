            <p>Australia sealed their place in Sunday's final of the 50-over Cricket World Cup against India following a nervy three-wicket victory against South Africa in the second semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>Australia bowled out South Africa for a below-par 212 despite David Miller's defiant 101 but the chase was not as straightforward as Pat Cummins and his team would have liked.</p>
        
            <p>Travis Head (62) led Australia's rollicking start before a mid-innings wobble put the five-time champions in a spot of bother.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa did not let big partnerships bloom but Australia eventually reached the target with 16 balls to spare with Steve Smith (30) and Jos Inglis (28) providing useful cameos.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Temba Bavuma's decision to bat under an overcast sky backfired and South Africa slumped to 24-4 inside 12 overs before light rain held up play.</p>
        
            <p>Miller and Heinrich Klaasen (47) arrested the slide after play resumed with a 95-run partnership but Head's double strike put Australia back in charge.</p>
        
            <p>Miller smashed Cummins for a six to bring up his hundred but fell in the same over trying to clear the rope again.</p>
        
            <p>India beat New Zealand in the first semi-final on Wednesday to book their place in the final in Ahmedabad.</p>
