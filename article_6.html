            <p>The New Zealand Breakers have continued their resurgent season with a fourth straight win, coming from behind to beat the Tasmania JackJumpers in Hobart.</p>
        
            <p>Tasmania shot out to a 20-8 lead but the Breakers recovered to have the scores locked at 40-all by half time.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers rattled in 30 points in the third quarter to lead 70-64 going into the final period but the JackJumpers recovered in the final quarter to lead by four with three minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>But the Breakers American import guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright took charge down the stretch with the Breakers running out 98-93 winners - their fourth straight win which moved them into sixth spot on the ANBL ladder.</p>

            <p>"This is a tough place to play, this is a very tough team to beat and not a team you want to go down against to give them momentum," said Breakers coach Mody Maor.</p>
        
            <p>"So being able to respond in that situation is great."</p>
        
            <p>Maor feels his squad is finally gelling as a team.</p>
        
            <p>"What I like is that people have finally settled into their roles. They know what is expected of them both sides of the court and one of the strongest undercurrents of the past month is that they have got a lot closer as people. You can really feel it.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a friendship brewing. There is true care and trust between them."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers now have eights wins and nine losses this season and take on the second placed Perth Wildcats in their next match in Auckland on Sunday.</p>
