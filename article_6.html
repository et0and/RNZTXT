            <p>With surgery scheduled for tomorrow, the Chiefs anxiously await the prognosis of star number eight Wallace Sititi's knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks' biggest success story of last season could potentially miss the entire Super Rugby Pacific campaign after damaging his knee on the end of year tour.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs coach Clayton McMillian was searching for positives in the wake of the news.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's seen how he is played over the last 12 months and it's never nice to lose players of that calibre, but no team is immune to injury and you go deep in the competition through the strength of your squad, not individuals, and while we'll miss them, I've got a lot of other very good rugby players that will step up."</p>
        
            <p>McMillian said they do not yet know how long Sititi will be sidelined.</p>
        
            <p>"It won't actually be known until he goes under the knife, which is happening tomorrow, but the fact that he is got to have surgery gives you an indication that it's reasonably serious."</p>
        
            <p>The loss of Sititi marks a huge blow for the 2024 finalists.</p>
        
            <p>"He generated a lot of excitement through his ability. We'll miss him and all we can do is just jump in behind the young man and help with his rehab however long that takes and get him back out on the field as quickly as possible."</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs are yet to land on a replacement for Sititi.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't given that any consideration. We want to make sure that whoever we do bring in as a replacement is going to add value and it's not a decision we're going to rush into. We won't get anything for free in the first six weeks of the competition. I can tell you that. But that's the way you want it. But we'll turn up ready."</p>
        
            <p>With the start of the season less than a month away, the Chiefs are preparing for a blockbusting opening clash against the defending champion Blues in a replay of last year's final.</p>
        
            <p>However, as well as Sititi, another star will be missing as Shaun Stevenson has taken up a short term deal in Japan,</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a sensible decision in the end that hopefully meets everybody's needs. Shaun is a guy who has been a massive contributor to Chief's rugby so him getting an opportunity to dip his toes in those waters and the fact of the matter is he'll be coming back to us, we will welcome him back with open arms."</p>
        
            <p>However, McMillian said Stevenson will not be given a free ticket back in the starting line-up.</p>
        
            <p>"So everybody's at the start line here. Whether you just walk through the door for the first time this year or you're a 10 year veteran, you have to earn the opportunity to go out and play. So he'll be no different."</p>
