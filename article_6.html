            <p>Another setback for the White Ferns with opening batter Bella James ruled out of next month's ODI series with Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns lost pace bowler Molly Penfold to injury earlier this month, while two of the side's most experienced players, Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr, were unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>Devine has taken an extended break to focus on her well-being, while Kerr is playing in the Women's Premier League in India.</p>
        
            <p>James sustained a grade two quadricep strain in her right leg playing for Otago in a Hallyburton Johnstone Shield game last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>She is expected to require between three-to-six weeks of rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>She will be assessed during the ODI series with a possibility that she may be able to play in the following T20 games against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's Lauren Down replaces James in the ODI squad.</p>
        
            <p>James' absence has been offset somewhat by the return of Georgia Plimmer who had been out of action since their T20 World Cup and India tour in October last year with a hip problem.</p>

            <p>Head coach Ben Sawyer is hoping James will be fit for the Sri Lanka T20Is.</p>
        
            <p>"She had a strong start to her international cricket career in December so it's a shame she doesn't get the opportunity to back that up this series.</p>
        
            <p>"But we're hopeful she'll be tracking to return for the T20s".</p>
        
            <p>The Sri Lanka ODI and T20 series' is followed by three T20's against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The opening ODI against Sri Lanka is in Napier on 4 March.</p>
