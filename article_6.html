            <p>The Black Caps have set Australia 279 to win the second test after being dismissed for 372 in the second innings late on day three in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The last three New Zealand wickets fell for one run, including Scott Kuggeleijn for a hard-hit 44, but the home side have nevertheless given themselves a shot at winning the Hagley Oval test and squaring the series 1-1.</p>
        
            <p>Some big hitting from Kuggeleijn has pushed the Black Caps' lead past 250, taking them to 345 for six at tea after Australia claimed three quick wicket midway through the second session - including Rachin Ravindra for 82 and Daryl Mitchell for 58.</p>
        
            <p>Number eight Kuggeleijn's 49-ball knock - featuring five fours and two sixes - shifted momentum back towards the Black Caps although wickets tumbled quickly early in the final session, with both Glenn Phillips and Matt Henry both dismissed for 16.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier there were half-centuries to opener Tom Latham (73), along with Ravindra and Mitchell, who combined for 123 for the fourth wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell was the first to depart, caught behind off Josh Hazlewood after striking the pace bowler for successive fours from the two previous deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra followed - also snared by wicketkeeper Alex Carey - off the first ball of a new spell from Australian captain Pat Cummins (4-62).</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell's modest form with the bat continued when he struck a poor delivery from Cameron Green to cover to depart for nine.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Latham added eight to his overnight score before he was caught by wicketkeeper Alex Carey off Pat Cummins' bowling.</p>
        
            <p>The Australians successfully reviewed after the original decision was not out, with replays showing a fine inside edge from Latham's bat.</p>
        
            <p>Carey finished the innings with five catches, giving him 10 dismissals for the match, one short of the world record.</p>
        
            <p>It was the equal-most dismissals by a keeper against New Zealand in a test, matching the tally achieved by Adam Gilchrist in Hamilton 24 years ago.</p>
