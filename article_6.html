            <p>Crusaders and All Blacks lock Scott Barrett is backing his brother should the Hurricanes go deep in the Super Rugby Pacific playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>Younger brother Jordie will lead the Hurricanes for their quarterfinal showdown with the Melbourne Rebels at Sky Stadium on Saturday, as the Wellington-based franchise pursue a second ever title.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes secured pole position on the championship ladder after the Chiefs denied the Blues a bonus point during the final weekend of the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders of course are a notable absentee for the play-offs following a tumultuous campaign.</p>
        
            <p>It marks the first time the seven-time defending champions have missed the post-season in nearly a decade, following a golden run under former coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters at Christchurch's Rugby Park on Thursday, Barrett admitted he's had limited time to pore over the weekend's quarterfinals, after finalising his commitment to the Crusaders and New Zealand Rugby until 2027.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest I actually don't even know who the matchups are," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been that focused on what's been going on around there and announcing this and getting tackled by a two and a half year old at home."</p>
        
            <p>With older sibling Beauden unavailable for Blues selection on eligibility grounds, family ties ensure Barrett's allegiances rest with the Hurricanes, even if it's begrudgingly.</p>

            <p>"If they're (Hurricanes) doing well, I'll certainly support my brother if he's in a position to win a championship," Barrett said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll shake his hand and say 'well done'."</p>
        
            <p>As the competition's two "form teams", the Hurricanes and Blues looked to be the biggest championship contenders, Barrett said.</p>
        
            <p>However, he suggested a team from across the Tasman were capable of usurping proceedings during the knockout stage.</p>
        
            <p>"An Aussie team could be a wee spanner in there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Reds and the Brumbies on their day certainly can show up and do a job.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't be ruling out an Australian team."</p>
        
            <p>Of the three Australian outfits still in contention, the Brumbies will be firm favourites for their quarterfinal with the Highlanders in Canberra on Saturday night although the Highlanders should be buoyed by recent history.</p>

            <p>The southerners have prevailed in four of their last five trips to the Australian capital, including a quarterfinal win in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds also head to Hamilton as slight outsiders, despite proving to be more than competitive against the New Zealand teams during the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenslanders beat three of the five New Zealand teams, including the Chiefs, but also took the Hurricanes to extra time and got within seven of the Blues.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining two match-ups are arguably more clear-cut.</p>
        
            <p>Unbeaten in Wellington this season, the Hurricanes are expected to take care of the Rebels, therefore sending the latter into the rugby wilderness.</p>
        
            <p>It was finally confirmed last week the cash-strapped franchise would be axed from Super Rugby Pacific next year.</p>
        
            <p>The Fijian Drua are faced with a similarly daunting task as they trek to Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>As potent as the team are in the very warm settings of Lautoka. the Drua are yet to bottle these qualities on the road.</p>
        
            <p>Having lost only twice this year and still smarting from conceding top spot, the Blues are odds on to book a home semi-final.</p>
