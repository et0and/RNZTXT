            <p>The Black Caps are about to attempt to do what no other team has done in more than a decade - win a test series in India.</p>
        
            <p>The two teams square off in a three-match series starting Wednesday evening (NZT) in Bengalaru and the hosts are heavy favourites for good reason.</p>
        
            <p>India currently hold the record for the most consecutive test series wins at home, having won their last 18. They last lost a home test series in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>India are coming off a heavy win over Bangladesh to seal another home test series victory and their 41st win in 52 tests at home since the start of 2013.</p>

            <p>Adding to the Black Caps challenge is their record in India. New Zealand have won just two test matches in the country, in 1969 and 1988 respectively.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts have won 10 out of the 12 test series between the two teams in India, with two drawn.</p>
        
            <p>India have won four straight home test series against New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps all-rounder Rachin Ravindra said they are well aware of the size of the task in front of them.</p>
        
            <p>"We know how good India are in their own conditions, the quality of their bowlers, the quality of their batters. They've grown up in these conditions and it shows how hard it is for other teams to come and win here," Ravindra said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's difficult (to win in India), they have consistent bowlers who bowl an area for a long period of time. Their two spinners who play consistently, Ashwin and Jadeja, two very accomplished bowlers who can bat too which makes it very hard.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll take our learnings (sic). We've been here a lot recently and played a lot of test matches in India, the group has grown together quite well and we've all had that experience, so hopefully we can put together a strong fight."</p>

            <p>Ravindra is feeling good about his own form following some recent strong performances on Indian pitches in the 2023 ODI World Cup and IPL.</p>
        
            <p>"Although it is different formats it does give you confidence you can perform in this part of the world. Conditions will most likely be different but I've been able to perform a couple of times and I'll hopefully able to do it in a test series. I'm excited to have a fully fledged three test series here."</p>
        
            <p>While India enter the series in winning form, the Black Caps are coming off a 1-0 series loss in Sri Lanka and a heavy defeat in the second test in Galle.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra believes those results will not affect their chances in Bengalaru and he insists the Black Caps have a style of play capable of beating India.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, it's playing our game and doing what's true to us. We did some really good stuff in the Sri Lanka series. We were on the wrong side of the win and loss column there, but I think there were times we really pushed and the first test was close and we played the way we wanted to in certain moments, but we understand we have to do it for long periods of time.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't look at the other team too much. We know what a quality side they are and what they bring to the table, but if we're able to play our game and be consistent and put our best foot forward, hopefully that will result in a win."</p>
        
            <p>The ball will turn in India, with the Bengalaru pitch no different, but with some wet weather around the area, conditions might not be so spinner friendly in the opening test.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra believes that could help the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>"Traditionally Bangalore (Bengalaru) is a little bit less turning. You see a lot of fast bowlers taking wickets here. I guess with a bit of rain around, some overcast conditions and looking at the wicket, it might not be as turny (sic) as what we might expect in Mumbai.</p>
        
            <p>"The quality of wicket, the quality of their bowlers, the quality of our bowlers will determine the outcome of the match. Whether it turns, we might not find out into the third, fourth or fifth day, so it's important for us to play what's in front of us and not come into this game with preconceived notions or ideas of what it looks like," Ravindra said.</p>
        
            <p>The first test starts at 5pm Wednesday (NZT).</p>
