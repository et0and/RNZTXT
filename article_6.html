            <p>The clash of roller skates echoed through the Trust Arena in West Auckland today at the first day of the Rainbow Games.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve events will take place across Auckland from today until Sunday, focused on creating a welcoming space for queer people in sport.</p>
        
            <p>Over 600 people from 21 countries are taking part - including both seasoned athletes and people trying something new for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Today at Trust Arena, the games began with a rangitahi sporting event and a roller derby tournament, with competing teams from New Zealand and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Skater for Auckland-based team the Pirate City Rollers Daphne Hui said the atmosphere at Trust Arena was buzzing.</p>

            <p>"The team and the community itself is feeling really buzzed about being part of Rainbow Games, because roller derby is such an inclusive sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We welcome everyone from all walks of life to come and join us, where they can come and be their true authentic selves."</p>
        
            <p>At the games, drag queens and kings mix with sports people - and sometimes, are both.</p>
        
            <p>George Fowler is Hugo Grrrl, an enigmatic drag king - as well as performing at the opening ceremony, he is jumping into the pool for the first time since school to compete in swimming.</p>
        
            <p>"It struck me as a really unique opportunity to acknowledge some of that trauma.</p>
        
            <p>"As a queer person in sport, often times changing rooms and sporting spaces are really tricky and really scary spaces.</p>
        
            <p>"By the time I left swimming, I had a really tough relationship with it. [The Rainbow Games] struck me as such an amazing opportunity to get back into the sport I love."</p>

            <p>He never would have felt brave enough without the Rainbow Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a transgender man, so this is my first time in the water wearing speedos, and in this new body, so it's been pretty huge. It feels like a really huge win."</p>
        
            <p>Fowler said he was not nervous to swim in the competition tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really not about winning for me. It's about confronting my fears and probably having a really healing moment being in a pool surrounded by other queer and trans people."</p>

            <p>Kate Weatherly is a national mountain biking champion and an ambassador for the Rainbow Games - she got involved because of a gap in sporting events that uplift queer people.</p>
        
            <p>"Although there are a huge amount of queer people in the sporting world already, really focusing on those people and highlighting them and uplifting queer people has been an area that's a bit of a gap.</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly with the current socio-political environment around queer and particularly trans people being included in sport, having spaces where those people can benefit and participate in sport is so huge."</p>
        
            <p>Weatherly has been mountain biking her whole life.</p>
        
            <p>"When I initially started mountain biking, for me it was just all about the fun, hanging out with my mates, going in and hitting jumps and having a good time."</p>
        
            <p>"As I got better at it and got more competitive, I started doing races, and really enjoyed that side of things.</p>
        
            <p>"Through that time I was also figuring out my queer identity and my identity as a trans woman, and it was always quite hard trying to understand how those parts of my life were going to fit together."</p>
        
            <p>But, Weatherly said when she came out, there was not such a focus on queer and trans exclusion from the sporting world - and the conversations about whether trans people should be included in both elite and community sport have increased in the last few years.</p>
        
            <p>She is concerned that young people will become blocked from engaging in sport at all.</p>

            <p>"Particularly now, with the narratives around queer inclusion and particularly trans inclusion in sport, if they're a young queer or trans person, they're just gonna see these barriers, and go, 'Oh, well I just don't want to be a part of that environment'.</p>
        
            <p>"And I think they're really missing out, because my journey through the sporting world has given me so much, both in terms of community and in terms of personal growth."</p>
        
            <p>Making those young people feel welcome was the focus of a special rangitahi event today, in partnership with School Sports New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Teresa Platt, co-chairperson of the Pacific Rainbow Games Trust Board, said the rangitahi session brought together high schoolers who otherwise would not engage in sport.</p>
        
            <p>"The outcomes for our rangitahi are the worst in the rainbow community. That's where people are isolated, or commit suicide."</p>
        
            <p>"And I guess we're trying to reach out and say you don't have to feel like that, look at all us here, be loud and proud."</p>
        
            <p>"We got your back, and we'll take care of you."</p>
        
            <p>She said the event helped young rainbow people engage with their community, grow confidence and be healthy by moving their body through sport.</p>
        
            <p>The Rainbow Games continue Saturday with more sports at the Trusts Arena and New Zealand's first Gay and Lesbian Tennis tournament in Albany.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, multi-sports continue and the games will take to the waterfront for a half-marathon.</p>
