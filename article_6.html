            <p>Tearful New Zealand alpine skier Alice Robinson has secured her first FIS Ski World Cup win in four years to climb to the top of the giant slalom standings.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson claimed a fourth career title and her first since March 2021 when her second run powered her to victory by more than half a second at Kronplatz in Italy.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old struggled to contain her emotions after heading off Swiss rival Lara Gut-Behrami and American Paula Moltzan in a tense finish.</p>
        
            <p>"I am really quite speechless…it's been four years since I last won and there were definitely some times in those four years where I wasn't sure if I was going to win again, to be back winning here is so special," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just proud, the second run I just really wanted to be brave and ski on the limit and I am really proud of that."</p>
        
            <p>After the first run the top eight women were separated by less than a second, with Robinson fifth fastest, 0.49 seconds off the pace of Italian leader Federica Brignone.</p>

            <p>Pushing out of the start gate for run two, Robinson knew she needed to produce something special to be in for a shot at the podium.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew after the first run that I had a little mistake, and I felt like the last few races I have been missing that extra gear to push a bit harder and take a few more risks," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the second run I just really didn't want to get to the finish and feel like I could have done more. I took a lot of risks and it wasn't perfect, but it was fast."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson established a lead of almost a second as she blasted across the finish line in 58.75 seconds, posting the fastest second run time of the day.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenstown-raised athlete then had to watch the four leading athletes from the first run come down the slope to try to better her combined time of 1 minute and 55.28 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Sweden's Sara Hector and home town favourite Brignone both failed to finish, while Gut-Behrami Moltzan failed to match Robinson's lightning-fast second run.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson leaps to first on the World Cup standings, narrowly ahead of Hector - a reward for having made it onto a giant slalom podium in every race bar one.</p>
        
            <p>"My family's here to watch, and I guess it's just a lot. So much has happened in the last four years, and to get back to winning is really special," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a challenging road I suppose, a lot of ups and downs. This last year my skiing has been so consistently good, and to finally execute and win is just really special.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it was about time that I got a win after the last year. I'm just really grateful."</p>
        
            <p>The result is also a boost for Robinson ahead of next month's world alpine skiing championships in Saalbach, Austria.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I'm in a good spot for the world champs," she said.</p>
