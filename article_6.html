            <p>One massive clash overshadows everything else this weekend in Super Rugby Pacific. All due respect to the other sides, but really the Hurricanes v Chiefs game on Saturday night in Wellington is the one to be keeping an eye on.</p>

            <p>Moana's odyssey through the rugby grounds of New Zealand continues, this time they're up north to face a Reds side that will be feeling pretty confident coming off their bye. Three consecutive losses are what Moana are heading in with, each slightly more disappointing than the last, and they have moved skipper Sione Havili Talitui to number eight and welcome back Danny Toala at fullback.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Viliami Fine, 13 Henry Taefu, 12 Julian Savea, 11 Fine Inisi, 10 William Havili, 9 Ereatara Enari, 8 Sione Havili Talitui (c), 7 Jacob Norris, 6 Irie Papuni, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Tom Savage, 3 Sione Mafileo, 2 Samiuela Moli, 1 Abraham Pole</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Sama Malolo, 17 Sateki Latu, 18 Sekope Kepu, 19 Ola Tauelangi, 20 Miracle Failagi, 21 Melani Matavao, 22 Christian Lealiifano, 23 Nigel Ah Wong</p>
        
            <p>Reds: 15 Jock Campbell, 14 Suli Vunivalu, 13 Josh Flook, 12 Hunter Paisami, 11 Jordan Petaia, 10 Harry McLaughlin-Phillips, 9 Tate McDermott (cc), 8 Harry Wilson, 7 Fraser McReight, 6 Liam Wright (cc), 5 Ryan Smith, 4 Seru Uru, 3 Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, 2 Matt Faessler, 1 Peni Ravai</p>

            <p>Rob Penney and his Crusaders have come good - at least that's the feeling in the air after their first win of the season a fortnight ago against the Chiefs. They head to Sydney with revenge on their minds after the Tahs tripped them up in the Super Round, however the New South Welshmen haven't won a game since. Ethan Blackadder makes a long-awaited return to the field at blindside, while Noah Hotham holds onto the halfback spot after a very good performance in the win over the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Waratahs: 15 Max Jorgensen, 14 Triston Reilly, 13 Izaia Perese, 12 Lalakai Foketi, 11 Dylan Pietsch, 10 Tane Edmed, 9 Jake Gordon (c), 8 Langi Gleeson, 7 Charlie Gamble, 6 Lachlan Swinton, 5 Ned Hanigan, 4 Jed Holloway, 3 Harry Johnson-Holmes, 2 Julian Heaven, 1 Hayden Thompson-Stringer</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Theo Fourie, 17 Lewis Ponini, 18 Tom Ross, 19 Miles Amatosero, 20 Hugh Sinclair, 21 Jack Grant, 22 Will Harrison, 23 Joey Walton</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: 15 Chay Fihaki, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Levi Aumua, 12 Dallas McLeod, 11 Johnny McNicholl, 10 Riley Hohepa, 9 Noah Hotham, 8 Cullen Grace, 7 Tom Christie (c), 6 Ethan Blackadder, 5 Jamie Hannah, 4 Quinten Strange, 3 Fletcher Newell, 2 George Bell, 1 George Bower</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Brodie McAlister, 17 Joe Moody, 18 Owen Franks, 19 Dom Gardiner, 20 Christian Lio-Willie, 21 Mitchell Drummond, 22 Rivez Reihana, 23 Macca Springer</p>

            <p>Here's the big one, as the Chiefs head down to the road to take on the unbeaten Hurricanes. There's match ups across the park, most notably at first five where the livewire Damian McKenzie faces off against the steady hand of the rejuvenated Brett Cameron, as well as inside them where young Cortez Ratima is against veteran TJ Perenara.</p>
        
            <p>A win here will be a real statement for the Canes, whose fans know too well not to count their chickens before they hatch. The Chiefs were exposed in their loss to the Crusaders, being picked apart at the breakdown and making some uncharacteristic errors but have McKenzie back to steer them round for what should be a massive NZ derby match.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Ruben Love, 14 Josh Moorby, 13 Billy Proctor, 12 Jordie Barrett, 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Brett Cameron, 9 TJ Perenara, 8 Brayden Iose, 7 Peter Lakai, 6 Brad Shields (c), 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 4 Caleb Delany, 3 Tyrel Lomax, 2 Asafo Aumua, 1 Xavier Numia</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 James O'Reilly, 17 Pouri Rakete-Stones, 18 Pasilio Tosi, 19 Justin Sangster, 20 Du'Plessis Kirifi, 21 Devan Flanders, 22 Richard Judd, 23 Peter Umaga-Jensen</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Shaun Stevenson, 14 Emoni Narawa, 13 Daniel Rona, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Cortez Ratima, 8 Wallace Sititi, 7 Luke Jacobson (c), 6 Samipeni Finau, 5 Tupou Vaa'i, 4 Naitoa Ah Kuoi, 3 Reuben O'Neill, 2 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 1 Aidan Ross</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Bradley Slater, 17 Ollie Norris, 18 George Dyer, 19 Jimmy Tupou, 20 Kaylum Boshier, 21 Xavier Roe, 22 Josh Ioane, 23 Rameka Poihipi</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 9:35pm Saturday 13 April</p>
        
            <p>AAMI Park, Melbourne</p>

            <p>This stands as a real test for the Highlanders, who will drop out of the top eight with a loss. The Rebels are no mugs, they've overcome off and on field issues to be sitting fifth with four wins and three losses and have the ultimate rocks and diamonds package in Carter Gordon. Highlanders coach Clarke Dermody has made a big call at first five, giving young talent Ajau Faleafaga a start in the hope that it can breathe some life into an exciting backline.</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Andrew Kellaway, 14 Lachie Anderson, 13 Filipo Daugunu, 12 David Feliuai, 11 Darby Lancaster, 10 Carter Gordon, 9 Ryan Louwrens, 8 Vaiolini Ekuasi, 7 Maciu Nabolakasi, 6 Josh Kemeny, 5 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 4 Tuaina Taii Tualima, 3 Sam Talakai (c), 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 Matt Gibbon</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Alex Mafi, 17 Isaac Kailea, 18 Taniela Tupou, 19 Angelo Smith, 20 Daniel Maiava, 21 Jack Maunder, 22 Matt Proctor, 23 Nick Jooste</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 15 Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, 14 Timoci Tavatavanawai, 13 Jonah Lowe, 12 Sam Gilbert, 11 Jona Nareki, 10 Ajay Faleafaga, 9 Folau Fakatava, 8 Nikora Broughton, 7 Billy Harmon (c), 6 Sean Withy, 5 Pari Pari Parkinson, 4 Oliver Haig, 3 Saula Ma'u, 2 Henry Bell, 1 Daniel Lienert-Brown</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ricky Jackson, 17 Ethan de Groot, 18 Rohan Wingham, 19 Hugo Plummer, 20 Will Stodart, 21 James Arscott, 22 Matt Whaanga, 23 Connor Garden-Bachop</p>
