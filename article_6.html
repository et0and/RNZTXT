            <p>The screech of Supercars is set to return to New Zealand, as a plethora of petrolheads descend on Taupō for this weekend's inaugural event.</p>
        
            <p>The multimillion-dollar shipment of 24 Supercars has made its journey south from Auckland for the 21st Championship round to be held in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>After more than a year's absence, Taupō International Motorsport Park owner Tony Quinn, said the weekend marks the return of motorsport to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We're back," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Grandstand and general admission tickets have sold out for Saturday and Sunday, and Quin hoped it would help secure a future for Supercars in Taupo.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a well known fact that motorsport in general in New Zealand is a very highly supported sport and they haven't been here for a year or so and there's not a spare seat in the house."</p>
        
            <p>Quinn said this was indicative of a country crying out for some Supercars action.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't been here for a year or so and there's not a spare seat in the house. I think the V8 Supercars are glad to be back in New Zealand. It wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to do more in New Zealand and we're off to a bloody great start."</p>
        
            <p>Locals were greeted by the drivers Thursday afternoon as the V8s roared through the Taupō town centre.</p>
        
            <p>"The preparations have been going on for months, and that's the thing that a lot of people don't fully understand, is that it's not just a weekend - it's six months in the making."</p>
        
            <p>Quinn said the track will provide a unique challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of them have been here for a day just driving a Mazda MX5 or Toyota 86 around and I haven't heard anybody complain about it. Obviously it's not a track that they all know."</p>
        
            <p>He said though there was a heap of quality on the field, he was backing one particular driver for the flag.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all great guys. But my personal favourite is young Brock Finney, who is an absolute gentleman when he takes his helmet off. He's doing such a good job at such a young age. But, whoever wins it will be a worthy winner."</p>

            <p>Taupō marks the third venue in Aotearoa to host, with the first Supercars championship round first held at Pukekohe in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland hosted Supercars to 2007 before picking it up again in 2013 and bidding farewell in 2022.</p>

            <p>Hamilton held championship rounds between 2008 and 2012.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has a rich history in Supercars, producing four champions - Jim Richards, Shane van Gisbergen and Scott McLaughlin and Robbie Francevic.</p>
        
            <p>Reigning Bathurst champion Richie Stanaway was one of five Kiwis racing this weekend, and the proud Aucklander said winning on home soil would be almost on par with winning Bathurst.</p>
        
            <p>"As a New Zealander, getting the opportunity to race back at home once a year gives us a chance to feel what it's like for all the Australian drivers who get to race at home on all the other rounds, so it's something that we really appreciate."</p>
        
            <p>He said it will be a significant boost having friends and family in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not something that I get to do a lot. They only live two hours away from the track so it's quite unusual for them to be able to come see me race so close to home. I did most of my career racing internationally, either in Europe or the US or in Australia, so it's very rare for me to actually be able to race at a professional level in my own country. So it's something that I really look forward to."</p>

            <p>The Penrite Racing member said the interest in Aotearoa was obvious.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been shown to have huge demand for the event with the ticket sales being sold out. It just goes to show how much interest there is in the series. It's great for us to race here and I hope we can race it more in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Having only recently returned to the series, Stanaway said the unknowns of the Taupō track evened the playing field.</p>
        
            <p>"Noone's raced at Taupō before, so I'm looking forward to that clean slate for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Both he and fellow Kiwi teammate Matt Payne will run special silver fern liveries on their Mustangs this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope the fans appreciate such an iconic Kiwi-themed livery. It's going to be great to roll it out. Racing in New Zealand, both Matt and I being Kiwis, and I hope we get a huge amount of fan appreciation for this livery that we're going to roll out."</p>
        
            <p>Supercars COO Tim Watsford said the anticipation in the town was palpable.</p>
        
            <p>"The uptake and interest in our first-ever event in Taupō has been incredible. The response to this event has been overwhelming, and we are beyond excited for what will be a very special inaugural ITM Taupō Super400."</p>
        
            <p>Joining Stanaway and Payne as the Kiwi contingent will also be Andre Heimgartner, Ryan Wood and Jaxon Evans.</p>
        
            <p>Defending Supercars Champion Brodie Kostecki will also be one to watch, after missing the opening two rounds of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, 2017 Bathurst 1000 Champion David Reynolds will make his 200th career round start.</p>
        
            <p>"I've done 200 weekends in superiors, many years and a lot of hard work and a lot of positive stories, a lot of negative stories A lot of highs, a lot of lows, But yes, I've had a lot, a really good journey so far."</p>
        
            <p>On-track action at the Taupō Super400 will see two 200-kilometre races across Saturday and Sunday.</p>
