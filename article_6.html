            <p>The Chiefs almost blew a 36-point halftime lead, before running out 50-35 winners against Moana Pasifika in Pukekohe. The competition leaders were going at over a point a minute at the break and while they ultimately withstood an extremely spirited comeback, their inability to score again until just before full time will be of concern to coach Clayton McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>On the other hand, Moana coach Tana Umaga will be ruing the other end of the game, as they let Damian McKenzie run amok and set up Bradley Slater, Shaun Stevenson, Xavier Roe and Leroy Carter to tries before bagging one himself. Moana had no answer to the All Black first five and Stevenson's incisive running, and while they pegged one back to William Havili before the break, it was looking like the match was going to be the biggest blow-out of the season so far.</p>
        
            <p>But whatever Umaga said at halftime combined with the Chiefs completely losing interest in playing any attacking rugby at all combined to produce a remarkable second half. The Moana bench, especially outside back debutant Tuna Tuitama, made a massive impact and they scored four converted tries.</p>
        
            <p>Not only that, but Moana completely dominated territory and possession to the point where McMillan had to keep some of his experienced All Blacks on the field far longer than he would've liked.</p>
        
            <p>Abraham Pole's try started the comeback, followed by fellow front rower Sama Malolo, before Tuitama's soft hands collected a cross kick in the corner. Havili's intercept in the 75th minute and Patrick Pellegrini's perfect goal kicking meant Moana had improbably pulled within eight points, however it was a testament to how rattled the Chiefs were that the visitors had to play for a penalty and rely on their lineout drive to kill the game off.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps the Chiefs had their eye on the upcoming bye week, but Moana will be wanting to take all the momentum for this one into a tough fixture in Christchurch next Saturday against the Crusaders.</p>
