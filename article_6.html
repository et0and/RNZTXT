            <p>Caroline Powell jumped her way to victory at the Badminton Horse Trials in England, becoming just the second New Zealand woman to win the prestigious event.</p>
        
            <p>Powell and Greenacres Special Cavalier crept steadily up the leaderboard from sixth place after the cross-country phase.</p>
        
            <p>They then produced a clear showjumping round and it proved enough as plenty of rivals knocked over rails.</p>
        
            <p>Powell is the fifth New Zealander to win the event, following in the footsteps of four-time Badminton champion Mark Todd, Jock Paget, Andrew Nicholson and Jonelle Price.</p>
        
            <p>Powell told RNZ's Morning Report she knew the showjumping round was going to be tricky.</p>
        
            <p>"But Cavs [Cavalier] was absolutely amazing in the showjumping. She's only 11 years old so she's a true professional and she jumped very very well. She's just always been a bit special in her own way and today she proved that she's extremely special," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell, who won Burghley in 2010 on Lenamore, was not expecting the result at all.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought third place would be great, but to win - wow. It's awesome and it means so much - I'm not in my youth and just to get a horse to this stage is difficult enough, but to win - I can't believe it.</p>
        
            <p>"We came in to the week sort of hoping that we were going to jump a double clearance and have a good week but to win has been a major added bonus ...very exciting."</p>
        
            <p>Ireland equestrian Lucy Latta finished second on RCA Patron Saint and British rider Alex Bragg climbed from 60th place after dressage to finish third on Quindiva.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow New Zealand rider Tim Price held a slim lead after the cross-country but had a nightmare show jumping round, dropping to eighth. His horse Vitali is a notoriously poor showjumper.</p>
        
            <p>Jonelle Price, the first New Zealand woman to win Badminton, in 2018, finished sixth on Grappa Nera.</p>
        
            <p>Powell first came to Britain as a groom for triple Badminton winner Ian Stark. She won Burghley in 2010 on Lenamore and won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Greenacres Special Cavalier is an Irish-bred, 11-year-old mare by Cavalier Royale, bred in Ireland by Michael Callery.</p>
        
            <p>Powell first sat on her as a youngster - "You can have a good horse [Lenamore] and then you can disappear. "Cav" has had her tricky moments, but to be here, winning Badminton, is a dream come true."</p>
