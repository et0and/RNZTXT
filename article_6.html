            <p>Charlie Woods is looking to qualify for his first PGA Tour golf event.</p>
        
            <p>15 year old Woods, the son of 15-times major winner Tiger Woods, will compete in a pre-qualifier event this week as he bids to secure a place in the PGA Tour's Cognizant Classic next week in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Approximately 25 players and ties from each of the four pre-qualifying sites will advance to a Monday qualifier, from which four players will earn spots in the Cognizant Classic.</p>
        
            <p>Among those in the field for the Cognizant Classic are major winners Rory McIlroy, Shane Lowry, Matt Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose and Gary Woodland.</p>
        
            <p>Woods is scheduled to tee off Friday morning (NZ time) alongside Olin Browne Jr. -- son of three-times PGA Tour winner Olin Browne -- and Ruaidhri Mcgee.</p>
        
            <p>Woods has competed with his father in the last four editions of the PNC Championship -- a 36-hole event featuring two-player teams made up of a major champion and a family member -- and finished runner-up in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Tiger Woods, who entered the year aiming to play one event a month, withdrew during the second round of last week's Genesis Invitational at Riviera due to the flu, which brought an abrupt end to his first PGA Tour start since last April's Masters.</p>
