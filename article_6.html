        <h2>All Blacks: Who plays halfback this weekend?</h2>

            <p>Analysis - The fact that we're having a conversation about who will play halfback this weekend for the All Blacks probably says more about one man who isn't playing, rather than the three that might be.</p>
        
            <p>Aaron Smith's incredible career saw him snuff out any debate about the No 9 jersey for 13 straight seasons, with the only real chat about the position being who should sit on the bench behind him. Smith retired from test rugby last year, leaving a serious vacuum given that he was still playing just as well as he ever had - indeed, he was a slight handling error away from scoring what would have been the match winning try in the World Cup final.</p>
        
            <p>His heir apparent, Cam Roigard, had his knee blown out back in May playing for the Hurricanes against the Highlanders. So that means TJ Perenara, Finlay Christie and Cortez Ratima are in line to play against England in the first test - with each man having a decent claim to be starting.</p>
        
            <p>Let's assess their credentials:</p>

            <p>The cruel irony of Roigard's misfortune meant that Perenara took back the Hurricanes' starting spot after a lengthy stint on the sideline himself, having spent almost a year and a half out after a serious knee injury at Twickenham in the last test of 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara has obviously had the longest career of the three current halfbacks, with 80 test matches in a career stretching back a decade. However, only 22 of those were starts given Smith's hold on the position, so you could make a case that big test match experience is something he still needs to acquire.</p>
        
            <p>You certainly can't argue with Perenara's Super Rugby Pacific form, though. He was a major part of the Canes' table-topping regular season and his leadership was a clear positive in an otherwise youthful side with a first year coach.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara also managed to break and hold the competition record for all time top try scorer, an exceptional achievement given that he's a halfback, not a wing.</p>

            <p>It's hard to get a real read on Christie's overall form given that he spent a decent chunk of Super Rugby Pacific out injured, but the fact remains that as soon as he was available, Vern Cotter had no hesitation in putting him straight back in the Blues' starting line-up. That's despite Taufa Funaki playing so well he ended up part of the All Black conversation himself, so that speaks to Cotter's trust in Christie's abilities.</p>
        
            <p>It paid off, as the 21-test All Black was a key part of the Blues' direct gameplan that steamrolled its way to a championship.</p>
        
            <p>The key advantage Christie has is that he's technically the incumbent test halfback, although a slightly controversial one. The perception that his selection was a way for Ian Foster to thumb his nose at his critics is slightly unfair, but now that Roigard is out and Scott Robertson has continued on with Christie says a great deal.</p>

            <p>The young Chiefs man has been tagged as a future All Black ever since he first played for Waikato, so his call up doesn't come as much of a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was thought that he'd come in as the traditional third halfback, the role that is more about holding tackle bags and learning off the other two more experienced ones than actually playing. That's not the case for Ratima, who you'd think has just as much claim to the starting spot as the other two given his form and confidence this year.</p>
        
            <p>Yes, the Chiefs bombed out in a one-sided final and Ratima spent a frustrating night behind a beaten pack, but that doesn't overshadow the most important attribute he brings to the All Blacks: his partnership with Damian McKenzie.</p>
        
            <p>It's well established over two seasons and the temptation to keep the Chiefs inside back combo going to give a fresh All Black team a bit of cohesion from the word go is one that Robertson may well go for.</p>
