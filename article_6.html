            <p>Canoe slalom paddler Luuka Jones will join a select group of New Zealand athletes, having been selected to compete her fifth Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The 35-year-old Jones and fellow paddler 28-year-old Finn Butcher have been officially named in the New Zealand team for this year's Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>Jones, who won silver at the Rio 2016 Olympics, will become just the third New Zealand woman to compete at five Olympics, joining shot putter Dame Valerie Adams and board sailor Barbara Kendall.</p>
        
            <p>"To be going to my fifth Olympics is crazy. It's something I never dreamed of as a kid but I'm extremely grateful for the career that I've had and the experiences that I've had."</p>
        
            <p>Jones will head into the event in top form having last year won World Cup gold in Paris in the new Olympic discipline of kayak cross.</p>
        
            <p>The event sees four athletes compete at the same time, starting the race from a ramp above the water.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like a demolition derby. It's really physical - you're jostling for position the whole way down the course, there is so much going on and it's really exciting.</p>
        
            <p>"We grew up paddling plastic boats and being out on rivers in New Zealand, so we're kind of used to that discipline already."</p>
        
            <p>In early 2022, Jones was diagnosed with long Covid and was forced to take the year off training and competing. She returned to the competition circuit in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"I've loved being back on the water and I'm feeling healthy and good to go."</p>

            <p>Alexandra's Finn Butcher will join Jones in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher grew up in Central Otago and began paddling aged nine at a 'have a go' day on a local river and immediately fell in love with the sport, developing into an elite athlete over the years.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher was the New Zealand K1 reserve for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and has continued to improve his ability and world ranking since then.</p>
        
            <p>At the 2023 World Championships, he secured an Olympic quota spot for New Zealand, finishing 13th in K1 and 11th in Kayak Cross.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty special for me," said Butcher.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be amazing to go to the Olympics and represent my community and all the people who've helped me on my journey. To have the fern on my chest is going to be unreal."</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic canoe slalom competition will be held from July 27th to August 5th at Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium.</p>
