            <p>The New Zealand under-19 women's cricket team has been stunned by Nigeria at the T20 World Cup in Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>The Nigerians were overjoyed at registering their maiden win at their first U19 T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>In a rain-affected match in Sarawak, they scored 65 for six in their 13 overs.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand struggled in their turn at bat, with Kate Irwin run out off the first ball and fellow opener Emma McLeod dismissed in the third over.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand needed 17 runs off the last two overs to claim the win and got eight off the penultimate over with captain Tash Wakelin hitting a boundary off the last ball.</p>
        
            <p>They required nine runs off the final over but couldn't manage it, eventually being beaten by two runs.</p>
        
            <p>Wakelin scored 18, while Anika Todd top-scored with 19.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders were beaten by South Africa in their opening match, another affected by wet weather.</p>
        
            <p>If they are to advance to the playoffs, they have to beat Samoa on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa lead Group C after beating Samoa by 10 wickets on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The Samoans only managed 16 runs off 9.1 overs, with Nthabiseng Nini taking three for four off two overs.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa knocked off the winning runs in just 1.4 overs.</p>
