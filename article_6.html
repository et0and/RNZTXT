            <p>A new-look Football Ferns drew 1-1 against Costa Rica in San José to kick start their journey towards the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Interim head coach Michael Mayne fielded a much changed side to the team's final match of the previous cycle, with only five players retaining their starting spots from Paris 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The squad for the tour included five uncapped players and Perth Glory forward Kelli Brown-was rewarded with a starting debut for today's international friendly.</p>
        
            <p>Mayne had signalled his intent to implement a new playing style, which was evident in their formation. The team lined up with a back three of Liz Anton, Claudia Bunge, and Kate Taylor, while Indiah-Paige Riley and Hannah Blake operated as wingbacks.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns started well, controlling possession against the Central Americans, with Macey Fraser testing Costa Rican goalkeeper Noelia Bermúdez with an early shot.</p>
        
            <p>As the first half progressed, the home side grew into the game, forcing Ferns goalkeeper Vic Esson into several impressive saves.</p>
        
            <p>In the 20th minute Costa Rican midfielder Priscila Chinchilla was played through on goal to finish with a deft touch, flicking the ball past Esson and into the net.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns responded, regaining momentum in search of an equalizer against the 43rd ranked Costa Rica.</p>
        
            <p>The breakthrough came when Indiah-Paige Riley unleashed a brilliant shot from outside the box, looping the ball over the Costa Rican keeper to level the score at 1-1 heading into the break.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns, who are ranked 32 in the world, carried their attacking momentum into the second half, with substitute Jacqui Hand testing the goalkeeper with a long-range effort just minutes after the restart.</p>
        
            <p>While Esson was called upon to make another crucial save, the best chances fell to the Ferns, the best of which came when goalscorer Riley delivered a pinpoint cross to Kitching, but the midfielder's shot fired over the bar.</p>
        
            <p>The second half saw Maya Hahn and Maniana Elliot make their international debuts but despite finishing as the stronger side, the Ferns were unable to find the winning goal.</p>
        
            <p>Mayne said he was pleased with how his side grew into the game, given the new onfield structure.</p>
        
            <p>"...The response at the end of the first half was really good and I actually think the second half we dominated really well. We've had a couple of good chances that we've just got to learn to take so that's what we'll be looking at for the next game," Mayne said.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns will face Costa Rica again on Wednesday at Piedades de Santa Ana Stadium in Alajuela.</p>
