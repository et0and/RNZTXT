            <p>Auckland FC have partnered with Auckland Stadiums to play their home games at Go Media Stadium for their first five years of existence in the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>In an announcement on Wednesday, the newly-formed club said its training and administrative headquarters would be at North Harbour Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC chief executive Officer Nick Becker was excited for his club to play at the venue, known previously as Mt Smart Stadium, which is the long-term home of the Warriors NRL club side.</p>
        
            <p>"Go Media Stadium is an iconic football stadium in New Zealand and we can't wait to write our own stories here," Becker said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is going to provide a fantastic backdrop for our fan first match day experience, with a family fanzone and different zones that cater for every type of sports fan.</p>
        
            <p>"We are building a team packed with young, exciting Kiwi talent who will play an attacking style of football for Auckland football fans to enjoy."</p>
        
            <p>Mt Smart Stadium's main arena will continue to be known as Go Media Stadium until at least May 2028.</p>
