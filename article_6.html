            <p>New Zealand's Steven Adams was a key part of a stifling Houston Rockets defensive effort which over powered the visiting Orlando Magic 97-84, as he turned in a season high rebound count.</p>
        
            <p>Jabari Smith Jr scored a team-high 20 points, Alperen Sengun and Steven Adams recorded double-doubles.</p>
        
            <p>Smith nailed five 3-pointers and grabbed seven rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>He stroked a pair of 3's early in the third quarter to lift Houston to a double-digit lead and later delivered a dazzling defensive play to stifle the Magic for good, blocking a breakaway dunk attempt from Trevelin Queen that resulted in a Dillon Brooks 3-pointer that extended the Houston lead to 92-77 with 3:38 to play.</p>
        
            <p>Sengun (14 points, 14 rebounds) added a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession to seal the victory while Adams chimed in with 11 points with a season-high 17 rebounds off the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Houston sit fifth in the Western Conference with the top six automatically advancing to the playoffs.</p>
