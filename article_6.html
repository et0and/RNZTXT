            <p>Following the loss to England earlier this week, the Black Ferns have dropped co-captain Kennedy Tukuafu among five changes to their starting XV for Sunday's WXV clash with France in Vancouver, their final test of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns are out of WXV title contention following defeats to Ireland and England in their first two games of the tournament.</p>

            <p>Loose forward Layla Sae has been given an opportunity at openside, replacing Tukuafu in the starting side.</p>
        
            <p>Liana Mikaele-Tu'u and Kaipo Olsen-Baker remain unchanged at blindside and number eight.</p>
        
            <p>Halfback Iritana Hohaia will start for the first time this tour in place of Maia Joseph who's been benched.</p>
        
            <p>However, Hannah King, who struggled against England, remains at first-five.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns midfield duo of co-captain Ruahei Demant and Logo-i-Pulotu Lemapu-Atai'i (Sylvia) Brunt is unchanged alongside wingers Katelyn Vahaakolo and Ayesha Leti-I'iga.</p>

            <p>Utility back Patricia Maliepo earns her spot for the first time during the end of year tour, named in jersey 22.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns head coach Allan Bunting said France will provide another strong challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"Our group are determined to finish well this weekend. We have been through some challenging times; we've seen progression in certain areas of our game, but we need to be more accurate and consistent across the park.</p>
        
            <p>"Collectively we have shifted onto France, who we know can be a formidable and unpredictable side. Fortunately, we get another opportunity this week to show all the hard work we have been doing," Bunting said.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday morning's match (11:45am NZT) will be the 12th test between the two sides, with the Black Ferns winning six of those encounters.</p>
        
            <p>A loss could result in New Zealand finishing bottom of the six team WXV1 competition.</p>
