            <p>Arsenal moved top of the Premier League when a late goal by Kai Havertz earned them a 1-0 victory at Brentford.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester City's earlier draw with Liverpool meant Mikel Arteta's side would leapfrog both clubs with a win but that did not look likely for most of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale, recalled to the side, got away with a huge mistake in the first half, while the visitors had a goal by Leandro Trossard ruled out for offside.</p>
        
            <p>Havertz, who came on as a substitute, eventually broke the deadlock with a close-range header in the 89th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal moved up to first place with 30 points from 13 games, one ahead of City and two ahead of Liverpool.</p>
        
            <p>An 80th-minute goal from Trent Alexander-Arnold secured Liverpool a breathless 1-1 draw with leaders Manchester City.</p>
        
            <p>The draw ended a remarkable 23-game winning stretch at Etihad Stadium across all competitions for Pep Guardiola's City and spoiled a record-breaking day for Erling Haaland.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old Haaland, who tops the league with 14 goals, became the fastest player to score 50 Premier League goals when he slotted in a left-footed shot after a poor clearance from keeper Allison Becker. He took 48 games to reach the 50 mark, smashing Andy Cole's record of 65.</p>
        
            <p>The marquee match kicked off the return of the Premier League from the international break, and it did not disappoint, with Alexander-Arnold silencing Etihad's sea of sky blue supporters in the 80th minute when Mohamed Salah teed him up on the edge of the box for a blistering low shot into the corner.</p>
        
            <p>Haaland's goal was his first against Liverpool in a City shirt and came despite questions about the big striker's status after he withdrew from the Norway squad after picking up an ankle injury in a Nov. 16 friendly against the Faroe Islands.</p>
        
            <p>City, who were missing Jack Grealish due to illness, had a second-half goal by Ruben Dias disallowed after VAR ruled Manuel Akanji had interfered with the keeper.</p>
        
            <p>The home side then peppered keeper Allison Becker with shots in a frenzied final few minutes, including a Haaland header off a corner that sailed just wide of the net.</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool had their chances as well, including an early Darwin Nunez header from Salah's cross that Ederson had to leap to bat away.</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea were trounced 4-1 by Newcastle, while Brighton held on with 10 men against Nottingham Forest for a 3-2 victory.</p>
        
            <p>Luton fans celebrated their first home win this season in their 2-1 defeat of Crystal Palace.</p>
        
            <p>While Burnley's wait for the first home points of their campaign continues as they lost 2-1 to West Ham United.</p>
