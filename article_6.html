        <h2>Bev Priestman won't return after Football Ferns spying scandal</h2>
        <p>
Priestman was head coach of the Canadian women's football team team when drones were used to spy on the Kiwi side at the Paris Olympics.

            <p>Bev Priestman will not return as head coach of the Canadian women's football team team following an independent report into the use of drones to spy on the Football Ferns at this year's Paris Olympics, Canada Soccer said.</p>
        
            <p>The Englishwoman and two other team officials were banned from any football-related activity for one year by FIFA after New Zealand complained that Canadian staff flew drones over their training sessions before their opening match in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>But following an independent review commissioned by Canada Soccer, the national governing body said Priestman and the other two individuals currently suspended by FIFA would not return and a search for a new head coach would commence shortly.</p>

            <p>Priestman was previously head of football at New Zealand Football.</p>
        
            <p>Canada Soccer has now also begun an investigation against former coach John Herdman, saying the review unearthed "potential violations" of the organisation's code of conduct by the former head coach of the men's national team.</p>
        
            <p>Herdman too also previously worked for New Zealand Football as head coach of the Football Ferns between 2006 and 2011.</p>
        
            <p>The review found that Priestman and assistant coach Jasmine Mander "directed, approved, and condoned" the use of drones to illegally film the Football Ferns practices ahead of their group game at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Canada Soccer released a summary of the investigation and said players didn't view footage from the drone.</p>
        
            <p>The review found no evidence of drones being used during the 2020 Tokyo Games when Priestman helped guide the Canadian women to their first ever Olympic gold medal.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the governing body said Priestman, Mander, and assistant coach Joey Lombardi "will not be returning" after they serve one-year suspensions that were issued by FIFA last summer.</p>
        
            <p>"The findings of the independent investigator reveal that the drone incident in Paris was a symptom of a past pattern of an unacceptable culture and insufficient oversight within the national teams," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is no longer part of our operations. In fact, the investigation findings strengthen our resolve to continue implementing changes that are needed to improve Canada Soccer, in all respects, and to do so with urgency.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though the independent investigation has been concluded, there is more to be done to set things on a new course.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to scrutinise the cultural and ethical foundations of our organisation and we will dig in to learn more. As we do, we will take additional steps to ensure compliance with our ethical standards and Code of Conduct, and we will communicate to stakeholders as appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working to change Canada Soccer into a federation that Canadians trust and are proud of, and one that is not defined by unfortunate actions of the past." â€‹</p>
