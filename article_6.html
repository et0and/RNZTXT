            <p>Former Crusader Fergus Burke's the lastest New Zealand born rugby player, set to play for Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>The first-five, who played 42 games for the Crusaders between 202- and 2024 and qualifies through his Glasgow born grandfather, has been rushed straight into the Scottish squad for the Six Nations, despite having played just ten games for his new team Saracens.</p>
        
            <p>He will compete for the number 10 jersey with incumbent Finn Russell and Tom Jordan.</p>
        
            <p>"He has been playing regularly for Sacarens and playing really well," coach Gregor Townsend said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to find out about him as a person and a player.</p>
        
            <p>"He is a good defender and loves to carry the ball, whether at flyhalf or fullback," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meantime, star halfback Antoine Dupont is back in the French squad for the upcoming championship.</p>

            <p>Dupont missed last year's tournament to focus on Sevens rugby, which paid off with France winning gold at Paris 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Also back is injury prone first five Romain Ntamack, who missed both the 2023 World Cup and last year's Six Nations.</p>
        
            <p>Lock Hugo Auradou and flanker Oscar Jegou have also been included, despite unresolved and ongoing rape allegations in Argentina, which first surfaced in July.</p>
        
            <p>And, Ireland's bid to win a third successive Six Nations title for the first time has been boosted with the return of a number of key players to their squad.</p>
        
            <p>Hooker Dan Sheehan is back from ACL surgery, while winger James Lowe and fullback Hugo Keenan are also back training having both been out since Ireland's final November international against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Tadhg Furlong, who missed out on that series, is also back.</p>
        
            <p>"While there is a good sense of continuity in selection, having those players back massively increases our competitiveness," interim coach Simon Easterby said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing about the Six Nations is that you have to hit the ground running and there's no room for building or easing your way into competition.</p>
        
            <p>Facing England at home in the first round sharpens everyone's mind to what will be a big task ahead," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The only uncapped player included by Easterby in a squad loaded with experience is Leinster prop Jack Boyle.</p>
        
            <p>Easterby, a former international, is seeking to make his mark in the top job with Andy Farrell stepping away temporarily to prepare the British & Irish Lions for the mid year tour of Australia.</p>
