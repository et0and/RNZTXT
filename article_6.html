            <p>Hometown hero Nelly Korda took a two-shot lead in the second round of the LPGA Drive On Championship today in Bradenton, Florida, while New Zealand's Lydia Ko, is tied for third.</p>
        
            <p>Korda birdied three of her final four holes at Bradenton Country Club to card a 4-under-par 67 and enter the weekend at 10-under 132, passing second-place So Mi Lee of South Korea (second-round 65).</p>
        
            <p>Korda started her day on the back nine, overcoming an early bogey with birdies at Nos. 13, 15 and 17. Then, she shrugged off a bogey at No. 5 with a birdie at the par-5 sixth, and closed things out with birdies at the par-5 eighth and par-3 ninth holes.</p>
        
            <p>"I just knew that I could probably take advantage of the two par-5s," Korda said of her finish. "I knew I had two par-5s coming up, and if I had good drives, they're both reachable."</p>
        
            <p>Korda did not win on the LPGA Tour in 2023. She's in search of her first LPGA victory in 14 months.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been great to see the support," the former World No. 1 said. "I haven't played a tournament in Bradenton in a really, really long time. ... It's been cool to see the big crowds come out and support and the hometown feel."</p>
        
            <p>Lee, 25, is making just her seventh career start on the LPGA Tour. She piled up seven birdies against a single bogey, including four birdies on her back nine.</p>
        
            <p>Now she'll play in the final group Saturday alongside one of the game's biggest stars in Korda.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess you can say I'm not thinking much," Lee said. "I'll look forward to playing in the final group. I watched the LPGA when I was in Korea, and I'm thankful I get to play with the players I watched in the final."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Lydia Ko, who won last week's season opener in Orlando, Florida, co-led with Korda after 18 holes but settled for a 1-under 70.</p>
        
            <p>She's tied for third at 7 under with China's Xiyu Lin (66) and Japan's Ayaka Furue (67).</p>
        
            <p>Lucy Li and South Koreans Minji Kang and Sei Young Kim each shot 69 and are tied for sixth at 6 under. Lexi Thompson posted a 67 to move to 5 under, tied for ninth with Scotland's Gemma Dryburgh (68) and Thailand's Jasmine Suwannapura (68).</p>
        
            <p>Among those missing the cut line of even par include Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn (1 over), Paula Creamer (2 over) and South Korea's Jeongeun Lee (4 over).</p>
