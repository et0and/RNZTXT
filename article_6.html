            <p>Promising White Ferns opening batter Georgia Plimmer will miss the Australia ODI series in New Zealand because of a groin injury.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old, who was one of the success stories of the White Ferns' T20 World Cup triumph, is expected to miss the next six weeks of cricket.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket said Plimmer experienced pain in her left hip joint during the ODI series in India last month, and a subsequent MRI scan and assessment by a specialist confirmed she had a bone stress reaction in her groin.</p>
        
            <p>Plimmer will miss the Australian series before Christmas and most of the season's Hallyburton Johnstone Shield and Super Smash competitions.</p>
        
            <p>She is expected to need six weeks of rest and rehabilitation, with a return to high-speed running in January.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really gutted for this to happen to Georgia when she's at the top of her game," White Ferns head coach Ben Sawyer said.</p>
        
            <p>"She's certainly a loss for us heading into an important series against Australia," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Georgia's determined to rehab well and get back as soon as she can and we're wishing her a smooth recovery."</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Blaze player scored 150 runs in her six innings at the World Cup, with a top score of 53 against Sri Lanka. She was fourth equal top run-scorer with team-mte Suzie Bates and India's Harmanpreet Kaur.</p>
