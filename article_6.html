            <p>Flanker Fraser McReight and centre Hunter Paisami have returned to the Australia squad for Rugby Championship tests against New Zealand after recovering from injuries.</p>
        
            <p>McReight, who missed the South Africa and Argentina matches with a hand injury, will be a welcome addition to the Wallabies' back row following the record 67-27 drubbing by the Pumas in Santa Fe.</p>
        
            <p>Paisami's midfield drive was also missed against Argentina after he suffered a knee injury against the Springboks in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Isaac Kailea has been included in the 36-man squad named on Friday after being ruled out of the Santa Fe clash with a head knock.</p>

            <p>Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt is otherwise relying on largely the same players who have lost three out of four matches in the Rugby Championship and conceded 50 points in a half in Santa Fe.</p>
        
            <p>"After getting a much-needed win in the first (Argentina) test, then making a good start in the second test, we had a very disappointing final 40 minutes in Argentina," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The upcoming Bledisloe test in Sydney offers a great opportunity to turn that poor finish around in front of what looks like being another big home crowd."</p>
        
            <p>The Sept. 21 test against the All Blacks in Sydney and second test in Wellington seven days later double as matches in the annual Bledisloe Cup series contested by the trans-Tasman nations.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand, who have held the Bledisloe Cup uninterrupted since 2003, are coming off a pair of away defeats to world champions South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Like the Wallabies, they head into the tests having lost three out of four in the Rugby Championship while still finding their feet under a new coach in Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies flanker Liam Wright, who was a surprise captaincy choice in the first test of the season against Wales, was not included in the squad while still recovering from injury.</p>
        
            <p>Prop James Slipper retained his place, giving him a chance to claim a record 140th test cap for Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Australia squad: </p>
        
            <p>Forwards - Allan Alaalatoa, Angus Bell, Josh Canham, Matt Faessler, Nick Frost, Langi Gleeson, Tom Hooper, Isaac Kailea, Fraser McReight, Josh Nasser, Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Tom Robertson, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, James Slipper, Carlo Tizzano, Taniela Tupou, Rob Valetini, Jeremy Williams, Harry Wilson</p>
