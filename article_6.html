            <p>Analysis - Go with your gut! That's a thing people say, right?</p>
        
            <p>If I had taken that advice, I would be sitting here now gloating over an outrageous but accurate prediction of the weekend's Auckland FC v Wellington Phoenix clash.</p>
        
            <p>"A wild instinct in me wants to back an Auckland thrashing" I mused, before settling on a 1-1 draw, afraid of stirring a Yellow Fever blowback with my instinctive belief.</p>
        
            <p>The final score line in the third Kiwi Clasico of the season - 6-1 to Auckland - was however, even beyond my own inklings.</p>
        
            <p>So how did they do it? And what positives can the Phoenix take from the chastening experience of losing three times to their newly formed rival, including so emphatically this time out?</p>
        
            <p>Here are six reasons why Auckland FC just thrashed the Wellington Phoenix:</p>

            <p>They may be a new side, but the Black Knights have an abundance of grizzled professionals among their ranks. The average age of the Auckland starting XI this weekend was 28, compared to 25 for the Wellington Phoenix - a number bumped by the presence of elder statesman Kosta Barbarouses.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's XI consisted of nine players over the age of 25, compared to just five in the Phoenix ranks. Even Auckland's youngest player, Alex Paulsen, was featuring in his 50th A-League game - compared to his opposite number Alby Kelly-Heald's six.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, a midfield pairing of Fin Roa Conchie and Matthew Sheridan - with Alex Rufer still returning to full fitness and Paulo Retre out injured - were in the deep end against the wiley Felipe Gallegos and mercurial Jake Brimmer.</p>
        
            <p>They couldn't keep up and the end result was a dominant midfield display which formed the basis of Auckland's supremacy.</p>

            <p>Speaking of grizzled vets, Auckland's head coach has seen it all. A two-time A-League champion as a coach - and once as a player - the 51-year-old's level of A-League exposure is vastly higher than Phoenix sophomore Giancarlo Italiano.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, it showed - as the Phoenix looked, at times, tailor-made for Auckland to create chance after chance with both full-backs exposed by a narrow midfield and Kosta Barbarouses again isolated, despite the inclusion of new recruit Chico Geraldes.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland boss has been willing to adapt throughout the season, settling into a pragmatic and effective style of play that has led to their position as runaway leaders.</p>

            <p>Getting your five visa slots assigned to the right type of player is key to success in the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland have done just that and it was on show on Saturday where Hiroki Sakai captained the side, Neyder Moreno scored twice and Guillermo May led the attack. As already mentioned, Gallegos was pivotal while the returning from suspension Louis Versraete has arguably been Auckland's player of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Wellington have benched two of their foreign recruits (Josh Oluwayemi and Kazuki Nagasawa). They were soon joined by Hideki Ishige - hauled off after an ineffectual opening 45. While Scott Wootton is an ever-present, the final visa slot was effectively being squatted by an unwanted David Ball until recently - with Chico making his first appearance at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Compared to last season, when the likes of Oskar Zawada and Bozhidar Kraev were on the roster, it hasn't been the best use of valuable squad space.</p>

            <p>Auckland's decision to embrace some of the country's fringe talents has paid off dividends this season. Francis De Vries has been the league's standout left-back and on Saturday, ex-Phoenix man Logan Rogerson scored a hat-trick (although there remains debate over whether he or Moreno should get the match-ball) - bettering the two goals he managed in an 11 game Phoenix career. Jesse Randall, another who has previously been mentioned as a potential Phoenix recruit, also got on the scoresheet.</p>
        
            <p>They are not alone. Nando Pijnaker, Max Mata, Liam Gillion, Cam Howieson, Luis Toomey. All are Kiwis who have been welcomed back to professional football in Aotearoa and taken the chance to stick it to a team they have either ignored or been ignored by.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland are brand new and, in this league, that often pays dividends. Because they have yet to be impacted by the A-League pillage - something Wellington are more than accustomed to.</p>
        
            <p>Impressive displays in Australia often lead to big moves abroad for our talents - just look at Zawada, Ben Old, Finn Surman and Alex Paulsen from last season.</p>
        
            <p>It's not just Wellington either. Two-time reigning champs Central Coast are languishing this season after a couple of years of being raided. Macarthur couldn't even get through their season without losing their attacking talent.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland may have to deal with that at the end of their debut campaign - but for now, this is a squad untouched by envious hands.</p>
        
            <p>It's hard to put a word on it but it was evident from the opening game of the season. At Mount Smart, there was a buzz and hum as Auckland kicked off existence with a win over Brisbane Roar. The Port was born and a city has been captivated and cajoled into appreciating a new team from a sleeping giant supporter fanbase.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, at Sky Stadium, a disappointing crowd watched a drab 1-1 draw with Western United to little or no fanfare. If alarm bells weren't ringing, they should have been there.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC are the fresh, new toy. The Buzz Lightyear to Wellington's Woody. Only time will tell if they are falling with style but right now, they are flying way above the shrinking originals.</p>
        
            <p>Let's not forget - it's not all doom and gloom for Wellington. In fact, in one area, they have huge hope and that is with their excellent academy. The club have developed countless top talents and the latest generation is looking good too - even if many had a humbling experience at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>But in Luke Brooke-Smith they have a potential gem who, at 16-years-old, became the club's youngest goalscorer in the weekend humiliation. And on his mum's birthday as well. If others can continue coming along the conveyor belt like he has, then the Phoenix will continue to be the main hub of talent in the country.</p>
        
            <p>In other football news:</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns are looking to a new era after a woeful 2024 - both on and off the pitch. They got things started with a 1-1 draw against Costa Rica in Central America with Indiah-Paige Riley scoring the goal.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood played his role in a Premier League thriller against his former employers Newcastle United. The Kiwi provided an assist but Forest could not find the scoresheet in a 4-3 loss that narrows the gap between the two clubs in the battle for the top four.</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool look like champions elect after beating Manchester City 2-0. Coupled with Arsenal's loss to West Ham, Arne Slot's side are now 11 points clear at the Premier League summit.</p>
