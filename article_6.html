            <p>Taine Tuaupiki is out with concussion with Roger Tuivasa-Sheck moving to fullback and Adam Pompey coming into the centres.</p>
        
            <p>Walker missed last week's 18-10 win over the Raiders with an ankle complaint while hooker Egan is set for his second appearance of the season after being forced out of the last two matches with an elbow injury picked up in round one.</p>

            <p>Niukore's only outing this year was the second pre-season Challenge match against the Dolphins on 24 February in which he suffered a minor foot fracture, keeping him out of the first three rounds.</p>
        
            <p>He has been brought onto the bench alongside Walker, hooker Freddy Lussick and prop Bunty Afoa.</p>
        
            <p>With Egan, Niukore and Walker included in the playing 17, middle forwards Tom Ale and Jazz Tevaga plus utility Chanel Harris-Tavita move onto the extended bench.</p>
