            <p>Competition leaders the Wellington Phoenix have consolidated their place at the top of the A-League in a 1-1 draw with Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix were forced to settle for a share of the spoils against the Roar last night after conceding an equaliser in the fourth minute of the second half of stoppage time.</p>
        
            <p>Bozhidar Kraev had put the Nix in front in the 51st minute, scoring his fifth goal of the season to put Wellington on course to move five points clear at the top of the ladder.</p>
        
            <p>Instead the Phoenix are now three points above their nearest rival, Melbourne Victory, but still can't be knocked off top spot this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed to give the two points away at the end and give them one point," coach Giancarlo Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there was one moment in the first half where I felt like they got in behind usâ€¦and I didn't think they had much else apart from that.</p>
        
            <p>"The amount of changes I had to make because of some unplanned substitutions with injuries and players fatiguing and so on, it probably cost us in the end."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano will now turn his attention to Wellington's clash against the reigning champion Central Coast Mariners in Wellington on Waitangi Day.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Alex Rufer will return from his suspension next round, while defender Tim Payne's recovering ankle injury should allow him to get back on the pitch.</p>
