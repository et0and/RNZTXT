            <p>The Silver Ferns have won the Constellation Cup for just the third time after beating Australia 61-43 in the third Test of the series in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>It is also the first time since 2006 that the Silver Ferns have beaten the Diamonds three games in a row.</p>
        
            <p>After stunning the world champions in the first two Tests in New Zealand by margins of 14 and 11, the Silver Ferns were expecting a tougher test on Australian soil.</p>
        
            <p>They were on a five-game losing streak across the Tasman and it initially looked like that pattern might continue.</p>
        
            <p>The Diamonds made three changes for the Test with Georgie Horjus, Rudi Ellis and Matilda Garrett in for Kiera Austin, Kate Moloney and Jo Weston.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline Taurua went with the same starting seven that did the job in the first two Tests.</p>
        
            <p>It was 13-all after the first quarter and the Silver Ferns' main feeders, who had been explosive in the first two tests, were contained better by Australia.</p>

            <p>Wing defence Jamie-Lee Price in particular used her size advantage to make life difficult for wing attack Kimiora Poi.</p>
        
            <p>The Diamonds were slicker on attack and the midcourters were able to find shooter Sophie Garbin more easily.</p>
        
            <p>But the Silver Ferns still showed patience in getting the ball to shooter Grace Nweke and were able to get a 28-26 half-time lead.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline showed faith in her starting seven, who stayed out there for the whole game.</p>
        
            <p>Her patience was rewarded because Poi worked her way back into the game in the second half and the Silver Ferns found more flow on attack.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand defensive line started tightening up on the Diamonds, which led to the home side making a string of uncharacteristic mistakes.</p>
        
            <p>Georgie Horjus got her debut by coming on at wing attack, which saw Australian captain Liz Watson benched for the second game in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Australian coach Stacey Marinkovich made a number of changes throughout the game as she searched for answers.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand won the third quarter by a staggering 18-9.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand defenders caused hesitation in the Australian shooting end and Cara Koenen came on for goal shooter Garbin for the final few minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Kate Heffernan was named MVP after a fine showing at wing defence, where she also fired several balls into Nweke, who scored 47 goals at 94 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a remarkable turnaround from the Silver Ferns, who just three weeks ago were licking their wounds after losing the Taini Jamison trophy series 2-1 to England.</p>
        
            <p>In the wake of that, the Silver Ferns dropped to third in the world netball rankings.</p>
        
            <p>With a 3-nil lead, the Silver Ferns have a chance to take a clean sweep of the series for the first time since its inception in 2010, when the sides meet for the final test in Melbourne on Wednesday.</p>
