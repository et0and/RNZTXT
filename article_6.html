            <p>Australia's infamous Olympic breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn has announced her retirement from competition months after her appearance at the Paris Olympics recieved worldwide backlash.</p>
        
            <p>The B-girl whose performance at the Olympics went viral for all the wrong reasons, left the Games without a single point.</p>
        
            <p>Gunn is ranked number 1 in the latest Breaking World Ranking List but told an Australian radio station her breaking days were over.</p>
        
            <p>The university lecturer said her Paris experience had taken a toll.</p>

            <p>Gunn revealed on 2DayFM's Jimmy and Nath for Breakfast that should would not compete at another Olympics - should the sport make the cut in the future - and she would only break for fun now.</p>
        
            <p>"I still break, but I don't compete. I'm not going to compete anymore," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems really difficult for me to do now to approach a battle.</p>
        
            <p>"I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that's like in my living room with my partner!</p>
        
            <p>"It's [the Olympic backlash] been really upsetting. I just didn't have any control over how people saw me or who I was.</p>
        
            <p>"Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don't think people should feel crap about the way that they dance. If you get out there, and you have fun on the dance floor then just own it."</p>
        
            <p>After the Games Gunn said the backlash had been devastating and pleaded for privacy for herself and her family and friends.</p>
