            <p>Opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy made 86 and collaborated in two half-century partnerships to help Bangladesh finish day one of the first test against New Zealand on 310-9 in Sylhet.</p>
        
            <p>Electing to bat on a surface where the ball spun sharply from the first session, Bangladesh were 180-2 before New Zealand roared back into the contest with Glenn Phillips claiming 4-53 in his second test.</p>
        
            <p>Shoriful Islam (13) and Taijul Islam (eight) were dragged Bangladesh past the 300-mark before bad light stopped play at the Sylhet International Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto won the toss and elected to bat with the home side opting for a spin-heavy attack with Shoriful as the lone frontline seamer.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand wasted a review trying to get Zakir Hasan lbw by Kyle Jamieson before skipper Tim Southee, recognising the nature of the track, introduced spin in the seventh over bringing Ajaz Patel (2-76) into the attack.</p>
        
            <p>The left-arm spinner struck in his fourth over when he spun one through Zakir's gate but next-man-in Shanto threw caution to the wind and counter-attacked the New Zealand spinners.</p>
        
            <p>Shanto smashed three sixes in his breezy 37 before hitting a rank full toss from Phillips into the air on the leg side. Kane Williamson moved from mid-on to take the catch.</p>
        
            <p>Mahmudul added 88 runs with Mominul Haque (37) to consolidate their position but off-spinner Phillips, bowling first time in a test match, broke the stand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand bowlers subsequently kept chipping away and the early stumps meant they were spared the tricky task of batting in fading lights.</p>
        
            <p>The second and final test is scheduled in Mirpur from Dec. 6.</p>
