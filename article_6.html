            <p>Australia's two-times Grand Slam doubles champion Max Purcell has elected to take a voluntary provisional suspension under the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme, says the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).</p>
        
            <p>The ITIA said Purcell, the world's 12th-ranked doubles player, had admitted to a breach of rules relating to the use of a "prohibited method" and requested to enter into a provisional suspension on 10 December, which came into effect two days later.</p>
        
            <p>"Time served under provisional suspension will be credited against any future sanction," the ITIA said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old Purcell said on Instagram he unknowingly received an IV infusion of vitamins above the allowed limit of 100ml, adding he was convinced he followed World Anti-Doping Agency regulations and methods.</p>
        
            <p>"But the records show that the IV was over the 100ml limit, even though I told the clinic that I was a professional athlete and needed the IV to be under 100ml," Purcell explained.</p>
        
            <p>"This news was devastating because I pride myself on being an athlete who makes sure everything is WADA safe. I volunteered this information to the ITIA and have been as transparent as possible in trying to put this whole situation behind me.</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to being back on the court soon."</p>
        
            <p>Tennis Australia said the ITIA confirmed the breach related to the use of a prohibited method rather than the presence of a prohibited substance.</p>
        
            <p>"As the matter is currently under investigation, it is inappropriate to comment further at this time," it added.</p>
        
            <p>Purcell, who won the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 2022 and at the US Open this year, is prohibited from playing in, coaching at, or attending any event authorised by the governing bodies of the sport or national associations.</p>
        
            <p>Purcell is the latest Grand Slam champion to have case opened by the ITIA, an independent organisation established by the governing bodies of the sport to safeguard its integrity.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said last month that French Open champion Iga Swiatek had accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine following contamination of her sleep medication.</p>
        
            <p>World number one Jannik Sinner had been cleared of wrongdoing after two failed tests in March for the anabolic agent clostebol but faces a ban of up to two years after an appeal by WADA.</p>
        
            <p>Both players will be in action in the Australian Open, which begins on 12 January.</p>
