            <p>Lydia Ko describes the prospect of retirement as "scary" as she prepares to tee off at the home of golf - the St Andrews Old Course - in her latest stab at a women's major title.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh from her gold medal at the Paris Olympics, interest has turned to just how long 27-year-old New Zealander Ko will stay with the sport.</p>
        
            <p>She has long said she wanted to become eligible for the LPGA Hall of Fame before she considered putting away her clubs.</p>
        
            <p>The Hall of Fame goal was ticked off when she climbed to the top spot of the Olympic podium this month - adding gold to silver and bronze won at the two previous Games.</p>
        
            <p>It's why journalists were quick to ask about Ko's playing future at a press conference on the eve of the British Women's Open in Fife, Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>She would only say hanging up her clubs isn't in her immediate future.</p>
        
            <p>"It's exciting, what's ahead, but in a way it's scary. I've played golf since I was five. This is my life whether I like it or not. Golf has given me so much to be thankful for. I think it's not an easy decision but I know I have a great support team and family that's so supportive," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always said that while I'm competitively playing, I want to play at the highest level I possibly can and continuously work hard with my team to become a better, more consistent player. So that's the goal right now.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, it's kind of been, go, go, go since the Olympics, so I haven't really had a lot of time to think about everything. I don't want to rush into any decisions. You know, this is definitely not my last press conference or anything like that."</p>
        
            <p>Ko revealed her gold medal was wrapped up in a towel, inside a backpack in her hotel room.</p>

            <p>She hadn't had a chance to reflect fully on her Paris triumph, having turned her attention quickly to last week's ninth placing at the Scottish Open - a solid warmup for the last major of the year.</p>
        
            <p>It's eight years since world No.12 Ko clinched the last of her two major titles and she hasn't finished in the top-10 of a major for two years.</p>
        
            <p>However, a solid season this year and newly-formed appreciation for links courses has her confident she can make a challenge when she tees off her first round at the US$9.5 million (NZ$15.4 million) tournament at 11.26pm on Thursday (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't played particularly well in links golf in my 11 or so appearances that I've played," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's always a time for a change and it would be great to have one of my best finishes here.</p>
        
            <p>"I've gotten to love links golf over the years. I think before I was always frustrated it was windy and rainy - and all of those things combined. Conditions are a big factor in how our rounds are played.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you have to be very creative when you play links golf - sometimes numbers are irrelevant."</p>
        
            <p>Ko's first taste of St Andrews Old Course came at the 2013 British Open, she admits she was "quickly humbled" by the challenge as a 16-year-old.</p>

            <p>"I must say I don't have a lot of memory - I was just trying to survive the wind and the conditions at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously it's great to be here, this is the home of golf, it's kind of like a bucket list place for a lot of people.</p>
