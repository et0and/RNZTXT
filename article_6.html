            <p>Analysis - The Crusaders are currently winless, with only one bonus point saving them from being last on the Super Rugby Pacific table.</p>
        
            <p>Let that sink in, before pondering this next fact: before this weekend the Hurricanes had only won in Christchurch twice since 2016. Both times it required, without question, their best performance of the year.</p>
        
            <p>While it certainly was good, you could make a case that the Canes' 14-10 win at Apollo Projects Stadium on Friday night was not even their best game this season - and we are only four rounds in.</p>
        
            <p>There is certainly a lot to like about Clark Laidlaw's unbeaten Canes so far in 2024. But the story right now is the Crusaders and just how they salvage their campaign, especially since they have the Blues and Chiefs in their next two fixtures.</p>
        
            <p>The signs of life are there, like when Jamie Hannah pulled off a stunning turnover late in the game on his own line that eventually lead to Riley Hohepa's penalty goal 80 metres downfield to take the lead. But as clinical and Crusaders-like that sequence was, things were blown apart only moments later when they let the Canes march right up to their line and take it back through a Justin Sangster try.</p>
        
            <p>Hannah was even sin binned for a professional foul on the play, just to ram home the difference between this Crusaders team and the ones that have come before it. Rob Penney knew he had a tough job ahead of him when he took the coaching gig, given how many talent was leaving, but the casualty ward and tough draw may well have him wondering just what he has got himself into.</p>
        
            <p>This is Super Rugby after all, so the extremely generous playoff situation will likely see the Crusaders be able to use all available time to mount a serious challenge by then. But given they have to go to Eden Park and then have Damian McKenzie and his mates come down and see them in the next fortnight, things are likely to get worse before they get better.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another result that could prove to be a turning point for a team in a very different way happened in the graveyard shift. Moana Pasifika's 22-14 win over the Force was a valuable road win for them, but the way in which it came was ironically reassuring, given its business-like manner.</p>
        
            <p>Up until now, every Moana win has been built on a huge performance that's seen them upset sides. This latest one though was simply a case of coming in with a good chance and getting the job done - sure, Kyren Taumoefolau's second half try was spectacular and the Force are garbage, but it is these sorts of results that build seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Things will get tougher for Moana over the next few weeks, but there are enough chances later on for them to secure what will be judged a successful season.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies' 27-21 win over the Highlanders in Dunedin probably says more about them than their hosts. It was a rare Australian win on New Zealand soil, but on paper the Brumbies should have felt confident given their solid, talented squad.</p>
        
            <p>Cory Toole is quickly becoming one of the most exciting players in the competition and with three wins and one loss, his side can cement themselves in the top part of the table in the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>If you are looking for help curing insomnia, a replay of the Blues' 12-10 result over the Waratahs would be a good start. But a win is a win for the Blues as they gear up for their first game at Eden Park next weekend, where they will be looking to inflict as much pain on the Crusaders as possible.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Dalton Papali'i certainly has not been shy about mentioning the need for tribalism and rivalry this season, which is refreshing, but now it is time to put those words into action with a ruthless performance.</p>
