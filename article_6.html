            <p>World champions Erika Fairweather and Lewis Clareburt head a nine-strong New Zealand swim team for the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The only other member of the squad with Olympic experience was Eve Thomas.</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt won the 400m Individual Medley at this year's Swimming World Championships in Doha, while Fairweather picked up her title in the 400m Freestyle, as well as winning silver in the 200m Free and bronze in the 800m Free.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so keen to get to Paris," Fairweather said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always special getting to compete at this level, so much hard work goes on behind the scenes to prepare for the Olympics and I can't wait to showcase it."</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt said: "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be an Olympian, let along going to my second Games.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge privilege, I can't wait to represent New Zealand and put the pūkana on the world stage."</p>
        
            <p>They were joined by fellow Tokyo Olympian Thomas, who will also have a busy programme - contesting four events.</p>
        
            <p>The other six athletes will make their Olympic debuts in Paris after swimming qualification times at the New Zealand Swimming Championships earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Hazel Ouwehand was one of the standout performers at the meet, storming home in the Women's 100m Butterfly in a New Zealand record time of 57.43s, almost half a second under the Paris Olympic Games qualifying time.</p>
        
            <p>"Going to the Olympics has been a dream of mine since I was super young so it's pretty special to see it realised," Ouwehand said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really excited for the Games, it's going to be an amazing field of athletes and I can't wait to put all my hard work and training into action."</p>

            <p>For 200m Backstroke athlete Kane Follows, the selection was particularly sweet. The 27-year-old has never made a New Zealand representative team until now.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been a grind, I've missed a lot of teams but I've stuck at it, I've given so much to the sport and it feels so good to get this result," Follows said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sport is a lot of ups and downs but it's all worth it for this feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Sprinters Taiko Torepe-Ormsby (Ngāi Tahu) and Cameron Gray are the other men in the Olympic squad.</p>
        
            <p>Torepe-Ormsby produced the fastest 50m Freestyle swim ever by a New Zealander (21.86s) as he qualified for Paris, while Cameron Gray beat his own New Zealand record in the 100m Freestyle.</p>
        
            <p>Caitlin Deans and Laticia-Leigh Transom round out the team, contesting the women's 4x200m Freestyle Relay alongside Fairweather and Thomas.</p>
        
            <p>Swimming New Zealand Olympic programme lead Gary Francis said they were excited about the potential of the squad.</p>
        
            <p>"To have nine really quality athletes heading to the Games is fantastic," Francis said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a great mix of experienced campaigners and exciting young talent in this team. We were thrilled with the times these athletes swum at the New Zealand Swimming Championships earlier this month and we're expecting some special performances in Paris in a few months time."</p>
