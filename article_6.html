            <p>He was one of the most destructive and feared boxers on the planet, but before amassing a professional record of 52 wins, David Tua was a talented teenager honing his skills in a Māngere Bridge gym.</p>
        
            <p>Before the heavyweight's homecoming to Samoa, his contributions to amateur boxing will be celebrated as the inaugural inductee into the Auckland Boxing Association Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>ABA chairman Paul McSharry said Tua paved the way for the likes of Shane Cameron and Joseph Parker to shine on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>"David's the best amateur we've ever had, and the best professional that we will probably ever have. David is the only boxer in the history of New Zealand that I'm in awe of."</p>
        
            <p>McSharry said he had wanted to start a hall of fame for a long time and "celebrate a group of legendary local fighters who have started their amateur careers here in Auckland".</p>
        
            <p>Tua will be inducted on 26 October at the ABA and said he was caught off guard by the accolade.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a massive surprise. Certainly an honour. I'm grateful, and I think of those who have gone before, those who have paved the way for me to be where I'm at today. I'm just really grateful, happy and thankful for it."</p>
        
            <p>The former WBO Asia Pacific and WBO Oriental heavyweight champion said the ABA was crucial to his career.</p>
        
            <p>"They played a massive role, not only as coaches, trainers, father figures, they mentor me to become the person that I am today."</p>
        
            <p>Told about McSherry's endorsement, Tua said he was humbled.</p>
        
            <p>"To come from not just anyone, but someone that understands the game, means a lot."</p>
        
            <p>He anticipated an emotional evening.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an opportunity to say thank you to everyone that played a role in my life. The things that I've been able to achieve will always go back to my peers and those who have loved the game of boxing and know that most importantly, we can leave the ring with our health and go home to to our wives and our families."</p>
        
            <p>McSharry credited Tua for the survival of ABA.</p>
        
            <p>"David's career was taking off in America, and as soon as his sports betting arrived, Boxing New Zealand received funds from the TAB because David was asked what organisation should be receiving the percentage that needed to be passed on. It's through the efforts of professional boxers like David the ABA exists."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would be an amateur boxing showcase on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"We will have some fights that start in the mid afternoon. Then we will have an hour or two of inducting David into the hall of fame, there'll be speeches from people that I'm yet to identify who they will be, and then we'll finish off with another four or five fights, and then we'll celebrate what David has achieved."</p>
        
            <p>Tua has inspired millions through his in-ring prowess and humility outside.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess I can only hope that I've left the game knowing that it was better than when I first started."</p>
