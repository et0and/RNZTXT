            <p>New Zealand golfer Steve Alker is fired up to finally win the New Zealand Open.</p>
        
            <p>The 52-year-old has been based in the United States for the last 20 years but regularly returns home to play the national tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Alker has been the inform player on the PGA Champions Tour since joining the over fifties competition in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He's won eight times and would like to bring that winning formula to Queenstown this week.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still competitive, I'm still playing professional golf but there's probably not too many left in me so to come back and be competitive," Alker said.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton-born Alker says it's important for him to play here when he can.</p>
        
            <p>"As a New Zealander to get back and play in front of the fans and the family and really just to have another crack at it."</p>
        
            <p>Alker is yet to win the New Zealand Open, having finished runner-up twice in 2001 and 2002.</p>
        
            <p>It's a different story on the Champions Tour, he's won eight times and started in fine form in 2024 with victory in Hawaii in January.</p>
        
            <p>"To carry on that form from last year and have that win was great so a nice positive start and I hope to bring it in here.</p>

            <p>The tournament will include a field of up to 156 amateurs and 156 professionals playing alongside one another.</p>
        
            <p>The field will be split across two courses at Millbrook Resort for the first round of competition with all players alternating to the other course for the second round.</p>
        
            <p>Having played a couple of practice rounds Alker likes what he sees.</p>
        
            <p>"The course is in great shape, just keep it on the fairway and I think scoring will be pretty good if the weather stays good.</p>
        
            <p>"You know you've got to be aggressive and get after it.</p>
        
            <p>He'll have his wife Tanya on the bag this week.</p>
        
            <p>"It was 2014 US Open the last time my wife caddied for me. We are having a blast this week just being here and doing this together and the company we are in.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no golf talk at all which is a nice change from what it's been. We have fun out there. It's a nice change of pace. It's something we haven't done for a while and we have talked about doing. She was going to do it last year but couldn't unfortunately.</p>
        
            <p>"She knows golf, she knows a lot about the game and my game, so we talk often."</p>
        
            <p>Alker tees off at 12:57 on the opening day (Thursday).</p>
