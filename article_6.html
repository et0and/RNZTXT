            <p>Warriors coach Andrew Webster is standing by his scathing assessment of the NRL bunker.</p>
        
            <p>NRL referees boss Graham Annesley was forced to apologise this week in the wake of Stephen Crichton's two match suspension.</p>
        
            <p>He referred to it as a "judgement error".</p>
        
            <p>Crichton clocked Warriors centre Roger Tuivasa Sheck with a shoulder to the head in Friday nights loss to the Bulldogs.</p>
        
            <p>Tuivasa Sheck left the field with concussion, unable to return and prematurely ending his season.</p>
        
            <p>Webster scolded the decision post match, and his tune has not changed.</p>
        
            <p>"When a player makes a mistake, there's accountability for a player. If I get things wrong, there's accountability for me. So if there's accountability, then these things will will happen less. If there's no accountability, and no one explains it. All it does is lead to frustration."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said while not wanting to make excuses, there were simply too many dubious decisions stacking up against the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very careful not being a victim. There's so many things I want to do better as a coach, but I feel like it's just we're easy to pick on. They (the Warriors) don't blow up. (I don't) say anything. (I sit) there all year and and (say) it's OK. That's because I don't want players to use this stuff as excuses. And for the last two seasons, I've been like that. I don't want to be that guy, but that's just how I feel. But why we didn't make the playoffs is because we didn't play good football."</p>
        
            <p>Warriors fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad said seeing Tuivasa-Sheck laying prone was a scary sight.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a little bit worried I don't think I've ever seen Roger go down with an HIA like that."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said the waters were only becoming murkier regarding head contact.</p>
        
            <p>"People get frustrated when there's no clarity. When there's clarity, people can move on."</p>
