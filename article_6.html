            <p>RNZ looks over the biggest moments, statement performances, and all the water cooler chat from the weekend's rugby around the globe.</p>
        
            <p>Aupiki Arrives</p>
        
            <p>The third iteration of Super Rugby Aupiki kicked off with two highly entertaining games. Manawa's star studded roster ran away with it in the final 20 in Hamilton, though Poua, fielding 10 debutants, were brave in a standout first half. The Blues made amends for a poor first 40 in Invercargil to edge Matatu in a pulsating finish, how brilliant to have an extended s eason?</p>
        
            <p>An Unlikely Hero </p>
        
            <p>In a perfect cameo from the bench, replacement prop Pasilio Tosi made a match-winning impact for the Hurricanes in extra time against the Reds. The 140kg Tosi used his hulking frame to win a penalty with the Reds on attack, before scoring the clincher at the other end to steal a famous win.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett's Brainfade </p>
        
            <p>Not the best way to celebrate your 100th cap. Barrett's hit on Jordie Petaia could see him sidelined for several weeks.</p>

            <p>Patchell Proves a Peach </p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders have a poor track record of overseas signings, the likes of James Haskell and Freddie Burns come to mind. However, Welshman Rhys Patchell is proving to be the best Super Rugby import since Pablo Matera.</p>
        
            <p>Dupont's Triumph </p>
        
            <p>He is regarded as the greatest 15's player on the planet, so Antoine Dupont raised plenty of eyebrows when he opted to take his considerable talents to sevens, His decision was justified at the weekend however as he led France to a first title in 19 years in Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>Bongi Being a Boofhead</p>
        
            <p>Springboks hooker Bongi Mbonambi has followed up on his alleged racism controversy by blatantly disrespecting female referee Aimee Barrett-Theron in the URC, turning his back on her as she was explaining a decision.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Magic</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika and the Fijian Drua put on a stunning showcase of running rugby in Melbourne, reiterating just how much has been lost not having Pasifika sides in the competition from the outset of Super Rugby.</p>

The weekend saw peak Pacific flair on show in Melbourne.

            <p>Blues Scrum Tactics</p>
        
            <p>After seeing a huge emphasis put on speeding up the game in round one, the Blues reverted to their painful scrum tactics, holding the ball at the number eight's feet and waiting for the inevitable collapse. Just clear the ball!</p>
        
            <p>Japan watch</p>
        
            <p>Ardie Savea caused absolute carnage in the Kobe Steelers win over Beauden Barrett and Aaron Smith's Toyota Verblitz, running in four tries and bumping off 16 would be tacklers. He saved his best for last, a goosie and a huge don't argue as he streaked away for a 50 metre screamer.</p>

            <p>Hit of the Week</p>
        
            <p>Zarn Sullivan flattening a rampaging Timoci Tavatavanawai was not the outcome many were expecting from the collision between the two.</p>
        
            <p>Stock drop</p>
        
            <p>Sam Gilbert- His three missed conversions against the Blues cost his side dearly. the highly touted Noah Hotham also struggled against the Waratahs.</p>
        
            <p>Stock rise</p>
        
            <p>Etene Nanai Seturo- Though Hoskins Sotutu gave Scott Robertson a timely reminder of his credentials with a hat-trick in Melbourne, Etene Nanai Seturo was simply sensational against the Brumbies, scoring one and setting up two other tries in the 46-12 rout.</p>
        
            <p>Post of the Week</p>
        
            <p>The medical community collectively cringed watching this clip.</p>
        
            <p>Brilliant moment in Bul v Sto game ... Fourie sees Coetzee is bleeding, so offers him the piece of cotton wool he's been using to wipe the blood from his own schnozz ... Probably breaking every medical rule in the book, but that's an incredible rugby moment in the heat of battle pic.twitter.com/h8byjEL43G</p>
        
            <p>Try of the Week</p>
        
            <p>Patchell produced an absolute masterclass in a losing effort against the Blues, his pièce de résistance a superb out the back offload to set up Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens for his third try of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Quote of the Week</p>
        
            <p>Goes to the Stan Sport commentary team. With former Wallaby Tim Horan having a crack at co-commentator Sonny Bill Williams after a Chiefs offload, saying "you would've run that," SBW snapped back without missing a beat; "I would have if I was running at you."</p>
        
            <p>
SBW is showing he can be just as sharp on the mic as he was on the field or in the ring.
