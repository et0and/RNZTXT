        <h2>New Zealand's first U85kg side to tour Sri Lanka</h2>
        <p>
NZR has confirmed the inaugural national team will head overseas in May next year.
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby (NZR) has confirmed the inaugural Under 85kg national team will tour Sri Lanka in May next year.</p>
        
            <p>After receiving an invitation earlier this year, the New Zealand side will play two fixtures against the Sri Lankan men's team, known as the Tuskers.</p>
        
            <p>While Sri Lanka might not spring to mind as a rugby nation, it does have a connection to an All Black great. Sir Colin Meads played his first match in a black jersey in Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, for the NZ Colts side in 1955.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement comes after another successful season of the National Under U85kg Club Cup, which was won by the Pakuranga Black Panthers in a thrilling final against the HSOB Light Bears at Sky Stadium in September.</p>

            <p>NZR's General Manager of Community Rugby Steve Lancaster said it was a great opportunity to continue building on the importance of the grade nationally and to take weight-grade rugby to a developing rugby nation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's exciting to confirm this inaugural tour for our Under 85kg national team, and playing against an open-weight national side will be a great challenge for them.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also worked closely with the New Zealand High Commission in Sri Lanka in establishing the tour and are extremely grateful for their help in supporting the tour and promoting rugby in the region."</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lankan Prime Minister the Honourable Dr Harini Amarasuriya noted what a significant milestone this tour would be.</p>
        
            <p>"This occasion promises to energise the nation's rugby enthusiasts as they witness a powerhouse of the sport take on our national team in two thrilling matches. We look forward to celebrating this historic occasion together, uniting through our shared passion for the game," said Dr Amarasuriya.</p>

            <p>Club Captain Peter White said "the NZ Barbarian Rugby Club is committed to growing rugby in New Zealand and are proud of our long term association with, and promotion of, weight restricted rugby. We are excited by the selection of this team which provides the opportunity for players from the grade to play international rugby and most importantly for these trail blazers to make lifelong friendships by touring together."</p>
