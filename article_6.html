            <p>It was two big backflips which saw Goomes outclass her rivals in the eyes of the judges.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to her tricks, Goomes stomped her 41-foot drop, and cleanly weaved down her top technical chute.</p>
        
            <p>"It hasn't yet sunk in. It's been such a process, so I'm trying to take it all in and enjoy it. I'm so stoked for my crew, they've gone so hard," said Coomes.</p>
        
            <p>Goomes receives $25 thousand in prizemoney.</p>
        
            <p>The event is often referred to as the 'Super Bowl' of mountain biking and is the first time women have competed in the event.</p>
        
            <p>The format is similar to freestyle skiing and freestyle snowboarding, where competitors are judged on their choice of lines down the hill, their technical ability and the complexity of tricks</p>
        
            <p>Riders have to dig out their own courses with each rider having three diggers to complete their competition zones.</p>
        
            <p>Then there are the riggers who rope in athletes and their diggers on the steep sections during the build process.</p>
        
            <p>The competition first took place in 2001 but by 2005 the organisers cancelled it due to the increasing risk competitors were taking.</p>
        
            <p>It returned after a three year break in 2008.</p>
