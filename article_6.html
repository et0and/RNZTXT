            <p>The 104th New Zealand Open will tee off at Millbrook Resort in Queenstown on Thursday pitting professional and amateur players against each other to lift the Brodie Breeze trophy.</p>
        
            <p>For Australian Brendan Jones the tournament holds a special place in his heart after he won it in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the names on the trophy are pretty incredible and knowing that I've got mine there now I just feel like I'm a foot taller than I actually am. It's my one and only national open that I've ever won so for me it's very very special."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Steven Alker does not know how many more times he will make the trek back home off the PGA Tour Champions to compete.</p>
        
            <p>Alker has yet to win the tournament that he first played in as a schoolboy and leading amateur in 1989.</p>
        
            <p>But he can see why it is worth the travel.</p>
        
            <p>"Not too many tournaments are played as a pro-am format so it's quite unique we've got an open championship for the country open that is played as a pro-am format, where we play it and what we're doing with the format it goes global and I think that is huge for the event."</p>
        
            <p>Jones and Alker will both be on the PGA Tour Champions in 2025 and both admit they are still finding form early in the season.</p>
        
            <p>"(I'm) rusty played first event last week in Sydney and missed the cut by plenty so there's a bit to work on but this time of the year I'm always fresh and it doesn't generally take me a lot to get back to where I want to be," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got some pretty exciting times ahead hopefully the enthusiasm that I've got for the game right now is going to be enough."</p>
        
            <p>Alker finished second in the PGA Tour Champions event in Morocco earlier this month and felt in a good place heading into the New Zealand Open.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got some good vibes and a game not quite where I want it, but it's early season," Alker said.</p>
        
            <p>"Early season, you're trying to feel out where you're at and get into some form."</p>
        
            <p>For the first time, the New Zealand Open is part of the Open Qualifying Series and the winner will get a place at The Open Championship at Royal Portrush in July.</p>
        
            <p>Arguably the strongest professional field in recent history at the New Zealand Open will also be competing for $2 million.</p>
