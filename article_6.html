            <p>A leading commentator says former Black Cap Lou Vincent's second chance in the game of cricket is long overdue.</p>
        
            <p>Vincent's life ban for match-fixing has been relaxed by the England Cricket Board after almost a decade out, allowing a return to domestic cricket.</p>
        
            <p>The ECB banned Vincent in 2014 after the disgraced player admitted he was a "cheat" and had shamed his country and the sport by fixing matches.</p>
        
            <p>Commentator Bryan Waddle says the 45-year-old will be a positive force in whichever path he chooses.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a fair and reasonable decision, he's served his time and his suspension and it's been regarded worldwide that people who have been given life bans have had those rescinded."</p>
        
            <p>Waddle said it was a harsh punishment imposed on Vincent.</p>
        
            <p>"He deserved to be penalised for his actions, but there's always room for a way back and I think it's a good decision for cricket."</p>
        
            <p>Vincent is not allowed to play at the top level, but due to his age this would have been unlikely.</p>
        
            <p>"He probably would like to get involved in a club administration. I know he was interested in being a coach and he could be a mentor for young people. He has been doing work in the area of anti corruption and taking responsibility for his actions. So I think there's a wide area that could be available."</p>
        
            <p>Vincent played 23 tests and more than 100 one-day internationals for New Zealand and says he remains sorry for the harm he caused.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a lot of dealings with him over a long period of time, and I'm sure he will add to the cricket community."</p>
        
            <p>Waddle said Vincent's team-mates will be supportive of the ruling, with the New Zealand Players Association also having a hand in the successful appeal.</p>
        
            <p>"The ban, of course came out of England not from New Zealand, New Zealand was just forced to accept it. Sometimes, sport, and the game of cricket is a little bit too serious. 11 life bans? For God's sake!"</p>
