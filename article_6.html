            <p>The All Blacks' biggest success story of last season is set to potentially miss the entire Super Rugby Pacific campaign. It was confirmed today by the Chiefs that Wallace Sititi will require surgery for a knee injury, which was picked up on the end of year tour.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan said Sititi would go under the knife on Friday, with the full extent unknown until next week.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess the fact that he's having surgery means it's reasonably serious," McMillan said, adding that he was unsure of exactly when then injury occurred in the five test matches Sititi played on the tour.</p>
        
            <p>"But we won't know how serious. (He's) a huge loss, everyone's seen how he's played over the last 12 months and it's never nice to lose players of that calibre. Every team in never immune to injury, you go through a competition on the strength of your squad."</p>

            <p>Sititi's absence is a blow, but the Chiefs do have ample depth in their loose forwards.</p>
        
            <p>"While we'll miss him, we've got a lot of other very good rugby players who will step up," McMillan said. That's no understatement.</p>
        
            <p>Current captain Luke Jacobson and Samipeni Finau are both current All Blacks, while they have acquired Jahrome Brown from the Brumbies. Simon Parker, Kaylum Boshier and Malachi Wrampling are also on the books while locks Naitoa Ah Kuoi, Jimmy Tupou and Tupou Vaa'i are all capable of playing at blindside if a reshuffle is needed.</p>
        
            <p>While Sititi's debut test season grabbed the world's attention, it came as little surprise to anyone who had followed the Chiefs' run to the Super Rugby Pacific season. His performances led to many tagging him as a future All Black but Scott Robertson pulled the trigger early and picked the 22-year-old for his initial squad, with a debut against Fiji followed by outstanding starts at number eight against the Springboks.</p>

            <p>By the time the end of year tour rolled around, Sititi was a confirmed starter and played every test match. He was awarded World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year in November.</p>
        
            <p>McMillan will also be without Shaun Stevenson for the first four rounds as well, after the fullback confirmed a short term deal to play for Kubota Spears in the Japanese Rugby League One competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a sensible decision that meets everyone's needs," said McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>"Shaun's been a guy that's been a massive contributor to Chiefs rugby… him getting this short term sabbatical is an opportunity to dip his toes into those waters. The fact of the matter is that he's coming back to us in round four and we'll welcome him back with open arms."</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs open their season with a rematch of last year's final, against the Blues at Eden Park. The Blues this week announced an intent to sell the game out, a prospect that excites McMillan. However, his side faces a gruelling start to the season, with games against the Crusaders (home), Brumbies (home), Drua (away), before hosting the Blues again.</p>
        
            <p>"Awesome, I imagine there'll be a lot of interest in the game so hopefully that comes to fruition…(but) we won't get anything for free in the first six weeks of the competition, I can tell you that now. But that's the way you want it… we'll turn up ready."</p>
