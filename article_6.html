            <p>Keirin world champion cyclist Ellesse Andrews will take a slender advantage into the final night of competition in the UCI Track Champions League in London.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews holds a seven-point advantage in the women's sprint competition after four of five nights of competition, comprising a select invitation field in a series with stops in Mallorca, Berlin, Paris, and London.</p>
        
            <p>The sprint competition involves the individual sprint with qualifying, a three-up semifinal and traditional two-rider head-to-head final, along with a keirin with qualifying and final.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews missed out on qualifying for the sprint final for the first time, but won her way into the keirin final, where she burst clear to take the lead with one and a half laps remaining, only to be pipped on the line by Martha Bayona.</p>
        
            <p>The Colombian finished second to Andrews in the keirin world championship final in Glasgow.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander has 133 points to hold a seven-point advantage over rising German prospect Alessa-Catriona Propster in the overall sprint competition with the second night of racing at the Lee Valley Velodrome in London tomorrow to conclude the league competition.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealander Sam Dakin finished fifth in a gallant effort in a stacked men's keirin final after leading into the final straight following a brave attack a lap and a half out.</p>
        
            <p>He finished fifth overall on points for the sprint competition with teammate Callum Saunders eighth while Emma Cumming was 12th overall from the endurance round, comprising scratch and elimination races.</p>
