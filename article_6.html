            <p>Two New Zealand drivers at opposite ends of the motor racing spectrum will meet up this weekend as the new IndyCars Series gets underway.</p>
        
            <p>Forty-four-year-old Scott Dixon enters his 25th season in the top competition in North America, while 19-year-old Liam Sceats begins what he hopes will be the start of a long career.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon can be considered the current king of IndyCars having won the series six times, second only to AJ Foyt.</p>
        
            <p>His 58 victories is also second to the American legend in race wins.</p>
        
            <p>Despite his impressive career, Dixon is still highly motivated to succeed.</p>
        
            <p>"It sucks to get beat and I hate it," he told IndyCars.</p>
        
            <p>"That is what drives you, you don't really think too much about the championships you won, it's always the ones you lost.</p>
        
            <p>"So the fire burns strong so I'm looking to getting after it for another year."</p>

            <p>It has been a remarkable quarter century since Dixon first entered IndyCars.</p>
        
            <p>In 2000 he started in the second tier competition which is now known as Indy NXT.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-five years ago Sceats wasn't even born.</p>
        
            <p>He will line up in St Petersburg, Florida, this weekend in the support class.</p>
        
            <p>After a promising test with the HDM Motorsports team he was offered a year-long contract as long as he could fund himself... unfortunately, he only has enough money to race the opening round.</p>
        
            <p>"It's tough, my situation is different to the majority of other racing drivers where it is such a battle to even get on the grid, let alone when you're at the race," Sceats told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not the first and won't be the last driver who has to hustle and so to be on the grid this weekend it feels like a win in itself."</p>
        
            <p>Fortunately Sceats, who won the New Zealand Grand Prix in 2024, can see a pathway.</p>
        
            <p>He said knowing that Dixon went through something similar at the start of his career was heartening.</p>
        
            <p>"I take a lot of inspiration from him because he was in my shoes nearly 30 years ago, just a young Kiwi who has a bit of talent and the work ethic and wants to have a crack on the world stage and just needs that opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Sceats will return to Auckland next week to continue the fundraising mission with the hope that he will return to North America soon.</p>
        
            <p>Despite all his success Dixon has never won at the St Petersburg circuit in Florida, but has finished second four times.</p>
        
            <p>That is one of the reasons he still has the hunger to win as he enters his 25th season.</p>
        
            <p>"Racing has always been extremely important for me, it's what drives me every day.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all about winning, that is definitely what makes me get up in the morning and want to go train and train harder and be better for the season."</p>
