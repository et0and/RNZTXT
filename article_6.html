            <p>After taking a year away from the game, Chanel Harris-Tavita feels he's back where he belongs.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old made the call to step away from the NRL in 2023, despite people in his ear urging him not to.</p>
        
            <p>However, Harris-Tavita said he has no regrets, slotting right back into the squad during pre-season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been fun, I've missed the boys, it feels like home, because it is home."</p>
        
            <p>Though it took a while to get his fitness back, the Samoan international's silky skill-set is still as sharp as ever.</p>
        
            <p>"A bit of rust in the lungs. I've had a break but I feel like I didn't lose too much, it's more just learning what the boys have been taught from Webby last year. Getting back into the fundamentals and practicing them over and over so it becomes second nature again. That's been the hardest part."</p>
        
            <p>So immersed in the rugby league life, Harris-Tavita said he opted out to rediscover his love of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"It was more just to get out of the environment and experience what it's like to not be a footy player and thankfully I got to do that and then come back to the into the environment with my mates."</p>

            <p>He said the break put in perspective just how small the rugby league world is.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels like it's everything when you're inside it, but if you take a short trip to Bali, no one's talking about the game on the weekend. They're just living their own life.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's about not getting too consumed by the game when you're in it and it's hard because there's always there's lots of media around it, there's lots of lots of noise, lots of pressure, but if you can just think that it's only your job, it's what you get paid to do, I think that helps you play a bit more consistently and not worry too much about the noise."</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita hopes other players feeling disillusioned with the game will follow his lead.</p>
        
            <p>"If you feel like you need to do it and you have the opportunity, I'd back anyone to do it. I was pretty lucky, I didn't have a partner or kids at the time, so I had no one that relies on me financially. If anyone else was in my position and they did the same thing, I tip my hat to them because I know how hard it was me to make that decision."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were plenty of people trying to convince him to stay.</p>
        
            <p>"They were saying 'hang in there' and 'see you go', but I thought I probably wouldn't get the chance to make that decision again if I resigned for another two years. Now I'm not second guessing, I'm happy. I did it. It's done now and I'm also happy to move on."</p>
        
            <p>Feeling reinvigorated, Harris-Tavita is determined to have a big year.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm mentally prepared. I've had a good preseason under my belt. Physically, I feel good. It's just getting back into the grind."</p>

            <p>With Shaun Johnson, Luke Metcalf, and Temaire Martin all on the books, Harris-Tavita knows it will be a challenge to start in his favoured position.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm trying to be in the team somewhere. Whether it's in the halves or off the bench. Honestly, I'll be happy to be in the team."</p>
        
            <p>He said a win first up against the Sharks this weekend will be crucial in kick starting their campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"Every team is going to start off a little bit rusty, but if we can stick to what we know wins us games, we'll be able to get the result."</p>
