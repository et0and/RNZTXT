            <p>Local runner Michael Voss has won his fourth Rotorua marathon, while Debbie Donald took out the women's race.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Voss and Cullern Thorby served up a classic head-to-head showdown at the 60th anniversary edition of the Red Stag Rotorua Marathon on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>However, Voss put on the after-burners in the final few kilometres to overhaul the 21-year-old Thorby and claim a fourth Rotorua Marathon victory in 2:23:48.</p>
        
            <p>Voss, who claimed a sixth successive Rotorua Marathon podium and added to his victories in 2020, 2021 and 2022, said: "This Rotorua Marathon victory is the one I enjoyed the most. I love having a battle, Cullern was so strong."</p>
        
            <p>"I tried to take Cullern at 30km and I opened up a lead. Then he came back, and we kept taking turns at the front. He then got a little bit of a gap, and I thought he had me. I almost settled for second, but my workmates kept me going and then I gave it everything at the end."</p>
        
            <p>Debbie Donald of Athletics Masterton claimed an emphatic victory in the women's marathon to retain her national title in a time of 2:46:30.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old mum-of-three forged ahead of Lydia O'Donnell before 10km and marched on to top spot just seven weeks after recording a lifetime best of 2:40:39 in the Nagoya Marathon in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>"I only [made] a last-minute decision to come here," said Donald.</p>
        
            <p>"After Nagoya I competed over the half marathon in Christchurch, where I finished fourth, and although the time was good my legs felt a bit off.</p>
        
            <p>"I hadn't done any long runs leading into today and my legs felt a bit zapped by 32km. But I knew the championship was on the line, and I'm pinching myself now."</p>
        
            <p>After taking the lead she told herself not to look back and was rewarded with the race win.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew Lydia was a gun runner and she has fast legs too. I just had to keep going. It was so beautiful running around Lake Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>"To win the New Zealand title again is so surreal. I hope to come back next year and win a third New Zealand title."</p>
        
            <p>On a sun-bathed day in Rotorua, the event attracted more than 5100 runners, among them 100-year-old Colin Thorne, who completed the 5.5km in 1:11:24 alongside his daughter Pauline Dinsdale.</p>
