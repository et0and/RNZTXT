            <p>'The Last Stylebender' is back.</p>
        
            <p>One of the greatest middleweights of all time, Israel Adesanya's next bout will have a slightly different feel, with no gold on the line, a first for the Kiwi in seven years.</p>

            <p>Live blog updates on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>Israel Adesanya</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya is at a career crossroads.</p>
        
            <p>The former UFC middleweight king is in unfamiliar territory not only fighting in the Saudi heat but on a non-pay-per-view card for the first time in seven years.</p>
        
            <p>On a two-fight skid, Adesanya is out to remind the world that he is one of the greatest mixed martial artists alive. No longer chasing belts or legacy, Adesanya said he simply wants to show just how good he can be as a true all-around mixed martial artist.</p>
        
            <p>A kickboxer who almost exclusively fights on the feet, Adesanya said he is also a competent wrestler and can nullify a takedown as well as pose a submission threat on the mat.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya has 16 knockouts in his 24 career wins, notably, his victims include current light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira. He has been submitted just once, which came via face crank in his last fight against champion Dricus Du Plessis.</p>
        
            <p>Nassourdine Imavov</p>
        
            <p>There is little to lose here for the Russian-born Frenchman.</p>
        
            <p>However, if he wins, he adds one of the game's greatest to his list of victims. Imavov has endured some rough luck during his run to date, an accidental head clash resulting in a no-contest in his clash against Chris Curtis, and dropping a decision to former champion Sean Strickland who replaced original opponent Kelvin Gastelum at short notice.</p>
        
            <p>However, he has bounced back. Though born in Dagestan, Imavov moved to France when he was nine, and didn't take the traditional Russian wrestling route, opting to take up boxing in his new country. He has six knockouts to his name and is yet to be knocked out himself inside the octagon.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya has only fought for gold since 2018. His last two fights saw him lose the belt and then fail to reclaim it against Strickland and Du Plessis respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Both fights had incredibly tense feuds in the lead-up, and it could be argued this somewhat clouded Adesanya's typically cerebral and meticulous style. Strickland essentially walked him down for five rounds in Sydney, knocking down the champion in the first before suffocating him with his relentless pace.</p>
        
            <p>Du Plessis on the other hand has been a puzzle no middleweight in the UFC has been able to solve, and Adesanya proved no different, forced to tap in the fourth after showing glimpses of the striking IQ that took him to the top.</p>
        
            <p>Imavov is unbeaten in his last four walks to the octagon, and though one finished in controversial fashion, he went on to get his hand raised in the next three, including a knockout of Jared Cannonier, a man Adesanya defeated by decision, in round four of July last year.</p>
        
            <p>He backed this performance up just three months later, picking up a majority decision over the highly touted Brendan Allen, ending the American's seven-fight winning streak.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen his fights. I know he's dangerous. I know he's slick. I like his styles go. It's not bad footwork. He's dangerous. Well-rounded. I feel like the old dog, there's the young guys coming up and it's my job to send them back down and let them know, I'm still here." - Adesanya.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he is going to come very focuses, and very hungary. And I hope he is going to be in the best shape so I can beat the best Israel Adesanya." - Imavov.</p>
        
            <p>Expect a world-class striking exhibition between a wily veteran and a hungry young gun. Adesanya will look to use his reach advantage to maintain distance and pick Imavov apart from the outside.</p>
        
            <p>The Nigerian-born Kiwi may look to unleash some frustration that has no doubt built up in the wake of his slide down the ranks, which could spell trouble for Imavov who has never been finished.</p>
        
            <p>With his experience and current mindset, Adesanya should out-class his opponent, and begin his journey back to title contention.</p>
        
            <p>Prediction - Adesanya by unanimous decision.</p>
        
            <p>A co-main event with serious middleweight implications, Shara Magomedov versus Michael 'Venom' Page is sure to be a barnburner.</p>
        
            <p>Magomedov pulled off one of the most stunning knockouts in history with a double-spinning back fist and is regarded as one of the wildest and most unpredictable fighters on the roster.</p>
        
            <p>Page meanwhile recently moved over from Bellator where he was a human highlight reel, often drawing comparisons to the legendary Anderson Silva.</p>
        
            <p>However, his UFC run has been largely unspectacular to date. Also, plenty of fireworks can be expected when the big boys enter the cage to stand and bang.</p>
        
            <p>Sergei Pavlovich went on an absolute tear through the heavyweight division before he was promptly halted by interim champion Tom Aspinall. Jairzinho Rozenstruik also possesses plenty of punching power and won't be looking to go deep against the Russian.</p>
