            <p>In front of a capacity Go Media Mt Smart Stadium crowd, Auckland FC have triumphed over arch-rivals Wellington Phoenix 2-1 in a frenetic, action-packed match at Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The win extends their unbeaten run in their maiden A-League season to six matches, and they maintain their competition lead, with the Phoenix slipping to fifth, with their second loss, with the first also inflicted by the Aucklanders.</p>
        
            <p>The win, before 26,253 boisterous fans, came after they led 1-0 halftime courtesy of a Isaac Hughes own goal. They went further ahead in the 70th minute with Nando Pijnaker headed in a free kick from Hiroki Sakai.</p>
        
            <p>Sakai had had a role in the earlier own goal, whipping in a cross that got Hughes in a tangle as he booted the ball past goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi.</p>

            <p>Auckland's goalie Alex Paulsen had pulled off some impressive saves, twice going down injured, with one of them from a challenge that saw Phoenix veteran Kosta Barbarouses booked.</p>
        
            <p>But it was Barbarouses who gave the Phoenix a chance to get back in the game, banging in a goal in the 82nd minute, the first that Paulsen and Auckland FC have conceded this season.</p>
        
            <p>That paved the way for a frantic finish, with Phoenix throwing everything at claiming an equaliser but Auckland FC managed to keep their goal intact during the six extra minutes.</p>

            <p>Auckland FC defender Tommy Smith was delighted with the win and the crowd atmosphere, terming his side's supporters The Port their "12th man".</p>
        
            <p>"We want this rivalry to be a big one - and it's going the right way,'' he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew they would come out and try and get revenge for the game at their place. They gave us a real good game and I think they were much improved on the game before, but we clung on for the win and that's the main thing."</p>
