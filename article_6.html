        <h2>Who will be the next Warriors captain?</h2>
        <p>
The front-row powerhouse seems a natural choice, but there's just one problem.
</p>
        
            <p>NZ Kiwis skipper James Fisher-Harris simply oozes mana, whenever he enters a room. Just ask his coach.</p>
        
            <p>Therein lies the dilemma for NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster in his search for a new captain for the coming NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>"He sets the example the minute he walks in the door," observed Webster, who has lost incumbent Tohu Harris to injury and retirement on the eve of the 2025 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"He does it with his actions. When he speaks, everyone listens, but his actions are his most important thing.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everyone's intensity increases around him and he's certainly done that since he's been here."</p>
        
            <p>The Far North front-rower brings a championship pedigree with four-time defending premiers Penrith Panthers, where he worked previously with Webster, and also inspired his national team to a recordbreaking victory over Australia at the 2023 Pacific Championships.</p>
        
            <p>Replacing departed prop Addin Fonua-Blake, who often stood in for Harris as captain, Fisher-Harris is a natural born leader and would be a great choice for the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>There's just one problem.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit of a touchy one, because I'm still learning how to be a Warrior," he explained. "I don't want to come in here and get that straight away - I want to earn it.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, I feel like I'm ready, so it's up to the playing group and up to the coaches… whatever's best for the team really.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be pretty special, but it's whatever is best for the team."</p>
        
            <p>He admits feeling pressure already, as the club's big off-season signing, but is ready to embrace that.</p>

            <p>"I'm a front-rower, I don't have to make big decisions and that, so I'll just do my job," said Fisher-Harris, 29. "Webby's told me, 'Just do you', so it's pretty simple.</p>
        
            <p>"If I look back at the start of my career, I'm pretty surprised at how far I've come, but I'm just trying to get better each and every day."</p>
        
            <p>Harris' departure so soon after his arrival - and the retirement of veteran half Shaun Johnson - has changed the dynamic within the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It was quite a surprise for me, but I think the boys knew he was struggling with his injury," said Fisher-Harris. "SJ and now Tohu… but I look around and we've got all we need, and we're fully embracing it."</p>
        
            <p>The captaincy change is a major setback to Webster, as he tries to resurrect his team from a disappointing 13th finish in the 2024 competition, but it provides an opportunity for others to grow into the void.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big blow, but NRL doesn't stop for anyone," he said. "I think it's important to celebrate Tohu and what he's down for the game, and what he's done for us as a club, through his captaincy and the way he plays, but then it's 'what's next'.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't just replace a Tohu overnight, they're just not out there, so we're going to miss him."</p>
        
            <p>Webster insists there's no need to rush the decision, but it will be made before the opening round.</p>

            <p>"We're just going through the process of who wants it and how they display that every day at training," he said. "It's not just on the field, captaincy has a lot of things off the field as well."</p>
        
            <p>A short-list of candidates isn't that short, with several boasting previous captaincy experience or playing credentials for the role. Here's a few options:</p>
        
            <p>James Fisher-Harris - Leads his country and has developed his own leadership style as a senior player within the powerhouse Panthers dynasty.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Barnett - Captained the Warriors during Harris' frequent injury absences in 2024 and led by example, with form that saw him debut for New South Wales and the Kangaroos.</p>
        
            <p>Roger Tuivasa-Sheck - A former Warriors captain, before switching codes to represent the All Blacks. Still trying to perfect his craft as a centre, but a return to his natural fullback spot might strengthen his claims.</p>
        
            <p>Dallin Watene-Zelezniak - A former Kiwis captain, but entering the final year of his Warriors contract.</p>
        
            <p>Wayde Egan - Has captained the Warriors on occasion, a club centurion and, like Fisher-Harris and Barnett, contracted through 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Dylan Walker - Has also captained the Warriors, and amassed more than 200 first-grade games across South Sydney Rabbitohs, Manly Sea Eagles and Warriors, while also representing New South Wales and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Kurt Capewell - No specific captaincy experience, but another with extensive representative background at Origin, and championship pedigree with Penrith.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're very lucky that we have a lot of candidates and a lot of people willing to do it as well," said Webster. "That's why we don't have to rush into it... we'll take our time."</p>
