            <p>Pakistan ended their campaign in the home Champions Trophy without a win after rain washed out their dead rubber against Bangladesh at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The Group A match between the two eliminated sides was of little consequence and steady drizzle poured cold water on defending champions Pakistan's hopes of a consolation victory.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's Group B fixture between Australia and South Africa at the same venue was also abandoned without a ball being bowled because of rain.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a forgettable campaign for Mohammad Rizwan-led Pakistan in the first global tournament to be staged in the country since 1996 and their six-wicket defeat by arch-rivals India will particularly hurt.</p>
        
            <p>"The expectations are very high. We didn't perform well and it is disappointing for us," Rizwan said.</p>
        
            <p>"We made mistakes in the last few games. Hopefully, we can learn from these. We are next going to New Zealand and hopefully we can perform there."</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh also finished their winless campaign with a point.</p>
        
            <p>"We really wanted to play this match, but can't do anything about the weather," Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said.</p>
        
            <p>He drew positives from the display of their pace trio Nahid Rana, Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman.</p>
        
            <p>"We have always struggled with our fast bowling unit, but in the last few years a lot of fast bowlers are coming through," Shanto said.</p>
        
            <p>"The likes of Taskin and Rana coming in and 'Fizz' is there. We have a very good bowling attack."</p>
        
            <p>India and New Zealand, who meet in an inconsequential group match in Dubai on Sunday, have secured semi-final places from Group A.</p>
