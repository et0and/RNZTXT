            <p>Former national 400m champion Camryn Smart has made a remarkable return from injury and is following in the footsteps of Olympic mum, Toni Hodgkinson.</p>
        
            <p>Smart finished second at the Pacific Games in Solomon Islands two days ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I am pretty proud, and I am just happy to be back running. To take a silver back home is just an added bonus," Smart said.</p>
        
            <p>She was aware that she was sitting in medal contention before her race but, "I knew it was going to be tough especially racing against Ellie."</p>
        
            <p>That is Ellie Beer, the Australian who took out the competition with a time of 52.67 seconds.</p>

            <p>"I knew there was going to be a good chance of me medalling, so I went all out for it".</p>
        
            <p>Smart crossed the line second in a time of 55.30 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The former national champion missed out on her track and field season last year after carrying a hip injury.</p>
        
            <p>Smart said her main goal was to get a couple races in before the New Zealand domestic athletics season starts in January, "so the Pacific games was a really cool place to start."</p>
        
            <p>She had managed only one practice 400m run before departing for the games so she "didn't have super high expectations. I just wanted to race."</p>
        
            <p>Born into a talented track and field family, Smart's mother, Toni Hodgkinson is an 800m runner who represented New Zealand at both the Atlanta 1960 and Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>Hodgkinson also competed in the Auckland 1990 and Kuala Lumpur 1998 Commonwealth games.</p>

            <p>"Learning from her experiences has been really good. She just gets it." says Smart.</p>
        
            <p>"She always makes me feel better about a race and she hypes me up."</p>
        
            <p>Before leaving to the Pacific games, her mum told her to, "go have fun and remember what it's like to be back out there."</p>
        
            <p>Hodgkinson said, "I thought her performance was solid. I think that she can be happy with a silver. It's been a wee while since she's been in a big competition."</p>
        
            <p>Camryn's father, Alistar Smart is also a former national 400m hurdler and decathlete.</p>
        
            <p>Smart chuckles and says, "Dad has been timing me on the TV with his stopwatch whilst I've been over here."</p>
        
            <p>She is now based in Auckland with Bays Athletics Club, but when Smart is back home in Nelson, her parents help with her training.</p>
        
            <p>"Dad will be timing and Mum will join me for 300 metre reps or anything longer.</p>
        
            <p>"Mum can't quite keep up with the sprints but she will get me with the long-distance runs. She's still got it."</p>
        
            <p>Hodgkinson says, "it's been lovely helping her with the longer reps as I have more experience over those."</p>
        
            <p>Smart said there was a possibility of her going up to the 800 metres. Until then she wants to focus on getting faster over the 400 metre.</p>
        
            <p>Hodgkinson thinks it will be a good event for Camryn to tackle so she can develop her strength and speed endurance.</p>

            <p>Smart also has big aspirations of following her mother's footsteps of representing New Zealand on the Olympic stage as well.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy that she is involved in athletics", Hodgkinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been lovely for us to reconnect with athletics, and we get to enjoy Camryn's journey as well."</p>
        
            <p>The focus for the kiwi runner now is preparing for her domestic season opener next year in January at the Potts Classic, Hawkes Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"I still feel like I am learning to race, and it will take a couple more competitions for me to get back to my old form that I was in before I was injured."</p>
        
            <p>That form secured her a senior gold medal and lifetime best of 53.98 seconds at the 2021 New Zealand track and field championships.</p>
        
            <p>She credits her current coach Matthew Wyatt, a former long jump champion, who has told her to be "patient" with the process.</p>
        
            <p>"He said it will come back once I'm out there. It will click eventually".</p>
        
            <p>And her own advice as a 22-year-old for young kids who want to get into athletics? "Like Mum said, it's all about having fun. If you're not having fun what's the point?"</p>
