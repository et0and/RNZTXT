            <p>The Black Caps have missed the chance to secure a series whitewash against Pakistan after slipping to a 42-run defeat at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan set a target of 135 for New Zealand in their innings.</p>
        
            <p>However, after initially appearing to be on track to beat that, the Black Caps lost several wickets in quick succession to finish on 92 from 17 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan's 134/8 is the lowest 20-over total any team successfully defended in men's T20s in New Zealand. The previous lowest was 156/6 by Australia in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>It's also only the second time that New Zealand has been bowled for less than 100 in men's T20s on home turf.</p>
        
            <p>The previous time that occurred was in 2010 when they were bowled out for 80, also against Pakistan in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Iftikhar Ahmed was awarded the player of the match honour after taking 3-24.</p>
        
            <p>"I read the wicket and bowled accordingly, wicket was turning so I tried to bowl wicket by wicket," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes it was decided that I will bowl today, Shaheen [Shah Afridi] told me before the game and I was preparing for it. If the captain wants, I am available to bowl as I have done before."</p>
        
            <p>Mohammad Nawaz and Usama Mir both took two wickets apiece.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand win the series four games to one.</p>
