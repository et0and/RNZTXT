            <p>Kiwis Tom Walsh and Jacko Gill have qualified for the men's shot put final at the Stade de France this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Gill threw 21.35m on his second attempt to progress; Walsh went one better with a throw of 21.48m.</p>
        
            <p>By way of comparison, American world record holder Ryan Crouser won the World Indoor Championships in March with a throw of 22.77m. Walsh won silver in that event.</p>
        
            <p>Rico Bearman finished 11th overall in the men's BMX racing event semifinals and will not progress to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Kiwi trampolinist Dylan Schmidt finished out of the medals after a tumble during his routine at the Bercy Arena in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt who was eighth set himself up well through qualifying but lost his line and fell off the trampoline in his final jump.</p>
        
            <p>Sailors Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie have claimed a silver medal in the men's 49er skiff, taking New Zealand's medal total to six.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa's fastest-ever female 100m sprinter Zoe Hobbs made her Olympic Games debut at the heats on Friday night, coming second to advance to the next round.</p>
