        <p>
He suggested their seven-match unbeaten streak had gone to the players' heads.

            <p>Auckland FC coach Steve Corica has accused his players of complacency after crashing to the first defeat of their maiden A-league season, humbled 4-0 at home by Western United.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Knights remain top of the table but only one point ahead of Adelaide United after a major reality check.</p>
        
            <p>Corica conceded his team were outplayed from the opening whistle and found themselves 3-0 down inside the opening 34 minutes after conceding goals to Riku Danzaki (penalty), Noah Botic and Hiroshi Ibusuki.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors bagged a fourth in the dying stages through Matthew Grimaldi to seal a deserved win but an irritated Corica said the damage was done early, when his team failed to match Western United's desire.</p>
        
            <p>He suggested their seven-match unbeaten streak had gone to the players' heads.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe a little bit of complacency settled in there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They think that they don't have to do the basic work that we expect from them. And yeah, if you're going to do that against a good team, they're going to punish you.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just off. It wasn't one or two players off, it was basically the whole team.</p>
        
            <p>"The first half was terrible, let's face it. The boys didn't turn up for the first half and you can't allow a good team like that moments in games.</p>
        
            <p>"And we didn't compete, we didn't win the second ball, and that's what got us in trouble in the first place. It was a long way back from 3-0 down at halftime."</p>

            <p>Auckland remain top of the standings by one point from Adelaide United but Corica said vastly better would be needed when they face Central Coast Mariners in Gosford on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Corica suggested there would be changes for that game.</p>
        
            <p>He moved captain Hiroki Sakai from right back to centre back to replace the injured central defender Dan Hall, but hinted it was a switch that didn't work.</p>
        
            <p>"Any change like that is going to take away from the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something we'll need to look at next week, whether we continue that way or whether we make changes. I'm sure there will be a few changes."</p>
        
            <p>Corica pleaded with Auckland FC fans not to lose faith in his side after building a tidal wave of support through the early rounds, comprising six straight wins followed by a draw.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a good start. We didn't want it (first loss) this week, and especially at home as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fans showed up to support us and they were amazing through the whole game. But, you know, we disappointed them in the first half and that's disappointing from my side of things as well, that we actually did that because when you're on a good run, good momentum, you want to make the most of it.</p>
        
            <p>"Little things like that can turn sour and that's a sour taste in my mouth actually today."</p>
