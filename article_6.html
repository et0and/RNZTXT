            <p>World Rowing plans to introduce a mixed boat category for upcoming major championships.</p>
        
            <p>The plan was discussed at a recent World Rowing Quadrennial Congress with the idea that it could be a part of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>World Rowing made a proposal to its 160 Member Federations to introduce a mixed boat category in the Olympic and World Championship event programmes.</p>
        
            <p>The Mixed Eight would be in addition to traditional eight boat class.</p>
        
            <p>World Rowing said in a statement it was positioning the new event as a strong contender for inclusion in the next Olympic Games, reinforcing its commitment to gender balance and innovation in the sport.</p>
        
            <p>The Mixed Eight will be officially introduced at the 2025 World Rowing Championships in Shanghai, China, after being offered as a test race at both World Rowing Cups in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes represent a significant evolution in Classic Rowing," said Jean-Christophe Rolland, World Rowing President.</p>
        
            <p>"By updating the progression system and introducing a mixed eight event, we are ensuring that our sport remains relevant and competitive, while also making it more exciting and accessible to fans around the world."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has a long tradition in Olympic rowing with 29 medals including 14 gold medals.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has won two gold medals in men's eight and a silver in the women's eight.</p>
