            <p>The Breakers showed signs of improvement, but late jitters cost them dearly in a 92-84 loss to the Sydney Kings as they crashed to a seventh-straight NBL defeat.</p>
        
            <p>In front of a large home crowd in Auckland, the Breakers looked set to end their run of miserable form as they led by eight points early in the final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>They were still up by five with less than three minutes on the clock, before the Kings went on a 16-3 run to cement their third placing on the standings, while the Breakers remained second-last in the 10-team league.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright scored a team-high 25 points, mixing it with eight assists as his energy drove their offence.</p>

            <p>Athletic teenage forward Karim Lopez produced 18 points, while towering centre Tacko Fall showed signs he is settling into the Breakers' methods, with 15 points and nine rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers found it hard to contain Sydney forward Kouat Noi, who shot 10 from 14 from the field in his game-high 26 points.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers coach Petteri Koponen said it was tough to take another loss despite an improvement across the court.</p>
        
            <p>"We lost our poise in the last few minutes and it was just the small details in the end, but we gave them a fight tonight," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The guys feel it and you can see it in the locker room - this one hurts. We were close.</p>
        
            <p>"We played much better but Sydney found the talent in the end. Overall, I'm proud of these guys. We keep competing, fighting and getting better."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers are away from home for their next game, a Christmas Day clash with the Tasmania JackJumpers on Wednesday.</p>
