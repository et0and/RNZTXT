            <p>Kiwi triathlete Ainsley Thorpe succumbed to the slippery surface during her race in Paris, which ultimately cost her a shot at a podium finish.</p>
        
            <p>Thorpe crashed on the cobblestones part way through the cycle leg, sending her to the back of he field and crushing her Olympic dream.</p>
        
            <p>It would be a local to claim the race, Cassandre Beaugard storming home during the run to win gold.</p>
        
            <p>Beaugard was caught in a quartet in the final stretches, before she powered clear to get home in one hour 54 minutes and 55 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi Nicole Van der Kaay finished in 31st, six minutes and 39 seconds behind with Thorpe crossing in 44th nine minutes back.</p>
        
            <p>Thorpe suffered a nasty scrape on her arm and she was one of about three or four athletes to go down in the collision.</p>
        
            <p>Many athletes struggled on the wet terrain, numerous crashes coming from the bikes.</p>
        
            <p>Defending champion Flora Duffy from Bermuda, made a strong start in the Seine, emerging from the water eight seconds in front.</p>
        
            <p>However, her lead was quickly whittled away as the Netherland's Maya Kingma overtook Duffy on the back end of the second leg.</p>
        
            <p>World champion Beth Potter was right in touch and made up ground on the run, which soon saw four front runners emerge.</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland's Julie Derron took the lead, followed by Beaugard, Potter and Emma Lombardi, the leading quartet with a 10-second gap.</p>
        
            <p>Derron held the front heading into the final 2500m, but Beaugard pulled ahead with one lap to go, followed by Derron, Pooter and Lombardi.</p>
        
            <p>Van der Kaay admitted she had a bit of an average start.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know where I was until I came out of the water, and all of a sudden I see I wasn't too far off the front group, and I was around good enough girls, so I was really happy with that. I really tried to hang in there for the second lap and play it smart."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had a few gnarly crashes in her time, so played the bike on the cautious side.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been practising cornering a lot with my squad, so that has helped a lot.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately there was a crash right in front of me, I do hope those athletes are all right. But I'm really disappointed with how I finished that race."</p>
        
            <p>Van der Kaay said the atmosphere in Paris was "unreal".</p>
        
            <p>"I've experienced nothing like it. It was good to get a little preview for mixed relay. I really hope I can bring it home on the relay."</p>
