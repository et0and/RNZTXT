            <p>The Football Ferns have been beaten 1-0 by Colombia in their second friendly in Bogota, their final match of the year.</p>
        
            <p>It follows their 0-0 draw at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Colombians had the better of the game and were worthy winners.</p>
        
            <p>The homeside grabbed the only goal in the 71st minute when New Zealand failed to clear properly from a corner and a long range shot from Daniela Montoya beat the defence.</p>
        
            <p>Katie Bowen, filling in as captain with Rebekah Stott out ill and Ali Riley out injured, made her 100th appearance for the Football Ferns.</p>

            <p>There was just one change to the starting eleven with Kate Taylor replacing late withdrawal Stott, while Ruby Nathan made her debut in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>The match was played behind closed doors at the request of the Colombian Football Federation.</p>
        
            <p>Much like the first game, Colombia created more chances and had multiple scoring opportunities, though the Football Ferns defended doggedly.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand again failed to score, which will be of concern for coach Jitka Klimkova.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns now turn their attention to qualifying for the Paris 2024 Olympics with an Oceania qualifying tournament scheduled for Samoa in February.</p>
        
            <p>The winner of the eight team tournament will qualify for the Games.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns finish 2023 with two wins from 16 games having scored just five goals.</p>
