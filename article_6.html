            <p>The All Blacks Sevens are into the quarter-finals after making winning start to their Olympic campaign with victories over Japan and South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>They overwhelmed Japan 40 -12 in game one.</p>
        
            <p>Akuila Rokolisoa opened the scoring in the first minute with a try which he converted himself and he would add another try to his tally in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Fehi Fineanganofo scored back to back tries in the first half, while Ngarohi McGarvey-Black also dotted down for two five pointers.</p>

            <p>They had a much tougher battle against South Africa, taking the match 17-5. Their final group match is against Ireland at Stade de France early on Friday morning NZ time.</p>
        
            <p>"South Africa is a good outfit and we had to fight for that one. It makes our mindset a hell of a lot easier tomorrow and we have just got to build on what we have already established," Moses Leo told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Tomasi Cama was impressed with his side's first up effort against Japan but conceded it was tough against South Africa with New Zealand suffering a couple of concerning injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the game though. It's chaos and you've just got to deal with each moment....there was a few dings out there to the boys but we managed to close it out. So very pleased with the day."</p>
