            <p>Interim Football Ferns coach Michael Mayne continues to explore the depth of talent available to play for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Two players have been called up to potentially make their debut against world number 42 Chinese Taipei next month.</p>
        
            <p>Adelaide United goalkeeper Claudia Jenkins, who has started every game this season for her club in the A-League Women, and University of Denver goalkeeper Alina Santos, have both been selected for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>The squad also sees C.S. Marítimo's Jana Radosavljević and Lexington SC's Grace Wisnewski called up after missing out on the last tour.</p>
        
            <p>The changes to the squad that faced Costa Rica reflect a continued drive to examine more players in the Football Ferns team environment to build depth across the pitch ahead of the next FIFA Women's World Cup cycle, New Zealand Football said.</p>
        
            <p>Mackenzie Barry, Geo Candy, Brianna Edwards, Macey Fraser, and Grace Jale, who were part of the squad assembled for the win and draw against Costa Rica last month, haven't been selected for this tour due to injury, managing playing time after returning from injury, and a desire to test other players.</p>
        
            <p>"I was pleased with the progress we made in Costa Rica, which involved implementing a new playing model on the pitch, and some new language and some different approaches off the pitch, so I'm very much looking to continuing that work next month," Mayne said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to approach this tour with a drive towards refining some of the details within our system, and with a training game behind closed doors first, it gives us the perfect opportunity to try a couple of new things as we prepare for the full international.</p>
        
            <p>"Our objective remains the same and that is to assess the strength of our squad, and build the competition within this team, so that come the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027, should we qualify, we are in the best place to perform."</p>
        
            <p>Mayne said after Costa Rica he felt "a reasonable amount of consistency was important".</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns will face the Blue Magpies on 8 April at Kaohsiung Nanzih Football Stadium in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.</p>
        
            <p>The sides will also face-off in a behind closed doors training game three days earlier.</p>
