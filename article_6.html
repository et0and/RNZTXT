            <p>Auckland power-hitter Bevon Jacobs has earned a maiden Black Caps callup, for the Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka beginning this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs completed a memorable month with his inclusion in the 13-man squad for the three-match series starting at Mount Maunganui's Bay Oval on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket also named a 13-strong group for three ODIs against the Sri Lankans in early January.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams are led by new white ball skipper Mitchell Santner, who was named in that role fulltime last week.</p>

            <p>Luke Ronchi will be the head coach for both series, with regular coach Gary Stead taking a break "off the back of an extensive period of cricket for the team", according to a New Zealand Cricket statement.</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson and Devon Conway were unavailable for selection due to their commitments in the South Africa SA20 competition.</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowers Ben Sears (knee) and Kyle Jamieson (back) weren't considered for selection as they continue their rehabilitation from injury.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs' powerful shot-making has made an impression since he burst on the scene in last summer's domestic T20 Super Smash and he has continued that form in all formats this season for Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old's name was a surprise entry in last month's Indian Premier League player auction and he made headlines when picked up by the Mumbai Indians for the minimum base price of $60,000.</p>

            <p>New Zealand selector Sam Wells said Jacobs' international promotion was warranted.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously an exciting time for Bevon and his family," Wells said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a promising player with a lot of talent and we're looking forward to exposing him to international cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"He's clearly got a lot of power with the bat, but he's also shown in the longer formats that he has a decent technique and temperament."</p>
        
            <p>The T20 series hands a first chance for Zac Foulkes, Mitch Hay and Tim Robinson to represent the Black Caps on home soil after the trio made their international debuts overseas earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury wicketkeeper-batter Hay has won inclusion in both squads after impressing on last month's tour to Sri Lanka, where the 24-year-old claimed a men's T20I record for the most dismissals in an innings (six) in Dambulla before scoring 49 with the bat in Pallekelle.</p>
        
            <p>Hay will keep in the T20I series and has been selected as batting and keeping cover for the ODI series behind incumbent Tom Latham.</p>

            <p>Jacobs, Foulkes and Robinson will make way from the T20 squad for Latham, Will O'Rourke and Will Young, who will contest the ODI series only.</p>
        
            <p>Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell and Matt Henry all return to both white-ball squads, having missed last month's trip to Sri Lanka to prepare for the England test series.</p>
        
            <p>The ODI series will be New Zealand's last before a 15-player squad is selected for the February's Champions Trophy tournament in February.</p>
        
            <p>Wells said the squads represented a mix of fresh new talent alongside some proven internationals.</p>
        
            <p>"As with the squads that recently toured Sri Lanka, we're keen to keep exposing new talent to the big stage and it's nice to have an experienced core of players around them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Champions Trophy, like all ICC pinnacle events, is an obvious incentive for players and I know many will be keen to put their best foot forward in the ODI series to be in the frame for selection."</p>
