            <p>Sam Sutton looms as a key figure in the Phoenix's finals run.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix head into their finals series in second spot on the A-League ladder following a dramatic conclusion to the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix's fate was decided Wednesday night as minor premiers Central Coast Mariners defeated Adelaide 2-0 to claim top spot.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix fulback Sam Sutton said it was a painful watch for the side seeing the minor premiership slip away.</p>
        
            <p>The team was gathered on Courtenay Place watching the game together and obviously not the result they were after but as Sutton said it has only fired them up more ahead of the finals.</p>
        
            <p>"Gutted at the result but it happens. Obviously after that first goal went in, it was definitely a rough moment but there's there's still heaps to play for so we've forgotten about that. We've had a good regular season and now we're moving into the finals with confidence and we're raring to go."</p>
        
            <p>The team will enjoy a week off due to finishing second but Sutton said it will not stall their momentum.</p>

            <p>"That result has pumped us up even more, now we're just looking forward to that semi-final, whoever we come up against, we're going to be ready and we've come into training and worked really hard. The boys are in good spirits."</p>
        
            <p>In terms of a preferred opponent, he said they do not fear anyone so it did not matter who they faced.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously each team brings different things. They've all got their pros. They've all got their cons."</p>
        
            <p>It will be a bit of a wait for the Phoenix, with their first-leg away on 12 May, before returning home the following week.</p>
        
            <p>"Chiefy is going to set up tactically and then we'll match and see what we can do against them and obviously be wary of all the threats but we don't fear anyone and that just comes down to ourselves and the belief we have in the group."</p>
        
            <p>He said the recent support they have had at home had been a driving force.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gonna be a big weekend, hopefully get a big crowd. So just exciting times, the last last games at home were immense and so special to be a part of."</p>
        
            <p>Sutton said a maiden title was their primary focus.</p>
        
            <p>"We can go all the way, it's obviously up to us how much we want it, and if we can stick to that and stick to the way we play and stick to our values, then there's no reason we can't do it."</p>
        
            <p>This weekend, the Elimination Finals are played with third seeds Melbourne Victory playing sixth seeds Melbourne City and fourth seeds Sydney FC playing fifth seeds Macarthur FC.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will then play the highest placed Elimination Final winner in a home and away series and the Mariners will play the lowest place Elimination Final winner.</p>
