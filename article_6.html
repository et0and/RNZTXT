            <p>One of the Black Sticks' most enduring players, Olivia Merry, has announced her international retirement, saying she ''poured her heart and soul into the black shirt".</p>
        
            <p>Merry, 32, scored 128 goals in 284 matches in an international career which began against India in 2012. She holds the record for most goals by a New Zealand women's player and is second behind long-time teammate Stacey Michelsen (296) for number of international caps.</p>
        
            <p>Merry represented New Zealand at two Olympic Games, in Rio and Tokyo, and was part of the 2018 Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning side, also winning bronze in 2014 in Glasgow.</p>
        
            <p>Merry's retirement comes three months after the Black Sticks women failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>She described her career as a journey of dedication, passion, and perseverance.</p>
        
            <p>"From the early days of training with some of my idols, to competing at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, I've poured my heart and soul into the black shirt. As with any journey there are always challenges and setbacks, but also amazing wins and highs, which I believe has moulded me into the person I am today."</p>

            <p>Merry was a fearsome player in the circle and was the leading scorer for the first four seasons of the FIH Pro League. She was nominated for the world player of the year title in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, she was New Zealand's co-captain at both the Commonwealth Games and the World Cup, at which the Black Caps finished fifth, equalling their best result at a World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Merry was ''an absolute legend of the game", Black Sticks co-captain Megan Hull said.</p>
        
            <p>"She is the epitome of what it means to be a Black Stick, and anyone who has had the privilege of playing with her, against her, or meeting her is better for it. She has given everything to the shirt and inspired us all to be better every day."</p>
        
            <p>Hockey New Zealand's high-performance general manager Darren Smith, who coached Merry in 2022, said she was a fierce competitor who gave her all to the team.</p>
        
            <p>Merry said after a long career she was looking forward to spending more time with her friends and family, giving back to her job outside hockey and hopefully reducing her golf handicap.</p>
        
            <p>"As I retire, I will always carry with me the memories and lifelong friendships made. I am proud of the legacy I leave behind in the world of hockey - all I hope is that I left the black shirt in a better place."</p>
