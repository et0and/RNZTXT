            <p>The World Champion Black Ferns host Canada in their second test match of the Pacific Four Series in one of the most compelling games of the series.</p>
        
            <p>A win for the visitors in Christchurch would move them above New Zealand in the rankings, while the Black Ferns could close the gap with No. 1 ranked England with a victory.</p>
        
            <p>The third-ranked Canadian women come in on a high after dispatching the Wallaroos in Sydney last weekend, while also securing their spot in the WXV tournament later this year, which they will host in Vancouver.</p>
        
            <p>Canada's forwards dominated Australia in their 33-14 win which moved them above France into third place in the World Rankings.</p>
        
            <p>All five Canadian tries came from the front row as the Wallaroos failed to contain the visitors' deadly driving maul.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns were largely untested as they brushed aside the USA in a 57-5 demolition in their series opener in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand scored nine tries to one in a commanding win to open their series title defence.</p>
        
            <p>Mererangi Paul scored a hat-trick in the first 16 minutes in an explosive performance to set New Zealand on the path to a comfortable win.</p>
        
            <p>Paul, in her first start at full-back after five matches on the wing, made 16 carries, 131 run metres, four clean breaks, three offloads and clinched two try-saving tackles.</p>
        
            <p>A trio of exciting new Black Fern rookies handled the pressure on debut.</p>

            <p>Starting second rower and former volleyball international Maama Mo'onia Vaipulu notched up her first international try as she powered over from close range.</p>
        
            <p>First-five Hannah King debuted off the bench, slotting three conversions.</p>
        
            <p>And Maia Joseph, who has put her medical studies on hold to chase a career in rugby, impressed as the depth of new talent was a boost for the side co-captained by Ruahei Demant and Kennedy Simon.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns assistant coach Tony Christie said Canada have invested in their game as they move up the rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Canada pushed powerhouse England to the limit in the semi-finals at the last women's Rugby World Cup and Christie believes they will be a threat on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"The overall international standard has increased a lot, particularly this Pacific Four Series," Tony Christie said.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it's for us to show that we want to widen the gap again."</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously their maul threat is a danger for us, but we're excited with what we've come up with to stop that."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns laid the platform against the USA but there were aspects to tidy up.</p>
        
            <p>"We showed some good areas, but we were inconsistent throughout the game," Christie said.</p>
