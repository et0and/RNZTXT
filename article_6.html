            <p>The NFL will play its first game in Australia in 2026 as the league continues to grow its international footprint.</p>
        
            <p>The regular season game will be held in Melbourne at the MCG and feature the Los Angeles Rams. The game will likely be the season opener for the teams.</p>
        
            <p>Australia is a significant global market for the NFL with a growing fan base of 6.6 million across the country, the league said.</p>
        
            <p>"Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're thrilled the NFL will be touching down in the sporting capital of Australia. Victoria is now the first-ever state in Australia to host a regular season NFL game," premier of Victoria Jacinta Allan said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a win for jobs, a win for businesses and a win for fans who will get to see American football played at the iconic MCG."</p>
        
            <p>The league made its first foray into South America at the beginning of this season with a game in Sao Paulo.</p>
        
            <p>Next season the NFL is scheduled to play three games in England, a game in Berlin and one in Madrid.</p>
        
            <p>In 1999, the NFL staged a preseason game between the Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty-five regular-season games had been played in major international cities from London, Munich, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Mexico City and Toronto.</p>
