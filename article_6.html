            <p>New Zealander Nick Voke has become the second New Zealander in two years to win the Webex Player Series Sydney tournament, matching Kazuma Kobori's winning total from last year.</p>
        
            <p>Voke, who led by four strokes going into the last day at Castle Hill Country Club on Sunday, held on to win by one shot from Jake McLeod, with a final round of 3-under 69, to finish 25-under for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The Aucklander, a three-time PGA Tour China series winner, claims $50,000 for the victory and a big confidence boost heading into the New Zealand Open, which begins in Queenstown on Thursday. It and the Sydney tournament are PGA Tour of Australasia events, and Voke's win follows compatriot Josh Geary's win in the Victoria Webex event two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>It was a close-run thing for Voke, who led by five after a magnificent long birdie at the 13th hole.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as I hit it, I was like, oh, this looks pretty good," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But he dropped a shot at 14 as McLeod mounted a late charge, reducing Voke's lead to just two strokes with two holes to play.</p>
        
            <p>Voke made a clutch par to save the 17th, but a great third shot from 85 yards almost landed in the hole on the 18th and McLeod's birdie attempt to draw level hung just on the right edge.</p>
        
            <p>Voke, who creates golf content online, joked he might have peaked too early with the New Zealand Open on later this week, but also spoke about the vagaries of golf when asked what it meant to win again after last lifting a trophy in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"Golf is so hard. You can play a while, you can go through stretches and not win," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Gosh, that feels good. That's why you practise as a kid. That's why you have the late-night range sessions. It's why you do everything."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi Tyler Wood also had a final round 69 to finish in a tie for third, while Momoka Kobori was the best of the New Zealand women, finishing in a tie for 36th at 10-under, four strokes behind top woman Cassie Porter, who tied for overall.</p>
