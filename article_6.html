            <p>Defender Finn Surman has become the third Wellington Phoenix academy graduate to sign an offshore club deal after signing with Major League Soccer club the Portland Timbers for an undisclosed fee.</p>
        
            <p>The centre back follows Phoenix team-mates Alex Paulsen and Ben Old in securing a transfer overseas following the men's outstanding 2023-24 season in which they fell one step short of reaching the grand final.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of a 'pinch me' moment," Surman said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not something I really expected, but it's something that really excites me now that it's happening.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm stoked for Alex and for Ben as well because we're all pretty close. We've played a lot together throughout the years at the academy and played a lot together this season.</p>
        
            <p>"Deep down what every young footballer wants to do is push on and find the highest level that they can get to, so we're all having a crack at that in our different ways."</p>
        
            <p>Surman, 20, like Paulsen and Old, is coming off a breakthrough season after being limited to 19 league appearances over his first two years as a professional.</p>
        
            <p>He started all 29 of the Phoenix's matches during the season, playing all but the final nine minutes of extra time in the semi-final second leg against Melbourne Victory at Sky Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Surman memorably scored the stoppage time match-winner against Victory in round 24, although it was later credited as an own goal.</p>

            <p>The former New Zealand U20 captain also made his All Whites debut late last year and started all of their matches in Vanuatu on the way to winning the recent OFC Nations Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like it's a good step for me moving from the A-League to the MLS.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the jump for a centre back like myself is not too big and there are going to be opportunities to play if I take my chances and that's something that's important to me.</p>
        
            <p>"I see Portland as a place I can continue to develop and hopefully take the next step in my career."</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano congratulated Surman on his move.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm extremely happy for Finn," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he deserves it, especially off the back of a great season.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw in pre-season that he showed a lot of promise, so we didn't go with a foreign centre back. He took the initiative and was one of our most consistent performers.</p>
        
            <p>"Finn will be sorely missed, but his departure provides an opportunity for Isaac Hughes or Lukas Kelly-Heald to step into that role."</p>

            <p>Director of football Shaun Gill said it was another red letter day for the club following Paulsen's and Old's moves to AFC Bournemouth and AS Saint-Ã‰tienne respectively.</p>
        
            <p>"These are the three biggest outgoing transfers in the club's history and for them to come in one window is simply incredible.</p>
        
            <p>"It's no coincidence Finn, AP and Oldie have all come through our academy and it shows we've developed a world class high performance pathway for young Kiwi footballers."</p>
