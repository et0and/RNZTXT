            <p>A very proud grandmother will be hosting many of the people of the Central Otago settlement of Ophir to help cheer on her grandson at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Alexandra's Finn Butcher will be competing in his first Olympics in the sport of Canoe Slalom.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old will compete in both the K1 and Kayak-Cross events at the games.</p>
        
            <p>He began paddling as a nine-year-old at a "have a go day" and fell in love with it.</p>
        
            <p>After being named as a reserve for the Tokyo Olympics, Butcher is now set to race on the biggest stage and the people of Central Otago are getting behind him.</p>
        
            <p>He's been on the international circuit for a while now and says the support from Alexandra and the region is always bloody good.</p>
        
            <p>His parents, along with his sister and her fianc√© and a few other Alexandra people, will be in Paris for the games, while he told RNZ he's also had plenty of support via social media.</p>
        
            <p>"My phone has been consistently blowing up with people from home so it's pretty special, the place is always in my heart."</p>

            <p>And top of the list at the Finn Butcher fan club back home was his grandmother Val Butcher.</p>
        
            <p>"I know my Nana up in Ophir (just out of Omakau) is having a viewing party so she'll probably have the whole town there."</p>
        
            <p>The whole town was likely to fill her lounge.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all pretty proud."</p>
        
            <p>While his parents have seen Butcher compete in a number of places around the world, he admits that his mum gets quite nervous and there is a good chance she won't actually watch him during his run at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical course.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ, Finn was keen to give his Nana and all the people of Central Otago a shout out.</p>
        
            <p>"Thanks for all your support, I've been thinking about you a lot and all the crew of Central, I'm happy to represent you all.</p>
        
            <p>Last month Butcher put his name in contention for the Olympics by grabbing two medals at the Germany World Cup event.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't chasing a medal, but slalom is a funny game and anything can happen.</p>
        
            <p>"But if I go out there and paddle my style and give it my best it'll put me where it puts me.</p>
        
            <p>"If I do what I'm capable of then there is a definite shot at that (a medal)."</p>
        
            <p>The Canoe Slalom starts on the 27th with Luuka Jones, who is attending her fifth Olympics also competing in both the K1 individual and Kayak-Cross events.</p>
