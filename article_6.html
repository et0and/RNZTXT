            <p>All Blacks captain Scott Barrett has sustained a finger injury in the All Blacks' last test, it has been revealed.</p>
        
            <p>He has undergone surgical treatment and while it was unclear how long he will be out for, it was likely he will miss that start of the Rugby Championship next month.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks management confirmed today in a statement to RNZ that: "Scott Barrett injured a finger during the All Blacks test against Fiji in San Diego which required a surgical treatment after his return to New Zealand. The injury is now being assessed.''</p>
        
            <p>Coach Scott Robertson will name a 36-man squad for the Rugby Championship at 3pm on Sunday, with the All Blacks' opening their campaign against Argentina in Wellington on 10 August. The two sides meet again a week later, before the All Blacks head to South Africa for two tests against the Springboks and then a Bledisloe Cup series against the Wallabies.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett's absence means Ardie Savea presumably takes over the captaincy, with Jordie Barrett named as vice captain in the year's initial squad naming.</p>
        
            <p>It will also force a rethink about the second row, with the experienced Patrick Tuipulotu recovering from an injury of his own.</p>
        
            <p>While Tupou Vaa'i has played 28 tests, only six have been starts at lock, while Sam Darry made his debut against Fiji last weekend. The extended size of the squad could potentially see a recall for Josh Lord, who successfully got through a hit out with Taranaki against Wellington on Friday after a long injury break.</p>
        
            <p>Savea's probable ascension to the top job comes after news this week that he was leaving the Hurricanes to move to Moana Pasfika until 2027.</p>
