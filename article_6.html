            <p>Black Caps allrounder Michael Bracewell is set to make his return to the game on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell has been out of action since June after ruptering his Achilles tendon playing in England.</p>
        
            <p>He suffered the injury while playing for Worcestershire in the English T20 Blast and underwent surgery which ruled him out of contention for the World Cup in India.</p>
        
            <p>The 32 year old offspinner and big hitter was expected to miss 6-8 months.</p>
        
            <p>After undergoing an intense rehab plan over the last few months under the guidance of athletic staff Gavin Cross and Matt Long, Bracewell is set to take the field for the Wellington Firebirds when they take on Auckland in the Super Smash T20 competition.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Milne will rejoin the Wellington side after his stint with the Black Caps during their recent white-ball series against Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington top the men's standings while Auckland are second.</p>
