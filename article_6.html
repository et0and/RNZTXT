            <p>A new sports franchise is coming to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The long awaited entry of an Auckland A-Legaue team was officially confirmed today with a full A-League licence granted to American billionaire Bill Foley</p>
        
            <p>Foley will enter a team in the 2024 -League season, based in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It's been 17 years since the city had a side in the Australian League, with the Football Kingz from 1999-2004 and the New Zealand Knights 2004-2007.</p>
        
            <p>Bill Foley is a sports fanatic.</p>
        
            <p>He owns Bournemouth in the EPL and started the Las Vegas Black Knights in 2017, who won the Stanley Cup last year.</p>
        
            <p>Foley made his first investments in New Zealand in 2008 and his companies currently employ more than 500 Kiwis across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an honour to bring a top football club to Auckland," Foley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Building a championship team from expansion has been my most exhilarating professional achievement, and I aim to do the same for the fans of New Zealand and particularly the community in the Northern region. It's a special place and an area that I know will embrace this team."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to financing the new club Foley has committed to provide the investment and resources necessary to quickly build a competitive environment.</p>
        
            <p>Foley has hired Auckland native Nick Becker as the new club's Chief Executive Officer, leading the business endeavours, and will announce football leadership in the near future.</p>
        
            <p>The name of the franchise is yet to be announced, but Foley did offer a bit of a clue.</p>
        
            <p>"We really go through a process, and we have to make sure that whatever name we pick is going to represent New Zealand and Auckland. I have a special name I like because my alma mater are the Black Knights and black is a strong, strong statement in New Zealand. but we have a lot of other ideas on names, so it will take us a process."</p>
        
            <p>As well as a mens team, the franchise will field a womens team in the 2025-26 A-League Womens competition.</p>
