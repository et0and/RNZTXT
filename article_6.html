            <p>Loose forward Liana Mikaele-Tu'u scored with two minutes remaining to put the home side ahead for the first time at Eden Park, capping a barnstorming finish after the Chiefs had dominated much of the contest.</p>

            <p>In wet, windy conditions and trailing by 13 points, the Blues finally found their form when things became desperate, with Kahlia Awa crossing in the 65th minute, followed by a second try to dynamic winger Katelyn Vahaakolo and Mikaele-Tu'u's match-winner.</p>
        
            <p>While it was a maiden title for the top-qualifying Blues, it was a second straight narrow final defeat for the Chiefs, who were the competition's inaugural champions in 2022.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs' more experienced forwards adapted to the wet weather better, helping their team to a narrow 8-5 halftime lead thanks to an early Renee Holmes try, which became 18-5 after Holmes landed a penalty and converted a Mia Anderson try.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues' only first-half scoring came close to the interval through Vahaakolo, who was among the most dangerous attackers on the field.</p>
