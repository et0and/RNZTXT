            <p>New Zealand Warriors prop Zyon Maiu'u has been granted an immediate release from his contract to continue his NRL career with the Bulldogs.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old 2024 NRL rookie was signed until the end of the 2026 season.</p>
        
            <p>"We were keen for Zyon to stay but he's looking for more opportunities," said Warriors general manager recruitment, pathways and development Andrew McFadden.</p>
        
            <p>"He came through our system to make his NRL debut last year, and we wish him the very best for what lies ahead."</p>
        
            <p>Maiu'u was initially signed in 2021, rising through the ranks to become a regular in the club's New South Wales Cup reserve grade side for which he made 43 appearances in 2023 and 2024.</p>
        
            <p>He made his NRL debut and only appearance to date in the Warriors' Anzac Day loss against Gold Coast at Go Media Stadium last year. In the Warriors' preseason match against the Wests Tigers last season, Maiu'u was found guilty of the shoulder-to-head contact that resulted in Tigers centre Declan Casey having to be stretchered off the field, which resulted in a two match suspension.</p>
