            <p>Britain have selected Switzerland as their opponents for the semi-finals of the America's Cup challenger series, meaning Italy will face the United States.</p>
        
            <p>The four teams are seeking to win the right to challenge New Zealand for the coveted "Auld Mug", which dates back to 1851 and is the oldest international sporting trophy, off Barcelona.</p>
        
            <p>The first team to reach five wins in each semi-final will move into the Louis Vuitton Cup final. The winner of that will then face the Kiwis in October's America's Cup Match.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Ainslie's British team were given the choice of their semi-final opponents after sealing victory in a round robin series, beating Italy in a sail-off for top spot.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, you've just got make a decision and get on with it and win some races," Ainslie said of the British decision during a press conference for the four remaining skippers.</p>
        
            <p>France have already been eliminated as potential challengers in the competition between huge AC75 foiling mono-hulls. These are lifted above the water on high-tech hydrofoils and can hit speeds approaching 50 knots.</p>
        
            <p>"I am quite pleased, actually, to race against INEOS Britannia. They showed great performance in the round robin, and if we want to win this thing then I think we need to learn from the best," Swiss skipper Arnaud Psarofaghis said.</p>

            <p>The US team will begin their semi-final without joint-helm Paul Goodison who posted on social media that he had broken five ribs last week when he fell through an open hatch while lifting the mainsail across the deck after racing.</p>
        
            <p>"I struggled to breathe after the impact, but the extent of the injury wasn't fully clear until further examination and imaging at the hospital," Goodison said, adding that he was working with the medical team to assess his return to racing.</p>
        
            <p>Goodison normally helms the US boat with Tom Slingsby.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still taking it day by day for when he will return," Slingsby said of Goodison, adding that Lucas Calabrese had stepped into the role and was doing "an amazing job".</p>
