            <p>A bid to exclude combined schools' 1st XV rugby teams from the local competition's top grade is "elitist" and "self-serving", principals say.</p>
        
            <p>The schoolboy competition has proposed combined teams from Canterbury schools who do not have enough players to field a whole team only play in the lower championship division from next year.</p>
        
            <p>The move is part of a set of proposed changes to the competition after administrators set up a working group to review its structure and format.</p>
        
            <p>But principals at Darfield High School and Christchurch Boy's High School have slammed the proposed change.</p>
        
            <p>Darfield High School principal Andy England said no explanation or rationale had been provided for the move,</p>
        
            <p>"I believe there may be an elitist element to it, whether it's intentional or not, the effect is elitist," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The teams remaining will all be boys' schools, or private schools and yes you could argue other schools could get there but it makes it extremely hard."</p>
        
            <p>The Miles Toyota competition includes teams from South and Mid Canterbury, Canterbury, and Tasman. It is split into two competitions, a premiership and championship.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the participating schools include Nelson College, Christchurch Boy's High School, Christ's College, St Bede's College and St Andrew's College.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 100 All Blacks have been educated at these schools alone.</p>
        
            <p>The competition is administered by the Canterbury Rugby Union (CRU) but is mostly run and governed by the schools themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Darfield High School, alongside Rolleston College, Lincoln High School and Ellesmere College, feed into the Selwyn Schools Combined 1st XV, the only combined side in this year's premiership grade.</p>
        
            <p>"What's really disappointing is that we've created a model which allows more equitable access to the best level of rugby, and it's not being allowed for some really unknown reason," England said.</p>

            <p>Christchurch Boys' High School headmaster Nic Hill said the plan to exclude combined teams showed some schools were putting "reputation and marketing" ahead of the best interests of students.</p>
        
            <p>"It's 100 percent elitism," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want a game that creates decent humans, it shouldn't be a marketing tool."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was ultimately a case of self-interest for the decision-makers.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been this arms race in schoolboy rugby for too long and it has not been healthy.</p>
        
            <p>"In Christchurch, significant schools do not have 1st XV programmes anymore simply because of private school scholarships."</p>
        
            <p>England said schools in rural areas would continue to lose students needlessly to the bigger Christchurch schools.</p>
        
            <p>"That means for those families uprooting, it means finding the money to enable that to happen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And that means they don't continue rugby within their own community and continue with their own friends and whƒÅnau around them.</p>
        
            <p>"It gives another message that you have to move to these schools in order to get what you want."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the CRU said participating schools selected a working group "representing the views and opinions of all schools" following the 2023 competition.</p>
        
            <p>The group then reviewed the competition's "structure, format, and governance".</p>
        
            <p>"This review sought feedback from the principals (or their nominees) of the schools currently involved in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"All decisions were made based on the majority views of the principals and not based on the views of any individual in the working group.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of this thorough review, a set of competition guidelines has been proposed for the 2025 competition and beyond."</p>
        
            <p>The CRU said the proposed changes were still under review, and were subject to "ongoing consultation, ensuring that all principals are informed and involved in the process".</p>
        
            <p>"Canterbury Rugby's intention is to ensure quality experiences for all participants in all grades across the region."</p>
