            <p>The well-known haka took place at the intersection of Bunny Street and Featherston Street on Tuesday afternoon and was composed by Ngapo Wehi.</p>
        
            <p>Vehicles were barred from entering the intersection as a group of men performed the haka to a crowd of hundreds of onlookers.</p>
        
            <p>The men - wearing traditional garb and carrying taiaha - had earlier been seen moving in formation chanting 'Ka Mate'.</p>
        
            <p>Their performance at the intersection was minutes long and energetic, inspiring an eruption of cheers and applause at its conclusion.</p>
