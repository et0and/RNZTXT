            <p>Former New Zealand cricketer Lou Vincent has had his life ban for match fixing relaxed by the English Cricket Board, which will allow him to be involved in domestic cricket.</p>
        
            <p>The ECB's Cricket Discipline Commission announced last night the decision to relax the ban. The governing body said the outcome was reached after considering the circumstances of his case along with his "full and frank admissions and disclosures" and his "total cooperation" with the authorities.</p>
        
            <p>The life ban on Vincent in 2014 by the ECB was handed to the talented New Zealand batter after the disgraced player admitted he was a "cheat" and had shamed his country and the sport by fixing matches.</p>
        
            <p>Lou Vincent said he was grateful to have his life ban for match fixing relaxed by England's cricket board.</p>
        
            <p>The former Auckland player said he would look forward to supporting and helping the game at a community level in the years ahead, and attending cricket matches with his family.</p>
        
            <p>"I made a terrible mistake many years ago which I'll deeply regret for the rest of my life, and I remain very sorry for the harm I caused," Vincent, 45, said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to return to the cricket environment means the world to me and I feel very fortunate to again have that opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to thank the ECB and the Cricket Discipline Committee and Mr Gerald Elias CBE KC for their consideration of my application and their ultimate determination.</p>
        
            <p>"Same with the ICC, NZC, the NZCPA and the many other organisations who supported me throughout this process - it's meant so much to me on a personal level."</p>

            <p>Vincent, who played 23 tests and more than 100 one-day internationals for New Zealand, had been investigated for being involved in attempting to manipulate 12 matches in five countries between 2008 and 2012.</p>
        
            <p>He pleaded guilty to offences relating to two matches he played for English county Sussex in August 2011 - a Twenty20 contest against Lancashire and a 40-over clash with Kent - besides another T20 match between Lancashire and Durham in 2008.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand cricket chief executive Scott Weenink said his organisation supported the relaxation of Vincent's life ban from the game.</p>
        
            <p>"We're pleased for Lou," Scott Weenink said. "He made a mistake but he's part of our cricket family and we want to support him and stand by him.</p>
        
            <p>"Lou's given a lot to the game, not least in helping spread the anti-corruption message over thepast decade, and it's good and right that he can be more involved again."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket Players Association chief executive Heath Mills also welcomed the ruling.</p>
