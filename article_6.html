            <p>New Zealand Australian Rules footballer Mykelti Lefau is out for the remainder of the season, following confirmation from the Richmond Tigers that he has ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee.</p>
        
            <p>The promising key forward left the ground during the final quarter of the Tigers' 15.9 (99) 10.9 (69) loss to Geelong on Saturday night after landing awkwardly in a marking contest.</p>
        
            <p>Lefau joins an unfortunately large group of Tigers teammates with the same injury: Judson Clarke, Josh Gibcus, Sam Naismith and Tylar Young have all suffered ACL tears as well. It's the latest in a series of setbacks for Richmond, who currently sit 17th on the AFL ladder after 12 rounds.</p>
        
            <p>Lefau has previously ruptured the ACL in his left leg while playing in the VFL (reserve grade) in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"Football can be a cruel game sometimes, and for Mykelti, who has been in terrific form, this is an unfortunate way for his debut season to finish," Richmond football performance manager Tim Livingstone told AFL.</p>

            <p>"Mykelti has not put a foot wrong since he joined our AFL program in the pre-season, and we know he will attack his rehab with the same professionalism and energy that has held him in such strong stead this season.</p>
        
            <p>"We will give him our support every step of the way and help him to return to action and to continue with his promising career in 2025."</p>
        
            <p>Lefau debuted for Richmond in March. He kicked two goals in just his second game, an upset win over the Sydney Swans. Since then, Lefau kicked 14 goals from 10 matches, including another two in the game against Geelong before his injury.</p>
        
            <p>He originally moved to Melbourne as a 16-year-old to pursue a career playing rugby league in the NRL, before picking up Australian Rules Football and making a meteoric rise through the grades to the AFL.</p>
