            <p>The NRL judiciary has suspended St George Dragons five-eighth Kyle Flanagan for four matches after finding him guilty of biting Canterbury captain Stephen Crichton.</p>
        
            <p>Crichton had alleged that Flanagan had bitten him on the nose during Canterbury's win over St George on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Flanagan insisted during the two-hour hearing he had not bitten Crichton, but the judicial panel only took 15 minutes to find him guilty.</p>
        
            <p>He repeated his denial outside NRL headquarters after the hearing.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed with the result, but my focus turns now to the Dragons and how I can help them over the next couple of weeks," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't bite Stephen Crichton. But I thank them for a fair hearing and my focus is on the Dragons for the next four weeks.''</p>
        
            <p>Judicial panel chairperson Geoffrey Bellew said the panel took into account that the bite was momentary, and that Flanagan had a creditworthy judicial record.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the panel wished to make it clear that biting is a most serious offence and must be treated as such in terms of penalty," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In particular, the panel took the view that it was necessary to send a clear message to those playing the game that conduct of this kind will not be tolerated and, if proved, will inevitably result in a substantial suspension."</p>
        
            <p>Crichton did not testify at the hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Bellew said the panel was satisfied on video evidence that Flanagan's mouth was fully closed around Crichton's nose at one point and that the action had been carried out forcefully.</p>
        
            <p>The ban means Flanagan will not be able to play for the Dragons until the finals should they qualify. They are in ninth place with three rounds remaining.</p>
