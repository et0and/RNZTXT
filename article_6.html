            <p>Silver Ferns midcourter Mila Reuelu-Buchanan will miss the remainder of the ANZ Premiership season with scans confirming she suffered an ACL rupture during Monday's match against the Magic.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars player also suffered a medial meniscus tear in her left knee and will miss the international season later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Monday's game in Auckland was marred by two sinister-looking injuries when the Magic beat the Stars, who are languishing at the bottom of the table..</p>
        
            <p>Reuelu-Buchanan had to leave the court after falling awkwardly part way through the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>In the fourth quarter it appeared that the left knee of Magic midcourter Ali Wilshire buckled and she had to be helped off the court. There's been no update yet as to the extent of Wilshire's injury.</p>
        
            <p>They joined a growing list of injured players at the halfway point of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Stars coach Kiri Wills has already had to juggle injuries to Amorangi Malesala (ankle) and Emma Thompson (concussion) who are working towards full games.</p>
        
            <p>Wills has called on former Stars player and Silver Ferns captain Gina Crampton as reinforcement and will probably continue to as long as Crampton is available.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse have lost four key players this season, but are hoping to have them back for the business end of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>The Steel have lost two key players for the entire season. It is hoped Mystics shooter Grace Nweke will be back on court soon after hurting her knee in Round three.</p>
        
            <p>Reuelu-Buchanan will undergo surgery before working towards a return to the netball court in 2025.</p>
