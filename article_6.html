            <p>An absolutely sensational eight-goal thriller.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC and Adelaide played out 100 minutes of indescribable drama this afternoon, with the memorable battle ending in a 4-all stalemate.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Hiroki Sakai looked to have things sealed with just minutes remaining, before Bart Vriends broke the hosts hearts with a 98th minute equaliser.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland roared out to a 2-0 lead on the back of a brisk brace by Guillermo May, the first a superb strike from distance bending out of reach of Ethan Cox.</p>
        
            <p>Just four minutes later, his second came in slightly sloppier fashion, as he chipped home to put his side firmly in control at Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan Elsey pulled one back for Adelaide from a corner to send the sides to the sheds 2-1.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after oranges, Logan Rogerson extended the lead once again as Francis De Vries sent glorious corner for him to convert.</p>
        
            <p>Right on the hour mark, Zach Clough netted a penalty to bring his side back within one, after Louis Verstraete was pinged inside the box for a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Clough then squared things up as he slotted another penalty, this time Tommy Smith the culprit.</p>
        
            <p>Then as injury time ticked over, the skipper stood up and with a second shot, looked to have nailed the clincher as the crowd were sent into delirium.</p>
        
            <p>However, that soon made way for utter disbelief, as a scramble saw the ball fall to the feet of Vriends, and he ensured the sides would not be separated to bring a close to an unbelievable clash.</p>
