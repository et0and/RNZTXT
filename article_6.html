        <h2>Godfrey solidifying his spot in the Hurricanes</h2>
        <p>
Harry Godfrey has only started one game at No.10 for his NPC side Hawkes Bay, and is now ready to cement himself as the Hurricanes first choice first-five.

            <p>Harry Godfrey intends on making the Hurricanes first-five jersey his own.</p>
        
            <p>Following a rash of injuries, the 22-year-old, who had mostly played at fullback and had less than a dozen Super Rugby games under his belt, was thrust into the starting No.10 role for last week's loss to the Crusaders in the season opener in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in the first forty (half), we played well. We went to the sheds feeling pretty comfortable. And then coming out in that second half, that momentum swung a bit. They got a few quick tries and we couldn't really bounce back from that," Godfrey said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had our review and there are some really easy fixes (to make) on defence and attack."</p>

            <p>While upset with the result, Hurricanes assistant coach, former All Blacks wing Cory Jane, was impressed with Godfrey's performance.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good. He's put in so much work in trying to drive this team and I thought Harry played well," Jane said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look back at the start of preseason, and I've been in the team for a couple years with him, every time he got up to speak everyone would laugh at him because he was kind of like a jokester and like the little boy.</p>
        
            <p>"But now he's just turned into the absolute general of our team and stepped in and gone, I want to be the starting 10 and the boss of this team. It's been awesome to see and he'll get better too. When he's speaking to the boys in meetings now, it's unbelievable."</p>

            <p>"I always would like to be at 10. I enjoyed my time at fullback. They're slightly different, but more of the same. A bit more space at fullback, but you get a bit more touches on the ball at the first receiver.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy enjoy playing 10. I've worked pretty hard through the preseason, in terms of leadership, game management, being a game driver, stuff like that.</p>
        
            <p>"I've still got a bit of a way to go, but I'm in a good space."</p>

            <p>Godfrey doesn't mind calling the shots for the Hurricanes backline, despite his young age and relative in-experience.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not too bad. Playing outside Cam Roigard (All Blacks halfback) helps as well. The boys trust me, which is good and the coaches back me as well."</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes take their home game against the Fijian Drua to Napier this weekend and Godfrey, a Hawkes Bay Magpie, couldn't wait.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be awesome. Napier's a great place. We love playing there. Obviously, I'm a Magpie Boy and with a 4:30pm kick off as well. There's no better time," Godfrey said.</p>
