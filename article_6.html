            <p>In a finish for the ages, LawConnect has sensationally overtaken Andoo Comanche in the final moments to snatch line honours in the 2023 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.</p>
        
            <p>Andoo Comanche held the lead a lot more comfortably when rounding the Tasman Peninsula and entering the River Derwent for the final sprint, but LawConnect started to rapidly gain on them.</p>
        
            <p>The speedier LawConnect closed several nautical miles between them along the river until they were neck and neck to a nail-biting finish.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect's finish time in the end was 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes and 58 seconds. Andoo Comanche's was just 51 seconds behind.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect owner Christian Beck described their dramatic win as a dream come true.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't believe that result. Honestly, it's a dream come true," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I never thought it was possible, actually."</p>
        
            <p>Despite trailing by a significant margin as they passed the Iron Pot on the final approach, LawConnect had the advantage of being able to watch Andoo Comanche to see where the slow spots were.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect entered with a protest flag flying, after being on standby for about 30 minutes during the race due to concerns Andoo Comanche was in distress at one stage.</p>
        
            <p>There was also some interference from a spectator boat in the final moments, with a catamaran passing close to Andoo Comanche and the crew being seen yelling and gesturing.</p>
        
            <p>Sailing master Tony Mutter said spectator boats were something the competitors had to deal with.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty fair that everyone had troubles with the spectator boats. That's part of it when it's so busy," he said.</p>

            <p>Andoo Comanche skipper John Winning Jr said they only had themselves to blame for the last-minute loss.</p>
        
            <p>"We should have been miles ahead of them with our boat," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The conditions suited us, I think they just outsailed us."</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of spectators watched the dramatic finish at Constitution Dock from 7am (local time) as the two super maxis jostled for the top position.</p>
        
            <p>It was the perfect finish to one of the most memorable editions of the blue water classic, held amidst intense storms over south-east Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder of the fleet is crossing the Bass Strait, where conditions are easier than the previous night.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a testing 78th edition of the Sydney to Hobart, with a man overboard, stormy seas, damaged yachts and rapid wind changes.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven boats have retired, including race favourite SHK Scallywag, which broke its bow sprit on the first day.</p>
        
            <p>The skipper of two-handed Rum Rebellion, Shane Connelly, was sent overboard at 6pm on Boxing Day after encountering rapid wind changes off the coast between Cronulla and Wollongong.</p>
        
            <p>Two-handed Currawong also retired, after facing various issues in rough conditions off New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Owner Kathy Veel said they were disappointed but believed they made the right decision.</p>
        
            <p>"Last night was quite difficult and there was a lot more of that ahead of us in a long race," she said.</p>
        
            <p>They were the last boat to cross the finishing line at last year's event, making a well-received arrival in Hobart at midnight on New Year's Eve.</p>
