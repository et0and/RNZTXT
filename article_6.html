            <p>Blues Captain Patrick Tuipulotu has suffered a fractured jaw in Japan and will return home for surgery.</p>
        
            <p>He's likely to be sidelined for the first half of the Blues' Super Rugby Pacific campaign.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-test lock suffered the injury late in the first half of the Blues opening pre-season match against Tokyo Sungoliath on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Blues Head Coach, Vern Cotter, said he was feeling for his captain.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tough blow for Patrick, especially early on in the season," Cotter said.</p>
        
            <p>"We wish Paddy a speedy recovery knowing he'll still offer plenty to the group from a leadership perspective over the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a resilient group and we've got a strong stock of locks to call on while he recovers."</p>
        
            <p>Cotter said a decision on who will take over the Blues captaincy will be made in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues take on the Yokohama Canon Eagles in their second pre-season match on Saturday.</p>
