            <p>Queenstown skier Alice Robinson has come second to Italian star Federica Brignone again, this time at the latest World Cup Giant Slalom race in Sestriere in Italy.</p>
        
            <p>It is the same result as that of the World Championships in Austria ten days ago.</p>
        
            <p>It was closer this time with Robinson less than half a second behind Brignone, who got out of her sick bed to win her sixth World Cup victory of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson, 23, still tops the Giant Slalom standings, having now finished first or second in the last three global Giant Slalom races and been on the podium in all but one contest in the discipline this season.</p>
        
            <p>It is the 15th World Cup podium of her career.</p>
        
            <p>"It is so nice to get another podium, I am a little bit disappointed that I couldn't hold the lead but obviously I am really happy with another second place," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson was pleased with her first run that had her just ahead of Brignone.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a really solid run, I was feeling calm this morning and I felt a good feeling on this snow. I got into a really good rhythm from the top and I felt like I attacked and also had a good bit of touch when it was a bit more grippy at the bottom. There are still a couple things I would like to improve on the second run but I am happy."</p>
        
            <p>Despite being sick all week, Brignone managed to step up in the second run to pip Robinson again.</p>
        
            <p>However it has been a marvellous couple of weeks for the Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a really exciting past month, it's cool to be leading the GS standings for the first time and a medal at World Champs is just great, so hoping to keep it rolling!"</p>
        
            <p>That was first of two back-to-back Giant Slalom World Cup races in Sestriere.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson will be back in the start gate on Saturday night for the second race.</p>
