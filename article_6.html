            <p>Japan's Taro Daniel has outlasted Frenchman Alexandre Muller to grab the first men's semi-final berth at the ASB Tennis Classic in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The three set quarter-final lasted 2 hours 40 minutes with Daniel winning 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 to advance.</p>
        
            <p>Daniel told Sky Sport it was a "brutal" match.</p>
        
            <p>"Very hot today and I had it in the second but (Muller) came back...but I came back and found my momentum again," he said.</p>
        
            <p>At the post match media conference he said "there were a few minutes there where I felt very heavy physically and mentally and I was like 'I don't know if I can keep doing it and may be it's just better to throw it in and go to Melbourne early'.</p>
        
            <p>"Those thoughts come in - but I told myself to stay loose and that was the most important thing"</p>
