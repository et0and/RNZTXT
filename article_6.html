            <p>British tennis star Emma Raducanu will make her third straight appearance at Auckland's ASB Classic.</p>
        
            <p>The 2021 US Open Champion is set to make a return to the game after being sidelined with an ankle injury for two months.</p>
        
            <p>Two other US Open champions will join Raducanu at the ASB Classic in the form of newly crowned WTA Finals doubles winners, New Zealand's Erin Routliffe and her Canadian partner Gaby Dabrowski.</p>

            <p>The doubles duo paired up for the first time in 2023 before going on to win the US grand slam.</p>
        
            <p>This year Routliffe and Dabrowski were quarter-finalists at the US Open, semi-finalists at the French Open, runners-up at Wimbledon and winners of the recent WTA Finals in Riyadh.</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu required a wildcard spot to compete in Auckland in 2024 following a significant injury layoff in 2023. She is currently ranked 58th in the world.</p>
        
            <p>The British player plans to return to tennis in the Billie Jean King Cup this month, after she was a key figure in Great Britain's win over France in April, where she won both singles matches.</p>
        
            <p>She is looking forward to her return to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"The people are very friendly and very hospitable. I always have a great time there. The weather, when it is nice, is really beautiful," Raducanu said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of my best friends lives in Auckland and her family do too, so I think I will be there for Christmas Day. Over the last two years, we have gone an hour north to their beach house and had a BBQ there. It is really wholesome. The quality of the meat and fish is so fresh and I am looking forward to it.</p>
        
            <p>"Mentally I feel like I am in a better place to compete now than I ever have been before since the US Open. It's going to probably take me some tournaments to get up to speed but once I do, I think I am in a better head space to compete now."</p>

            <p>Dabrowski and Routliffe teamed up to win their first Grand Slam doubles title in only their fourth tournament as a team in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>For Routliffe, the win at the US Open served as a springboard. Two years ago Routliffe had contemplated retirement, but after playing well with Dabrowski, she climbed rankings to become New Zealand's first WTA Tour World No 1 this year.</p>
        
            <p>To cap it off she was selected along with Lulu Sun to represent New Zealand at the Paris Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>"Two years ago, if you told me this was happening, I would not have believed you," Routliffe said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a testament to years and years of working and learning myself what works for me. Having people around me that believe in me no matter what. Gaby taking a chance on me when my ranking was probably not as high as she would have liked in our partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"I will never forget that and I don't take any of it for granted. It's been a quick rise to the top of the game. I'm excited for more."</p>
        
            <p>The final women's field for the ASB Classic will be announced the first week December.</p>
