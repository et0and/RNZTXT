            <p>Queenstown's Alice Robinson has been crowned the New Zealand Giant Slalom National Champion for the second year running.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen countries were represented and there were 10 New Zealand women in the field competing at Coronet Peak in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>The Giant Slalom course differed slightly from previous years, with the athletes starting at the top of the Coronet Express on the M1, before taking a big left hand bend and rolling over into the formidable Hurdle, widely recognised as one of the steepest giant slalom slopes in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to be able to race here [at Coronet Peak] and take the National Champs title, it's always really special and a nice way to start my season off," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson attacked the challenging course and lead run one by -0.67 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>As the fastest first run athlete, Robinson was the final athlete to push out the start for run two.</p>
        
            <p>She made quick work of solidifying her lead and took the win by -1.42 seconds in the overall FIS race and -1.43 seconds in the NZ Giant Slalom National Championships race.</p>
        
            <p>Piera Hudson of Hawke's Bay finished third overall, just one hundredth of a second behind second place finisher Janine Maechler of Switzerland.</p>
        
            <p>Hudson's result also secured her a second place finish in the NZ Giant Slalom National Championships.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson's Ruby Fullerton rounded out the National Championship women's podium in third.</p>
        
            <p>Poor weather delayed the men's competition which will now take place on Friday.</p>
