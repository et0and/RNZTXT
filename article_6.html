            <p>Mexican driver Sergio Perez has confirmed he is leaving the Red Bull Formula 1 team.</p>
        
            <p>His future with the team was in the balance after disappointing results in the second half of the season.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Liam Lawson, who drove the last six races with Red Bull's sister team RB, is considered a leading contender to replace him in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Perez had two years left on his contract.</p>
        
            <p>There was a reported offer of an ambassadorial role with the team, but Perez has opted to walk away from his contract altogether.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm incredibly grateful for the past four years with Oracle Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing team," Perez said on X.</p>
        
            <p>"Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I'll always cherish the successes we achieved together. We broke records, reached remarkable milestones, and I've had the privilege of meeting so many incredible people along the way.</p>
        
            <p>"It has also been an honour to race alongside Max (Verstappen) as a teammate all these years and to share in our success.</p>
        
            <p>"A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support ever day. We'll meet again soon. And remember ... never give up."</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull team principal Christian Horner made this comment to F1.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to thank Checo [Perez] for all he has done for Oracle Red Bull Racing over the past four seasons," team boss Christian Horner added. "From the moment he joined in 2021 he proved himself to be an extraordinary team player, helping us to two constructors' titles and to our first one-two finish in the drivers' championship.</p>
        
            <p>"His five wins, all on street circuits, were also a spectacular mark of his determination to always push to the limit.</p>
        
            <p>"While Checo will not race for the team next season, he will always be an extremely popular team member and a treasured part of our history. Thank you, Checo."</p>
        
            <p>The 2025 season opens in Melbourne on 24 March.</p>
