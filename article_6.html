            <p>The Indian wicketkeeper was the subject of a bidding war between the Super Giants and his former side, Delhi Capitals.</p>
        
            <p>Pant returned to the game in this year's IPL after an 14-month lay-off following a car accident.</p>
        
            <p>Another Indian batsman, Shreyas Iyer, was signed for $2.5m by Punjab Kings.</p>
