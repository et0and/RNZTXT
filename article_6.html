            <p>Auckland FC have extended their lead at the top of the men's A-League ladder to five points with a 2-1 win over Macarthur Bulls at Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>An 80th minute goal from midfielder Louis Verstraete broke the deadlock that had been in place since the 19th minute.</p>
        
            <p>He nodded the ball into an unoccupied Macarthur net after a superb Francis de Fries free kick eluded goalkeeper Flip Kurto.</p>
        
            <p>It was Verstraete's first A-League goal and yet another example of Auckland FC's ability to score goals late in matches.</p>
        
            <p>The Belgian said he had felt before the game that he was going to score today.</p>
        
            <p>"I just went for it and I saw a gap,'' he told Sky Sport. There was possibly a touch by Kurto, but Verstraete said he was in the right place at the right time.</p>
        
            <p>Their win over fourth-placed Macarthur puts them five clear of Adelaide United, but they have played two more games than the South Australian side.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland took the lead in the ninth minute courtesy of a Neyder Moreno goal, after nifty lead-up work from skipper Hiroki Sakai and Max Mata, but Macarthur levelled up in the 19th minute thanks to a Jake Hollman goal.</p>
        
            <p>There was immediate concern after that goal for centre back Nando Pijnaker, who had to come off after possibly rolling his ankle.</p>
        
            <p>Defender Tommy Smith said the team's fitness levels were responsible for their ability to score goals late in matches.</p>
        
            <p>"We know we are fitter than all other teams. That's testament to the guys in our medical and fitness department. We have worked so hard throughout the pre-season throughout the season to be the fittest team in the league," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC have a bye next weekend and play Western United away on 15 February.</p>
