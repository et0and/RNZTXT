            <p>Are the Highlanders this season's surprise package already? Alright, so they've only got one win but it was a very impressive victory last weekend against the Blues, achieved with only 13 men at one point and answering a fair few questions about the side's fortitude. Former Moana player Timoci Tavatavanawai staked a very early claim for an All Black call up and pint-sized fullback Finn Hurley scored a try that'll surely be one of the best of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Moana Pasifika have had no problems scoring tries of their own in two high-scoring games against the Force and Reds - the problem is they've lost both.</p>
        
            <p>Moana: 1. James Lay, 2. Millennium Sanerivi, 3. Sione Mafile'o, 4. Tom Savage, 5. Allan Craig, 6. Miracle Faiilagi, 7. Semisi Tupou Ta'eiloa, 8. Ardie Savea (c), 9. Jonathan Taumateine, 10. Jackson Garden-Bachop, 11. Kyren Taumoefolau, 12. Danny Toala, 13. Pepesana Patafilo, 14. Solomon Alaimalo, 15. William Havili</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Sama Malolo, 17. Tito Tuipulotu, 18. Chris Apoua, 19. Samuel Slade, 20. Ola Tauelangi, 21. Melani Matavao, 22. Patrick Pellegrini, 23. Tevita Ofa</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 1. Josh Bartlett, 2. Soane Mikaele Vikena, 3. Sefo Kautai, 4. Fabian Holland, 5. Mitch Dunshea, 6. Sean Withy, 7. Veveni Lasaqa, 8. Nikora Broughton, 9. Folau Fakatava, 10. Taine Robinson, 11. Caleb Tangitau, 12. Timoci Tavatavanawai (c), 13. Tanielu Tele'a, 14. Sam Gilbert, 15. Finn Hurley</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Jack Taylor, 17. Ethan de Groot, 18. Saula Ma'u, 19. Will Stodart, 20. TK Howden, 21. Nathan Hastie, 22. Cameron Millar, 23. Jake Te Hiwi</p>

            <p>If the defence is going to rise to the occasion in this one, they're going to have to do it without arguably their best defender. Sione Havili Talitui is out, replaced by rookie Semisi Tupou Ta'eiloa. Patrick Pellegrini and Tevita Ofa are set to debut off the bench. Kyren Taumoefolau and Solomon Alaimalo have been in great form so far and will look to continue on the wings.</p>

            <p>Some good news after last weekend's prop-mageddon saw the Highlanders reduced to depowered scrums, with Ethan de Groot and Saula Mau'u passed fit to play. They'll come off a bench that also welcomes back TK Howden. Nikora Broughton starts at number eight in place of the injured Hugh Renton.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders have lost 12 of their last 14 Super Rugby Pacific games away from Forsyth Barr Stadium, including their last four in a row. However, one of those wins was against Moana Pasifika at Teufaiva Stadium in Tonga.</p>

            <p>Moana Pasifika have scored four or more tries in four of their last five Super Rugby Pacific games after not doing so in any of their previous nine fixtures. They've scored 44 and 36 points across their last two games and will be looking to score 30+ points in three consecutive games for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Taumoefolau has scored two tries in each of his last two games in the Super Rugby Pacific; only twice in the last decade has any player scored multiple tri es in three straight games (Semisi Masirewa in 2019 and Shaun Stevenson in 2023).</p>
        
            <p>"We work hard to score our points yet we just give away points really easily. It's not just about scoring points. Obviously that's important, but we've also got to stop points being scored against us. We're scoring enough points to win games. So there's been a big focus around making sure that we nail our defence." - Moana Pasifika coach Tana Umaga</p>
        
            <p>"We're proud of the performance on Saturday night, it's awesome to have a good crowd in and I think we showed a huge amount of heartâ€¦I think it's just down to the players and how hard they've worked." - Highlanders assistant coach Ben Smith.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders 28 - 17 Moana Pasifika</p>
        
            <p>Fair to say the Highlanders were happy to head home under their roof after one the wettest Super Rugby Pacific games ever played. The two sies met in Nuku'alofa and put on a pretty decent display despite the atrocious conditions, the late Conor Garden-Bachop playing a big hand with a try and assist for the victors.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of tries if the previous few weeks are anything to go by. Both teams want to run the ball, Moana seem pretty disinterested in tackling, and the Highlanders have some real key weapons now in the backline. The key advantage the Highlanders have is their bench though, while Moana's scrum has been solid so far this season, they will be up against some real class when de Groot and Mau'u come off the bench.</p>
