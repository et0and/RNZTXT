            <p>Promising All Whites midfielder Marko Stamenić has signed a five-year deal and will join New Zealand captain Chris Wood at English Premier League side Nottingham Forest.</p>
        
            <p>Stamenić, 22, will move from Serbian league champions Red Star Belgrade, but will initially be on loan to top Greek club Olympiakos for the 2024-25 season to assist his development.</p>
        
            <p>No transfer fee has been disclosed in the deal announced by Nottingham Forest on Saturday, but it has been reported as being NZ$9.6 million.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington-born Stamenić, who has 21 caps for the All Whites, played 35 games for Red Star last season.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second big transfer for an All White this month, with goalkeeper Alex Paulsen joining Bournemouth from Wellington Phoenix in a reported $4 million deal.</p>
