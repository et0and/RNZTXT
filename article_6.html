            <p>Coverage of New Zealand Cricket home internationals will move back to Sky Television next year.</p>
        
            <p>Spark Sport secured the rights to cricket in New Zealand in April 2020, but closed in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Television New Zealand took over the coverage and will continue to broadcast the games in New Zealand for another year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket and Sky have agreed terms on a six-year deal from the 2026-27 season with the Black Caps and White Ferns home internationals returning to the pay-tv provider.</p>
        
            <p>The new agreement with Sky relates to home internationals. Free-to-access arrangements for the domestic Super Smash competition are yet to be announced.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket chief executive Scott Weenink said it was important for the game in New Zealand to have certainty over its short-to-mid-term domestic broadcasting future.</p>
        
            <p>Weenink said NZC was hugely grateful for the partnerships with Spark and TVNZ, the latter of which will remain the carrier for all NZC home internationals and Dream11 Super Smash games until the end of next summer.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an amazing relationship with TVNZ and we're looking forward to continuing and developing that relationship over the balance of our agreement, and potentially after that in respect of free-to-air T20Is and the Super Smash."</p>
