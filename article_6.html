            <p>The Blues bludgeoned the Brumbies 34-20 in Auckland to book a place in the Super Rugby Pacific final - but victory may have come at a cost.</p>
        
            <p>A Blues side basing their game once again on forward power scored four of their five tries in the first 20 minutes to take control of the semi-final at Eden Park as they opened up a 27-13 halftime lead.</p>
        
            <p>Their only try in an even second half was scored by No.8 Hoskins Sotutu, giving him 12 for the season.</p>
        
            <p>That lifts Sotutu level with Crusaders winger Sevu Reece as the competition's top try-scorer this year and also equals the most tries by any forward in a Super Rugby season.</p>

            <p>Of concern was All Blacks forwards Dalton Papali'i and Ofa Tu'ungafasi both leaving the game with injury in the second spell.</p>
        
            <p>The nature of in-form prop Tu'ungafasi's ailment was unclear while Papali'i took a head knock and reportedly failed an HIA assessment.</p>
        
            <p>Papali'i told Sky Sport he thought he would be cleared to play the final.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sweet, I think I just got a bit of a hit to the teeth, and I'm already missing one so the other ones are hurting a little bit more. But I'm sweet, I'm good to go," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It means a lot. This group has been through a lot and there's a lot of old boys who have been with this team for so many years. We've got one more game to go.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to say credit to the Brumbies. They are a tough Aussie team and we always expect a test match calibre game against them."</p>
        
            <p>Standout flanker Papali'i was leading the Blues in the absence of regular skipper Patrick Tuipulotu, whose campaign was ended by a knee injury suffered in last week's quarter-final win over Fijian Drua.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues will face the winner of Saturday's semifinal between the Hurricanes and Chiefs in Wellington tomorrow, meaning a New Zealand winner is guaranteed for a 10th straight year.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Vern Cotter's team - who have won 15 straight matches at Eden Park - will have a shot at winning their first full Super Rugby title since they clinched their third crown back in 2003.</p>

            <p>It was a fourth successive semi-final exit for the two-time champion Brumbies and continues the record of Australian teams having never won a semi-final on New Zealand soil.</p>
        
            <p>They had won seven straight games coming into the match, with their previous loss being a 46-7 hammering from the Blues at Eden Park in round nine.</p>
        
            <p>Their chances weren't helped by two Wallabies being ruled out soon before kickoff.</p>
        
            <p>Flanker Tom Hooper couldn't play because of illness while veteran prop James Slipper re-aggravated a calf muscle injury that has sidelined him for several weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies captain Allan Ala'alatoa said they were off their game in the crucial opening exchanges.</p>
        
            <p>"We weren't clinical coming out of our end and I think we gave them three balls off our kick-off receipt and they made us pay through tries," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't give a side like that, that ascendancy at the beginning of the game. We tried to fight hard from there but I think they got too much of a lead."</p>
        
            <p>As they have for much of their campaign, the Blues dominated up front, winning a slew of scrum penalties throughout the contest.</p>
        
            <p>They were also forced to defend fiercely, with the Brumbies having an edge in possession through their trademark phase play.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Caleb Clarke put the hosts 24-6 ahead inside the opening quarter when he crossed out wide off the back of a dominant scrum.</p>

            <p>The opening try came from the game's first passage of play, with the Blues using a patient build-up before second five-eighth AJ Lam crossed with less than two minutes into the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Close-range tries followed to hooker Ricky Riccitelli and lock Sam Darry, with the Brumbies' only response coming via two penalties to first five-eighth Noah Lolesio.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies appeared to have scored their first try but winger Corey Toole was bundled out in the corner by scything tackle from impressive Blues captain Dalton Papali'i.</p>
        
            <p>Rob Valetini finally crossed the tryline for the visitors but the Blues scored the final points of the first half through a Harry Plummer penalty goal.</p>
        
            <p>After a long period on defence after the break, the Blues surged downfield to set up Sotutu's try.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies gave themselves a glimmer of hope when reserve flanker Luke Reimer crossed with 10 minutes remaining but their chances plunged when lock Nick Frost was shown a yellow card for taking out Clarke in the air from the kickoff.</p>
        
            <p>Score:</p>
        
            <p>Blues 34 (AJ Lam, Ricky Riccitelli, Sam Darry, Caleb Clarke, Hoskins Sotutu tries; Harry Plummer 1pen, 3con) Brumbies 20 (Rob Valetini, Luke Reimer tries; Noah Lolesio 2pen, 2con). Halftime: 27-13.</p>
