            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have mounted a comeback for the ages to beat the New York Yankees 7-6 in game five of baseball's World Series and win their first World Series since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The Dodgers trailed 5-0 in the fifth inning and were down a run in the eighth before a sacrifice fly from All-Star Mookie Betts capped the biggest comeback win in a clinching game in World Series history.</p>
        
            <p>New York had hoped to become the first team to force a Game Six after trailing 0-3 in a World Series but fell flat in their first trip to the Fall Classic in 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>It was the largest comeback ever in a World Series clincher, surpassing the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates overcoming a four-run deficit in Game Seven against the Washington Senators.</p>
        
            <p>The showdown between two marquee franchises had been a boon for Major League Baseball, with Dodgers slugger Shohei Ohtani driving record TV ratings in his native Japan.</p>
