            <p>World heavyweight champion Daniel Dubois has withdrawn from his scheduled title defence against New Zealand's Joseph Parker this weekend after falling ill.</p>
        
            <p>Dubois, 27, who holds the IBF title, underwent a medical examination in Saudi Arabia and missed a scheduled media conference, prompting the decision to pull out. Details of his health status have not been released.</p>
        
            <p>"If he is ill, I hope he gets well soon and I'm looking forward to Saturday (Sunday morning NZ time) and a great show," said Parker, who will now face last-minute replacement Congolese fighter Martin Bakole.</p>
        
            <p>Promoter Spencer Brown said Parker doesn't mind who he fights.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever it's gonna be, Joe's there. There will be a fight Saturday. Whoever's there, Joe's ready to fight. He's ready to go. He's ready to win. Whoever we're gonna fight, Joe's up for it. He doesn't care. He's one of them fighters. He'll fight anybody."</p>
        
            <p>Parker said he's not fazed by the late change of rival.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm ready to go. I put in all the hard work for with my team in Ireland and I'm here now on Riyadh and come on Saturday."</p>
        
            <p>British-born Dubois took the interim belt in June by beating Filip Hrgovic and was upgraded to champion when Oleksandr Usyk vacated the title due to his rematch clause with Tyson Fury.</p>
        
            <p>Dubois then defended his title in September with a knockout win over fellow Briton Anthony Joshua at Wembley.</p>
        
            <p>Former world champion Parker, 33, claimed the World Boxing Organization (WBO) heavyweight title in 2016 by defeating Mexican Andy Ruiz. He lost the title to Joshua in 2018.</p>
