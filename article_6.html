            <p>The Black Caps' ODI cricket drought is finally over.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's last game in the 50-over format was almost a year ago, a nine-wicket win over Bangladesh in Napier on 23 December.</p>
        
            <p>Since then it's been a feast of T20 and tests for the Black Caps, including an historic test series win in India, and a dismal T20 World Cup campaign.</p>
        
            <p>The side will return to 50-over action tonight when they meet Sri Lanka in the first of a three match series.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead says it's simply the nature of the modern game.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what world cricket is, you go between three formats and you have to move quickly, the test series we had in India seems like months ago now."</p>
        
            <p>With the T20 World Cup taking place in June, One Day International's have been given a back-seat in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"There is not a World Cup for a period of time but we have a Champions Trophy coming up so will see a short burst of ODI's. I love the ODI game I think its a fantastic format, but with the cycles now, it's probably par for the course and something we are getting used to."</p>
        
            <p>With a change in format has also come a change in personnel.</p>

            <p>The Black Caps are fielding a second-string side in Sri Lanka, with the big names preparing for home summer against the English starting in December.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a different set of guys over here getting their opportunities to show their capabilities at this level."</p>
        
            <p>The campaign in Sri Lanka gives a glimpse into the future of the Black Caps, with rookies stepping up to defend a sub-par total in the second T20 on Sunday, and square the two match series.</p>
        
            <p>"It's exciting for us in the long term. You see the likes of Zac Foulkes show some calmness under pressure. Mitch Hay had a fantastic game with the gloves, so I think it's a good sign for our domestic game that it's producing guys that can come in and perform immediately at international level."</p>
        
            <p>With white ball cricket exclusively T20 so far this year, Stead said players will benefit from more time in the middle.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been playing on some difficult wickets in the T20's, so I think find your tempo in ODI cricket is a real shift, makes it easier to find that balance with the bat between scoring runs and surviving."</p>
        
            <p>Stead expects spin to again play a major part in sub-Continent conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"They have some very good spinners and I am sure it will be a big part about how we go shaping our team as well.</p>
        
            <p>One man who won't be taking part however will be seamer Lockie Ferguson, who, fresh off a hat-trick in the T20's, has been sent home to get scans on his calf.</p>
