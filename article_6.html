            <p>The Warriors hunt to replace their GOAT continues.</p>
        
            <p>With the retirement of club legend Shaun Johnson at the end of the 2023 NRL season, the Warriors are looking to strengthen their options in the halves.</p>
        
            <p>Their latest recruit is Gold Coast Titans halfback Tanah Boyd, who has signed a two-year contract with the club to the end of the 2026 NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old has amassed 69 NRL appearances since making his first-grade debut with the Titans in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors head of recruitment Andrew McFadden said Boyd was a player of proven quality who would add depth to the squad.</p>
        
            <p>A former Queensland under-20 representative, Boyd joins incumbent halfbacks Te Maire Martin, Luke Metcalf and Chanel Harris-Tavita.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster said Boyd's arrival would create healthy competition among the halves.</p>
        
            <p>"He brings a great kicking game, strong game management skills and he's also a proven goal kicker. We're really looking forward to having him at our club."</p>
        
            <p>Boyd said there was much to like about the direction of the club.</p>
        
            <p>"From Webby to the fans and the support the team gets. There's been plenty of players who have come this way in the past and in recent times who have proven that if you buy in, you can make an impact, and that's certainly what I plan on doing."</p>
