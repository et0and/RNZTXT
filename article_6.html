            <p>After all the hype and anticipation, the Warriors 2024 campaign is off to a losing start.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have been beaten in their season opener at Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>A packed stadium saw the Sharks pip the Warriors 16-12, with the home side kept score-less in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Tohu Harris said it was a bitter pill to swallow after so much excitement.</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Johnon was masterful with the boot, but the Warriors committed far too many errors with ball in hand.</p>
        
            <p>It was a hostile greeting for the visitors while the crowd erupted for their home town heroes.</p>
        
            <p>Things didn't take long to heat up, Braydon Trindall rattling Dallin Watene-Zelezniak's jaw with a high shot, granting the Warriors the first penalty and attacking set of the game.</p>
        
            <p>It took just nine minutes for the Warrior to crack Cronulla, Addin Fonua Blake crashing his way over the chalk.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts struck again moments later, Johnson securing the turnover and Luke Metcalf justifying his selection with a stunning piece of individual brilliance.</p>
        
            <p>The five-eighth danced his way through five Sharks defenders to score a screamer under the sticks.</p>
        
            <p>Compounding Cronulla's woes, they were pinged for a shove in the back, gifting the Warriors another golden opportunity on attack.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson sent a cross kick to Watene-Zelezniak who went aerial but was taken in the air by Ronaldo Mulitalo, the indiscretion leading to a penalty but bafflingly, not a penalty try.</p>

            <p>Another pinpoint Johnson kick gave the Warriors back to back repeat sets, but the Sharks somehow managed to survive under immense pressure.</p>
        
            <p>Some brilliant defence from Rocco Berry kept the Sharks at bay just before the break.</p>
        
            <p>Taine Tuaupiki was taken off for an HIA after a collision, Roger Tuivasa Sheck moved to the back.</p>
        
            <p>The Sharks then managed to pull one back before the break, Jesse Ramien powering his way over from dummy half, the crowd screaming for a review but to no avail.</p>
        
            <p>Cronulla sparked another attack in the final seconds of the first forty, Marcelo Montoya putting in a solid shot to kill the momentum, the sides heading to the sheds at 12-6.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors made a sloppy start to the second, Tuivasa-Sheck spilling a high one and Mulitalo scoring in the corner from the ensuing attack.</p>

            <p>Nicho Hynes pushed his conversion wide to keep the hosts ahead.</p>
        
            <p>A storming surge from Fonua-Blake brought the momentum back to the home side as the fans again found its substantial voice.</p>
        
            <p>Another Cronulla high tackle had the Sharks camped deep in their own half as Johnson forced another line drop out.</p>
        
            <p>They would survive and canter up field, Siosifa Talakai going in for his side's third try to take the lead for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Vice-captain Wayde Eagan left the field with a wrist injury, Freddy Lussick replacing the hooker.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson began to really stamp his authority, a typically jinking run forcing a fourth drop out, followed shortly by a fifth.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors were struggling to capitlise on their weight of possession, held scoreless for half an hour of the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Some monstrous defence with the Sharks on their own line forced an error, gifting the Warriors a scrum 10 metres out, right in front of the horns.</p>
        
            <p>Cronulla again repelled the onslaught, but were called on to defend their line a final time courtesy of Johnson's impeccable kicking game.</p>
        
            <p>But as was the story of the second for the home side, they could not convert the chance, the final whistle brining a palpable deflation from the fans.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 12 (Fonua-Blake, Metcalf, tries, Johnson 2 goals)</p>
        
            <p>Sharks 16 (Raimen, Mulitalo, Talakai, tries, Hynes 2 goals)</p>
