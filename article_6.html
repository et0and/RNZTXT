            <p>Australian driver Chaz Mostert led a Ford Mustang sweep in practice yesterday from Kiwi young gun Matt Payne.</p>
        
            <p>Mostert's first impressions of the circuit were extremely positive as he pushes for a podium performance to boost his overall position in the third leg of the Supercars Championship.</p>
        
            <p>In the championship, 17 points separate title leader Will Brown from Broc Feeney, with Mostert less than 100 points adrift in third after a consistent start to the year.</p>
        
            <p>"This track feels like an old school Supercars race," Mostert said.</p>
        
            <p>"The feel is so different from the last two we've been at, and it was nice to top practice, but I think we need to find a little more balance out of the car to get comfortable."</p>
        
            <p>This weekend marks the of Supercars to New Zealand shores with Kiwi motorsport fans hoping for a local victory.</p>
        
            <p>The inaugural Super 400 Championship at Taupō will see 200km races on the circuit on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

            <p>Kiwi Matt Payne (2nd) said it was a special feeling as he hopes to follow in the footsteps of decorated drivers like Scott McLaughlin and Shane van Gisbergen.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something I've never experienced before," Payne said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fan reception yesterday at the track-to-town parade was really cool. Coming into the main street, there were so many people packed in there."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Andre Heimgartner (6th), Jaxson Evans (8th) Ryan Woold (17th) and Bathurst champion Richie Stanaway (19th) were lapping up the opportunity to race at home.</p>
        
            <p>"As a New Zealander getting the opportunity to race back at home once a year gives us a chance to feel what it's like for all the Australian drivers that get to race at home on all the other rounds," Stanaway said</p>
        
            <p>"It's something we really appreciate."</p>
        
            <p>Taupō International Motorsport Park owner Tony Quinn expected 25,000 spectators each day.</p>

            <p>Two years after the sport farewelled Pukekohe, the slack is being picked up by Taupō, which is welcoming Supercars with fervour.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a well-known fact that motorsport in general is a very highly supported sport," Tony Quinn said.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't been here for a year of so, it's a sell-out, there's not a seat in the house."</p>
        
            <p>Reigning champion Brodie Kostecki (12th) makes his highly anticipated return to Supercars, and after missing the first two rounds of the season, he has no time to waste if he wants a shot at defending his title.</p>
