            <p>A Marnus Labuschagne half-century and stubborn tail-end batting drove Australia to a 333-run lead at the end of day four in the fourth test in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving India facing a record chase to steal an unlikely victory.</p>
        
            <p>Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland marched off to a huge ovation from home fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having combined for an unbeaten 55-run partnership for the final wicket as Australia went to stumps at 228 for nine.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon was 41 not out, with number 11 Boland on 10.</p>
        
            <p>With the five-test series level at 1-1, India's pace dynamo Jasprit Bumrah had threatened to turn the match on its head with a three-wicket burst before tea in front of 43,867 fans.</p>
        
            <p>But Labuschagne (70) and Australia captain Pat Cummins (41) steadied the hosts with a 57-run partnership before Boland and Lyon frustrated India further.</p>
        
            <p>The day ended sourly for the tourists when Bumrah had Lyon caught in the slips with a no-ball in the final over.</p>
        
            <p>Only one team has ever chased more than 300 for victory in a test at the MCG - England mowed down 332 runs to beat Australia in 1928.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's rearguard resistance compensated for some shoddy middle order batting.</p>
        
            <p>Having been in command at 80 for two, Australia lost four wickets for 11 runs in a Bumrah-led onslaught to slump to 91 for six.</p>
        
            <p>Mohammed Siraj triggered the collapse when Steve Smith chased a wide, full delivery and nicked behind to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to be out for 13.</p>
        
            <p>Bumrah steamed in to have Travis Head caught at square leg for one and earn his 200th test wicket.</p>
        
            <p>He struck again four balls later to remove number six Mitchell Marsh for a duck with a gloved catch to Pant before bowling Alex Carey through bat and pad for two.</p>
        
            <p>Australia were reeling but Cummins rode out the storm with typical defiance.</p>
        
            <p>Having scored 49 in the first innings, he produced a vital 41 to stall India's momentum.</p>
        
            <p>When Labuschagne was out lbw to Siraj, Cummins added another 25 runs with Mitchell Starc (five) and Lyon before falling to the spin of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.</p>
        
            <p>Fielding mishaps also cost India dearly.</p>
        
            <p>Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped two chances, with Labuschagne spared at 46 when he nicked Akash Deep to the gully and Usman Khawaja reprieved on two with a spill at leg gully.</p>
        
            <p>Khawaja went on to make 21 before Siraj bowled him in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Nitish Kumar Reddy also missed a tough chance to remove Cummins for nine, misjudging the flight of the ball when the Aussie skipper slogged over mid-off.</p>
        
            <p>India may still count themselves blessed to be in the game at all, having been on the ropes early on day three until Reddy rescued them with a maiden century.</p>
        
            <p>Reddy finished with 114, his 189-ball vigil ended by spinner Lyon a few overs into the fourth morning.</p>
        
            <p>The healthy day four crowd brought total match attendance to 299,329, a record for a Boxing Day test in Melbourne.</p>
