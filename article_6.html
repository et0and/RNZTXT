            <p>A Canterbury rugby coach has been temporarily banned from coaching after misconduct towards a referee.</p>
        
            <p>A coach had been accused of assaulting a referee in Ashburton on 20 July, at the end of the senior B semi-final match between Hampstead and Celtic.</p>
        
            <p>Celtic B won the semi-final at Hampstead Rugby and All Sports Club 25 points to 20.</p>
        
            <p>Mid Canterbury Rugby Union said a judicial hearing was held last Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>It found the coach guilty of using threatening words or actions and grabbing the referee's shirt.</p>
        
            <p>However, it did not substantiate any further allegations of referee assault during or after the match, the union said.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Tanya Dearns said according to the New Zealand Rugby Disciplinary Rules, the behaviour could have resulted in a 23-match suspension.</p>
        
            <p>"After considering both the mitigating and aggravating factors, the suspension was reduced by eight matches, resulting in a 15-match ban from coaching or any involvement with teams playing matches," Dearns said.</p>
        
            <p>"Respect for referees is fundamental to the integrity of the game," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We take these matters very seriously and are committed to maintaining a respectful environment for all participants."</p>
        
            <p>Mid Canterbury Rugby Union said heightened emotions among sideline supporters after the final whistle might have contributed to the incident and this would be addressed directly with the club.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said officers were called to the ground but no charges had been laid.</p>
