            <p>The Scottish government has backed a bid for Glasgow to host a scaled-down version of the Commonwealth Games in 2026, 12 years after the city last hosted the quadrennial multi-sport event.</p>
        
            <p>The Games were originally slated for the Australian state of Victoria, but they withdrew as hosts due to rising costs.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been working with Commonwealth Games Scotland and the Scottish Government for several months and are delighted to hear CGS has received confirmation of support from the Government to enable them to progress with their proposal to host the Games in 2026," Commonwealth Games Federation president Chris Jenkins said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>At the heart of discussions, Jenkins said, is the 100 million pounds (NZ$213.00 million) investment from the CGF and the commitment that Glasgow 2026 would not require financial underwriting from either the Scottish or UK Governments.</p>
        
            <p>Commonwealth Games Australia also committed a multimillion pound investment to help finalise the Glasgow deal, "a strong sign of the support and excitement for the concept within the wider Commonwealth Games Movement," Jenkins said.</p>
        
            <p>The Glasgow proposal is for a scaled-down version of previous Games, with 10 sports to be held in four venues.</p>
        
            <p>"The Commonwealth Games are a key pathway for elite athletes, a great event for spectators, and a fantastic opportunity to bring together the Commonwealth family of nations in a positive and impactful way," a UK government spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a positive outcome for the Commonwealth Games movement and for the United Kingdom, and an opportunity to showcase what a new, more sustainable model for the Games looks like to assure its future as an event to 2030 and beyond."</p>

            <p>Close to 5000 athletes from 71 nations competed in 18 sports at the 2014 Games in the Scottish city. The budget was $1,225 billion, with $192 million spent on security.</p>
        
            <p>The total budget for the Games is expected to be about $243 million, the BBC reported.</p>
        
            <p>There had been concern the Games -- first held in the Canadian city of Hamilton in 1930 as the former British Empire Games -- would cease to exist altogether as the CGF struggled to find hosts.</p>
        
            <p>In March, Malaysia rejected an offer to hold the 2026 Games due to time constraints, costs and an insufficient offer of funding, in another major setback for the event.</p>
        
            <p>Malaysia was asked to step in after Victoria withdrew.</p>
        
            <p>"We will work closely with CGS to positively conclude final stakeholder discussions with the aim of formally announcing Glasgow as the host city for 2026 as soon as possible," Jenkins said.</p>
        
            <p>Durban was set to be first African city to host the Games in 2022, but ran into money troubles, with Birmingham and the British government stepping in to salvage the event.</p>
