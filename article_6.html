            <p>Hutt Valley mountain biker Erice van Leuven is optmistic about her recovery after surviving the biggest crash of her life.</p>
        
            <p>The 18-year-old broke her neck, back and wrist and has damaged a lung and her liver after catching her rear wheel while trying to clear an 85-foot jump at an event in Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>"I went over the bars and hit my head, I don't really remember the rest," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I first went to the hospital I thought it would be a few ribs and my wrist."</p>
        
            <p>Scans revealed the severity of the injuries van Leuven had sustained.</p>
        
            <p>She has been awaiting clearance from doctors that her lung is strong enough for her to make the trip home to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Her chest protector has been removed, but she continues to wear a neck brace.</p>
        
            <p>Van Leuven's mother will travel home with her - with a detour on the way home to the Halberg Awards in Auckland next Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'll have a nice accessory for that," she said, referring to her neck brace.</p>
        
            <p>The two-time junior women's world champion shows no sign of slowing down, saying her excitement was already building for next year's competition.</p>
