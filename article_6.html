            <p>New Zealand track cyclist Ellesse Andrews has left the field in her wake to win gold in the women's keirin at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old from Christchurch dominated the six-woman final, proving untouchable over the closing lap as she added to the silver medal she won in the same event at the previous Games in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews hit the front on the penultimate lap and, despite the challengers lining up behind her, she could not be caught, winning by 0.062 seconds from Dutch rider Hetty van de Wouw. Great Britain's Emma Finucane took bronze.</p>
        
            <p>It was a second medal of the Games for Andrews, who was part of the silver-medal winning team sprint on the opening night of track cycling competition in Versailles.</p>
        
            <p>It adds to a career tally that includes a world championship gold in Glasgow last year, along with a trio of golds on the track at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games.</p>
