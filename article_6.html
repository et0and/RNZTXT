            <p>A Chiefs side inspired by rampaging No.8 Wallace Sititi upset the Hurricanes 30-19 to set up a Super Rugby Pacific final against the Blues.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs scored two of their three tries in the opening six minutes to take control of the semi-final in Wellington and a perfect six-from-six shots at goal from first five-eighth Damian McKenzie kept them in front.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues will host the all-New Zealand final at Eden Park on Saturday after they beat the ACT Brumbies 34-20 in Friday's first semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>It's a chance for one team to make amends after both lost finals to the Crusaders over the last two seasons, with the Chiefs falling short last year.</p>
        
            <p>They will chase their first title since winning back-to-back finals in 2012 and 2013, while the three-time champion Blues last claimed the full Super Rugby silverware in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>The top-qualifying Hurricanes were favoured to advance in front of their home supporters and stretch their winning streak at home to 10 matches.</p>

            <p>However, they were rocked onto the back foot early on and couldn't recover from a 17-7 halftime deficit, with McKenzie dictacting play with his boot in general play as well as amassing 15 points.</p>
        
            <p>However, the standout performer was 21-year-old Sititi, whose breakthrough performance included numerous effective charges with the ball and some thunderous defence.</p>
        
            <p>It was his 60m surge midway through the second half which set up a try for winger Daniel Rona at a point where a Hurricanes fightback appeared to be gathering momentum.</p>
        
            <p>Player of the match Wallace Sititi told Sky Sport the Chiefs knew a strong opening was crucial.</p>
        
            <p>"We started really well and I think that set us alight," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We made a few errors and let them back in the game but we were able to fight back and get momentum again.</p>
        
            <p>"We talked about heart, accuracy and effort and we can't fault the effort out there, but the job ain't done yet."</p>

            <p>The Chiefs lost fullback Shaun Stevenson to an undisclosed injury before kickoff while their All Blacks hooker Samisoni Taukei'aho limped off with a leg ailment midway through the first half.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors were also twice reduced to 14 players, with Samipeni Finau shown a yellow card for a late collision in the first half and fellow-flanker Luke Jacobson sanctioned the same way for a similar offence after the break.</p>
        
            <p>However, their defence largely held firm, reducing the threat of a Hurricanes attack which has terrorised defences this season.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs raced 14-0 ahead through sweeping tries to Finau and scrum-half Cortez Ratima.</p>
        
            <p>Both were converted by McKenzie, who added a penalty before the Hurricanes got a foothold in the game, crossing through flanker Peter Lakai.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie's second penalty stretched the lead to 13 points before a high-octane Hurricanes attack ended in a try to fly-half Brett Cameron.</p>
        
            <p>The match swung on an intercept from Sititi as the Hurricanes threatend to go in front, storming downfield to set up Rona's try.</p>
        
            <p>A 50m penalty goal from McKenzie was followed by a Hurricanes try to Billy Proctor but the hosts couldn't pull off a miracle over the dying minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes captain Brad Shields said his side never found their rhythm after their slow start.</p>
        
            <p>"Those two tries the Chiefs got were a bit of a shock, I suppose," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just gutted because if you look back on our season, we're extremely proud of what we've achieved and put ourselves in a really good position. We just couldn't get there tonight, which is tough to take."</p>
