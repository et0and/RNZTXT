            <p>With two games left to qualify for the World Cup All Whites coach Darren Bazelely is focused on just one thing, winning.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand qualified for the Oceania semi-finals with an 8-0 victory over Samoa in their last group game in Auckland on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>That meant they finished top of their group and will play Fiji in the OFC semi-finals in Wellington in March while New Caledonia will play Tahiti.</p>
        
            <p>The OFC final will then be held in Auckland three days later with the winner qualifying for the 2026 World Cup in North America while the loser will go to an intercontinental play-off game.</p>
        
            <p>"We just have to win, we've got two games now to qualify for the World Cup," Bazeley said following the game against Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the opposition now, we just have to prepare properly and go and win those games."</p>
        
            <p>While happy with their latest games in New Zealand where they beat Vanuatu 8-1 and Samoa 8-0, Bazelely knows how weaker opposition can be challenging.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had this before where teams, while losing are trying to kill the game, but it's knockout now so it will be a different type of game."</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites dominated with almost 90 percent of possession and territory against Samoa in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>But it took a while for the home team to get on the score sheet with Callum McCowatt opening the scoring in the 24th minute.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a challenging game, an easy game, but a weird game," Bazeley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Samoa defended bravely which made it difficult and there was not a lot of space, I felt we could have done a lot better in trying to unlock that.</p>
        
            <p>"When you win 8-0 in an international game I can't really be critical... it was sort of win the game and move on."</p>

            <p>Bazeley has said selection is becoming more difficult with so many players competing at a high level around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"They go back to their clubs now and it's up to them now to keep performing, keep developing... we'll be watching."</p>
        
            <p>On Monday night captain Chris Wood scored a hat-trick of goals, McCowatt, Marko Stamenic, Francis De Vries, Elijah Just and Ben Waine got the others.</p>
        
            <p>It was Stamenic's second goal for New Zealand and he was particularly proud to have played as he is part Samoan.</p>
        
            <p>He had his extended family and friends on hand to watch him at Mount Smart and now can't wait for the semi-final back in his home town of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"Awesome to go back home, I haven't been home in Wellington for a long time now so to see more of my family and friends will be really exciting," the Greece based midfielder said.</p>
