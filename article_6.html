            <p>Hooker Wayde Egan has signed a two-year contract extension with the Warriors, keeping him at Mt Smart until the end of 2027. Egan has been one of the standouts in an up and down Warriors season, with a string of good performances putting him in the conversation for a New South Wales call up in this year's State of Origin series.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old had previously extended his contract to the end of 2025 only last July. Egan, who now has a total of 117 NRL appearances, joined the Warriors for the 2020 season after 29 appearances for the Penrith Panthers in 2018 and 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He started this season in similar vein with a series of performances which saw him singled out as a contender for this year's New South Wales State of Origin side. Egan has averaged 40 tackles a game, racking up 58 in the Warriors' round six 22-all draw with the Sea Eagles.</p>
        
            <p>"Wayde has shown his class consistently as one of the best hookers in the game," Warriors general manager recruitment, pathways and development Andrew McFadden said.</p>
        
            <p>"He is thriving in the environment we have here and he's passionate about the club. We're thrilled to have him with us long term."</p>
        
            <p>Egan is in line to play his 100th match for the Warriors this season, boosting his tally to 88 in Sunday's clash against the Sydney Roosters.</p>
        
            <p>"Wayde is vital to us as an elite hooker - one of the smartest around - and as a leader on and off the field," Warriors head coach Andrew Webster said.</p>
        
            <p>"He loves it here and we love having him. We've got a style of play we put around him so he can show his talent. He's exceptional and a player I'd like to see at our club for many years to come."</p>
        
            <p>Egan and the Warriors face a tough challenge at this weekend's NRL Magic Round at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, they face the defending premier Penrith Panthers. They are in desperate need of a win after four straight defeats have left them 14th on the NRL ladder.</p>
