            <p>Wellington Phoenix scored in the eighth and final minute of extra time to complete a stunning 3-2 A-League women's win over the Newcastle Jets in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>Trailing 2-0 at halftime, the home side staged a comeback with a strong wind at their back, capped by Manaia Elliott's goal direct from a corner kick in what was virtually the last act of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Elliott's curling cross could only be touched by the glove of Jets goalkeeper Danielle Krzyzania as it sailed into the net, greeted with jubilation by the Phoenix players.</p>
        
            <p>Victory over struggling Newcastle lifts Wellington from sixth to fourth in the standings heading into a match away to Central Coast Mariners on Sunday next week.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Temple's team will hope they can produce the same fight, having fallen behind to two goals from Jets striker Sheridan Gallagher in the first spell at Porirua Park.</p>
        
            <p>Temple made a key change at halftime, introducing Elliott, who finished the match with two goals.</p>
        
            <p>She had an impact six minutes after the restart, diving bravely for a low header to score from a cross delivered by captain Annalie Longo.</p>

            <p>Eight minutes later Longo levelled the scores after good buildup work from Elliott and Emma Main - another second-half substitute - with the skipper slotting home a parried save from Krzyzaniak.</p>
        
            <p>Elliott's spectacular late score handed the Phoenix their fourth straight win in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>It also extracted a measure of revenge, having lost their third-round match away to Newcastle 1-0 in November.</p>
        
            <p>The match was the 50th for Phoenix midfielder Alyssa Whinham.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old became the second women's player at the club to reach the milestone after defender Mackenzie Barry.</p>
