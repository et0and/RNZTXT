            <p>Finishing off a degree at Harvard and trying to qualify for the Olympics is something young New Zealand runner Maia Ramsden is taking in her stride.</p>
        
            <p>The well travelled middle distance athlete has dreamt of wearing the black singlet and she hopes that will happen in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The 21 year old, who was born in the US, has a New Zealand father and an American mother.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden hit the headlines in June with victory in the NCAA 1500m, setting a personal best of 4:08.60</p>
        
            <p>Maia's father works for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and she moved around a lot as a youngster with her father's work.</p>
        
            <p>She has lived in New York, Wellington, the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Ethiopia.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020 she moved back to Wellington to start University and for the last couple of years has been at the private Ivy League university in Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>She's now close to qualifying for an Olympics, something that probably didn't cross her mind as a youngster competing in Weetbix Tryathlons in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"It is my main goal going into 2024," Ramsden told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely my dream, and I think more of a concrete goal now more than it has ever been."</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden took up running seriously while she was at secondary school in Fiji and not long after set her sights on representing New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She studies History and Literature at Harvard and will graduate in May, just two months before the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>She hopes to have impressed selectors by then.</p>
        
            <p>Her aim is to get to the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow in March and will continue to keep up an intense training programme while she finishes off her degree.</p>
        
            <p>So is representing New Zealand in the 1500m in 2024 realistic?</p>
        
            <p>"I need to run a bit quicker than I have but my coach thinks that's possible and so that's the first step, taking a few more seconds off my PB's."</p>
        
            <p>With the IAAF now allowing qualification on rankings as well as time, that could help.</p>
        
            <p>"For me it means there is a pathway to Olympic qualification which would be just a dream come true."</p>
        
            <p>She will have to get invites to some high ranking events in North America and Europe, to improve her chances.</p>
        
            <p>"My coach (Harvard coach Alex Gibby) and I have talked about what we need to do to make it happen, however I recognise that I'm young and it's a hard team and event to make."</p>
        
            <p>She will also have to juggle her time between running and studies.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously I have some other obligations with school, but I think it is still very possible and that's my goal.</p>
        
            <p>"With the school it's like a bit of a distraction, it gives me something else to do and be excited and passionate about.</p>
        
            <p>"I do hope to have many years ahead of me in this sport, so if it doesn't happen, I'll be a bit disappointment but I won't be devastated and so I'll be able to use that as motivation the next time around.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden has the support of shoe manufacturer On Running, which under new NCAA rules allows a relationship while she continues her studies.</p>
