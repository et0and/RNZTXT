            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko has won the season-opening LPGA tournament in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-six-year-old Ko shot a two-under 70 at the HGV Tournament of Champions to win by two shots and claim the 20th LPGA title of her career.</p>
        
            <p>Heading into the 18th, she held a three shot lead and bogied the final hole though she had already done enough to secure the win.</p>
        
            <p>Ko pockets $368,000 for the victory, taking her career earnings to more than $28 million.</p>
        
            <p>It was a tough 2023 for Ko who was winless on the tour which included shooting her worst-ever round on the LPGA Tour.</p>
        
            <p>However she finished the year by winning the Grant Thornton Invitational mixed team tournament with Australian Jason Day.</p>
        
            <p>The win means Ko is just a point from qualifying for the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>She is currently ranked 12th in the world</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday fellow New Zealander Steven Alker won on the PGA Champions Tour.</p>
        
            <p>....more to come.</p>
