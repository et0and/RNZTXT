            <p>Former Australian professional cyclist Rohan Dennis has pleaded guilty over an incident which resulted in the death of his Olympian wife Melissa Hoskins last December.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Dennis entered a guilty plea to one aggravated count of creating likelihood of harm relating to a crash at the front of the couple's Medindie home in Adelaide's inner-north.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors dropped a charge of dangerous driving causing death and an aggravated charge of driving without due care.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskins, a mother-of-two, was struck by a car driven by Dennis outside their home on 30 December.</p>
        
            <p>The Adelaide Magistrates Court heard prosecutors accepted the plea to the new charge because Dennis was reckless, and did not intend to kill his wife.</p>
        
            <p>After almost 12 months of negotiations the prosecution accepted that Dennis was not responsible for causing the death of the 32-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>Prominent barrister Jane Abbey KC, representing Dennis, told the court the new charge was admitted on the basis of recklessness.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no intention of Mr Dennis to harm his wife - and this charge does not charge him with responsibility for her death," she told the court.</p>
        
            <p>An aggravated charge of creating likelihood of harm carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment and a five-year loss of licence.</p>
        
            <p>Dennis has been committed to the District Court for sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>On the night Hoskins was hit by the car, emergency services were called to the scene on Avenel Gardens Road just after 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskins was taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital with serious injuries and "died in hospital overnight", police said the following morning.</p>
        
            <p>Her death triggered an outpouring of grief within the cycling community, including from her former Olympic teammate Amy Cure, who wrote on social media: "You will be forever missed my sister."</p>
        
            <p>The world champion cyclist was laid to rest at a funeral in Fremantle in her hometown of Perth in January.</p>
        
            <p>The following month, her family and former teammates gathered in Adelaide for a public memorial service, which was attended by Dennis, on what would have been her 33rd birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskins was a two-time Olympian and a renowned road and track cyclist who represented Australia at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>She won gold in the women's team pursuit at the 2015 World Championships.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskins retired from professional cycling two years later, announcing the decision, as well as her engagement to Dennis, in an interview with website Cyclingnews in 2017.</p>
