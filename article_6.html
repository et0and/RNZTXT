            <p>NPC final: Wellington v Bay of Plenty</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 3.05pm Saturday, 26 October</p>
        
            <p>Sky Stadium, Wellington</p>

            <p>While provincial rugby's big prize is on the line at Sky Stadium on Saturday afternoon, bragging rights of a different but no less important kind will be too at halftime. Mascots from 14 unions will be racing the length of the field in a no-holds-barred showdown and repeat of last year's edition, that was arguably the highlight of the New Zealand rugby season.</p>
        
            <p>"Provincial pride is so strong, not just among players but also the mascots," NZ Rugby Marketing Manager Charlotte Mooney said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have long connections to fan clubs and iconic moments in provincial unions, so we really wanted to promote that. The race from last year was one of the highest rated YouTube clips on the All Blacks channel, it went viral and was picked up by the international media. We're trying to make it a tradition. Sky Sport are giving it full coverage and Nisbo (Grant Nisbett) will commentate."</p>
        
            <p>The 2023 race, held at Yarrow Stadium in New Plymouth, was notable for the settling of at least one high profile feud, when Wellington's Leo the Lion annihilated Kahu the Hawke's Bay magpie with a shoulder charge. It was later confirmed to be vengeance for Hawke's Bay taking the Ranfurly Shield off Wellington and winning the semi-final between the two sides the weekend before.</p>
        
            <p>It was one of many acts of inter-mascot violence, with the race eventually won by Thames Valley's Swamp Fox.</p>
        
            <p>So what happens this time around? Let's look at the form guide for what should be an exciting race on a heavy track:</p>
        
            <p>Whanganui's Barrie the Butcher is the only mascot who will be armed (with his trademark cleaver), which is a significant advantage offset a little bit by having to run in freezing works gumboots. The Swamp Fox will be confident of defending his title after his side's big Meads Cup win last weekend, while Steely Dan from Counties-Manukau has the bulk and will be hard to stop if he gets a roll on early. However, keep an eye on Steve-O the Southland Stag, who is looking in fine fettle.</p>

            <p>Leo the Lion has home ground advantage but there are questions about whether he can keep his emotions in check. Tane the Taniwha from Northland and Hori BOP may well threaten the leaders, while Winger the Auckland seagull had a falling out midseason with former ally Mr. Potato that led to a scrap in the middle of Eden Park. Will that be a motivating factor?</p>

            <p>Harry the Harbour dog is clearly out of shape, Mooloo from Waikato is almost 100 years old, while Taranaki's Ferdinand has reportedly spent too much time partying with the Ranfurly Shield to be a threat. Hopefully not as much as Kahu from Hawkes' Bay did last year, though.</p>

            <p>Canterbury's Larry the Lamb and Marco the Tasman Mako are easily the laziest attempts at mascot costumes given that they're only really masks and team jerseys. The resulting grotesque appearances due to having the heads of beasts and bare arms of men is reminiscent of a David Cronenberg-esque body horror nightmare, but without the budget.</p>

            <p>South Canterbury's Tim and Ru, the only mascot duo in the country, sadly haven't made the trip to Wellington despite strong runs last year. Meanwhile, Otago doesn't seem to have a mascot ever since Shaq the Cat's dark past was revealed.</p>
