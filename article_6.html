            <p>Hutt Valley mountain biker Erice van Leuven has defended her world junior downhill title.</p>
        
            <p>17 year old Van Leuven dominated the field on the challenging 2.1km downhill course in Andorra, finishing over six seconds clear of her nearest competitor.</p>
        
            <p>"This means so much to me. To back it up is incredible and to do it with some of my whanau here is really special," said van Leuven.</p>

            <p>It was again a multi-kiwi celebration, with Auckland's Sacha Earnest repeating her bronze medal from last year in Glasgow.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand nearly pulled off another clean sweep, with 17-year-old Tauranga rookie, Eliana Hulsebosch finishing fourth, three seconds behind Earnest.</p>
        
            <p>Van Leuven, who rides for the Commencal les Orres professional team, was in a league of her own in the junior women's final.</p>
        
            <p>As the top qualifier, she was last off, and was a second up after the first time check. She increased that to five seconds at marker two, six seconds at time check three and 6.5 seconds at the final from Sweden's Ella Svegby.</p>
        
            <p>"To get three of us in the top four is so sic," said van Leuven. "Obviously it would have been really cool to get another 1-2-3 but three in the top four is pretty incredible - so stoked for us girls.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really pleased with that run. It was a bit sketchy in spots but overall I was happy with it and was just having fun. With the changing conditions I was really focussed and making sure I had my lines. Practice wasn't great but finals was perfect.</p>
        
            <p>"The track was very different because the elites practised in the mud yesterday, so that chewed up the track quite a lot. The grip for our race was actually perfect."</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch rider Luke Wayman was seventh in the junior men's race.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Sam Gaze is a chance in the world short course cross country event later in the programme.</p>
