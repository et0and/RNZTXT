            <p>New Zealand swimmer Lewis Clareburt was shut out of the medals in the final of the Olympic men's 400m individual medley, finishing sixth in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt finished just under two seconds off a place on the podium in a race won in spectacular style by French gold medal favourite Leon Marchand.</p>
        
            <p>Marchand pulled away from the start and was never threatened, clocking an Olympic record winning time of 4 minutes 02.95 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Japan's Matsushita Tomoyuri was some distance back second and American Carson Foster third.</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt's time of 4:10.44 was 0.72sec slower than his time when he clinched world championship gold at the world championships in Doha in February.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew that I'm a better swimmer than what I showed today," Clareburt said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's the Olympics, and there's no second chances here, right? I just wasn't able to execute the race I wanted to. Sixth is the final result unfortunately."</p>
        
            <p>"The first 200 metres I felt like I swum it just about perfect. I thought I would have more on the breaststroke to give. I felt good on the first 25m of the breaststroke, but then it fell apart a little. I wasn't able to get my rhythm that I like. Then the freestyle I was hoping I had a bit left it the tank to be able to bring it home, but unfortunately I was already too far behind."</p>
        
            <p>Sitting at the side of the pool after the race was a moment of reflection, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a really tough couple of years, and I guess to have it finish that way, it's not a fairytale ending, so to have these last couple of years of build-up and this was the moment when I was meant to execute, and I had a small reflection on the side of the pool.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it was a little bit of being overwhelmed in the moment, but also thankful that I was able to finish today and now move on from it."</p>
        
            <p>The wait for New Zealand to break the 28-year medal drought in the Olympic pool goes on.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather placed fourth in the final for her favoured 400m freestyle event on Sunday.</p>
