            <p>After an injury-plagued couple of seasons with the Wellington Phoenix women, Annalie Longo is fit again and ready to put the captain's armband back on for another season in the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>Longo missed the entire 2022-23 season after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament and 12 games into last season, she was once again sidelined with an Achilles injury.</p>
        
            <p>"That was one of the big reasons why I wanted to return to the Phoenix because there have obviously been some great foundations laid over the last three seasons and unfortunately last season I was a little bit hampered with a niggly injury," Longo said.</p>
        
            <p>The 136-cap Football Fern overcame injury to play at her fourth Olympic Games in France this year and felt like she still had "a lot more to give".</p>
        
            <p>"The Olympic campaign was a bit of a whirlwind of emotions but once I returned home I felt my body was in a really good position and physically and mentally I felt really good, so it made the decision very easy to come back and return to the Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really excited to be part of the group again. We learnt a lot last season and I think everybody is really looking forward to getting back together and having a really good pre-season and trying to create a bit of history for the club."</p>

            <p>Last season under coach Paul Temple the Phoenix finished 8th, the highest finish in the team's history.</p>
        
            <p>Longo believed the Phoenix should be playing finals this season which kicks off on 1 November.</p>
        
            <p>"Paul has done a really good job and now the key is to evolve our environment so people can continue to thrive.</p>
        
            <p>"My job as captain and one of the leaders in the team is to ensure we create that good environment so players are continuing to enjoy their football and want to represent the club well.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to continue to try and help the younger players and drive the team forward, and hopefully we can do something special this season."</p>

            <p>Temple said it was "essential" he brought Longo back for the 2024-25 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"Last season Annalie really stood up as a leader within the group despite having to battle with a few frustrating injuries that restricted her gametime," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"She is a greatly appreciated, respected and valuable member of the team, and she's such a smart footballer, good person and great role model.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there is an element of unfinished business for Annalie. Her mentality is still strong and she's passionate about the style of football we play.</p>
        
            <p>"And on top of her leadership Annalie is a great player in her own right. In my opinion she is one of the very best New Zealand has ever produced in the women's game."</p>
        
            <p>Longo was a serial winner, having won seven national league titles and two A-League championships. And she was fresh off winning three trophies with Cashmere Technical this season.</p>
        
            <p>"Cashmere Tech did a really good job in helping me make that Olympic squad by providing the right environment to get back into training, and the right competition.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always been one of my priorities is to try and give back to the game, and I just enjoy playing.</p>
        
            <p>"To come back and play for a club that did so well this season, winning the qualifying league, the South Island league and the Reta Fitzpatrick Cup, which was a pretty significant achievement for Cashmere Tech, was great to be part of."</p>
        
            <p>Longo is the 18th player confirmed in Phoenix women's first team squad, with pre-season training starting next week.</p>
