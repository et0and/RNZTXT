            <p>A knee injury has ruled Black Caps pace bowler Ben Sears out of the test series against India beginning on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Sears experienced pain in his left knee while training during the recent test series in Sri Lanka and underwent scans on his return to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Scans revealed a tear to his meniscus and on medical advice the 26-year-old will not travel to India.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Volts bowler Jacob Duffy has been called into the side as Sears' replacement but will not arrive in time for the start of the first test.</p>
        
            <p>Duffy has featured in six ODIs and 14 T20Is for New Zealand and currently has 299 first-class wickets to his name.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps head coach Gary Stead said he was hopeful Sears would make a fast recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"We're obviously disappointed for Ben who made a strong start to his test career during the home summer and offers a genuine pace option," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It remains to be seen how long we'll be without him for, but we're hopeful his road to a full recovery will be a short one."</p>
        
            <p>Stead said Duffy was a chance to make his test debut during the three-test series.</p>
        
            <p>Selecting players at a time when no domestic cricket was being played in New Zealand could be challenging, Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"Jacob's recent experience playing for Nottinghamshire in the County Championship certainly pushed his place. His performances in white-ball cricket for the Black Caps have always been impressive and we're confident he'll be able to contribute if called upon."</p>
        
            <p>Sears' unavailability gives former captain Tim Southee a better chance of being selected for the test - the first of which will be played since he stepped down from the skipper role.</p>
        
            <p>The test series against India begins on Wednesday evening at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.</p>
