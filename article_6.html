            <p>Coach Clayton McMillan called for a complete performance and it was about as close as it gets to one for his team tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie furthered his case to be the first-choice first five for the All Blacks with another clinic as the Chiefs dispatched the Western Force 51-7 in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Daniel Rona's stocks also continue to rise, after he bagged himself a hat-trick in the rout - though he was quick to deflect any praise as he spoke to Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"[I was] just on the end of some good plays."</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs captain Kaylum Boshier said it was a performance to be proud of.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always things we can work on. We have been up and down, so it's great to put two games back to back like we have."</p>
        
            <p>Boshier said the team's collision work in particular had lifted in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"We are starting to win the physical battle and we are getting the rewards; the boys are confident."</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs put points on the board straight from the kick off as the Force conceded a penalty, McKenzie converting the regulation shot at goal.</p>
        
            <p>Just a few minutes later and the Chiefs would score the opening try. After firing it wide, Emoni Narawa took the inside ball from Rona and showcased his skill to keep himself infield as he grassed it in the corner for an early 8-0 lead.</p>
        
            <p>After setting up the first, Rona went in for the second after rocketing to the blindside with Cortez Ratima spotting the chance and shifting it left to his winger.</p>
        
            <p>A dominant scrum put the hosts in for a third after just 20 minutes, as Ratima again went blind to find McKenzie who strolled over.</p>
        
            <p>Another powerful scrum won the Chiefs a penalty with lock Tupou Vaa'i scoring a few phases later.</p>
        
            <p>The Force finally got themselves some reward when James Doleman awarded the visitors a penalty try and he sent Boshier to the bin.</p>
        
            <p>They looked to go back to back, but were held up over the chalk right as the siren sounded to send the sides to the sheds at 29-7.</p>
        
            <p>It took a little over five minutes after oranges for the Chiefs to strike again in a clinical fashion, hooker Bradley Slater barging his way over from a copybook rolling maul.</p>
        
            <p>More magic from McKenzie set Rona up for a double - a hop, skip and a jump before offloading capping the first five's masterful effort.</p>
        
            <p>Restored to 15 and then gaining a one-man advantage with Force midfielder Hamish Stewart shown yellow, the Chiefs and Tyrone Thompson took immediate advantage - the replacement hooker powering his way through three Force defenders to score in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>Rona's third and the Chiefs' half century came shortly after on the back of another barnstorming burst from Thompson, and some slick handling with Anton Lienert-Brown making the final pass.</p>
        
            <p>Rona almost picked up a fourth - Etene Nanai-Seturo busting the line with his trademark footwork and kicking ahead as Rona was just pipped in the chase, but it was popped up for Josh Ioane to score a ninth for the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>The one-sided win see the Chiefs move to third, though they could be leapfrogged by the Brumbies should they get past the Drua in Canberra later tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers: </p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 56 (Rona 3, Narawa, McKenzie, Vaa'i, Slater, Thompson, Ioane, tries, McKenzie, 4 cons, 1 pen)</p>
        
            <p>Force 7 (Penalty Try)</p>
