            <p>Former All Black star Ma'a Nonu has become France rugby's elite Top 14 competition's oldest player, lining up for Toulon today at the age of 42 years, 10 months and eight days.</p>
        
            <p>Nonu, a double Rugby World Cup winner, eclipsed the record of another New Zealander, tighthead prop Karena Wihongi, who was 40 years and 98 days when he made his final appearance for Castres against Agen in January 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Nonu came on as a replacement for winger Gabin Villiere in the second half of Toulon's match against Castres, helping set up Fijian winger Jiuta Wainiqolo's try in the 74th minute.</p>
        
            <p>It was not enough as Castres won the match, 28-26.</p>
        
            <p>Toulon signed up Nonu last month as medical cover for the injured Charles Ollivon.</p>
        
            <p>It's his third stint with Toulon, with his first starting in 2015 after his retirement from the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>The durable midfielder played 103 times for New Zealand.</p>
