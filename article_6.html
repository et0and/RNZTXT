            <p>Rising sevens star Jorja Miller has committed to New Zealand Rugby and the Black Ferns Sevens through to 2027.</p>
        
            <p>The four-year contract is the longest to be signed by a women's player in New Zealand, with professional contracts introduced just over ten years ago for the Black Ferns Sevens.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first of several contracts that will secure the future talent of the programme over the coming seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Miller burst onto the international scene with her selection in the Black Ferns Sevens for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>The 19-year-old went on to feature in all seven World Series tournaments over 2022/23, being named in the tournament dream team on four occasions, and Player of the Final in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>She was named Rookie of the Year by World Rugby for her first season.</p>
        
            <p>As she prepares for the first tournament of the upcoming season, Miller said it was special to know she will be part of the side for the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got such a big legacy in this team so being part of continuing that by locking in long-term contract, it shows the pathway that there is in the women's game.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a lot more to give to this team and this game. I'm excited to keep growing on and off the field and I have a drive to really change the game, I want to bring a different style and be a different athlete," Miller said.</p>
        
            <p>Head of Women's High Performance Rugby Hannah Porter said confirming Miller's commitment to the sevens programme was a significant milestone.</p>
        
            <p>"Having Jorja commit long term to the Black Ferns Sevens is great. The programme has a proven track record of developing some of the world's best rugby athletes, so we look forward to seeing what the future holds for Jorja and the team," Porter said.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns Sevens Coach Cory Sweeney said Miller was a player with a massive future ahead of her.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen in just her first season the potential Jorja has. She is one of several impressive young ladies we have in our team who will be integral to our future success," Sweeney said.</p>
