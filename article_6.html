        <h2>White Ferns not strong enough to hold off England in final T20 match</h2>
        <p>
Brooke Halliday and Izzy Gaze hit a record 56-run 6th wicket partnership, but their efforts were in vain.

            <p>A top-order batting capitulation cost the White Ferns in the final match of the T20 international series against England, with another loss and a 4-1 series defeat.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a maiden half-century from tenacious wicketkeeper Izzy Gaze, New Zealand's total of 136 for 6 wasn't strong enough to hold off the England women at the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Halliday and Gaze hit a record 56-run 6th wicket partnership in T20s for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately their individual efforts were in vain, as England won by five wickets with Sophia Dunkley hitting the winning boundary off Rosemary Mair as her team-mates celebrated reaching the target at 138 for 5 in the 18th over.</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Plimmer, who came in for the injured Sophie Devine, made the highest contribution of the opening five New Zealand batters with a score of 12.</p>
        
            <p>White Ferns captain Amelia Kerr told TVNZ England were a class above with their commanding 4-1 series win.</p>
        
            <p>"They've obviously got match winners and they're a world class side," Kerr said.</p>

            <p>"Izzy was outstanding the way she played her game, her lap shot. To do that was pretty special for her.</p>
        
            <p>"She works bloody hard and has been for a long time so it's nice to see her come off today."</p>
        
            <p>Kerr captained the side, with star allrounder Sophie Devine on the injured list with a quad injury picked up in the fourth T20 on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said New Zealand had improved from their last performance but there was more work to do.</p>
        
            <p>Victorious England captain Heather Knight, who top-scored for the visitors with 35, was thrilled to see her side wrap up the series with strong bowling in the power play.</p>
        
            <p>"If we are picky, we probably let them get too many," Knight said.</p>
        
            <p>"We talked a bit about chasing after we didn't quite do it the way we wanted in the third game.</p>
        
            <p>To do that quite calmly was outstanding from us."</p>
        
            <p>The teams meet again on Monday in the first one-dayer of the three-match series in Wellington, with the second and third ODIs to be played in Hamilton.</p>
