            <p>Eliza McCartney isn't sure she'll be back for another Olympics after missing the pole vault podium in Paris - eight years after leaping to bronze at the Rio Games.</p>
        
            <p>McCartney and New Zealand team-mates Imogen Ayris and Olivia McTaggart lasted through to the midway point of the women's final on Thursday but couldn't feature at the business end of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Nina Kennedy was a surprise winner, clinching gold when she was the only athlete to clear 4.90m</p>

            <p>She headed off American defending champion Katie Moon, who claimed silver from Canada's Alysha Newman on a countback after both successfully cleared 4.85m.</p>
        
            <p>McCartney exited when the bar was raised to 4.80m, narrowly failing in each of her three attempts.</p>
        
            <p>It was a disappointing outcome for the 27-year-old who had sailed over on her first attempt at each of her two previous heights - 4.60m and 4.70m.</p>
        
            <p>She nevertheless produced her trademark smile after the bar fell for a third time and later said it was because ''you never know whether you are going back again".</p>

            <p>"I want to be going to LA in four years time but I don't know if it's going to happen. Why wouldn't I just enjoy this moment because it's happening right now and I get to be out there.</p>
        
            <p>"The atmosphere out there is amazing, it's so special to get these opportunities. So I just love it. The fact I get to go out there and do my thing,express myself, pole vault which I love to do. How lucky am I, I just love it all."</p>
        
            <p>McCartney said was in tears when speaking later to journalists and reflected on her ongoing battle with a variety of injuries, including problems in the leadup to Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a really tough preparation, nothing like my indoor season which went really smoothly and beautiful," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't as prepared as I would have wanted to be, then we made some good decisions in the last month or two to actaully I could get here and pole vault, because that was never guaranteed with me.</p>
        
            <p>"So to get able to get in a final and come sixth equal, I will absolutely take that.</p>
        
            <p>"My attempts at 4.80 were just not quite it, I think it showed I didn't have the right run-in, but I do really believe I gave everything I could today, so you can't ask anything more than that, so I'm happy."</p>

            <p>Ayris finished 12th and McTaggart 13th after both cleared 4.60m in their first Olympic final appearance but neither could advance when the target was increased by another 10cm.</p>
        
            <p>Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Ayris was able to improve on her personal best, which previously sat at 4.57m.</p>
