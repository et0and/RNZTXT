            <p>The Breakers' hopes of qualifying for the NBL playoffs are over following a heavy 94-78 loss to the Adelaide 36ers.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland side slumped to an 18th defeat from 27 matches and can't qualify for the post-season with just two games remaining in what has been a disappointing campaign.</p>
        
            <p>With co-captain Parker Jackson-Cartwright missing the game in Adelaide due to injury, the Breakers struggled to find consistency on offence and trailed by 22 points at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The lead grew to 28 before the visitors regrouped over the closing stages, at one point rattling off a 12-0 run.</p>
        
            <p>Adelaide's offence, led by Montrezl Harrell's 26 points and Kendric Davis' double-double of 23 points and 13 assists, proved too much for the Breakers to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>Mojave King led a valiant effort off the Breakers bench with a team-high 20 points, including five three pointers.</p>

            <p>Jonah Bolden recorded a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds, while Matt Mooney contributed 14 points and a team-high nine assists.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Petteri Koponen said his side lacked energy early in the contest and failed to effectively get the ball into the hands of towering centre Tacko Fall but responded well in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"We came out flat. The energy wasn't where it needed to be against a team like Adelaide," Koponen said.</p>
        
            <p>"Second half we competed much better, but it wasn't enough. The first half did the damage - we didn't have a good start.</p>
        
            <p>"When we tried to get the ball in to Tacko, they doubled him and that opened up a lot of chances for other guys. We need to keep shooting the ball with confidence and when we did that, guys like Mojave made it look good."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers finish their campaign with two home games, starting with the Cairns Taipans on Saturday.</p>
