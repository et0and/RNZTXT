        <h2>The events coming back, and those that aren't, at the Commonwealth Games</h2>
        <p>
The Games has been scaled back after the organisers struggled to find a host, however, it will still see more than 200 medals contested across 10 sports in Glasgow this year.

            <p>More than 200 gold medals will be contested across 10 sports at the scaled-back Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>The event programme has been released for the Games which were scaled back after organisers struggled to find a host.</p>
        
            <p>Swimming, track cycling and Para sports will each boast more medallists than in any previous Games.</p>
        
            <p>Athletics will have two new events, a mixed 4x400m relay and the Commonwealth Mile, which replaces the 1500m.</p>

            <p>Last run in 1966, the Mile race, which will be run on the track, is a nod to the 'The Miracle Mile' at the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Canada in 1954, when England's Roger Bannister and Australian John Landy - the only two sub-four-minute runners in the world at the time - went head to head only two months after Bannister became the first athlete to run a sub-four minute mile.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Murray Halberg finished fifth and Bill Baillie seventh in that race.</p>
        
            <p>"The mile is the quintessential Commonwealth athletics event whose return I very much welcome," said World Athletics President Sebastian Coe, who suggested the event to Glasgow organisers.</p>
        
            <p>"From 1930 through to 1966, the mile was the blue-riband event of each Games and the magic of the mile continues to resonate.</p>
        
            <p>"A ticket to watch its Commonwealth final will be one of the must-have seats in Glasgow next year."</p>
        
            <p>Para sports will be fully integrated across six of the 10 disciplines, with a Games record of 47 medal events in total.</p>
        
            <p>While the overall number of sports has halved from 20 in Birmingham in 2022 to combat rising hosting costs and time demands, the schedule remains intense.</p>
        
            <p>A total 26 cycling golds will be fought for at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, with eight of those in Para-track cycling.</p>
        
            <p>In swimming 56 golds will be on offer, with the men's 800m and women's 1500m freestyle races included for the first time.</p>
