        <h2>No stress: Relaxed Schmidt chasing back-to-back golds</h2>
        <p>
Dylan Schmidt will enter a zen-like state when he chases a trampoline gymnastics world championship title defence in Birmingham.

            <p>It took a while but New Zealand's Dylan Schmidt has figured out what works and what doesn't in top-flight trampoline gymnastics.</p>
        
            <p>Relaxation is fundamental to success, he says, and will drive his bid for a world championship title defence in Birmingham this week.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty 20 years since he first jumped on his backyard trampoline in Te Anau, Schmidt now knows not to get too worked up in the leadup to a major event. And nor to bust a gut during it too.</p>

            <p>Staying cool and composed worked for the Aucklander when he jumped to a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics and then again when he bagged gold at last year's world championships in Bulgaria.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to always put so much pressure on myself," Schmidt told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I went through a bit of a phase in my early-ish years when I'd put myself in a good position, feel the pressure I guess, and not do the routine I was looking for.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely over the years I've learned to take it a bit easier and be a bit more laidback. I've learned to take every comp as it is, be as prepared as possible and then just go in and have some fun."</p>
        
            <p>One of the most experienced in a field of more than 100 jumpers in the men's individual competition, Schmidt will remain serene when the four-day world championships begin on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>He'll jump within himself to advance through the preliminary rounds and then aim to produce another controlled routine in the 24-man semi-finals.</p>

            <p>All going well, his best will be saved for the eight-man final on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"So you're just going through the rounds and ticking the box, ticking the box and then when you get to the final, that's when you want to have your best stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"It's managing your energy and trying to get through each round. You still have to do good routines to get through but it's just taking that mental load off the prelims and the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully by Sunday you're still feeling pretty fresh because that's the big one - Sunday's where it all happens, that's when you win the medals.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year at worlds our game plan worked well, so it's just sort of similar going into this one."</p>
        
            <p>Reaching the last eight will serve a second purpose for Schmidt - booking him an automatic berth at next year's Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Helping the 26-year-old stay grounded will be the presence of older sibling Rachel, who is also in the seven-strong New Zealand team in Birmingham.</p>

            <p>Having last represented her country seven years ago she rediscovered her competitive desire but Schmidt predicts she'll be even more relaxed than him.</p>
        
            <p>"(She's back) for the love of the sport really," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>"She probably knows that there's no Olympics on her horizon but the world champs is still an amazing event to be part of and to qualify is no easy feat."</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt is looking forward to a return home before Christmas, having spent five months overseas competing on the World Cup circuit and enjoying "a bit of an OE".</p>
        
            <p>Most recently, a 10-week camp in Bournemouth, training alongside decorated British trampoline gymnast Bryony Page, has given him one of the best preparations for a major event he can remember.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously world champs and Olympics are the pinnacle of my sport but as soon as you put it on a pedestal, it becomes a big deal," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day, all I'm doing is jumping on a trampoline and doing flips and doing a routine, just like any other day."</p>
