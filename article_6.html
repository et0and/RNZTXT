            <p>Jasprit Bumrah claimed six for 45 in a reverse swing masterclass to fetch India a handy lead on day two of the second test against England in Visakhapatnam</p>
        
            <p>Replying to India's 396 in the first innings, England were cruising at 114-1 batting with the kind of unbridled aggression, which has become the hallmark of the side under Ben Stokes.</p>
        
            <p>Bumrah, armed with the reversing ball, then turned the match on its head and England were all out for 253 conceding a first-innings lead of 143.</p>
        
            <p>India were 28 for no loss at stumps for an overall lead of 171.</p>
        
            <p>Yashasvi Jaiswal, who smashed 209 in the first innings, was batting on 15 with skipper Rohit Sharma on 13 at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>"If you want to take wickets as a fast in India, you have got to learn to use reverse swing because the new ball doesn't do much," Bumrah said of his bowling.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you can try and force the magical deliveries but it's also about being patient and setting the batter up.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to have a plan and use every delivery wisely. I was very happy to execute it today and happy to contribute on that pitch."</p>
        
            <p>England got off to a strong start with Zak Crawley (76) and Ben Duckett (21) looking determined to make the most of the excellent batting conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Crawley hit Bumrah for four fours in an over en route to a 52-ball fifty, a milestone he reached with a six off Kuldeep Yadav (3-71).</p>
        
            <p>The spinner broke the 59-run stand when he had Duckett caught at silly point but was denied a second wicket in that over when Srikar Bharat blew a stumping opportunity against Ollie Pope.</p>
        
            <p>Crawley went run-a-ball but miscued his shot against Axar Patel and Shreyas Iyer took a spectacular tumbling catch running backwards to trigger a collapse.</p>
        
            <p>With the ball reversing, Bumrah was recalled into the attack and the crafty seamer responded by getting Joe Root caught in the slip for five.</p>
        
            <p>Bumrah's mastery was on display again and this time Pope (23) nearly fell over trying to block a yorker that crashed through his defence and into the base of his middle and leg stumps.</p>
        
            <p>Bumrah returned after the tea break to dismiss Johnny Bairstow (25) with England reeling at 159 with their top five batters back in the hut.</p>
        
            <p>Yadav removed Ben Foakes and Rehan Ahmed before Bumrah returned to produce a stunning delivery to end Stokes's brisk 47.</p>
        
            <p>Stokes dropped his bat and stood in disbelief after Bumrah sent down a delivery that jagged back to flatten his off-stump.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Jaiswal smashed his maiden test double hundred, which contained seven sixes and 19 fours, to provide the bedrock of the Indian innings where no other batter managed a fifty.</p>
        
            <p>Seamer James Anderson, Shoaib Bashir and fellow spinner Ahmed claimed three wickets apiece for England.</p>
