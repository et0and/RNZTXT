            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have blown away the defending A-League men's champions the Central Coast Mariners with a 3-0 win in Gosford.</p>
        
            <p>The dominant performance against the two-time champions was marked by an unbelievable long-range strike off the free kick for Wellington's Hideki Ishige in the early stages.</p>
        
            <p>Ishige's incredible goal in the 15th minute will be shown on the highlights reel as a contender for the goal of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The Japanese star was in the action again setting up Kosta Barbarouses who scored to send the Wellington side into the sheds at half-time with a 2-nil lead.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Sutton knocked in a third after displaying impressive footwork for his first goal in two years.</p>
        
            <p>The wins sees the Phoenix climb up to third on the A-League ladder, although they could be surpassed by Sydney FC and Melbourne City on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington will be delighted to rebound from last week's defensive howler when they lost in the derby to rivals Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>And Auckland, who had the bye this round, are still holding second place on the table.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Central Coast Mariners remain near the foot of the table in tenth position, dropping below Newcastle Jets due to Sunday's three goal defeat.</p>
