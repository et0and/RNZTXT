        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific: Super Round preview</h2>
        <p>
All the news, team lists and kick-off times for the second round of Super Rugby Pacific.
</p>
        
            <p>After a week of daily mouthguard chat, Super Rugby Pacific moves to Melbourne for its Super Round. Every team is playing at AAMI Park, part of Melbourne's impressive sporting precinct, but it will be interesting to see just how many people from the famously AFL-obsessed city actually show up. Here's everything you need to know:</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 8pm Friday</p>

            <p>Both of these sides are coming off good wins in their first games, but the feeling was that the Blues never really got out of third gear in Whangarei against the Drua. Meanwhile, the Highlanders certainly had to rise to the occasion against Moana, scoring an early contender for try of the year. Blues coach Vern Cotter has made a few changes for this one, citing rotation although stopping short of saying whether it was All Black-mandated. This, along with the mouthguard issue, isn't a great look - especially when a player like Finlay Christie only started one test match last year and averaged less than 20 minutes off the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 15 Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, 14 Timoci Tavatavanawai, 13 Tanielu Tele'a, 12 Sam Gilbert, 11 Jona Nareki, 10 Rhys Patchell, 9 Folau Fakatava, 8 Hugh Renton, 7 Billy Harmon (c), 6 Sean Withy, 5 Max Hicks, 4 Pari Pari Parkinson, 3 Jermaine Ainsley, 2 Henry Bell, 1 Ethan de Groot</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ricky Jackson, 17 Daniel Lienert-Brown, 1 Saula Ma'u, 19 Fabian Holland, 20 Nikora Broughton, 21 Nathan Hastie, 22 Ajay Faleafaga, 23 Jonah Lowe</p>
        
            <p>Blues: 15 Zarn Sullivan, 14 Mark Tele'a, 13 AJ Lam, 12 Bryce Heem, 11 Caleb Clarke, 10 Stephen Perofeta, 9 Taufa Funaki, 8 Hoskins Sotutu, 7 Dalton Papali'i (c), 6 Akira Ioane, 5 Sam Darry, 4 Laghlan McWhannell, 3 Marcel Renata, 2, Ricky Riccitelli, 1 Ofa Tu'ungafasi</p>

            <p>The Star Wars Trophy goes on the line once again (not really, I just made that up) between the two renowned battler teams of the competition. You can roll a dice about who will actually win this game, given they're both coming off heavy losses, but the main story about the Rebels is whether they'll even be playing next season.</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Andrew Kellaway, 14 Lachie Anderson, 13 Matt Proctor, 12 David Feliuai, 11 Filipo Daugunu, 10 Carter Gordon, 9 James Tuttle, 8 Rob Leota (c), 7 Brad Wilkin, 6 Josh Kemeny, 5 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 4 Josh Canham, 3 Taniela Tupou, 2 Alex Mafi, 1 Matt Gibbon</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Jordan Uelese, 17 Isaac Kailea, 18 Sam Talakai, 19 Tuaina Taii Tualima, 20 Vaiolini Ekuasi, 21 Ryan Louwrens, 22 Jake Strachan, 23 Nick Jooste</p>
        
            <p>Force: 15 Max Burey, 14 Harry Potter, 13 Sam Spink, 12 Hamish Stewart, 11 Chase Tiatia, 10 Ben Donaldson, 9 Nic White, 8 Will Harris, 7 Carlo Tizzano, 6 Michael Wells, 5 Thomas Franklin, 4 Jeremy Williams, 3 Santiago Medrano, 2 Tom Horton, 1 Ryan Coxon</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Feleti Kaitu'u, 17 Charlie Hancock, 18 Tiaan Tauakipulu, 19 Tim Anstee, 20 Lopeti Faifua, 21 Ollie Callan, 22 Issak Fines-Leleiwasa, 23 George Poolman</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 7pm, Saturday</p>

            <p>This one should be a lot of fun. Moana were much better than the 14-point deficit suggested in their loss to the Highlanders, playing a mix of solid and enterprising rugby. The Drua were admittedly pretty poor in their loss to the Blues but if there is one team that can completely change their demeanour over the course of a week, it's them. Moana have had to ring a lot of changes, with 13 players injured, and coach Tana Umaga has handed the captaincy to Sione Havili Talitui in his debut for the team.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Nigel Ah Wong, 13 Henry Taefu, 12 Julian Savea, 11 Viliami Fine, 10 William Havili, 9 Ere Enari, 8 Lotu Inisi, 7 Sione Havili Talitui (c), 6 Jacob Norris, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Tom Savage, 3 Sione Mafielo, 2 Sama Malolo, 1 Abraham Pole</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Samiuela Moli, 17 Sateki Latu, 18 Sekope Kepu, 19 Ola Tauelangi, 20 Irie Papuni, 21 Aisea Halo, 22 Christian Lealiifano, 23 Kyren Taumoefolau</p>
        
            <p>Fijian Drua: 15 Isikeli Rabitu, 14 Epeli Momo, 13 Iosefo Masi, 12 Apisalome Vota, 11 Selestino Ravutaumada, 10 Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 9 Frank Lomani, 8 Meli Derenalagi (c), 7 Ella Canakaivata, 6 Etonia Waqa, 5 Isoa Nasilasila, 4 Mesake Vocevoce, 3 Mesake Doge, 2 Tevita Ikanivere, 1 Livai Natave</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Mesulame Dolokoto, 1 Haereiti Hetet, 18 Jone Koroiduadua, 19 Te Ahiwaru Cirikidaveta, 20 Vilive Miramira, 21 Simione Kuruvoli, 22 Kemu Valetini, 23 Junior Ratuva</p>

            <p>This might be a bit more of a test than first glance suggests for the Crusaders, given that their casualty ward has filled up at a medieval military rate after only one game. Coach Rob Penney is already looking far and wide for replacements, and he's putting a lot of trust in a very young but promising inside back duo of Noah Hotham and Taha Kemara. Still, it would be a shock if they dropped this one against a Tahs team that was well beaten last weekend in Brisbane - it just might be a bit closer than usual.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: 15 Chay Fihaki, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Levi Aumua, 12 David Havili, 11 Macca Springer, 10 Taha Kemara, 9 Noah Hotham, 8 Cullen Grace, 7 Tom Christie, 6 Dominic Gardiner, 5 Quinten Strange, 4 Scott Barrett (c), 3 Fletcher Newell, 2 George Bell, 1 George Bower</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Quentin MacDonald, 17 Joe Moody, 18 Owen Franks, 19 Jamie Hannah, 20 Christian Lio-Willie, 21 Mitchell Drummond, 22 Ryan Crotty, 23 Dallas McLeod</p>
        
            <p>Waratahs: 15 Max Jorgensen, 14 Mark Nawaqanitawase, 13 Harry Wilson, 12 Joey Walton, 11 Dylan Pietsch, 10 Tane Edmed, 9 Jake Gordon (c), 8 Langi Gleeson, 7 Charlie Gamble, 6 Fergus Lee-Warner, 5 Hugh Sinclair, 4 Jed Holloway, 3 Harry Johnson-Holmes, 2 Mahe Vailanu, 1 Angus Bell</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Julian Heaven, 17 Hayden Thompson-Stringer, 18 Dan Botha, 19 Miles Amatosero, 20 Ned Hanigan, 21 Teddy Wilson, 22 Mosese Tuipulotu, 23 Triston Reilly</p>

            <p>Here's probably the most intriguing game of the round, because the best of the NZ teams will go against the best of the Aussies. The Chiefs did it the hard way last weekend but showed their championship fortitude against the fast-finishing Crusaders, while the Brumbies stomped all over the Rebels in a predictable result. Damian McKenzie has bounced back from the Crusaders attempting to murder him every time he got the ball, while on the other side the Brumbies' hopes will rest on Ryan Lonergan and Noah Lolesio's combination at 9 and 10.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Shaun Stevenson, 14 Liam Coombes-Fabling, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 12 Rameka Poihipi, 11 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Xavier Roe, 8 Luke Jacobson (c), 7 Kaylum Boshier, 6 Samipeni Finau, 5 Tupou Vaa'i, 4 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 3 George Dyer, 2 Bradley Slater, 1 Ollie Norris</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 17 Jared Proffit, 18 Reuben O'Neill, 19 Naitoa Ah Kuoi, 20 Simon Parker, 21 Cortez Ratima, 22 Josh Ioane, 23 Daniel Rona</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies: 15 Tom Wright, 14 Andy Muirhead, 13 Len Ikitau, 12 Ollie Sapsford, 11 Corey Toole, 10 Noah Lolesio, 9 Ryan Lonergan (c), 8 Charlie Cale, 7 Luke Reimer, 6 Rob Valetini, 5 Tom Hooper, 4 Nick Frost, 3 Sosefo Kautai, 2 Lachlan Lonergan, 1 James Slipper</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Billy Pollard, 17 Blake Schoupp, 18 Rhys Van Nek, 19 Cadeyrn Neville, 20 Jahrome Brown, 21 Harrison Goddard, 22 Declan Meredith, 23 Tamati Tua</p>

            <p>The narrative in the off season was that the Canes' halfback battle would be between Cam Roigard and TJ Perenara, but NZ U20s player Jordi Viljoen had something to say about that. He's retained on the bench against the Reds while Roigard starts with Brett Cameron hanging onto the equally contested first five spot too. The Reds won't be an easy task, they were fluid and impressive against the Tahs last weekend, especially the loose forward/halfback combination of Fraser McReight, Harry Wilson and Tate McDermott. Again, this one probably won't be a walk in the park.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Ruben Love, 14 Josh Moorby, 13 Billy Proctor, 12 Jordie Barrett (cc), 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Brett Cameron, 9 Cam Roigard, 8 Brayden Iose, 7 Peter Lakai, 6 TK Howden, 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 4 Caleb Delany, 3 Tyrel Lomax, 2 Asafo Aumua (cc), 1 Xavier Numia</p>
