            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens are through to the season-ending world series semi-finals in Madrid, despite suffering a rare loss in pool play.</p>
        
            <p>And the All Blacks Sevens have also won through to the men's semi-finals after beating South Africa and Ireland overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand women had already won the SVNS league title after claiming four cup legs in a row - Vancouver, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Singapore - but the Madrid tournament is a winner-take-all grand final.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders were looking in trouble after being stunned 26-17 by Canada, but rebounded to blitz the United States 38-5 in their final pool match. They play Australia on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Jorja Miller, who scored two brilliant tries against the US, said they could not wait for the challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"We're excited. We love playing the Aussie girls and that is the best thing for us, to go out and battle against them. It's going to be epic."</p>
        
            <p>The side had been hurting after the Canada game, she said. "But we knew if we dwelled on it too long it wouldn't help us in this game."</p>
        
            <p>Canada will play France in the other semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks Sevens will meet Argentina in the semi-finals, with a similar rebound after losing their opening match to Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>Leroy Carter scored twice against South Africa, but they were also helped by their rivals being down to four players at one stage, as they conceded a penalty try after a high tackle and incurred three yellow cards. The All Blacks Sevens won 33-24.</p>
        
            <p>It was Joe Webber's turn for a try double against Ireland, as they held out a late challenge to win 22-17.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji will play France in the other men's semi-final.</p>
