            <p>Black Caps captain Kane Williamson and pace bowler Kyle Jamieson have been withdrawn from T20 squad to face Bangladesh on medical advice.</p>
        
            <p>The duo's ommission opens the door for allrounder Rachin Ravindra and bowler Jacob Duffy to join the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson will undergo a period of knee rehabilitation and strengthening following his recent return to play at the Cricket World Cup in India and the Tests against Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>Jamieson's hamstring injury will see him miss the series against Bangladesh which starts on Wednesday and January's T20 Series against Pakistan with February's Test Series against South Africa his targeted return.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead said the withdrawals were grounded in fresh medical advice</p>
        
            <p>"We want both Kane and Kyle to be in the best possible place leading into the next block of Test cricket against South Africa and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on discussions with the medical staff and the players it was decided a period of rehabilitation and conditioning was the best option for both of them."</p>
        
            <p>Stead said Ravindra and Duffy provided strong additions to the squad mix for Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>"Jacob is an experienced T20 cricketer and always brings a lot when he is part of the Black Caps environment. He's worked very hard on his white ball skills in recent seasons.</p>
        
            <p>"Rachin adds to any environment he's a part of and has a great desire to learn and develop his game - across all three formats."</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Santner will be captain for the Bangladesh T20 series in Williamson's absence. Santner has led the team 14 times previously in international cricket.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Santner (c), Finn Allen, Mark Chapman, Jacob Duffy, Adam Milne, Daryl Mitchell, James Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Ben Sears, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee</p>
