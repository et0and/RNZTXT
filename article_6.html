            <p>Former All Blacks Sevens star William Warbrick is one of eight debutants named in the Kiwis squad for their Pacific Championships campaign against the Kangaroos and Tonga this month.</p>
        
            <p>The Melbourne Storm winger, who played in last weekend's NRL Grand Final loss to the Penrith Panthers, won an Olympic silver medal with the All Blacks Sevens at the 2020 Tokyo games, which were held in 2021 due to Covid.</p>

            <p>Brisbane second rower Jordan Riki, Gold Coast utility forward Erin Clark, his Titans teammate and fullback Keano Kini, Roosters forward Naufahu Whyte, Newcastle hooker Phoenix Crossland, Penrith centre Casey McLean and his Panthers teammate and hooker Trent Toelau are the other uncapped players in the squad, with a number of frontline players injured or unavailable, such as star back Joseph Manu, who has switched to rugby union.</p>
        
            <p>Dally M Medal-winning Storm halfback Jahrome Hughes will lead the backline, while current Golden Boot winner James Fisher-Harris, fresh from a fourth consecutive NRL title win with Penrith, will again captain the side after leading the Kiwis to their record 30-0 win over Australia in last year's Pacific Championships final in Hamilton.</p>

            <p>Also named from that line-up are Warriors fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Dolphins winger Jamayne Isaako, Raiders centre Matt Timoko, Hughes, back rowers Isaiah Papali'i (Wests Tigers) and Joseph Tapine (Raiders) plus bench forwards Leo Thompson (Knights) and Griffin Neame (Cowboys).</p>
        
            <p>Veteran centre Peta Hiku will fly from England to join the 21-man squad.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old former Warrior has been in strong form in his first season with Hull Kingston Rovers in the Super League, helping the club to a 10-8 win over Warrington last Friday to clinch a spot in the grand final at Old Trafford for the first time this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>After last playing for the Kiwis in their semifinal loss to Australia at the 2022 Rugby League World Cup, Hiku becomes the first Super League player selected for New Zealand since Thomas Leuluai was brought back home from Wigan for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.</p>

            <p>"While we've had a number of players ruled out through injury or unavailability, it's a hugely exciting opportunity having the Kiwis playing at home in front of our fans again," said new Kiwis head coach Stacey Jones.</p>
        
            <p>"We've still got a solid core of last year's squad but, the way I see it, it's a fantastic chance for us to build the group to provide lots of options and depth for following campaigns."</p>
        
            <p>As well as Hiku, other 2022 World Cup players returning are Penrith's four-times NRL premiership-winning back rower Scott Sorensen and Warriors second rower Marata Niukore plus Dolphins utility Kodi Nikorima, who last played for the New Zealand side in the 2019 home series against Great Britain.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis start their campaign against the Kangaroos in Christchurch on 27 October, the first time the Trans-Tasman rivals have squared off in the South Island city since the opening Test of the 1989 series.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders then travel to Auckland to face Tonga at Mt Smart Stadium on 2 November competition moves to Sydney for the finals on 10 November.</p>
        
            <p>The Pacific Championships start with the Kangaroos meeting Tonga in Brisbane on 18 October.</p>
