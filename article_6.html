            <p>The Parramatta Eels have confirmed their Kiwi play-maker Dylan Brown will leave the club at the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The 24 year old told Eels staff and team-mates of his decision on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>There had been reports in Australia that Brown would be offered an NRL-record deal from the Newcastle Knights.</p>
        
            <p>News Corp first reported on Monday that the five-eighth had agreed to sign a 10-year, $13 million deal to join the Knights from next season.</p>
        
            <p>Parramatta Eels GM of Football, Mark O'Neill, acknowledged Brown's decision on their website.</p>
        
            <p>"Dylan has been offered what I understand to be the biggest deal in NRL history from 2026 onwards. Dylan is a class player, we understand his decision to take up the offer and no one could begrudge him for accepting this opportunity for him and his family.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite agreeing to terms with another NRL club for future seasons, Dylan remains committed to the Eels in 2025 and we look forward to him playing his role in the team for the remainder of the year."</p>
        
            <p>Brown made his NRL debut in 2019 and has since played 124 games for the club.</p>
        
            <p>An international representative for New Zealand, Brown was a key player in the team that won the Pacific Cup in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He was the starting five-eighth for the Eels's horror start to 2025, beaten by the Stom in Melbourne 56-18.</p>
