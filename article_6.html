            <p>Blockbusting All Blacks winger Leicester Fainga'anuku will return from France to New Zealand Rugby after signing a two-season Super Rugby contract with the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Fainga'anuku will return to the Crusaders for the 2026 season, once his 18-month contract at French club Toulon finishes midway through next year.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old will be a welcome addition for the Crusaders, who won a title in each of the five seasons he played there, including last year when he scored 13 tries in 13 appearances.</p>
        
            <p>He has played seven tests, including four at last year's World Cup, where he scored a hat-trick against Uruguay and also crossed in the tense quarter-final win over Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders chief executive Colin Mainsbridge was pleased to lure back Fainga'anuku, who has just begun his second season with Toulon.</p>

            <p>"He's an outstanding young man who has continued to show what a remarkable athlete he is during his time in Europe," Mainsbridge said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was wonderful to connect with him when he joined us to watch the Crusaders play Munster in January and it felt like he hadn't left."</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders head coach Rob Penney said the move was "fantastic news for rugby in New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>"Leicester is a huge asset to any team he is a part of, so to have him back in Christchurch is really positive," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"He has plenty of years left to play at the top level, and we're all very pleased he's chosen to return to the Crusaders."</p>
