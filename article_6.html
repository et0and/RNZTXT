            <p>Olympian and Black Sticks great Simon Child is ending an almost 20-year international career.</p>
        
            <p>Child first stepped onto the international stage in 2005, as a teenager, going on to represent New Zealand more than 300 times.</p>
        
            <p>Renowned globally for his goal-scoring prowess, Child's 148 goals place him as the second-highest scorer in the history of New Zealand men's hockey.</p>
        
            <p>Child said representing New Zealand was his "greatest achievement" and he was "incredibly grateful for the journey".</p>
        
            <p>"I played my very first game at 16-years-old, in front of family and friends and never imagined that I would go on and play a total of 309 games, captain the team and compete at four Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I owe everything to my parents, whose sacrifice, encouragement and commitment shaped my career.</p>
        
            <p>"Special thanks to my wife Kush, for your motivation, love and support. I couldn't have done any of it without you."</p>

            <p>Kevin Towns, who was the first to ever select Child for the Black Sticks, identified Child's exceptional talent early on, tracking his progress from junior levels to secondary schools.</p>
        
            <p>"It was clear from a very early age that there was something special about Simon, a natural athlete with a different but extremely effective skill set, he had game smarts and loved to win.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a privilege for me to have him in the Black Sticks group. To see him grow into his role as a fully-fledged international and a threat to teams across the world of hockey."</p>
        
            <p>Child is a veteran of four Olympic Games and three Commonwealth Games. He was a pivotal part of the squad that clinched a bronze medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>Hockey New Zealand chief executive officer Anthony Crummy praised Child's career and contributions to the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Simon has had a remarkable career and his service to hockey over the last two decades has been extraordinary. A world-class player with incredible skill and game sense, Simon retires as one of our greatest ever Black Sticks.</p>
        
            <p>"His resilience and commitment to excellence have been an inspiration."</p>
