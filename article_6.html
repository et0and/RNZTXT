            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have won the Vancouver leg of the World Series with a 41-7 win over Fiji, to extend their lead at the top of the overall standings.</p>
        
            <p>Within two minutes, a Fijian player had been red carded and New Zealand made them pay straight away, through a Risi Pouri-Lane try.</p>
        
            <p>Manaia Nuku almost immediately scored New Zealand's second try, and not long after Stacey Waaka got her ninth try of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Just before half-time Jorja Miller side stepped multiple defenders to add another try and New Zealand led 22-nil at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>Michaela Brake (nee Blyde) scored within the first two minutes after the main break.</p>
        
            <p>With just three minutes left Fiji got on the board with a well worked try.</p>
        
            <p>The 18-year-old debutante Maia Davis scored her first try on the World Series, before Mahina Paul put the cherry on top adding one more try for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens made the final after a comprehensive 29-10 win over Australia in the semi-final this morning. The win was a strong response to their loss to the Australians in the Perth leg final late last month.</p>
        
            <p>Coming into the tournament, the New Zealand women had a slim two point lead over their arch-rivals after three rounds. They now have a six point buffer over Australia, who finished third in Vancouver.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns went through the tournament unbeaten with big victories in their pool matches over Ireland, China and the USA, before downing Canada 34-12 in their quarterfinal.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Sarah Hirini told Sky Sport that they were blessed to have someone as experienced as Stacey Waaka return to the side, and a rookie like Davis slot into the side so well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to have our mate Stacey back, and Maia debuting you could just see how happy she was running in for her first try, her parents are in the crowd too," Hirini said.</p>
        
            <p>Pouri-Lane, who was named the player of the final, said it had been a huge effort.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just so proud of the girl's efforts this whole weekend. For us we've got to be prepared for whatever but in saying that the best that we can prepare is by focussing on ourselves and what we can bring to the game," Pouri-Lane said.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks Sevens had a disappointing tournament, losing 31-10 to Great Britain in the play-off for fifth place. New Zealand's sixth placing in Vancouver follows their ninth place finish in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand men are seventh in the World Series standings, with three rounds left.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina took out the men's competition in Vancouver and lead the overall series standings after four rounds.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are next in action for the fifth round of the HSBC SVNS world series in Hong Kong from 28-30 March.</p>
