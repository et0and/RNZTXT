            <p>The Wellington Phoenix women have been denied a spectacular A-League comeback by fired-up competition leaders Sydney FC.</p>
        
            <p>After falling behind to a 3-0 deficit at Porirua, the Wellington side brought the crowd to life with two goals in quick succession to close the gap 3-2 in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney answered the stern challenge, scoring a fourth time for the 4-2 win.</p>
        
            <p>Matildas star Cortnee Vine scored first at Jerry Collins Stadium as the visitors hit the lead in their quest to maintain their place at the top of the A-League standings.</p>
        
            <p>Vine's goal came from a corner, drilling a spectacular shot into the bottom of the goal for the visitors in the 18th minute.</p>
        
            <p>The lead pushed out to 2-0 from a Sydney attacking strike into the 6-yard box which beat everyone until it bounced off Phoenix defender Tiana Jaber for an own goal.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington came back with a vengeance at 3-0 down.</p>
        
            <p>Isabel Cox hit back with a header for the home side taking the score to 3-1, before Mariana Speckmaier pounced on Sydney's inability to clear the ball out and then drilled it into the back of the net for her ninth goal of the season to close in on the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney stepped up a gear at 3-2 to deliver their fourth goal through American signing Jordan Thompson.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson hit a strike into the bottom corner of the goal after she latched onto a loose ball ouside the area.</p>
        
            <p>There was a long stoppage in play while Sydney's Kirsty Fenton was attended to as the epidemic of serious knee injuries continues to have a large impact on the women's professional league.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken away on a stretcher early in the first half and was in visible distress after her foot appeared to plant in the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Six A-League women's players including two from the Wellington Phoenix have suffered season-ending anterior cruciate liagment injuries this year.</p>
