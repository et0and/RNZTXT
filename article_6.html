            <p>Another century from Kane Williamson on his most successful ground has propelled the Black Caps into a dominant position heading into the fourth day of the third and final test against England.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson's 33rd test century helped the Black Caps through to 453 in their second innings in Hamilton, with a lead of 657 runs. By stumps on day three, England were 18/2.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson has scored seven centuries in 12 tests at Seddon Park with Monday's knock his fifth successive test ton at the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beautiful ground, (I've) played a lot of my cricket here growing up as well in age group and for Northern Districts," Williamson said.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was not really challenged during his innings of 156, which came off just 204 balls.</p>
        
            <p>"In recent years, there have been some varying characteristics of the pitch and it was nice to spend some time out there today and build a bunch of partnerships and get a big total on the board.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a nice job by the collective to go out there and make sure we put those runs on the board and get that total."</p>
        
            <p>Matt Henry and Tom Southee picked up a wicket each to have England in trouble in their chase for a record-winning score.</p>
        
            <p>The highest successful fourth innings run chase in test history is the 419 the West Indies scored to beat Australia in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a big job to do as the ball gets a bit softer and the wicket becomes a bit friendlier to bat on so a big push tomorrow," Williamson said.</p>
        
            <p>Southee is playing his 107th and last test for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson said it was nice to share a moment with his long-time New Zealand and Northern Districts team-mate.</p>
        
            <p>"It was certainly special him leading us out onto the park. A lot of incredible memories and (he's) an outstanding servant of the game and just a huge player for us over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"His leadership and how he carried himself throughout his test career and has been a big part of why this team has been in a pretty strong place for some time."</p>
        
            <p>Play on day four will start at 10:30am with England 18/2 with Jacob Bethell on nine and Joe Root yet to score.</p>
