        <h2>Watch: Gaël Monfils wins first round ASB Classic match</h2>
        <p>
The 38-year-old used all his years of experience to overcome Pedro Martinez in a three set thriller.
</p>
        
            <p>Gaël Monfils, 38, showed that he is still capable of bringing the crowd to its feet on centre court at Stanley Street on Monday, winning a thrilling first round match against Spain's Pedro Martinez.</p>
        
            <p>The 1-6 7 (7)-6 6-3 victory looked to be all over when Martinez was up 5-3 in the second set and then 4-1 up in the tiebreak, however a stunning comeback gave the French veteran the win.</p>
        
            <p>"It was not a pretty match…when I stepped on the court nothing worked, I made a lot of mistakes," admitted Monfils after the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to stay in the moment, try to play ugly and put the ball in…do anything you can. I felt much better in the second set and after I went down a break I was very upset, I felt I was serving better and my rhythm was better. But it was just a matter of quality - you have to believe."</p>
        
            <p>The main adjustment Monfils was able to make was slowing down the pace to a more manageable one, expertly slicing and forcing Martinez into energy-sapping shots to try and speed it up again.</p>
        
            <p>Time and time again Monfils placed the ball right on the baseline so that all Martinez could do was send back looping forehands, which allowed the Frenchman to come to the net and pick his spots for winners.</p>
        
            <p>While Monfils described it as "ugly", it certainly did not seem to bother the big crowd, who roared on every point in the comeback effort.</p>

            <p>"I was very thankful…there was a lot of mistakes in the beginning but they were pushing me and I am super thankful for that," said Monfils.</p>
        
            <p>Still, the long period on court did take a toll on Monfils, who was taking long breaks between points. He admitted that he did not want to make this sort of match a habit in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope I don't have to do that (too often), it's tiring physically and mentally.</p>
        
            <p>It's not only a good result for Monfils, but the tournament itself after a day in which one of the main draw cards found themselves out after only two sets.</p>
        
            <p>Cam Norrie was a major drawcard, but he will have to wait at least another year to win his home tournament, his 6-2 6-3 loss to Facundo Diaz Acosta a real disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils was well aware of what his presence could achieve and was happy that his appearance this year would go at least one match longer than in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year I didn't win and I put a lot of work in (this year), to make sure I won," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils will be back in action on Wednesday afternoon, against fellow first round winner Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany.</p>
        
            <p>All the top four seeds in action too after receiving first round byes, all eyes will be on big serving American Ben Shelton, who plays the first match of the night session.</p>
