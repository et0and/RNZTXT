            <p>Analysis - Super Rugby Pacific kicks off on Friday 14 February, with one less team than last season and a whole host of things to talk about. We're once again previewing each New Zealand team from worst to first, today it's last year's round robin winners, the Hurricanes.</p>

            <p>The Canes made full use of the low expectations put on them last season, charging to eight wins in a row and an eventual semi final at home in Wellington. It all came unstuck against a Chiefs side that completely picked them apart in that game though, but the emergence of some excellent young talent and a very capable coach in Clark Laidlaw has given long-suffering fans some sense of direction going forward.</p>

            <p>Peter Lakai and Brayden Iose more than made up for Ardie Savea's absence in the loose forward mix, now with Savea gone they can continue to establish themselves as elite level players. Cam Roigard is back from a serious knee injury and showed on last year's All Black tour that, if anything, he's even better than before.</p>

            <p>Injuries, retirement and defections have hit the Canes hard. Brett Cameron's knee surgery leaves a massive hole at first five after his very good season last year. While TJ Perenara's departure is offset by Roigard's return, the veteran All Black was a key leader for the team. However, the biggest loss is definitely Jordie Barrett - Laidlaw's gameplan was heavily reliant on the All Black midfielder so that will need to be adjusted quick.In an effort to fill the leadership void, Laidlaw has named an unprecedented four captains.</p>

            <p>Riley Higgins will step up into Barrett's place, he comes in with a reputation as an All Black in waiting but this will be his first solid starting role in Super Rugby. He'll be outside Riley Hohepa or Harry Godfrey at 10, Hohepa joins the Canes after a pretty underwhelming stint at the Crusaders last year.</p>
        
            <p>"(There's been) a lot of reflection on our last two weeks of last season. We're pretty disappointed, we felt like we played an exciting brand of rugby that the fans would've really loved in Wellington. The end result of finishing up short against the Chiefs, we were pretty gutted about." - Ruben Love.</p>

            <p>If Wellingtonians can focus their attention away from the imminent destruction of the city to sea bridge, they might realise that they have one of the most exciting young groups of talent Super Rugby has ever seen. Like Aucklanders, there will be more complaining about their stadium. Unlike Aucklanders, there is absolutely zero chance of a discussion about it being replaced even starting. The Canes are also taking a game to Napier, which the province really doesn't deserve after the last time they were in the news for rugby-related matters.</p>
        
            <p>The Canes' draw is quite manageable, they host the Blues in round three and don't head over the Tasman till round five. April is a tough month with games against the Blues again, then the Crusaders, Brumbies and Chiefs. It's a nice run home after that against the Highlanders, Reds and Moana, though.</p>
