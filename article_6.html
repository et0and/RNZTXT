            <p>Centre Anton Lienert-Brown and winger Gideon Wrampling have scored try doubles, as the Chiefs maintained their winning start to the Super Rugby Pacific season, overpower ACT Brumbies 49-34 at Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Locked 15-15 at halftime, the home side seemed to have snatched the initiative after the restart with tries to midfielder Quinn Tupaea and Wrampling, who had barely come onto the field to replace starting winger Manasa Mataele.</p>
        
            <p>The Aussies levelled with tries to hooker Lachlan Lonergan and winger Adam Muirhead, but could not gather the subsequent kickoff, as Wrampling pounced for his second try, giving the Chiefs a lead they would never surrender.</p>
        
            <p>Muirhead had his second try, but the missed conversion meant the Brumbies were chasing from too far back over the closing minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Penalties to Damian McKenzie and Josh Lacomb stretched the Chiefs advantage, and Lienert-Brown had his second, when the Brumbies tried to run the ball from a scrum under their own posts in the final seconds and a loose pass sat up for the All Blacks midfielder to score.</p>
        
            <p>Jacomb's conversion attempt rolled off the kicking tee with time running out, but the first-five coolly slotted the drop goal to seal the result.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs head to Lautoka to take on Fijian Drua next Saturday, but will sweat over the health of McKenzie, who hobbled off with a hyperextended knee, with 10 minutes remaining.</p>
