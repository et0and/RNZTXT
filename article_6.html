            <p>One of the best finishers in the game, Dallin Watene-Zelezniak will remain with the Warriors for the next three seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Watene-Zelezniak has signed a a two-year contract extension which will take his Warriors career into a seventh year.</p>
        
            <p>Coming off the two most productive campaigns of his career, the 29-year-old international will be with the club until the end of 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors general manager of recruitment and development Andrew McFadden said there is no doubt the move to the Warriors in 2021 has been a benefit to Watene-Zelezniak's game.</p>
        
            <p>"He had the best season of his career in 2023 and maintained his level this year by again finishing as the club's top try scorer. He thrives on being at the Warriors and living in Auckland, matching his enthusiasm and energy on the field with the same sort of passion off it."</p>
        
            <p>Watene-Zelezniak was named in both the Dally M Team of the Year and the Players' Dream Team in 2023 after scoring a club record 24 tries in 20 games and following it up with 15 tries in 22 appearances this year.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Andrew Webster said as well as his freakish ability to score tries, "what we all love about Dallin is the way he returns the ball."</p>
        
            <p>"He's so fierce and fearless. I wouldn't like to tackle him. He just gives us so much energy, inspiration and momentum. He has been unreal for us over the last two seasons, taking his game to a level well beyond where he was before and he can still be even better."</p>
