            <p>Joseph Parker is calling for a rematch with British heavyweight Anthony Joshua.</p>
        
            <p>Parker posted to his X (formerly Twitter) calling for a rematch with British heavyweight Anthony Joshua with a video of himself singing along to Ed Sheeran's 'Lego House'.</p>
        
            <p>It opens with Parker painting and hanging his framed work on the wall, as per the song's lyrics, before highlights of their previous fight are shown.</p>

            <p>As he wanders through his home staring longingly at his stuffed toy collection bearing the faces of Joshua, Parker admires a Lego ring he has built for featuring the two fighters, before revealing the earlier painting was a portrait of Joshua.</p>
        
            <p>It was accompanied with the words, "Let's build a LEGO ring for Parker v Joshua 2."</p>
        
            <p>Parker is becoming renowned for his creative callouts on social media, having last week directed a Take That parody of 'I Want You Back' to Dillan Whyte.</p>
        
            <p>Comments praised the Kiwi fighter for his imagination, many referring to him as the 'GOAT' (greatest of all time) for callouts.</p>
        
            <p>Parker lost his WBO heavyweight to Joshua by unanimous decision in March 2018.</p>
        
            <p>He has since enjoyed a career resurgence, and is riding a five-fight winning streak, most recently outlasting Chinese powerhouse Zhilei Zhang in Saudi Arabia on 8 March.</p>
        
            <p>Joshua, meanwhile, is coming off the back of an absolute destruction of former UFC Heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou.</p>
