            <p>A sleek, long-nosed Mercedes raced by Stirling Moss and five-times Formula One world champion Juan Manuel Fangio in 1955 could become the most expensive Grand Prix car of all time at an auction in Stuttgart on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The W196 R Stromlinienwagen ("Streamline car"), one of only four complete examples in existence, is being sold by RM Sotheby's on behalf of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) at a target price of more than 50 million euros ($NZ92 million).</p>
        
            <p>If it meets the estimate, it would also be the second costliest car ever sold at auction after a 1955 Mercedes 300SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe sportscar that changed hands for 135 million euros in May 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The most expensive grand prix car sold at auction to date was another ex-Fangio 1954 Mercedes W196 that fetched $29.6 million at Goodwood in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>The IMS car is the first streamline-bodied W196 R to become available for private ownership and, in its open-wheel form, was driven to victory by Fangio at the non-championship Buenos Aires Grand Prix in 1955.</p>
        
            <p>Moss raced it with the streamline body at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, retiring after setting the fastest lap at an average speed of 215.7 kph.</p>

            <p>Mercedes withdrew from factory-sponsored motorsport in 1955 after a Le Mans 24 Hours disaster that killed 84 people, returning to Formula One as an engine maker in 1994.</p>
        
            <p>The car is presented in its Monza livery with full documentation.</p>
        
            <p>"Without any doubt, it's the most beautiful race car in the world and ever. Nothing can compare. It's simply a masterpiece of style and design," Marcus Breitschwerdt, head of Mercedes-Benz heritage, told Reuters Television.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very fast. The top speed is actually above and beyond 300 kph.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't expect that it's too much of an effort to get it back to driving condition. And we gladly will offer whoever buys the car to do it for them."</p>
        
            <p>The car, chassis number 00009/54, was donated to the IMS by Mercedes in 1965 and is being sold to raise funds for the museum's restoration efforts.</p>
        
            <p>The Indianapolis museum, which is aiming to become more U.S.-focused, is selling a total of 11 cars from its collection at three separate auctions this year.</p>
        
            <p>The Mercedes 'Silver Arrows' dominated the immediate pre- and post World War Two era of grand prix racing with the W196 R a world-beater in 1954 and 1955.</p>
        
            <p>The streamlined bodywork with enclosed wheels was used at high-speed circuits, with the open-wheeled version favoured for more twisty tracks.</p>
