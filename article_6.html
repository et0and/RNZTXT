            <p>The All Blacks know how tough it will be be to win back to back tests in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The Rugby Championship holders have landed in Johannesburg ahead of the first match against the Springboks on Sunday morning (NZT), with the second test in Cape Town the following weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran All Blacks hooker Codie Taylor concedes South Africa, who are coming off two big wins over the Wallabies, will be tough to beat in their own back yard.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always special coming here. Such a unique rivalry, their the best team in the world and they're playing like it so it's going to be a massive challenge for us as a team."</p>

            <p>Prop George Bower has been called into the squad to replace the injured Ethan de Groot and he can't wait to play his second test on Ellis Park.</p>
        
            <p>Bower said the ground, known for its high altitude and thin air, is a special and daunting place to play, but he's confident the stadium holds no demons for the All Blacks ahead of this week's test.</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks have won nine of the 15 games they've played against New Zealand at the stadium, however the All Blacks won their most recent test at Ellis Park, beating South Africa 35-23 in 2022 to save then coach Ian Foster's job.</p>
        
            <p>Bower said that result gives them confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"That was an awesome win and one of my favourite games I've been apart of. It's a big challenge but we know we can win (at Ellis Park) and I'm excited," Bower said.</p>

            <p>The Springboks are favourites to win on Sunday morning but they won't be underestimating an All Blacks side desperate to prove they are the real deal under new coach Scott Robertson and a better side than the one that lost to Argentina in Wellington earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>They will also have to overcome the disruption of losing attack coach Leon MacDonald, who quit last week after just five tests with the side.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson cited a different views on coaching as the main reason for his exit.</p>
        
            <p>Bower is confident the sudden departure won't negatively affect the All Blacks and said the players are looking forward to taking on the World Cup winning South Africans and reigniting what he believes is the biggest rivalry in test rugby.</p>
        
            <p>The two teams have played each other more than 100 times since 1921 when they first met in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a rivalry that dates back long before I was born. It's a rich history in terms of rugby and also the relationship between the two countries as well," Bower said.</p>
        
            <p>"You come here as a kiwi and the players really respect you but then on the field they give you the best challenge ever and there are plenty of supporters here that love the All Blacks as well and they get behind us."</p>
        
            <p>Rookie loose forward Wallace Sititi has yet to play at Ellis Park, but he's heard plenty about it from some of his more senior team-mates.</p>
        
            <p>"They said the fans do it different here. Good atmosphere and really loud, so I'm excited to experience that," Sititi said.</p>
