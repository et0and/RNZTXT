            <p>The Wellington Phoenix are investigating the actions of a small group of spectators at Sky Stadium on Friday night after visiting fans were subjected to multiple physical altercations.</p>
        
            <p>The spectators entered the Melbourne Victory supporters' bay during the top of the table A-League match, antagonised the visiting fans and threw cans before starting fights in second half stoppage time.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix general manager David Dome said they had zero tolerance for anti-social behaviour at their matches.</p>
        
            <p>"These individuals are not welcome at Phoenix games and we will seek sanctions against them, including potentially banning them from the A-League if charges are proven," Dome said.</p>
        
            <p>"This would be an unprecedented step for the club. There currently aren't any Phoenix fans who are on the league's banned list.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with the police to identify the culprits."</p>
        
            <p>The club would also work with Sky Stadium management, who are responsible for venue security, to ensure there's no repeat of the unruly scenes.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to apologise to all of the Victory supporters who travelled across the Tasman for the match. We want a fun, family-friendly environment at our home games.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately the behaviour of a small number of people took away from what was a great occasion on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of the crowd was amazing and helped inspire the team to score a stoppage time equaliser, after playing the entire second half with just 10 men.</p>
        
            <p>"It was unquestionably one of the most dramatic games of the season and the atmosphere created by our fans was incredible, so it is very disappointing to have a small group of idiots engage in behaviour that no one else in the crowd wanted.</p>
        
            <p>"Our fans, led by the Yellow Fever, have a great reputation throughout the league and this behaviour is not reflective of the relationship they have with other supporter groups.</p>
        
            <p>"Victory and Nix supporters were mixing freely after the game so we know this was an isolated incident and not representative of our fans."</p>
