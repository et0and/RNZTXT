            <p>The former Kiwis coach Michael Maguire has been confirmed as the new coach of NRL side the Brisbane Broncos on a three-year deal.</p>
        
            <p>Maguire succeeds Kevin Walters, who was dismissed after four years in the job after the Broncos missed the finals, ending the 2024 season in 12th position.</p>
        
            <p>It means Maguire will step down immediately from his current role as coach of the New South Wales State of Origin side.</p>
        
            <p>He will start immediately with the Broncos and have a month to prepare for the 2025 preseason, which starts in early November.</p>
        
            <p>Maguire, who led the Blues to an Origin series win over Queensland this year, is an experienced coach, having earned a premiership with South Sydney in addition to a Super League title with Wigan and spending time at Wests Tigers and six years in charge of New Zealand.</p>

            <p>His club record as a coach is 303 games coached for 167 wins, while his win-loss record at representative level is 21 games coached for 14 wins.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Broncos CEO Dave Donaghy said: "Michael brings a wealth of experience across more than two decades of coaching and he has tasted success at club, state and international level.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe he is the right man to fill the role of Head Coach at the Broncos to take our current playing group forward.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking forward to Michael supporting our football program as they get to work on preparations for 2025."</p>
        
            <p>In the club statement, Maguire said Brisbane was a great club and it would be "an honour to step into the role of head coach".</p>
        
            <p>"The Broncos organisation has a high expectation on everything it does," Maguire said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's built a great history and shown the strength of what a club can be and what it can mean to fans. Playing my part in the great vision of what the Broncos stand for is the exciting part for me.</p>
        
            <p>"We want the members to turn up and be proud of the way we play, proud of their team. I can't wait to get started in Brisbane."</p>
