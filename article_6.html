            <p>The Melbourne Storm's Kiwi halfback Jahrome Hughes has edged out Sydney's James Tedesco to win the NRL's top award.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes won the Dally M Medal by one vote.</p>
        
            <p>As the event was wrapping up, Hughes's Melbourne teammate Will Warbrick charged forward from the back of the ball room at the Royal Randwick Racecourse.</p>
        
            <p>As he came forward, Storm star Eli Katoa and Canberra's Joe Tapine descended the stairs to join Warbrick in an emotional haka for their Kiwi teammate.</p>

            <p>Hughes became just the fourth New Zealander to win the award after Gary Freeman (1992), Jason Taumalolo (2016) and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck (2018).</p>
        
            <p>Hughes held a one-vote lead over Tedesco heading into final round.</p>
        
            <p>"I never thought I'd be a halfback in the NRL," Hughes said after receiving the award. "I thought I was a fullback until a guy called Papenhuyzen took my spot. I had to find a spot somewhere else in the team and Craig [Bellamy] made it halfback.</p>
        
            <p>Roosters back rower Olivia Kernick was named the NRLW's best player for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Both Dally M winners will look to add to their silverware on Sunday, with Kernick's Roosters come up against the Cronulla Sharks before Hughes's Melbourne Storm meet three-time defending premiers Penrith.</p>
