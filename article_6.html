            <p>A representative for the country's top rowers and cyclists says there is still a way to go before they're treated fairly, despite winning a landmark employment case.</p>
        
            <p>The Employment Relations Authority on Wednesday ruled in favour of The Athletes' Cooperative and found High Performance Sport NZ (HPSNZ) is obligated to engage in good-faith collective bargaining with the group, which represents around 60 elite cyclists and rowers.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Athletes Federation boss Rob Nichol told Morning Report the ruling was a step in the right direction.</p>
        
            <p>He said the rowers and cyclists wanted the opportunity to negotiate their pay and conditions, just like other people paid by HPSNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're a physio, a doctor, a performance coach, you can go and coach or work somewhere else, you've got options.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no option, if you've chosen to row for New Zealand and you're one of the talented, the Emma Twiggs of the world etc, or a cyclist, and you want to commit to the national high performance funded</p>
        
            <p>sporting environment, that's your focus."</p>
        
            <p>Nichol said the current system creates a power imbalance against the athletes who are essential told to "take it or leave it".</p>
        
            <p>"It's no longer a hobby where they work all day and train in the evenings, they are making a positive choice to say this is my career, this is my profession, this is what I'm dedicating my life to.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not asking for a fortune or anything, they just want to be treated fairly and reasonably."</p>
        
            <p>Sports commentator Mark Watson told Morning Report he was surprised by the ruling.</p>
        
            <p>"I always believed that as an athlete you get into it because you want to represent your country, you're not owed anything, you chose to do this."</p>
        
            <p>He said he did understand the athlete's frustrations, but didn't think there was enough money for what they wanted.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got $44m a year invested in high performance sport going across 44 sports, suddenly you've got 60 athletes all saying 'hey I want a bit more pay parity, I want a bit more security'.</p>
        
            <p>"Well you know athletics are going to jump on board, swimming are going to jump on board, all these other sports are going to jump on board.</p>
