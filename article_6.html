        <h2>Warriors' Mitch Barnett selected for NSW State of Origin Squad</h2>
        <p>
Andrew Webster will be without another key player for the Origin period, but the Warriors coach couldn't be happier.
</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors could potentially be without one of their best performers for the next few rounds, but coach Andrew Webster couldn't be happier.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Barnett has been selected for Michael Maguire's New South Wales squad for State of Origin, making him potentially the first Warriors player ever to debut for the Blues and only the second overall to be selected after Ryan Hoffman in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Barnett was named as a reserve, meaning that he could be released for games against the Cowboys and Broncos that fall on Origin weeks. However, Webster was ecstatic at the call-up.</p>
        
            <p>"He's worked so hard, he's been the glue the last two weeks," said Webster.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people are made for Origin, and he's made for it. This is his arena. It's tough, it's hard, it's about detail because you've got to get together quick, you've got to be a good person and mix well in a short space of time ... the harder it gets, the better he gets. That's what Origin is."</p>
        
            <p>Barnett was looking forward to the challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a nice moment for me and my family, something that's been on the bucket list for a while," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Webster was proud of the way his side battled unprecedented adversity to claim a 24-20 win over the Dolphins on Sunday.</p>

            <p>"Awesome, I'm so proud of the team," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The 17 that were on the field were so tight, so confident in what they were doing. If you'd seen our dressing room before the game, you'd understand that was no fluke tonight. It was just energy ... they literally believed they could beat a top four side."</p>
        
            <p>Webster played down the disruptions in the build-up, that started mid-week with the news that Addin Fonua-Blake was to be stood down for the game due to a breach of team protocols. Rocco Berry didn't recover from a hand injury, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad fell ill on Sunday morning and Taine Tuaupiki's partner went into labour.</p>
        
            <p>That was on top of having Shaun Johnson, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, Tohu Harris and Wayde Egan out injured as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a different kind of build-up. No one panicked, Te Maire (Martin) texted me and said, 'who is my halves partner', but when they arrived at the ground you could tell they really wanted to play with each other."</p>
        
            <p>Barnett, who captained the side in Harris' absence said that "it was a great day for the club".</p>
        
            <p>"We really just focused on our training and I think you can see the results of that ... I thought we were in the grind, and we sort of settled ourselves and calmed down and focused and turned the game, especially with possession."</p>
        
            <p>Regarding the Fonua-Blake situation, which fuelled speculation the prop was seeking an early release to join the Sharks, Webster said that he gad "taken on board" the in-house suspension and that they were looking to "move on".</p>
        
            <p>"Him and his agent have not given me any indication," Webster said of Fonua-Blake leaving the Warriors before the end of the current season.</p>
        
            <p>"I need to make sure I kept him accountable, it's as simple as that ... his reaction so far has been good."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors head into a bye week, before heading to Townsville to take on the North Queensland Cowboys in round 14.</p>
        
            <p>Dylan Edwards, Brian To'o, Stephen Crichton, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, Zac Lomax, Jarome Luai, Nicho Hynes, Jake Trbojevic, Reece Robson, Payne Haas, Liam Martin, Angus Crichton, Cameron McInnes.</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: Isaah Yeo, Haumole Olakau'atu, Spencer Leniu, Hudson Young. 18th man: Matt Burton. Reserves: Luke Keary, Mitchell Barnett.</p>
