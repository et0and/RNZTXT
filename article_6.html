            <p>New Zealand has close to a 200-strong team some of whom are competing already while others don't line up till the final day.</p>
        
            <p>The Oly Whites and the men's sevens' team were the first to settle their Olympic nerves, beginning with wins two days out from the opening ceremony centred on the Seine River in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Football Ferns are embroiled in a growing controversy over a spy drone that has resulted in two of Canada's support staff losing their places at the Games.</p>
        
            <p>With more on the field action looming here's a timetable of when all the Kiwi athletes will be competing. All the times listed are for New Zealand.</p>
