            <p>Bowler Ben Sears has been called in Black Caps squad as injury cover for Kyle Jamieson head of the series opener against Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>Jamieson experienced stiffness in his left hamstring after travelling back from Bangladesh after the test series which wrapped up on 9 December.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Gary Stead described the approach as "precautionary".</p>
        
            <p>"We're taking a cautious approach with Kyle," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want to rush or push him back, particularly at the very start of our home summer.</p>
        
            <p>"He could play if absolutely necessary but we don't want to take any unnecessary risks, hence calling in Ben for this first match.</p>
        
            <p>"Ben's familiar to the team environment and it's been good to see him back at full fitness for the Firebirds."</p>
        
            <p>Sears is yet to debut in ODI cricket but featured in the squad for last year's Chappell-Hadlee Series in Cairns.</p>
