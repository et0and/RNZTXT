        <h2>'It's God's purpose': Savea to lead Moana Pasifika</h2>
        <p>
Ardie Savea will lead Moana Pasifika into a new era, named as captain for the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season.
</p>
        
            <p>Ardie Savea has been named captain for the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season.</p>
        
            <p>Savea made the shock move to the Super Rugby minnows from the Hurricanes last July, after spending a stint playing in Japan. The loose forward has played 94 Tests for the All Blacks and first captained the test side in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old says he's honoured to lead Moana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty special and I believe it's God's purpose for me to lead," said Savea.</p>

            <p>"When I signed with the team Tana (Umaga, head coach) spoke to me about it and I went away and thought about it. After spending some time talking to my wife and those close to me, I realised it was the right decision to say yes.</p>
        
            <p>"First and foremost I've got to lead myself first and that's through my performance on the field and how I operate at trainings, and off the field as well. I also want to serve the brothers, serve the team, serve the franchise and serve the people anyway I can."</p>
        
            <p>The team spent the last weekend at camp, bonding and building team chemistry before the Super Rugby season kicks off.</p>
        
            <p>It's given Savea the chance to connect with his new teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the boys I'd never met before so this weekend in camp has been awesome to spend some time with the brothers," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to lean on the great leaders that are already here has been awesome."</p>

            <p>Umaga said that: "Ardie is a hard worker and incredible role model who pushes others to be better by setting a high standard for himself, both professionally and personally.</p>
        
            <p>"That's something that stands out for us as a good leader, bringing out the best in the team and uplifting others. He's a natural leader who is going to have a massive impact on our team."</p>
