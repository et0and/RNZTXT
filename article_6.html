            <p>The Phoenix will be without their goalkeeper for the rest of the A-League football season with scans revealing Alby Kelly-Heald needs shoulder surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The young Wellington Phoenix keeper dislocated his shoulder at training earlier this month and didn't travel to Sydney for the round 23 match against the Sky Blues.</p>
        
            <p>An MRI has since revealed a torn labrum in his left shoulder which requires surgery, cutting short his breakout season.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old made eight successive starts from when he made his A-League debut in January and kept two clean sheets.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly-Heald said he was gutted.</p>
        
            <p>"When you start playing you see yourself continuing to play the rest of the season. You don't anticipate any big injuries or anything like this. I'm disappointed I can't finish the season off with the team, but I'll be supporting on the sideline," Kelly-Heald said.</p>
        
            <p>But the young goalkeeper is determined to come back stronger than ever and remains hopeful of returning in time for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile in September and October.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Giancarlo Italiano feels for Kelly-Heald and the team.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed for Alby on a personal note because he's done a lot of hard work to get the number one spot," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also disappointing for the team dynamic because since he's come in he's given us a lot of security. But once he's had surgery he'll be back in no time and it's just a small little bump in his career."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano is confident Josh Oluwayemi and Dublin Boon will step up in Kelly-Heald's absence.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw Joshy step up against Sydney, which was good. He was ready for his opportunity and Dubs will do a good job as an understudy."</p>
