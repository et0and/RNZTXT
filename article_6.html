            <p>The Black Caps injury list continues to grow after last night's 2-0 Chappell-Hadlee series defeat to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opener Devon Conway was a casualty in the second over after he took a blow to his left thumb while keeping wickets in the second T20 at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>The team's medical staff attended to Conway and Finn Allen took over the wicketkeeping duties.</p>
        
            <p>Conway was coming into form after scoring 63 runs in Wellington in the series opener but was unable to build on that performance.</p>
        
            <p>Scans have now cleared the batter of a fracture but he could still face a nervous wait ahead of the first test at the Basin Reserve starting on Thursday in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's top-scorer Glenn Phillips said Conway was an "integral part" of the Black Caps and his presence at the top of the order was missed in the heavy 72-run defeat.</p>
        
            <p>"He always gives a lot of confidence to the guys that are behind him and it was a big loss," Phillips said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were already without powerful hitter Daryl Mitchell who is recovering from an ongoing foot problem and Rachin Ravindra was a late withdrawal last night due to knee soreness.</p>
        
            <p>Paceman Lockie Ferguson (4-12) and Ben Sears (2-27) showed encouraging signs with the white ball, with the ICC Men's T20 World Cup looming.</p>
        
            <p>The bowling performance of the New Zealand quicks helped restrict Australia to a total of 174, while Adam Milne (2-40) chipped in with two wickets on a pitch that offered seamers plenty.</p>
        
            <p>With a reshuffled batting order and with wickets falling at regular intervals, the Black Caps were all out for 102 in just 17 overs in their reply.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will look to chase a consolation win at Eden Park tomorrow afternoon in the final T20 of the three-match series.</p>
