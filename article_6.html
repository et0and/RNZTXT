            <p>The wait goes on for Mea Motu.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi boxer was set to fight Elli Scotney for the IBF and WBO bantamweight titles next month, but the Brit has pulled out with a wrist injury.</p>
        
            <p>Having been chasing this bout for well over a year, Motu said Scotney's withdrawal has "really pissed her off" and fuelled her even more to take Scotney's belts.</p>
        
            <p>'I'm not going to stop calling until we fight, I'm still coming for her."</p>
        
            <p>The fight will be rebooked, with no date as yet.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, Motu has found another opponent in Australian Shannon O'Connell who she meets on 4 October in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>A seasoned vet, O'Connell has 31 career fights with 11 knockouts.</p>
        
            <p>But Motu sees it as little more than a bump in the road en route to the titles and while frustrating, she was happy to at least have a new opponent to take it out on.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just glad to get back in the ring, I've been training all year, and to be postponed by Ellie has really annoyed me, but I'm happy I've got a fight locked in against the best in Australia and I am going to take over. It's just another fight for me, I want to fight the best, and obviously she is the best over here."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the setback, Motu's eyes are still firmly locked on Scotney.</p>
        
            <p>"It only prepares me more for Ellie, she still has to fight me."</p>
