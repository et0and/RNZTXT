            <p>The Black Caps have taken a 2-nil lead in the five-match T20 international series after beating Pakistan by 21 runs in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opener Finn Allen was at his explosive best scoring 74 off 41 balls as the hosts scored 194 for 8 to set up the thriller.</p>
        
            <p>Bowler Ben Sears claimed the key wicket of Pakistan captain Babar Azam on 66 which he hit off 43 balls as the visitors were dismissed for 173 in the final over, falling short of their target of 195.</p>
        
            <p>Paceman Adam Milne claimed 4 wickets for 33 runs, including the key scalp of Fakhar Zaman for a lively 50 off 25 balls, while Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi and Sears bagged two wickets each.</p>

            <p>New Zealand captain Kane Williamson retired hurt on 26 after he tweaked his right hamstring running between wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The injury puts Williamson's place in doubt for the remainder of the series, although he was already set to miss game three in Dunedin on Wednesday under a scheme to regulate his appearances.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson's score was the second-highest for New Zealand, whose innings lost its way towards the end following the dismissal of Allen in the 13th over.</p>
        
            <p>Paceman Haris Rauf was the best of Pakistan's bowlers at the death, finishing with 3-38.</p>
        
            <p>Stand-in winning captain Tim Southee told broadcaster TVNZ he enjoyed watching Allen hit seven fours and five sixes to set a platform for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a good surface and the way Finn Allen and the boys at the top set it up was very pleasing," Southee said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Pakistan brought it back very nicely and the two innings were quite similar in a way.</p>
        
            <p>"Adam Milne and Ben Sears, our young guys have shown a lot of character at this level, were outstanding with the ball.</p>

            <p>"Ish Sodhi shouldn't be overlooked in his efforts with 20 off his first over to come back and get two vital wickets for us in his last three was massive as well."</p>
