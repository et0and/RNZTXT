            <p>Two absolute powerhouse clubs have met in what was one of the most anticipated games.</p>
        
            <p>Minors premiers Melbourne Storm had been on cruise control once again, finding themselves in yet another preliminary final, whilst a resurgent Sydney Roosters outfit had streaked into the finals in red-hot form, dispatching everyone that came their way.</p>
        
            <p>The Storm, who retained the same squad who beat the Sharks an impressive 37-10 two weeks ago, were the favourites and made the most of last weekend's rest, taking out the Roosters 48-18.</p>
