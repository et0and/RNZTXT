            <p>New Zealand captain Kane Williamson remained coy about his future in 20-overs internationals after his team crashed out from the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the United States.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand could not make the Super Eight stage of the 20-team tournament and finished third as West Indies and Afghanistan advanced from group C.</p>
        
            <p>Team mate Trent Boult has confirmed this was his last T20 World Cup but Williamson would not reveal his plans after they finished their group campaign with a consolation victory against Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know," Williamson, 33, said when asked if he would be seen in action in the 2026 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a bit of time between now and then, so it's about regrouping as a side.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got red-ball cricket over the next year basically, so it's back into some other international formats, and we'll see where things land."</p>
        
            <p>Williamson said it was "frustrating" to crash out so early despite their habit of punching above their weight in global tournaments.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand began their campaign with defeats by Afghanistan and West Indies and their subsequent victories against Uganda and Papua New Guinea were of no real use.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to start the campaign strong, and we weren't able to do that," Williamson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We played against a couple of very strong sides who are very well equipped in these conditions and unfortunately it made the difference in our first two games."</p>
        
            <p>The tournament has proved a low-scoring affair so far with just three 200-plus scores, while no batter has managed to register a century.</p>
        
            <p>"Rhythm to batting doesn't really exist on these wickets," Williamson said of the slow tracks in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"It's trying to find a method that might allow you to get competitive totals and that's quite different to other surfaces that are slightly more even."</p>
