            <p>There was drama and upsets aplenty on the final day of the artistic gymnastics event.</p>
        
            <p>Brazil's Rebeca Andrade won the women's floor event, with hot favourite Simone Biles taking the silver.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the beam, Biles fell off and was out of contention - leaving room for Italy's Alice D'amato to take gold.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, Poland women gave Spiderman a run for his money in the speed climbing competition, and three Kiwis are through to the final of the women's pole vault.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some of the best pictures from the day's action.</p>
