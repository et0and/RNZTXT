            <p>A stunning performance from Black Cap Michael Bracewell has put the Wellington Firebirds back in charge of the national Plunket Shield championship.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old member of one of New Zealand cricket's most famous cricket families took a career-best 8/41 off just 11.4 overs at the Basin Reserve to ensure the Wellington Firebirds took an innings victory over the Otago Volts, with a day to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Off-spinner Bracewell's previous best first-class figures (having moved, several years ago, towards becoming a spinning allrounder in order to increase his chance of Black Caps' selection) had been 5/43 in 2019/20.</p>
        
            <p>That was the first season he began to bowl at first-class level, having previously played for nine seasons as a batsman only.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday he led the way to bowl out the Otago Volts for just 99 in 27.4 overs in their second innings, with the Wellington spinners - Bracewell and leg-spinning accomplice Peter Younghusband (2/27) - taking all 10 wickets to fall, and 15 for the match between them, after Younghusband's bag in the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>The result gives the Firebirds the maximum 20 points for the match, returning them to the top of the table where they currently hold a four-point (interim) lead over former leader Northern Districts.</p>
        
            <p>The Firebirds' victory in Wellington meanwhile sets up a must-see last match in Hamilton from Sunday when they will be taking on ND, the two frontrunners for this season's national title going head-to-head.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell twice put himself on a hat-trick (unconverted) during his star turn, and he rocked the Volts by taking three wickets - Thorn Parkes, Dale Phillips and captain Dean Foxcroft for a golden duck - in a game-changing, chaotic eighth over from which the remainder of the Volts line-up never recovered.</p>
        
            <p>The career-best performance comes less than a year after Bracewell was injured playing county cricket in England.</p>
        
            <p>He ruptured his right Achilles tendon - missing the World Cup last year.</p>
