            <p>The Breakers season continues after beating the Sydney Kings in the first round of the NBL basketball play-offs.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers won the Play-In Qualifier 83-76 in Sydney to eliminate the Kings, ending their hopes of a "three-peat" of titles.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland side, who have had plenty of injury issues in recent weeks, got through on the back of a strong performance from import guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright, who scored 34 points.</p>
        
            <p>The Kings lead 22-15 after the first quarter and were up by nine at half time before the visitors fought back in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers outscored the Kings 45-29 to move into a Play-In battle with the Illawarra Hawks in Wollongong next Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright was instrumental in New Zealand dominating the second half, he also had six assists and five rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>Forward Zylan Cheatham injured an ankle in the second quarter, but came back on court scoring in the second half with points, four rebounds and three steals.</p>
        
            <p>Will McDowell-White took to the floor just two weeks after suffering what initially looked to be a serious shoulder injury in the side's Round 20 win over Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys are so tough," said coach Mody Maor.</p>
        
            <p>"They care about all the right things, they care about each other, and they're battle tested, because this season has been tough and we've seen everything and been through everything.</p>
        
            <p>"Once I walked into the locker room at half-time, I knew we were winning the game because there was no sign of anything but determination and being focused on the task. It was fantastic and I'm really proud."</p>
        
            <p>The victory means the retiring Tom Abercrombie gets to play at least one more game.</p>
