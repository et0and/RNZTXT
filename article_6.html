            <p>Magic player Ali Wilshier will miss the remainder of the ANZ Premiership netball season with scans confirming the midcourter has suffered a serious knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>Scans have revealed Wilshier suffered a partial MCL (medial collateral ligament) tear and cartilage injury in the round eight match against the Stars in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In the final quarter, the left knee of Wilshier buckled and she had to be helped off the court.</p>
        
            <p>In the same game, Silver Ferns and Stars midcourter Mila Reuelu-Buchanan injured her knee and has since been ruled out of netball for the rest of the year with an ACL injury.</p>
        
            <p>Magic coach Mary-Jane Araroa said Wilshier would undergo surgery before continuing her rehabilitation under the care of the Magic medical team.</p>
        
            <p>"We were incredibly pleased with Ali's performances and it's unfortunate we will not see her return for the rest of the season. We will focus on getting her ready for the 2025 Premiership."</p>
        
            <p>Wilshier had been forming a strong midcourt combination with Claire O'Brien, and the Magic had been building momentum before an 18-goal loss to the Tactix in their round nine match last week.</p>
        
            <p>They still sit fourth on the ladder behind the third-placed Mystics and host the Steel in Hamilton tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Wilshier was benefiting from regular court time at the Magic, after spending a season in the UK super league last year.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to that, the 25-year-old spent two seasons with the Steel where her court time was limited due to injury.</p>
        
            <p>Several players have had significant time off the court this season due to injury, including Silver Ferns shooter Grace Nweke, and Amelia Walmsley and Maddy Gordon at the Pulse.</p>
        
            <p>Steel wing attack Shannon Saunders was ruled out of the season a few weeks ago due to injury.</p>
