            <p>New Zealand duo of Erin Routliffe and Michael Venus have exited the mixed doubles of the Australian Open after going down in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>The second seeded pair were beaten by Australian wildcards Olivia Gadecki and John Peers 6-4 6-4 on Margaret Court Arena in cool and blustery condition with the crowd supporting both sides.</p>
        
            <p>There were only a couple of stray points in each set which cost Routliffe and Venus, who reached the same stage at Wimbledon last year as well.</p>
        
            <p>Venus was broken in the ninth game on the first set after a long and hard-hit rally as a reaction volley was hit into the net by Routliffe.</p>
        
            <p>In the second set, Peers again stepped up for the Australians and dominated where he could.</p>

            <p>World No.2 Routliffe dropped her serve in the third game as Peers put on the pressure with a deep groundstroke at her feet and from then on, the games went with the serve.</p>
        
            <p>Peers eventually served out the match with an ace down the middle of the forehand side to old teammate Venus to wrap up the match.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Canadian Gaby Dabrowski will play their women's doubles semi-final tomorrow (Thursday 23 January) against the unorthodox third-seed pairing of Su-Wei Hsieh (Taipei) and Jelena Ostapenko (Latvia).</p>
