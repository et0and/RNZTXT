        <h2>Black Caps beleaguered after batty day at the Basin</h2>
        <p>
It's been a day for the bowlers at the Basin.

            <p>After a day which saw 15 wickets fall, 366 runs scored and a some classic test theatre play out, the tone has been set for a thrilling second clash between New Zealand and England.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis dismantled the English top order, all while Harry Brook produced a blazing century, his second successive, as his comrades crumbled around him.</p>
        
            <p>But after 54 enthralling overs, more drama followed as the second act commenced, the Black Caps also battling with the Basin deck.</p>
        
            <p>Seriously struggling at stumps at 86/5 still 194 runs behind, a memorable morning with the ball made way for another Black Caps' batting horror show.</p>
        
            <p>With New Zealand winning the toss and opting to bowl, the carnage quickly unfolded.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists were rocked with four early wickets, Matt Henry claiming the first two scalps as skipper Tom Latham regained some catching confidence as he snaffled one at slip.</p>
        
            <p>Henry then got one through the gate and sent Crawley packing after a scoring a quickfire dozen.</p>
        
            <p>Nathan Smith got in on the action, dismissing Root for three as Daryl Mitchell nabbed one handed ripper to have England 23/3.</p>
        
            <p>Smith then removed Bethell for 16 after another nick behind into the gloves of Tom Blundell to make it 43/4.</p>
        
            <p>Enter Harry Brook, centurion in Christchurch, to stem the damage with a blistering counter attack.</p>
        
            <p>Along with Oli Pope, Brook clobbered the kiwis around the park, bringing up a consecutive century, this one off just 91 balls.</p>
        
            <p>He and Pope combined for 174 crucial runs off just 159 balls.</p>
        
            <p>However, the resistance was broken when Will O'Rourke entered the fray, Pope sending one skyward to the waiting hands of Rachin Ravindra.</p>

            <p>Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes followed soon after, O'Rourke taking three wickets to once again have England reeling.</p>
        
            <p>Brook threatened to undo the home side's brilliant start, but was run out by Nathan Smith for 123, leaving the English 259 for 7 at tea.</p>
        
            <p>And they would not last long.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand mopped up the tail with little difficulty, the last three batsmen falling for 17 runs, Smith claiming the final, and his fourth wicket of the innings.</p>
        
            <p>After a conservative start with the bat by both Devon Conway and Latham, Conway's woes continued when he edged one to the slip cordon.</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson hit a four off his first ball and was then given a major reprieve.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was clean bowled on 20, only for him to get a second life as English seamer Brydon Carse overstepped with a no-ball.</p>
        
            <p>Latham lost his middle stump to Ben Stokes for 17, bringing Rachin Ravindra to the middle, but he would not last long either as Carse snagged a stunning grab to dismiss the local hero.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was unable to make the most of his second chance, caught behind off Carse for 37.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell did not trouble the scoresheet much, out just an over later for four, now the Kiwis in strife at 80/5.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell and O'Rourke survived to stumps, the curtain coming down on an absolutely batty day at the Basin.</p>
        
            <p>Play resumes at 11am.</p>
