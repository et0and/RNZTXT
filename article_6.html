            <p>A crowd at the Place de la Concorde has cheered wildly as French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Paralympic Games open on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Paris is promising a Games to remember as the opening ceremony for the 17th summer Paralymics gets underway.</p>
        
            <p>Around 4400 athletes from more than 160 countries are taking part, including 25 Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>Swimmer Cameron Leslie and athlete Anna Grimaldi have been chosen to be the flagbearers.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers say more than two million tickets have already been sold for events across the 11 days of competition.</p>
        
            <p>They are confident the Games will sell out, which would be a first for the event.</p>
        
            <p>International Paralympic Committee president, Andrew Parsons, when asked about the choice of having the opening ceremony outside the stadium said: "To us, it is like Paris is giving a gigantic hug to the Paralympic athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"When you hug someone, you're getting closer to the person and this is accepting the person like he or she is. This is our interpretation of this ceremony. We are being welcomed to Paris, at the very heart of the city."</p>
        
            <p>In his speech, he appealed to people to "open our minds wide".</p>
        
            <p>"For what you witness from Paralympic athletes are abilities and skills that surprise you. Levels of resilience and determination that energise you. And camaraderie that will inspire you.</p>
        
            <p>"Paralympic athletes are not here to participate, no, sir. They are not playing games. They are here to compete, win and smash world records."</p>
        
            <p>Parsons said Paralympians also wanted equality and inclusion for themselves and the world's 1.3 billion people with disabilities.</p>
