        <h2>Football round-up: All Whites old guard show age is just a number</h2>
        <p>
Instead of going gently into the good night of retirement, a couple of international players both appear set to rage, writes Mathew Nash.

            <p>Of the 23 All Whites who embarked on New Zealand's most recent men's World Cup campaign in South Africa nearly 15 years ago only two remain in the professional game. But rather than going gently into the good night of retirement, both appear set to rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        
            <p>Tommy Smith and Chris Wood were the youngest two members of that team - who infamously exited in the Group Stage despite being unbeaten. This weekend Smith, 34, and Wood, 33, both demonstrated a complete disregard for the long-held belief about footballers of their ilk.</p>
        
            <p>Smith played a key role at the heart of Auckland FC's defence as the Black Knights defeated his former side Macarthur 2-1 on Saturday to go five points clear of nearest rivals Adelaide United.</p>
        
            <p>However, as he led The Port, Auckland's vociferous South Stand supporter base, through a raucous post-match party, he did so as the last fit out-and-out centre-back on Auckland's books.</p>
        
            <p>A year ago, Smith's move to Auckland appeared to be written on the wall. The fledgling franchise were in the process of building their inaugural squad at the time and his arrival in Campbelltown always seemed like a layover. So it proved to be, when the experienced defender was announced as an Auckland player last June.</p>

            <p>However, the late transfer arrival of Nando Pijnaker saw Smith's role reduced to being 'The Closer' - an affectionate moniker gifted for his propensity to enter the game late to shore things up for head coach Steve Corica.</p>
        
            <p>But not anymore. Effectively, he has gone from graveyard slot DJ to headline act. Pijnaker exited at the weekend with an ankle injury which looks unlikely to heal fast. With Dan Hall, perhaps the club's outstanding centre-back, absent until March, it makes Smith the only fit and recognised centre-back at the club.</p>
        
            <p>For those worried about his ability to fulfil that role, in the infamous words of boxer-come-rapper Roy Jones Jr, 'ya'll must have forgot'. Smith made just under 250 appearances in the English Championship for Ipswich Town, including a goal-scoring performance in a play-off semi-final. He's played in FA Cup ties, East Anglia derbies and was Ipswich's Player of the Year in 2013. It's a career of achievements which makes him more than capable of leading the back-line in the A-League, especially alongside evergreen full-back Hiroki Sakai, with the captain likely to fill in alongside him for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>And then there is Wood - who is beginning to render superlatives erroneous. This weekend, he led Nottingham Forest on a scoring spree against Brighton, netting a hat-trick in a 7-0 romp.</p>

            <p>Wood became the first Kiwi to score a Premier League hat-trick with a first-half trio for Burnley v Wolves in April 2021. Now, he has three, including a point-proving trinity against former club Newcastle United in December 2023.</p>
        
            <p>It takes his tally to 17 Premier League goals this season, a career best, and bodes well for New Zealand's hopes of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup in North America. The All Whites have the final stages of the Oceania qualifiers coming up in March, and they will be strong favourites to overcome Fiji and then either Tahiti or New Caledonia to book their place at the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Wood is a shoo-in, and Smith has now likely put himself in with a strong chance of joining younger talents like Pijnaker, Tyler Bindon and Finn Surman in any potential World Cup squad. In doing so, at 16 years, both will have a shot at becoming the players with the longest gap between World Cup appearances, a just reward for the professionalism and consistency that has allowed such longevity for these two pillars of the New Zealand game.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix will be feeling rightly aggrieved after another 1-0 loss in the A-League Women. They dominated the league's top scorers Brisbane Roar, having 22 shots at goal. However, they conceded a contentious goal from a corner to suffer a second successive loss and drop to eighth in the table.</p>
        
            <p>In the Premier League, Arsenal asserted their dominance over struggling Manchester City with a 5-1 thrashing of the fallen Premier League holders.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, Liverpool remain in control in the title race after beating Bournemouth, Tottenham Hotspur are back to winning ways after an impressive triumph over Brentford and David Moyes is leading Everton to Premier League safety, with a 4-0 win over Leicester City his third in a row.</p>
