        <h2>“Are you not entertained?”: Auckland FC’s gladiators delight the masses</h2>
        <p>
They hadn't settled on a name one year ago, but the Black Knights' name has now become as synonymous with the wow factor, writes Mathew Nash. Video

            <p>"Are you not entertained?"</p>
        
            <p>Infamous words uttered on-screen by a New Zealand-born actor which helped him to an Academy Award 25 years ago. The Paul Mescal-led sequel to Russell Crowe's Gladiator has not fared as well ahead of the 97th edition of the Oscars this weekend, just the one nomination for costume design, but another Kiwi firebrand certainly has punters twitching from excitement.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC had not even settled on a name one year ago, but the Black Knights' name has now become as synonymous with the wow factor in the A-League as Maximus Decimus Meridius in Ridley Scott's fictionalised Colosseum.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend, it was a 4-4 draw with one of their main title rivals, Adelaide United, that had fans and pundits salivating over the drama much like the blood-thirsty Roman Emperor Commodus, so fiendishly portrayed by an up-and-coming Joaquin Phoenix, at the turn of the century.</p>
        
            <p>Guillermo May, who seems capable of swinging his left-foot with the ferocity of a Roman Gladiator's wielded blade, opened proceedings at Mount Smart on Saturday - with a now trademark thunderbolt from range.</p>
        
            <p>After he bundled home a second, it seemed Auckland were on their way to another procession-like triumph. Adelaide, however, tore up that script and after a couple of set-piece goals apiece, a brace of 'soft' penalties in the eyes of Steve Corica and two late strikes - fans at home and in attendance got their money's worth. With the increasingly soaring cost of Sky Sports - that's an impressive feat.</p>

            <p>Stoppage time provided the dramatic final act. A perfectly cast hero in Auckland's affable captain Hiroki Sakai seemed to have won it late in front of The Port - only for Bart Vriends to play the baddie, with a last-ditch leveller.</p>
        
            <p>It was circus day at GoMedia, and that finale certainly lived up to the billing - but when it comes to entertainment, Auckland have been providing all season.</p>
        
            <p>There was the reverse fixture between these two in January, when Auckland scored the latter of two stoppage time goals. Then there's Nando Pijnaker's smash-and-grab v Sydney, or Neyder Moreno's against Melbourne City and Western Sydney - and who can forget their burgeoning new rivalry with the Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Not many trilogies get better with each new installment. Lord of the Rings? Maybe. Clint Eastwood's Dollars trilogy. Arguably. Auckland's performances against Wellington. Definitely. From a late salvo, to a confident close-call to a demolition derby - a triad of increasingly escalating installments Sergio Leone would be proud of.</p>

            <p>Auckland have become must-see football. The great entertainers of the Colosseum that is the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>"I was the best because the crowd loved me." Another scripted sound byte from Gladiator, this time delivered from the late great Oliver Reed's Proximo, which applies to Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday's 4-4 draw was celebrated in The Port as if Auckland had been victorious because they came to be enthralled and that's what they got.</p>
        
            <p>Are they entertained? I think so.</p>
        
            <p>In other football news:</p>
        
            <p>It was Friday Night Lights for Wellington Phoenix - who welcomed Melbourne City to Sky Stadium at the weekend. Unfortunately, they were slain in a 2-0 defeat which surely puts an end to any lingering hopes of post-season football for Giancarlo Italiano's men.</p>
        
            <p>A positive week for the Football Ferns after a late Maya Hahn goal secured victory over Costa Rica on Wednesday. It was a first win in eight games and a much-needed boost after a difficult 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix's women are stuck in a rut. The in-form Adelaide United romped to a 3-1 triumph in Porirua and it could have been more, with 31 shots at goal from the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester United's defence of the FA Cup has come to an end - following a penalty shoot-out defeat to Fulham at Old Trafford. The Cottagers join Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Preston North End, Bournemouth, Manchester City and Brighton in the quarter-finals. Chris Wood's Nottingham Forest will look to join them by overcoming Ipswich Town on Tuesday morning (8.30am NZT).</p>
