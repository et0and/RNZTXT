            <p>Flag Football is flying in New Zealand and it's hoped it'll result in participation in the LA 2028 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Flag Football is a non-contact version of American Football and in recent years has become very popular in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The first full contact American Football clubs were formed in New Zealand in 1981 while the best known New Zealander in the NFL was David Dixon who played ten years for the Minnesota Vikings between 1994 and 2004.</p>
        
            <p>It's the flag version of the game that is now piquing interest around the country.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand teams have just returned from the Flag Football World Championships in Finland excited about the prospect of getting to the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Player Tom Rance said the possibility of going to the Olympics was the talk of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"Every team there had their eyes set on the Olympics," Rance told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously it's every athletes dream to go to the Olympics and there was a lot of buzz at the athletes village."</p>
        
            <p>The national body was also thrilled about the prospect.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an exciting time for the sport, it's booming world-wide and the momentum is there," said Russell McConnochie, general manager of New Zealand American Football Federation.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2018 membership has grown from just over 500 to 2000.</p>
        
            <p>There were four teams at the nationals in 2018 while more than 40 are expected for this summer's tournament which will be held across three days in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>McConnochie said two things happened in 2023 to help with the momentum.</p>
        
            <p>The NFL introduced a programme into New Zealand intermediate schools and LA organisers announced that the sport would be in the next Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The NFL funds the schools programme here, while they also pay for the tournament winning team to attend the NFL Pro Bowl in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the fourth most consumed sport in New Zealand. We walk into a school and say American Football and there are very few people who don't know what it is, which is hugely advantageous in introducing it," McConnochie said.</p>
        
            <p>"Madden NFL (the video game) is also very popular with kids."</p>

            <p>However the national body was struggling to keep up with the sports popularity.</p>
        
            <p>"We now get regional sports trusts calling up saying we've got interest, can you help us.... it's the same with schools."</p>
        
            <p>A recent unadvertised secondary schools trial in Auckland attracted 18 teams.</p>
        
            <p>McConnochie expects the sport to continue to grow now that it's in the Olympic programme.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a number of other sports that lend themselves to this sport like basketball, volleyball, sprinting, netball, touch and tag... all people that could transition very easily to this sport."</p>
        
            <p>While full contact NFL requires bulk, it's not the same for flag football.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more about skills rather than the big players because it's non-contact, it's very aerial and fast.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the keys for the future of the sport is getting it into a second Olympics so we can keep the momentum going."</p>
        
            <p>A form of flag football has been played since the 1940's when it was a recreational sport created for American military personnel to help with fitness.</p>
        
            <p>Organised national competitions started in the US in the sixties.</p>
