            <p>Race favourites Master Lock Comanche and LawConnect took the early lead in the 79th running of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, as the supermaxis led the 104 boats out into the South Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect, which won line honours last year in a thrilling finish by just 51 seconds, was first past the turning mark after cannons sounded the start of the race.</p>
        
            <p>However, it soon ran into some sail issues, giving race record-holder Master Lock Comanche an unexpected advantage.</p>
        
            <p>Wild Thing 100, another supermaxi, almost capsized after making a late tack to avoid the smaller Celestial V70.</p>
        
            <p>Covering approximately 630 nautical miles (nearly 1200km) of the Tasman Sea and notoriously treacherous Bass Strait, the gruelling annual race is Australia's premier yachting event.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasts were for a fast start in north-easterly winds of up to 20 knots, before a trough in the early hours of Friday bringing strong-to-gale-force south-westerly winds.</p>
        
            <p>The friendly weather conditions could bring the race record - set by LDV Comanche in 2017 - of one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds in sight.</p>
        
            <p>Sailors will be keen to avoid inclement weather when they cross the Bass Strait as they head across from the mainland toward the island state of Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>Five yachts were sunk and six sailors killed when a major storm hit the fleet during the 1998 race.</p>
