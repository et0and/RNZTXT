            <p>The conclusion of Sail GP's Season 4 gets underway in less that 24 hours in San Francisco with the Team New Zealand crew taking a cautious</p>
        
            <p>Having already clinched their place in tomorrow's three-boat finale, today's races were about getting a handle of the course and conditions to build confidence ahead of the big race.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand placed fourth in each of the three fleet races on day one in a consistent hit-out.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Burling's Black Foils prioritised keeping out of trouble ahead of the Grand Final race, but further down the standings there was plenty to race for.</p>
        
            <p>The Quentin Delapierre skippered France lead the standings on day one on 26 points after 1-3-3 finishes as they battle it out with Spain for the remaining spot in the shootout race.</p>
        
            <p>Three-time defending Sail GP champion Tom Slingsby steered Australia to 5-1-8 finishes to all but assure a spot in the Grand Final.</p>
        
            <p>Britain, with second placings in two of three races, are close behind France on 23 points.</p>
        
            <p>While Denmark claimed the last race of the day to sit third overall on 22 points.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis with 4-4-4 finishes sit one point further back and simply need to get through tomorrow's fleet racing in one piece to move on to the start line for the Grand Final.</p>
        
            <p>Two fleet races will take place from 9.30am tomorrow in San Francisco, with the three-boat Grand Final scheduled for a 10.35am start.</p>
        
            <p>The podium race from each leg of Sail GP has been replaced this round with the Grand Final race, with the top three nations on the season leaderboard contesting the last race, rather than the top three of the event.</p>
        
            <p>With $3.2 million on the line, there is a big payday to chase, and the New Zealanders will also pocket $570,000 for finishing at the top of the season leaderboard.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has won five of the previous 12 regattas in Season 4 of tech billionaire Larry Ellison's global league and are determined to take it to the defending champion Australian crew.</p>
        
            <p>The Aussies, led by Tom Slingsby, dominated the first three seasons of Sail GP, with three consecutive titles.</p>
