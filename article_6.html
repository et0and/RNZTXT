            <p>Maddi Wesche has claimed New Zealand's first track and field medal at the Paris Olympics winning silver in an extraordinary women's shot put final at Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>Germany's Yemisi Ogunleye, who took out the gold, needed something special to topple Wesche and she pulled out an absolute stunner of a final round throw.</p>
        
            <p>China's Jiayuan Song claimed bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche's second round throw of 19.58m kept her in the lead for some time before Germany's Yemisi Ogunleye jumped into the lead in the fifth round.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche responded immediately under pressure, with a personal best of 19.86m in the penultimate round.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi was in the gold medal position before Ogunleye's final throw of 20m jumped her into the top spot. Wesche's final attempt of 19.68m meant she had to settle for silver.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche flew under the radar in terms of Kiwi medal prospects these Games, but the 25-year-old has added to New Zealand's legacy in shotput.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche competed alongside Olympic great Dame Valerie Adams at the Tokyo Olympics three year's ago, when she came sixth.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Valerie won two Olympic golds, a silver and bronze medal.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has now stood on the women's shot put podium for five Olympics games in a row.</p>
