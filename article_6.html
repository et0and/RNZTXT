            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko has won the British Open at St Andrews.</p>
        
            <p>It is her third major title.</p>
        
            <p>Ko went into the final round tied for fourth, three shots from the leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic champion fired a three under par 69 which got her into a share of the lead late in her round and a birdie on the 18th gave her a one-shot lead.</p>
        
            <p>Ko then had to wait for her rivals to finish their rounds.</p>
        
            <p>In the end the 27-year-old finished two shots ahead of Lilia Vu and Nelly Korda of the United States, Jiyai Shin of South Korea and Ruoning Yin of China.</p>
        
            <p>The win is worth US$1,425,000 (NZ$2.28 million) for Ko.</p>
        
            <p>Ko's previous best result at the British Open was a tie for third in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"Winning the gold medal in Paris was almost too good to be true and heading into the weekend I thought how is it possible for me to be in contention for the British Open," Ko told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had the most Cinderella-type story the last few weeks and this is almost too good to be true.</p>
        
            <p>"Of all the major championships, this one I had the least amount of confidence just because I haven't had as much experience playing on links (courses).</p>
        
            <p>"So to be holding this trophy, I can't believe it."</p>
        
            <p>Her win at the Paris Olympics has qualified her for World Golf's Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>Korda was on par for four holes while Ko birdied the fourth to put herself within one shot of the leaders, meaning the top four were separated by a single stroke as the Open headed for a tense finish.</p>
        
            <p>However, Korda was on a mission to regain her lead and she sank four birdies over the next six holes to take the outright lead while she also saved par after finding the bunker on the 11th to leave Ko and Shin two shots behind.</p>
        
            <p>But Ko also slowly climbed up to top spot with three birdies before a bogey on the 15th saw all four sharing the lead at six-under overall.</p>
        
            <p>Ko then put the pressure on Vu and Korda when she finished with a birdie on the 18th for a final round of 69 to set the clubhouse target.</p>
        
            <p>Korda's chance of clinching a second major this year went up in smoke when she bogeyed the 17th and made par on the 18th to finish two shots behind Ko, the American rubbing the side of her head in disappointment as she walked off the greens.</p>
        
            <p>After Shin double-bogeyed the 17th, it was up to Vu to force a playoff but her putt fell short and Ko broke down in tears when victory was confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>In her disappointment, Vu also missed her putt for par and had to share second spot with Shin, Korda and China's Yin Ruoning at five under.</p>
