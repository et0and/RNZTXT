        <h2>As it happened: 'I'm stoked ... I'm proud': Black Ferns win NZ's first Olympic gold</h2>
        <p>
Winning try scorer Stacey Waaka is celebrating as the side says goodbye to retiring Black Ferns after a tense 19-12 final victory in Paris.
</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have won New Zealand's first medal of the Paris Games with a 19-12 victory over Canada in the final.</p>
        
            <p>The United States took the bronze medal in a stunning 14-12 win over Australia - the first time the USA has won an Olympic medal in this event.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a successful night on the water for NZ so far, with Emma Twigg and Tom Mackintosh comfortably winning their single sculls quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won their double sculls semi, and Robbie Manson and Jordan Parry came third in the men's event, so both duos are through to the final on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi swimmers have been less fortunate, with Lewis Clareburt (200m butterfly), Cameron Gray (100m freestyle) and Eve Thomas (1500m freestyle) all failing to progress in their heats.</p>
        
            <p>The men's individual triathlon is postponed until Wednesday night].</p>
