            <p>The Black Caps have posted a modest 134 for nine after recovering from a horror start to the first Twenty20 international against Bangladesh at Napier's McLean Park.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the toss, New Zealand's first three wickets fell in the first nine balls - for just one run - before their recovery was led by the big hitting exploits of allrounder Jimmy Neesham, who scored 48 off 29 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Neesham struck four fours and three sixes but was the only Black Cap to go past 25 as the Bangladesh attack showed the sort of intent that carried to victory in the third and final ODI at the same venue last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>That momentum continued as the tourists exploited lively early conditions to remove openers Finn Allen (one) and Tim Seifert (duck) while Glenn Phillips departed without scoring after being trapped LBW without offering a shot.</p>

            <p>As was the case in the ODI series - which New Zealand won 2-1 - seamer Shoriful Islam was the most effective Bangladesh bowler, taking 3-26 off four overs, including Mitchell Santner for 23 after the Black Caps captain put on 41 for the sixth wicket with Neesham.</p>
