            <p>Redemption and Pacific supremacy are on the line for the Kiwi Ferns this Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>After suffering a 14-0 defeat in the opening round, New Zealand will again face off against the Australian Jillaroos in the Pacific Championship final.</p>
        
            <p>After a narrow defeat two weeks ago, the Ferns are ready to make significant strides forward, aiming to defend their historic 2023 victory that ended a seven-year streak of losses to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Ricky Henry said there had been plenty of deliberations around picking the squad best suited for finals football.</p>
        
            <p>"This team that we have chosen for this final we believe will get the job done. The competition for positions underscores the abundance of quality talent in the team, ensuring a strong performance against the formidable Australian side."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Kiwis have named an unchanged line-up for their encounter with Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>Following their 24-25 loss to Tonga in their Pacific Cup contest in Auckland, the Kiwis finished third on the table to set up a promotion-relegation clash against the Kumuls, the winners of the Pacific Bowl competition.</p>

            <p>Tonga take on the Kangaroos in the final with the quadruple header kicking off with a women's promotion-relegation match between the Papua New Guinea Orchids and Fetu Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>While the New Zealanders lost to the Kangaroos and Tonga, the Kumuls beat Fiji Bati 22-10 in Suva and the Cook Islands Aitu 42-20 in Port Moresby on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Stacey Jones has today listed the same side which staged the valiant second half comeback in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Captain James Fisher-Harris and second rower Isaiah Papali'i will be making their 12th consecutive Test appearances for the Kiwis, having featured in every international in the last three years.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will meet Papua New Guinea for the first time in 11 years since a 56-10 win in Leeds en route to the 2013 Rugby League World Cup final at Old Trafford.</p>
