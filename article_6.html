            <p>American Noah Lyles has the chance to become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete an Olympic sprint double after qualifying for the 200m final at Paris 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Lyles won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, finished second in his 200m semi-final in 20.08 seconds to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.</p>
        
            <p>World 100m silver and 200m bronze medallist Tebogo set the fastest time of the round at Stade de France on Wednesday evening, clocking 19.96 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic men's 200m final takes place on Friday at 6.30am NZT.</p>

            <p>Kenneth Bednarek, of the United States, also set a faster time than Lyles, in 20.00, while compatriot Erriyon Knighton, who upgraded to world 200m silver last year, also safely progressed.</p>
        
            <p>But Canada's Andre de Grasse will not defend his title in the final after finishing third in his race (20.41).</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic 200m bronze winner three years ago, Lyles claimed world 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold in Budapest last year.</p>
        
            <p>Following that achievement, when he became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to complete a 100m and 200m world double, he claimed he could look to add the 4x400m relay title to that treble haul in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Jamaican sprint legend Bolt completed individual sprint doubles at three successive Olympic Games among his eight titles, adding relay gold in 2012 and 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Only nine men have achieved that double in the history of the Games.</p>
        
            <p>Lyles became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, with his narrow triumph.</p>
        
            <p>A three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will line up as favourite as he looks to further assert himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.</p>
