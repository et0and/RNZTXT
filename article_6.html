            <p>Without a Fight has become the first horse since 2021 to win the Melbourne Cup and the Caufield Cup in the same year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand mare Ethereal was the last horse to achieved the feat.</p>
        
            <p>It's jockey Mark Zahra's second Melbourne Cup having ridden to victory on Gold Trip last year.</p>
        
            <p>Second was Soulcombe and third Sheraz.</p>
        
            <p>The race worth nearly $9 million sees the winning horse get $4.8 million, with the winning jockey getting $240 thousand of that.</p>
        
            <p>Second place receives $1.1 million, third $550,000, fourth $350,000, fifth $230,000, and sixth to 12th $160,000.</p>
        
            <p>Zahra told Trackside immediately after the win that Without a Fight "was an absolute gentleman".</p>
        
            <p>"I was on a horse that you can just sit on. He's got an electric turn of foot and he just pulled me all the way to the line and it was all over.</p>
        
            <p>"I stood up in the irons giving it the two fingers for two wins, I don't what I was thinking..what an idiot"</p>

            <p>"It's been a great race for the family, it's been a while between drinks and it's good to get another one," said trainer Sam Freedman.</p>
        
            <p>"An extraordinary ride, he got him onto the rail from a wide gate, relaxed, switched him off, made a run."</p>
        
            <p>Zahra is the first jockey since Glen Boss on Makybe Diva to win consecutive Melbourne Cups.</p>
        
            <p>"The stars aligned for Gold Trip last year and aligned for this horse this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a few things and the way he won the Caulfield Cup, I was confident he would run it."</p>
        
            <p>The field was reduced to 23 after Cleveland was scratched.</p>
