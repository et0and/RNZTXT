            <p>New Zealand's Paralympics squad are entering their final phase of training, gearing up for the 2024 Paralympic games in Paris, taking place between the 28 August and 8 September.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ spoke to three athletes about their journey to Paris, podium goals, and that Paralympics Tiktok account.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-nine-year-old Holly Robinson is heading to her fourth Paralympic games in Paris next month, but it's her first competing in two events: javelin and shot put.</p>
        
            <p>She won gold at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics in the Women's Javelin, and said she is aiming for the podium in both.</p>
        
            <p>"Front of mind is definitely defending that Paralympic gold, but also a secondary medal as well. There are some good girls at the top for both events, but I'll have to be at the top of my game, but I'm excited for the challenge."</p>
        
            <p>She said sleep, recovery, and eating well were key to keeping her energy levels up high enough to earn two medals.</p>
        
            <p>"I just love challenging myself and working towards this one event that could either go well or not so well. But the moments where you get it right and you really nail the technical aspect of your throws is a really special moment."</p>
        
            <p>Tupou Neiufi is only 23, but at her third Paralympic games, she said she felt like a bit of a veteran.</p>
        
            <p>She won gold at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, but said she has had to overcome mental health hurdles to get back to the Paris Paralympics this year.</p>
        
            <p>"When your head's not in a good place, everything else follows with that. I'm very lucky to have an amazing team that helped me start overcoming that - it's not something that just goes away, it's still kind of there now and then. I have an amazing team that helps and supports me through that to these games."</p>
        
            <p>She is aiming to break personal records in these games.</p>
        
            <p>"At these games, all I'm looking for is just a fast time. A podium medal would be nice, but I think realistically based on the last couple of years, the goal for me is to just go faster."</p>
        
            <p>Three time gold medalist swimmer Cameron Leslie is returning for his fourth Paralympic games in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The 34-year-old missed the 2020 Tokyo games despite earning selection, but has since broken his own world records on the international stage three times, and won four medals in the 2023 World Para Swimming championships.</p>
        
            <p>He said the time passed since his last Paralympic Games in 2016 was not a setback.</p>
        
            <p>"Since Tokyo, I've had two world champs, and then we're into this year. So it's been a condensed cycle, plenty of high-level racing, plenty of training in that time too, so definitely not missing the beat. I've broken world records three times in the last three years, so we're well and truly on track for a good games."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was aiming to get back on the podium at Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanna be on the podium, 100 percent. What colour? I don't know. Paralympic sport has got to that level where you cannot guarantee any colour [of medal].</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the race tactics require a bit more bravery that I need to pump myself up to roll the dice of either chasing gold, or go for more of a safety option. We've still some more training between now and then to figure out whether we go for the safety of what we know for the last few years, or we roll the dice and go for gold."</p>

            <p>The official Paralympics TikTok account has attracted debate over whether its humorous social media presence, using footage of athletes, is disrespectful.</p>
        
            <p>Holly Robinson hasn't seen the TikTok account but says social media attention on the Paralympics have taken the games to new levels and changed perceptions of disability.</p>
        
            <p>"Paralympians are becoming household names. But I also think we need to have conversations around disability and what that looks like. That's okay to have conversations. Some people I think will be scared to approach me because I'm missing my arm, but we need to have those key conversations."</p>
        
            <p>Tupou Neiufi said she loves the TikTok's style but can see how it would not sit well with others.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand because some people will still be struggling with their disability. If they see themselves on the Paralympic page, not being made fun of but using certain humour for media, I understand if they don't like that. I love the page, I love the humour, but I also understand for those that don't agree on that type of content."</p>
        
            <p>Cameron Leslie said the humour was attracting more people to watch Paralympic sport, and humour was not something to be ashamed of.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't mind it. It's definitely sometimes borderline, but the main thing is it's attracting people's eyes to the Paralympic sport. And most of the time you are seeing some pretty bloody impressive stuff there, if you can see past the tongue and cheek of it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can laugh at ourselves, why can't we enjoy the lighter moments of a wheelchair being spun out in wheelchair rugby. I've been spun so many times in wheelchair rugby that it is just part of the game. When you cut it together it looks funny, but actually it's just part of the game."</p>
