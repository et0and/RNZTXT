            <p>A number of White Ferns players will miss the North-South cricket series over the next week with selectors taking the opportunity to give some domestic players higher honours.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Devine, Melie Kerr, Suzie Bates, Brooke Halliday, Georgia Plimmer, Rosemary Mair, Lea Tahuhu and Molly Penfold are either injured or are required to rest.</p>
        
            <p>However, internationals Maddy Green, Jess Kerr, Fran Jonas and Hannah Rowe will represent the North, and Polly Inglis, Hayley Jensen and Eden Carson have been named in the South.</p>
        
            <p>Recent White Ferns debutantes Emma McLeod, Flora Devonshire and Bree Illing will strengthen the Northern line-up while Izzy Sharp is in the South along with Bella James who is returning from injury.</p>
        
            <p>Northern Brave captain Jess Watkin will make her debut in the North squad along with 18-year-old rising star and recent New Zealand U19 representative Eve Wolland.</p>
        
            <p>Anna Browning and PJ Watkins of the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield winning Otago Sparks will make their debut in the South squad, joining eight of their Otago team-mates in the squad of 14.</p>
        
            <p>Re-established in the 2022-23 season, the North v South series aims to bridge the gap between domestic and international cricket.</p>
