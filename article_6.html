            <p>The Blues have kicked off their Super Rugby Pacific campaign under new coach Vern Cotter with a 34-10 defeat of Fijian Drua in Whangarei.</p>
        
            <p>Ill-discipline on defence and poor ball handling cost the Fijian Drua in the first half against a Blues side who were ready to make them pay.</p>
        
            <p>The Drua had the first opportunity to score in the first five minutes of the game but flanker Etonia Waqa dropped the ball over the try line.</p>
        
            <p>Instead it was Blues number 8 Hoskins Sotutu who scored the opening try in the 11th minute off the back of a big drive by the Blues forward pack.</p>
        
            <p>In his 50th game for the Blues winger Caleb Clarke scored the second try two minutes later which was converted by first-five Stephen Perofeta as the Blues started to take control of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Fullback Zarn Sullivan had the Blues' third try within 20 minutes but Perofeta couldn't convert from the sideline.</p>
        
            <p>Stand-in captain Dalton Papali'i crossed the line easily out wide for the fourth try of the first half while Perofeta's struggles off the tee continued.</p>
        
            <p>The Drua lost debutant first-five Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula to the sin bin with a yellow card just before half-time and the Blues took advantage with Sotutu crossing for his second try to give his side a 29-3 lead at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Still with 14 men on the park the Drua scored the first try of the second half to lock Leone Rotuisolia while Blues halfback Finlay Christie was also yellow carded at the same time for being offside just prior to the try being scored after the home side were warned for persistent infringing in the lead up to the try.</p>
        
            <p>Sullivan restored the Blues' advantage by getting on the end of some quick passes from the backline to score his side's sixth try.</p>
        
            <p>Perofeta's failure to claim a high ball at the back gave the Drua an opportunity to close the gap just before fulltime but the Blues averted the danger and held on for their first win of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The Drua meet Moana Pasifika in round two while the Blues play the Highlanders on Friday during Super Round in Melbourne.</p>
