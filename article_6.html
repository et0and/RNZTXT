            <p>A pivotal match in Oceania football history will take place at Eden Park on Monday night, many years after people involved believe it should have.</p>
        
            <p>Eight years ago when the qualification pathway for the 2026 Football World Cup changed countries from the Pacific dared to dream that it would be their team that became the first from the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) to gain direct entry to the expanded tournament.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand and New Caledonia are the last two standing of the OFC's 11 member nations vying for the coveted qualification berth.</p>
        
            <p>All Whites captain Chris Wood said it was "only fair" that FIFA's smallest confederation had representation at the World Cup, a sentiment that was echoed by coach Darren Bazeley.</p>
        
            <p>"To have a direct entry from this part of the world has probably been needed for a while now to make it a truly global competition... [it] is great for the whole region it gives everybody something to aspire to," Bazeley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously there is a secondary element to this qualification process as well so there is going to be another team getting a lot of experience playing high level opposition so I think is exciting for the whole region."</p>
        
            <p>The qualification process began in September 2024 when the four lowest-ranked countries in the region - Cook Islands, Tonga, American Samoa and Samoa - played in the first round. The All Whites and New Caledonia joined the second round of qualification in October and November last year alongside Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tahiti and Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>This month it was down to the final four of New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti and New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday night either the All Whites or New Caledonia will walk away after 90 minutes of football knowing they will be at next year's World Cup alongside 47 other countries.</p>
        
            <p>All will not be lost for the loser with the runner-up also having a chance to qualify via the FIFA Intercontinental Play-off Tournament against teams from Concacaf, AFC, CAF and CONMEBOL</p>

            <p>However, no player in the final is interested in second chances.</p>
        
            <p>New Caledonia midfielder Jekob Jeno emphasised that his side has been working tirelessly for this moment.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to win. We come here to play and give all for this game," Jeno said.</p>
        
            <p>Jeno said his side wanted to "give hope" to their nation.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to show our values, to show our strength, to show our confidence that we showed in the semi-final against Tahiti and the job is not finished.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing is impossible in football."</p>
        
            <p>All Whites defender Libby Cacace was similarly focused and putting any thoughts of returning to a intercontinetal play-off out of his mind.</p>
        
            <p>"The job is to qualify on Monday night and we'll do that," Cacace said.</p>
        
            <p>Cacace said the players' mindset changed when the qualification pathway changed but they were not taking anything for granted.</p>
        
            <p>"I think because we know we're probably the best in our [confederation] we defintely knew it would be a lot eaiser to get to the world cup that doesn't mean we're there already. We knew we'd have to go over to the islands qualify there it's always difficult going there but we've ticked every box so far and we've got one more box to tick."</p>
