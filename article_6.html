            <p>Former Wales rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has joined back-to-back Super Bowl champions the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>The 23 year old drew interest from several NFL franchises, and also had meetings with the New York Jets, Cleveland Browns and Denver Broncos.</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted on X, Rees-Zammit said: "Hi Chiefs Kingdom, Louis Rees-Zammit here.</p>
        
            <p>"Just signed, can't wait to go and see you all at Arrowhead."</p>
        
            <p>Rees-Zammit, who was part of the 2024 international player pathway (IPP), has targeted a hybrid role playing at both wide receiver and running back.</p>
        
            <p>Rees-Zammit's next task will be to try to earn a regular-season roster spot.</p>

            <p>After quitting Welsh rugby on the eve of this year's Six Nations tournament, Rees-Zammit announced he intended to pursue a career in the NFL in America.</p>
        
            <p>He was one of 16 players to take part in the 2024 IPP, a 10-week crash course designed to teach the required skills to succeed in the NFL.</p>
        
            <p>The ex-Gloucester player - who has won 32 caps for Wales, scoring 14 tries - showcased his skills at University of South Florida's Pro Day earlier this month, with scouts from all 32 NFL teams in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>While he did not test at an extremely high level in all metrics, his pace was impressive and up to the standard of NFL wide receivers.</p>
        
            <p>Now with the Chiefs, Rees-Zammit will be competing with the rest of the off-season squad to earn a place on Kansas City's final 53-man roster for the 2024 season, which begins in September.</p>
        
            <p>If he does not make it, Rees-Zammit is likely to spend his first season on Kansas City's practice squad.</p>
        
            <p>This year, for the first time, all 32 NFL franchises will be given an additional place in their practice squads specifically for players who have come through the IPP.</p>
        
            <p>Teams who have an IPP player on the practice squad will also be allowed to promote the player to the final active 53-man squad without taking up a space, up to three times during the season.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the hybrid role Rees-Zammit has talked about wanting to play, in the short term he may have a greater chance of being utilised as a kick returner.</p>
        
            <p>NFL rule changes have been implemented to encourage teams to return a greater number of kick-offs, an area where the Chiefs could look to use him.</p>
        
            <p>He has previously said he "would love" to return kicks on special teams, and his size, strength, speed and agility are attributes teams look for at the position.</p>
