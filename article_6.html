            <p>Like sporting champions from days gone by, such as All Blacks Colin Meads and Brian Lochore, speed-fencing national title holder Tim Garrick keeps fit for the competition stage by working the hill country.</p>
        
            <p>Garrick's backyard on the East Coast stretches the 150km distance from Tolaga Bay, in the north, to MƒÅhia, in the south, where he's a fencing contractor.</p>
        
            <p>Training for the rural sport of speed-fencing is not about gym workouts and personal trainers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>
There's no room for wonky posts or loose wires in speed-fencing where athletes are judged for speed and accuracy.

            <p>Garrick's training regime is his job keeping stock secure in the wider area north of Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>With wild weather hitting farms and destroying fencelines during Cyclone Gabrielle, Garrick's skills and machinery are in high demand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a pretty busy last two years for us with a lot of work going on, and lot of work still to do," said Garrick, who invested in a tractor with a post rammer capable of working steep terrain.</p>
        
            <p>What you need to know about speed-fencing?</p>
        
            <p>The sport of speed-fencing doesn't yet have the profile of shearing, wood chopping or sheep dog trials, but Garrick wants to put it on the map.</p>
        
            <p>The back-breaking competition sees strong, agile athletes race around the field carrying posts, heavy machinery and wires to erect a fence in less than 15 minutes.</p>

            <p>At the Rural Games in Palmerston North last March, the contest went down to the wire with Garrick winning the title by a mere 0.3 seconds from Shane Bouskill.</p>
        
            <p>At Mystery Creek, at the next big event on the calendar at Fieldays last June, Garrick excelled again in a display of skill by dethroning multiple national title holder Bouskill for the Golden Pliers trophy at Mystery Creek.</p>
        
            <p>Garrick now hopes this excellent form will extend to his next major event when he defends his Rural Games title in Palmerston North in early March.</p>
        
            <p>Competitions are also a chance for rural athletes to share new ideas and techniques.</p>
        
            <p>He said it's a thrilling sport for spectators with plenty of action on show, ramping up from the heats, to semis and finals.</p>
        
            <p>"In the qualifying heats you bore a hole with a post hole borer, install a strainer and ram up a post," Garrick said.</p>
        
            <p>"You do similar again for the semi-finals - and then for the final you install an angle stay or brace and a post and two wires. It's pretty fast."</p>
        
            <p>Accuracy is a factor with the judges making their final deliberation before any cash prizes are awarded.</p>
        
            <p>Garrick has also been named as one of three finalists in the New Zealand Rural Sportsman of the Year award.</p>
        
            <p>The other finalists are Taumuranui timbersport champion Jack Jordan and West Melton harness racer Blair Orange.</p>
        
            <p>The winner, along with the Rural Sportswoman of the Year and the Young Rural Sportsperson of the year, will be announced during the upcoming Rural Games.</p>
        
            <p>Athletes in shearing, tree climbing, rodeo and motocross are up for awards.</p>
