            <p>Eighteen-year-old Finley Melville Ives has become the youngest New Zealander to win a FIS Freeski World Cup with a dream run in the Freeski Halfpipe in Calgary.</p>
        
            <p>It marks the first World Cup podium of his career and maiden World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The Wānaka skier said it was surreal.</p>
        
            <p>"I just can't believe it, I am so stoked! I have trained so hard and I am so happy to put down my run. It has been a dream run of mine for so long, so to finally put it down in the pipe is unreal," Melville Ives said.</p>
        
            <p>Up against some of the strongest halfpipe competitors on the World Cup Tour, Melville Ives put down his winning run on his first of two runs in the finals.</p>
        
            <p>Melville Ives laced together a highly technical run, which included a left double corked 1620 mute grab into a unique left alley oop double corked flat spin 1080 mute grab to take the lead after the first run with a score of 92.75.</p>
        
            <p>Melville Ives qualified for Sunday's finals in the middle of the pack, meaning after he had completed his second run (recording a 'Did Not Improve) he had a nervous wait with nine athletes still left to drop, but his first run score proved untouchable.</p>

            <p>He was joined on the podium by two of the most successful freeskiers in the game, Nick Goepper (2nd place) and Alex Ferreira (3rd place) of the USA.</p>
        
            <p>"Both of them are my heroes growing up, I have watched them on the TV and at the Olympics, I can't believe it, this is nuts!"</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi Luke Harrold, 16, finished just off the podium with a season's best fourth place result.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's competition was the final stop of the 2025 FIS Freeski Halfpipe World Cup Tour, with Ferreira crowned the overall winner, Melville Ives finished fourth in the overall standings.</p>
        
            <p>The next major event on for the Kiwi Freeski Halfpipe Team is the World Championships, scheduled for the end of March in Switzerland.</p>
