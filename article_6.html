            <p>New Zealand motor racing ace Shane van Gisbergen's Chevrolet has been involved in a last lap crash involving multiple cars in one of the lead-up Nascar Cup Series races to Monday's Daytona 500.</p>
        
            <p>No one was reported injured in the crash which occurred in the second Daytona Duel on Friday, but van Gisbergen's dinged car was seen being towed off the Florida track after the crash and it is likely he will need a back-up car for Monday's big race.</p>
        
            <p>The two Duel races determine the starting order for the Daytona 500, one of the US's most iconic stock car races and the season opener for the Nascar Cup series.</p>
        
            <p>Van Gisbergen's car went into a spin after another car nosed into it, before hitting the wall, with five other cars also spinning out of control.</p>
        
            <p>Van Gisbergen, a rookie in the Cup series, was credited with 14th place after being prominent in around seventh place for much of the race.</p>
        
            <p>The cars were metres from the chequered flag when the crash occurred, and with a caution light flashing there was confusion as to who won the race, with Austin Cindric's Ford finally adjudged to have edged out Erik Jones' Toyota in a photo finish.</p>
        
            <p>Bubba Wallace won the first Duel in a Toyota.</p>
        
            <p>A provisional starting order for Monday indicated van Gisbergen would start in 26th place on the grid in a field of 40.</p>
