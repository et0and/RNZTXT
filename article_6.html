            <p>The Breakers' NBL winning streak has come to a grinding halt following a 108-102 loss to the Perth Wildcats in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Having climbed to fifth on the back of four successive wins, the Breakers fell away in the second half against the second-placed visitors, whose rebounding dominance and greater discipline were at the heart of their victory.</p>
        
            <p>It was a disappointing outcome for the home supporters after the Breakers opened up a 14-point lead near the end of the first quarter, with that advantage having been reduced to just five points by halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Perth dominated the third quarter to lead by 18 points at one stage and - from 87-77 up entering the final stanza - were able to hold out a late surge from the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>Accomplished Wildcats guard Bryce Cottong was hard to contain, scoring a game-high 31 points.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers' scoring was led by Anthony Lamb (27 points) and Zylan Cheatham (25) but their only other team-mate in double figures was Parker Jackson-Cartwright with 11.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Mody Moar's team must regroup for another challenging home game on Friday when they face league leaders Melbourne United.</p>
