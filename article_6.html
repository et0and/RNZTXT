            <p>Dame Noeline Taurua will be revealed as the Silver Ferns head coach for a second time on Friday, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>Netball New Zealand will make an announcement at 2pm but sources have told RNZ that Dame Noeline has been reappointed.</p>
        
            <p>In February Netball New Zealand said it would advertise the job, with Dame Noeline's contract coming to an end and the popular coach welcomed the process, saying she would reapply.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline answered an SOS to take over the Silver Ferns in 2018 and took them to a remarkable World Cup victory in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns are currently ranked second in the world but had their worst ever World Cup finish last year when they finished fourth in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>An independent panel shortlisted three candidates after a first round of interviews.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed that Tactix coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek and former Australian Diamond shooter Vicki Wilson were in contention.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson was previously an assistant coach with the Silver Ferns under Waimarama Taumaunu.</p>
        
            <p>The panel consisted of a senior leader from High Performance Sport NZ, a Netball New Zealand board representative, the head of high performance from a national sports organisation outside of netball, a former player, and Netball NZ's head of high performance Stephen Hotter.</p>
