            <p>The changing of the guard at the top of men's tennis is underway but the ASB Classic's mission remains the same.</p>
        
            <p>The ASB Classic has been a pivotal tournament for many players early in their career, for a variety of reasons, but as the top echelons of men's tennis transitioned to the next generation, of talent the Auckland tournament has kept the same ethos.</p>
        
            <p>Tournament director Nicolas Lamperin has for several years championed up-and-coming players when making decisions about who to try and attract to the ATP 250 Tour event.</p>
        
            <p>"We always are looking after new faces and new names and especially the players that we believe will have a great career ahead of them. We always remember about Rafa Nadal reaching his first final in Auckland or Federer losing first round of qualifiers so that's the kind of story that we're trying to recreate here year after year and that's the reason why we go after all the up and coming talent," Lamperin said.</p>
        
            <p>"With the retirement of Roger, Rafa and Andy there's been a real changing of the guard Sinner and Alcaraz have taken over but the names we have in Auckland including Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, Jakub Mensik, Flavio Cobolli or Alex Michelsen are part of the same group and they will be joining them in the top 10 if not the top five in the years to come.</p>
        
            <p>"We try to anticipate how players will evolve over time and we understand that potential we monitor their progress and their results throughout the year and when we feel that they're ready we extend them an invitation to come to Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>The cut off in rankings for the tournament held between 6 and 11 January was world No. 58, making it the strongest field in several years.</p>
        
            <p>American Ben Shelton, 22, lead the way as the tournament's top seed, ranked 21 in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton headed a bunch of bold young hopefuls with the eight players in the top-13 seeds, aged 23 years or younger, and having collectively this year won five ATP titles, made 15 ATP finals, 47 semis or quarterfinals and won 11 Challenger titles.</p>
        
            <p>"He's deciding not to play week one next year and he's going to come straight to Auckland he's going to train here before and just play this tournament so that shows the level of commitment that he has," Lamperin said of this year's ASB Classic semi-finalist.</p>

            <p>Mpetshi Perricard, a 21-year-old from France, who won ATP 500 and ATP 250 titles this year and stands at 2.03 metres tall would bring something different to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Lamperin compared the fifth seed to former player American John Isner and believed the smaller Auckland court would suit him.</p>
        
            <p>"From what I am hearing especially from Andy Roddick, who was probably one of the best servers in the world, [Mpetshi Perricard] is a better version. For example his average second serve is faster than Andy's average first serve which is massive...he's still got a lot of things to improve in his game but he's already so good."</p>
        
            <p>Two Argentineans ranked third and fourth with strong credentials comprise 23-year-old Sebastian Baez, who won the ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro followed by victory at the ATP 250 in Santiago, and Francisco Cerundolo, who lifted his first career trophy in Croatia.</p>
        
            <p>The No. 6 seed is 22-year-old Cobolli (Italy) ranked 32 in the world, who made the ATP 500 final in Washington, while No. 8 seed is American 20-year-old Michelsen, 41 in the world, who made two ATP finals and reached the quarters or better eight times.</p>

            <p>Another rising young player is 22-year-old Luciano Darderi (Italy), ranked 44 in the world and No. 11 seed, who won his first ATP title in Cordoba this year.</p>
        
            <p>The youngest is teenager Mensik, who is set to turn 20 years during the tournament. The Czech world 48 and No. 13 seed reached his first ATP final in Doha after winning two Challenger finals, and he pushed Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals at the Shanghai Masters.</p>
        
            <p>Mensik would play in the Next Gen ATP Finals next week in Jeddah.</p>
        
            <p>"He's the youngest player in the top 50 and he's going to do some damage in the future."</p>
        
            <p>These faces of the future will come up against some of the sport's ageless statesmen, led by 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who returns to the ASB Classic again.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils is regarded as the fastest and most flamboyant player on the Tour, having completed each of his 20 seasons ranked in the Top 100 with a career-high No. 6, and amassing 12 ATP titles.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 ASB Classic champion, Alejandro Tabilo from Chile, returns to defend his title as No. 2 seed after rising to high of No.19 in the world this year.</p>
        
            <p>Another itching to etch his name on the trophy is Cameron Norrie from Great Britain who learned the game in Auckland and ventured to Stanley Street often as a youth.</p>
        
            <p>Norrie's path at the ASB Classic in 2025 would be different to previous appearances.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming back from injury he's coming into the ASB Classic being unseeded so he won't be protected but Cam has shown in the past he has the ability to beat all these guys in the top 10 and top 20 if he's fully fit. Of course it will be more challenging but he has every chance to be able to go far."</p>
        
            <p>Eighteen players were given direct entry, with three wildcards including the New Zealand Playoff winner, four players to come from qualifying and three from special exemptions still to be added to the field before 6 January.</p>
