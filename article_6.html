            <p>Injury has forced Lulu Sun to withdraw from her debut match at the US Open in New York after just one set.</p>
        
            <p>Sun went into the match on the back of her first finals appearance, having finished runner-up at the Monterrey Open in Mexico at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Her world ranking had risen to 41 after her quarter-final appearance at Wimbledon, but she took the court with her left ankle heavily strapped and appeared to struggle with a hip injury as her match against 76th-ranked Italian Lucia Bronzetti wore on.</p>
        
            <p>The games went with serve until the seventh, when Bronzetti broke Sun's serve to go 4-3 up.</p>
        
            <p>After that game, Sun called a time out for medical treatment and there was a further delay when rain halted proceedings for a quarter of an hour.</p>
        
            <p>When play resumed, Bronzetti quickly went 5-3 up with Sun limping around the court at times.</p>
        
            <p>Bronzetti won the next game to take the set 6-3, after which Sun informed the umpire she was retiring due to injury.</p>
