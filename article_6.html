            <p>The NRL has confirmed the Warriors will play their NRL season-opening match next year in Las Vegas, lining up against the Canberra Raiders on 1 March, 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Cameron George hailed the Warriors' inclusion in a rugby league extravaganza comprising four matches as "one of the most exciting and significant ventures in the club's history".</p>
        
            <p>In an expanded programme, Penrith and Cronulla will also play an NRL match while there will also be a Super League fixture between Wigan and Warrington, and a women's international between Australia and England.</p>
        
            <p>"We're absolutely thrilled to be involved in an event that will provide our club, members and fans with an unbelievable experience," George said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was amazing seeing the impact this year's event had as the NRL took premiership games outside Australia and New Zealand for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>"Our members and fans are the best in the game. They've been packing out our home games in record numbers, they follow us around the country and support us brilliantly in our away games."</p>

            <p>Warriors back Luke Metcalf expected strong support from travelling fans, as well as a Kiwi expat community in North America.</p>
        
            <p>"We have sold out every home game this year so far so I could imagine the buzz in round one would be huge and we have the support of the whole nation.</p>
        
            <p>"I am pretty sure there is a big Polynesian community in Utah so it would be cool if they came down as well to add some extra numbers.</p>
        
            <p>"The ultimate goal is to spread the game in the US so the more local fans the better."</p>
