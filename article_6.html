            <p>New Zealand golfer Ben Campbell is well placed to defend his Hong Kong Open title after surging to the lead in faultless fashion at the midway point.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old fired a five-under-par 65 to top the leaderboard on 12-under by one stroke from first-round leader Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand.</p>
        
            <p>Nitithorn backed up his opening day 62 with a 67 and is two ahead of a trio of players in third place: Korean Yongjun Bae (62), Kevin Yuan (68) from Australia, and Japan's Kazuki Higa (68).</p>
        
            <p>Campbell's consistency continued at the US$2 million (NZ$3.44m) Asian Tour event, shooting four birdies on the back nine and one on the front while avoiding a single bogey.</p>
        
            <p>He told the Tour's website Hong Kong's Fanling course was suited to his game.</p>
        
            <p>"I just think it's a course where, you know, I'm not the longest hitter, so it's good that you just got to sort of plot your way around and just be patient I think," said the two-time Tour winner, whose second title came this season in Morocco.</p>
        
            <p>"I hit a lot of shots to sort of 10-15 feet today, and sort of just played patient. I didn't fire at a few flags when I wasn't quite in position and then rolled in a couple of 15-footers. So, yeah, I think it's just all about being patient around here and sort of not trying to overpower the golf course."</p>

            <p>Campbell has set his sights on winning the Tour's Order of Merit, which would earn the recipient an automatic place on next year's LIV Golf tour.</p>
        
            <p>He was fourth coming into this week, with just tournaments in Qatar and Saudi Arabia still to be played.</p>
        
            <p>American John Catlin, leader of the Asian Tour Order, surprisingly missed the cut in Hong Kong.</p>
