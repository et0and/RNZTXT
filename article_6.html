            <p>NSW Blues coach Michael Maguire has made five changes ahead of the state's must-win Game II.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Moses has been chosen as the Blues halfback, with Nicho Hynes being dropped after a quiet outing in Game I.</p>
        
            <p>Latrell Mitchell will make his return to the State of Origin arena, being selected at centre for the suspended Joseph Sua'ali'i.</p>
        
            <p>Game II is in Melbourne on 26 June.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Sydney's Connor Watson and Penrith's Dylan Edwards have been named in the starting 17 to make their debuts.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards was selected at fullback for Game I, but suffered an injury in training which ruled him out.</p>
        
            <p>Former captain James Tedesco played at fullback in Game I, but Maguire has again shown his belief in the Panthers' custodian to perform on the biggest stage.</p>
        
            <p>Cronulla captain Cam McInnes has been named in the squad, dropped from the 17 to make way for Watson.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland name their squad on Monday.</p>
