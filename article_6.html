            <p>All White Sarpreet Singh wants to go to an Olympics at least once in his career.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old skipped the Tokyo Olympics to focus on his club career and is keen to be considered as one of three over-23 players for this year's tournament in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Singh plays his club football in Germany for Bundesliga 2 club Hansa Rostock.</p>
        
            <p>However he's struggled for game time and admits that would play a part in his involvement with the national side.</p>

            <p>"At some stage I would love to have the opportunity but at the same time I have to consider my own future and my club environment," Singh told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"If I do have the choice I would have to speak with the coach and try and figure out the best solution that helps my career."</p>
        
            <p>Singh left the Wellington Phoenix in 2019 to join up with European glamour club Bayern Munich.</p>
        
            <p>He only made two starts for Bayern's first team before being loaned to FC Nurnberg and then Jahn Regensburg. He joined up with Hansa Rostock in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He missed much of 2022 with an injury and then an administration error which made him ineligible for selection for his club side.</p>
        
            <p>Singh has arrived in camp with the All Whites with plenty to prove during a two-match tournament in Cairo.</p>
        
            <p>He is making his way back into the national team after missing a couple of years through injury and is expecting to make an impact.</p>
        
            <p>The attacking midfielder is struggling to get game time with his German club where he wants to be playing 90 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't take it for granted that you'll play 90 minutes and especially as an attacker and with being able to make five changes (substitutes) you are more likely to get substituted.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think what's important is the amount of time you do play and what you do with that time and so it's sometimes better to play 60 minutes at one hundred percent."</p>
        
            <p>Since 2018, Singh has managed just nine caps for New Zealand and is likely to play just one of the two games in Egypt over the next week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge honour to play for New Zealand, I also believe we are building something great heading towards the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"That's our target and we have qualifiers starting this year so our goal is clear to win this tournament (against Egypt Croatia and Tunisia).</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling good, I feel great every time I play for New Zealand."</p>

            <p>Singh is enjoying working under new coach Darren Bazeley and what they're trying to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a great environment, everyone feels comfortable, everyone has a voice so I think the culture set up here is really good and it's driven by Baze (Bazeley) and the coaching staff."</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites play Egypt in Cairo on Saturday and then either Croatia or Tunisia next Wednesday.</p>
