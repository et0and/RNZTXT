            <p>Kosta Barbarouses scored his 100th A-League goal as an under-strength Wellington Phoenix scored their first win of the year, beating Macarthur FC 2-1 at Campbelltown in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the spectrum, their other goal on Monday night was Kazuki Nagasawa's first in the A-League after he capitalised on a nifty flick from Hideki Ishige.</p>
        
            <p>The much-needed win keeps the Phoenix in touch with the first six on the ladder. They are in ninth place with 17 points, just four adrift of sixth-placed Macarthur.</p>
        
            <p>Macarthur led 1-0 at halftime before Nagasawa levelled things up in the 65th minute, and Barbarouses scored the vital goal from the penalty spot six minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano said he was "very, very proud" of Barbarouses.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year I built around him. This season I tried to do the same with just a different dynamic and partnership. I think we've found it a little bit harder to create.</p>
        
            <p>"Also, teams are putting a bit more of a focus on Kosta. They're double teaming him or man-marking him… so he's finding it harder to make those chances.</p>
        
            <p>"For me the most important thing is getting the ball to him so he can capitalise, and I think we'll get there."</p>
        
            <p>Struggling to find enough fit players for the match, Italiano gave young striker Luke Supyk his first A-League start, coming in for defender Matt Sheridan who was concussed in the scoreless draw against Sydney FC last Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano was relieved to come away with the first win of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"Happy's not the word, I'm more satisfied," he said. "We've had a really rough six to seven weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"We dug in. At halftime I just reassured them there was enough opportunity to capitalise in some areas and gave the old famous 'if we get one, we can get two'.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we could have hurt them a little bit earlier, but when confidence is at a minimum we'll take that."</p>
        
            <p>Alby Kelly-Heald made some vital saves, savouring his first win as an A-League goalkeeper.</p>
