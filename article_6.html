            <p>Football Ferns midfielder Maya Hahn scored her first senior international goal and helped New Zealand win for the first time in 10 months with a 1-0 defeat of Costa Rica in San Jose.</p>
        
            <p>Hahn - in her first tour with the senior national team - came on as a substitute in the 66th minute and scored in the 89th minute to give the world number 32 New Zealand a much-needed win over the world number 43 side.</p>
        
            <p>Before the 23-year-old scored, New Zealand had not had a shot on target all game.</p>
        
            <p>Football Ferns goalkeeper Vic Esson had kept New Zealand in the game with two acrobatic saves and gave the side a bit of a scare when she needed attention for a leg injury just prior to half-time. Esson was back on the field for the second half as neither team made changes at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Had Esson needed to leave the field, it would have been a blow for the Football Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns played Costa Rica for the first time ever on Sunday in a game that ended in a 1-all draw.</p>
        
            <p>Interim coach Michael Mayne has made a point of introducing a new attacking style for the two matches against Costa Rica as they look ahead to the 2027 Football World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Hahn said the goal came as a surprise to her.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I wasn't expecting it, I was almost shocked when I saw it get in the back of the net but I was buzzing.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a good team effort in the build up to the goal and I found myself with a bit of space on the top of the box and it's a spot I like to shoot from and I was just stoked I could help the team get the win."</p>
        
            <p>The goal came off a set up from Macey Fraser who Hahn knows well but has not played with on the same team with very often.</p>
        
            <p>"It was super nice that today we got the opportunity to be on the field together for a longer amount of time and just finding our connection again and I saw her dancing with the ball in the corner and I backed her to get the ball to the top of the box to me and she found it and put it on a plate for me so that was really nice."</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns are expected to be in action again when the OFC Women's Nations Cup is held in Fiji in July.</p>
