            <p>Sarah Hirini is not offended by questions about her face.</p>
        
            <p>A month after she sustained multiple facial fractures in the rugby sevens Olympic final against Canada in Paris, the two-time gold medalist is healing well.</p>
        
            <p>She avoided surgery but will always have the photos to prove that she is not afraid to put her body on the line when it matters most.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little bit numb but its not fat and bruised any more so I am happy about that," Hirini said.</p>
        
            <p>Hirini has a had few broken noses during her 13-year representative rugby career, she also made a remarkable comeback from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee just to get on the field in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>She is no stranger to getting a few bumps during a game - "I put my head in places I probably shouldn't" - so she said it was adrenaline that got her through the final at Stade de France and despite a blood nose, it was not until the final whistle blew that she knew she was in a bit of trouble.</p>
        
            <p>"Straight after the game that's when it almost set in that this actually hurts pretty bad but then adrenaline kicks in [again] and you seem to forget about it until you start getting photos and then you get shown the photos and you're like these photos are not going to be my prettiest photos.</p>
        
            <p>"But I think most pinnacle events [finals] I've had a black eye, a broken nose, fractured face there's always something going on there so I would ideally like to get rid of that omen but I think that's just been me for my while career."</p>
        
            <p>Although Hirini looked worse for wear as she got her gold medal hung around her neck, she said her family and friends who were in the stands were relieved when they realised what her injury was.</p>
        
            <p>"I think most people were happy that it wasn't my knee.</p>
        
            <p>"When I went down I know my husband was like there is no way something's wrong with her knee then I grabbed my face and they were like 'oh yip sweet we're all good'."</p>
        
            <p>Medical advice was to go on holiday after the Olympics and not worry about her face as it would heal on its own.</p>
        
            <p>So Hirini and her husband Conor enjoyed a three week Euro summer. A holiday that Conor had booked four months before the Olympics not knowing whether his wife's ACL would be healed enough for her to play at her third Games.</p>
        
            <p>"For me it was important to have something booked and something to look forward to whether I had good or bad news from the Olympics whether we won or lost and either way if I didn't make it I was still going to go over and support for me that was really important and then obviously it worked out really well and then I could look forward to three weeks away which we don't really get to get especially in Europe.</p>
        
            <p>"Most people were still following the Olympics at the time so it was pretty crazy wherever we went.</p>
        
            <p>"We went to places we've never been to before we caught up with some friends we hadn't seen in a long time and actually got a really good break. It was nice to one not wear sports clothes and then just hang out in the Europe summer and I absolutely loved my time over there but it's also been nice being back at home too back in Papamoa and hanging out by the beach."</p>

            <p>Hirini still has a bit more travel on her mind as she has yet to get to ManawatÅ« to show her grandparents her latest Olympic medal and there are a few aunts in Wairoa who are also waiting.</p>
        
            <p>"They're patient and they know I've been busy since I got home but I'll get round to people when I can. Even six months ago I was still showing the Tokyo medal off so it takes time but we'll get there."</p>
        
            <p>Asked by one of her good friends to decide which of her Olympic gold medals she would choose if she had too, Hirini was stumped.</p>
        
            <p>"That is the hardest question I've ever been asked, they were two very different times.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Tokyo for me was almost a relief as in the monkey off your back we've finally closed the silver chapter whereas this one was holy we've done it again there is a different dynamic to doing it a second time and it makes me appreciate especially Dame Lisa [Carrington] whose won multiple multiple gold medals and you're like far out it's so hard to do but to do it with that group of girls was really special and then obviously having all our friends and family in the crowd I think that makes it a lot more special but it's definitely pinch yourself moment to know you've got three Olympic medals which I think is absolutely crazy."</p>
        
            <p>What happens next for Hirini is something she is yet to settle on.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not 100 percent sure about that which is exciting I think for me now at this point in my career having options to choose from is really special and there was probably a time six months ago that [I thought] I'd retire after this and go off and do something else and maybe look to what Portia [Woodman-Wickcliffe] is up to [playing 15s in Japan] but being injured and knowing I've still got a lot of fight left in me I want to carry on but I'm not too sure what that looks like yet.</p>
        
            <p>"I get a choice which is massive for me and we can sit down and go through everything and kinda figure out what I want to do. I'm still deciding at the moment what's going to make the happiest over the next couple of years."</p>
        
            <p>A throw away comment about the NRLW and potentially joining the Warriors when they return to the competition next year has not been met by a formal offer from any league teams for Hirini.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm loving the banter that's been getting thrown around obviously lots of my sevens team mates are in Australia at the moment all playing for different NRLW teams which is a bit of a struggle so it's kinda hard when you want to cheer for one cheer for the other who is in a different team."</p>
        
            <p>Closer to her rugby roots, Hirini would be open to returning to 15s alongside her former sevens coach Allan Bunting - but is not wanting to make the immediate switch.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely not in the short term, they've named their squad to go to Europe at the end of the year and I think it's amazing that they get to play at Twickenham I'd be surprised if it was not sold out and saying that out loud is pretty crazy.</p>
        
            <p>"But potentially next year I'd be lying to say I wasn't looking at it especially to play under him he's done so much for me and my career and helped me out a lot especially as a leader off the field and I absolutely love what he is about but right now I don't if I want to put my body through something like that going up against those England and French girls it's a tough gig so at the moment just enjoying some down time."</p>
