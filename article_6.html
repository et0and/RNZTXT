            <p>Warriors v Cowboys</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7.30pm, Saturday 8 June NZT</p>

            <p>As we approach the halfway point of the 2024 NRL season, it is still difficult to get a decent read of where everyone will end up on the ladder come finals time.</p>
        
            <p>We have seen perfect examples with the Warriors over the past few weeks upsetting both the Dolphins and the Panthers, and then also with the Cowboys picking up a gutsy victory of their own over the high-flying Roosters last Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland to Townsville is the longest trip the Warriors have to make, but they are welcoming back plenty of key players returning from injury.</p>
        
            <p>The Cowboys are in an almost identical position on the ladder, also desperate to walk away from Saturday night's match with a much-needed victory.</p>

            <p>Interesting situation for Andrew Webster, with experienced talent available again for team selection that the team has actually been doing perfectly fine without.</p>
        
            <p>Addin Fonua-Blake returns from suspension, Tohu Harris, Kurt Capewell, Wayde Egan, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Rocco Berry from injury and Taine Tuaupiki is in the extended reserves after the birth of his child.</p>
        
            <p>The good news doesn't stop there with Shaun Johnson expected to return next week and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck not long after.</p>

            <p>It is very hard to get a read on the Cowboys this week with a rather b-grade team being named after six players were in the Queensland Origin team on Wednesday night. but Tom Dearden and Jeremiah Nanai have been named on the interchange bench.</p>
        
            <p>Also lining up for the Cowboys is former Warriors Chad Townsend and star rookie centre Vilami Vailea.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 26 - 12 Cowboys</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 22 - 14 Cowboys</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have had the Cowboys' number in recent history, having edged them out twice at the start of last year's season in tight contests. The clubs both share a bit of history with former Warriors and now Cowboys head coach Todd Payten having led both of the clubs to relative success, he's done an amazing job of rebuilding the Cowboys and discovering some amazing young talent in the likes of Nanai and Taulagi.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams find themselves coming off the back of extremely gutsy victories where they have ground down top-level opponents to steal the games late in the piece.</p>
        
            <p>This game could really go either way. It wouldn't be surprising to see a tight relatively low-scoring affair and potentially even golden point over time.</p>
        
            <p>If the Warriors stick to the basics and follow their game plan of wearing the Cowboys down with strong contact up the middle and structured defence, it could provide ample opportunities to attack.</p>
