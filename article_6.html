            <p>The protester who yelled from the Melbourne Park stands following the Australian Open men's final has revealed how she made the decision to interrupt the post-match ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>In an extensive interview with independent tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg, "Nina" said she was a huge tennis fan who felt the sport had been apathetic on issues like domestic violence.</p>
        
            <p>Nina, not her real name, shouted "Australia believes Olya and Brenda! Australia believes Olya and Brenda! Australia believes Olya and Brenda!" at men's final runner-up Alexander Zverev, in reference to domestic abuse allegations against the German star.</p>
        
            <p>Olya Sharypova first made her allegations in an interview with Rothenberg in Racquet magazine in 2020. Sharypova did not pursue the claims with the police nor via court, and the ATP said there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.</p>
        
            <p>Brenda Patea made her allegations in 2023, leading to an out-of-court settlement in 2024 that did not include an admission of guilt from Zverev and concluded without any criminal record against his name.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev has denied the allegations throughout.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for, what, nine months now?" Zverev said after his match.</p>
        
            <p>"Good for her [Nina]. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. If that's the case, good for her.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again."</p>
        
            <p>Nina said she had been at the women's final the night before and had been torn about the protest.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a genuine fan ... I was at five sessions [this year] I believe, prior to the men's final," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I love this sport. I don't love its apathy to these important topics."</p>
        
            <p>The ATP does not currently have a policy specifically regarding allegations of domestic violence.</p>
        
            <p>"I decided at match point I'd come down to the Melbourne sign end, because I know where the media seats are," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to be close enough to you all to hopefully hear me.</p>
        
            <p>"And I wanted Olya's and Brenda's names to be heard in that arena."</p>
        
            <p>After the protest, Nina said she was escorted from the venue by security, before police told her she was barred from the venue for 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>"I said to the cop, 'what a shame I'll be missing tomorrow's play'," Nina recalled.</p>
        
            <p>"He didn't get it."</p>
        
            <p>Nina said she was surprised by the attention the protest received.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm thrilled that Olya and Brenda's stories are being recapped by media and highlighted by other media for the very first time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm surprised at the impact. This was never about attention for myself. I'm grateful for the friends and family showing me support; they've shared with me some positive comments online, and I'm glad to see it. I hope Olya and Brenda experience and witness the same positivity."</p>
