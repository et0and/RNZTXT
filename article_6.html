            <p>A second solid shot to the liver, and Tommy Karpency was done.</p>
        
            <p>David Nyika's rapid rise through the cruiserweight ranks continued on Saturday evening, as he finished his opponent 90 seconds into the third round.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika overwhelmed Karpency with his power, range and precision in what was a quick night at the office for "The Nice Guy".</p>
        
            <p>"It was a niggly start, I would have liked to have gotten straight into it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I hate when the crowd goes quiet. But I did what I had to do. I was patient enough. I still think I could have set my shots up a little bit better, but my first big show, first big headlining act, so it's a step in the right direction."</p>
        
            <p>After another fast finish, Nyika said he was hungry for stiffer opposition.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like tougher opposition and I think tonight you saw Tommy give up to a certain degree. I need guys that are going to push me and test me, because that's where you'll see the the best of me.</p>
        
            <p>"To his credit, he did everything he could. But I want to get taken to the trenches, because that's where I'll thrive."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika peppered Karpency's midsection, putting him on the canvas twice - the second time proving too much to get back up.</p>

            <p>"I think the body just presented itself. It was more readily available than his head. They didn't feel as clean as the bruising on his body would have suggested. But when I saw his body getting redder and redder, I just decided I'll keep targeting it."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika said it was a special experience fighting in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It felt exactly how it was supposed to. Just seeing so many familiar faces in the crowd was amazing. I'd love to do this again before the end of the year, we want to target all those guys in the top 15."</p>
        
            <p>On an entertaining undercard, we saw two quick knockouts, two draws, a retirement, and three decisions.</p>
        
            <p>Former All Black Liam Messam fought in one of two bouts which could not declare a victor.</p>
        
            <p>He said the draw with Charalampous may well have been his last bout.</p>
        
            <p>"They call it like it is and I will just take it on the chin."</p>
        
            <p>Messam said it was a bit of a strange feeling, the first draw of his boxing career, and like draws in rugby, he was not sure how to celebrate.</p>
        
            <p>"I tried to do some boxing and then I just swung and tried to hit. It is what it is."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a proud moment to take on such a well-respected boxer in Charalampous, and to have the likes of David Tua at ringside was a special moment.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the third time I've retired, but we will see what happens. Just really looking forward to a donut."</p>
        
            <p>Next up was a clash at heavyweight, as the highly touted Alex Leapai Junior from Queensland took on Auckland's Manusiu Fe'ao.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Leapai Junior needed just two rounds to get his hands raised, the 18-year old man mountain sending Fe'ao through the ropes with a vicious right hand.</p>
        
            <p>"Big ups, he's a tough dude. I just cant wait to get back to my family. First round I got a feel, second round I started to catch him. I'm still young and have time to become the ultimate fighter and a world champion."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Jackson England forced Nort Beauchamp to retire between rounds four and five after a thoroughly dominant performance.</p>
        
            <p>Another heavyweight bout followed, Uila Mau'u edging Joe Ageli by decision.</p>
        
            <p>Mau'u said Ageli frustrated him a bit, as he was not able to land too much flush, but he pushed the pace and found success with his jab.</p>
        
            <p>The evening's penultimate fight was arguably its least exciting, as Hemi Ahio avenged his earlier loss to Faiga Opelu by split decision.</p>
        
            <p>But the highlight was undoubtedly another blockbuster finish from the local hero.</p>
        
            <p>And Nyika said he was already targeting another fight in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"This is just the start of a new chapter. I feel like I've got everything to prove and my eyes are firmly set on those world titles."</p>
