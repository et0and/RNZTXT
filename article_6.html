            <p>Canoe Racing New Zealand will allow Dame Lisa Carrington to decide her own competitive programme for the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's most successful Olympian decided this week to commit to another Olympic cycle.</p>
        
            <p>High Performance manager Nathan Luce said the 35-year-old might want to limit her racing ahead of the LA Games in 2028, but that would not affect their overall programme.</p>
        
            <p>"I think those expectations (around Carrington's competitive programme) might be a bit more measured," Luce told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"She's married and she's looking at her career and her family obligations beyond sport, so if that means some time off from competitions between games, we will consider any position she presents."</p>
        
            <p>Canoe Racing NZ was ''elated'' Carrington, who won three gold medals at the Paris Olympics last year to add to her five others, had decided to continue, Luce said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there's been a lot of pressure for her to make that decision, and we have been in discussion with her for a while, knowing that she has been training and staying fit, but to get official word from her is great for the team, great for the programme.</p>
        
            <p>"She is still at the peak of her powers, so why not continue if she is willing and able?"</p>
        
            <p>Canoe Racing was in the fortunate position of having three other Olympic champions in the women's programme, after Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan won gold with Carrington in K4 500m event, while Hoskin and Carrington won in the K2 500 and Carrington again won the K1 500.</p>
        
            <p>"Knowing that we have three athletes alongside Lisa who are committed full-time, who are improving themselves and there are other athletes behind them, I think the steam train is rolling along.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to focus on those big team boats and if Lisa continues to be part of those boats that is amazing and we definitely will be happy to have her sit in any of those boats."</p>
        
            <p>Luce praised Carrington's influence on the other team members.</p>
        
            <p>"The daily standards that Lisa has provided to the programme and to the group and squad, it's elevated everyone around her."</p>
