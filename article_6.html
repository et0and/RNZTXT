            <p>All Blacks wing Caleb Clarke believes Leon MacDonald is a "great coach" and hopes they get to work together in the future.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald suddenly quit as the team's attack coach team last week with head coach Scott Robertson citing a difference in views on how to coach the team.</p>
        
            <p>Clarke, who will start this weekend against the Springboks in their Rugby Championship clash at Ellis Park, spent plenty of time under MacDonald's tutelage when the latter was head coach of the Blues from 2019 to 2023.</p>

            <p>Clarke said he feels for MacDonald.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a great friend and he's been a great coach for me. I'm gutted for him.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the same time I'm trusting in the (All Blacks) coaches and trusting in the systems and as a player that's all that I can do," Clarke said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've reached out to Rangi (MacDonald) to make sure he's ok and he is. He's a great coach so hoping the best for him.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time I'm trusting in my teammates and trusting in my coaches and looking forward to the challenge (playing the Springboks) ahead."</p>
        
            <p>Clarke said he and MacDonald have spoken since the latter's shock departure from the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"We just had a conversation. It was more around thanking for him for what he's done for me as a player, what he's done for me as a person. First time I got coached by him I was probably 19 and until this year I've been coached by him or he's been in the environment so it was just thanking him for that and saying hopefully we get to work together again in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Clarke is confident MacDonald's exit hasn't disrupted the All Blacks preparations for Sunday morning's clash with the World Champion Springboks in Johannesburg and he's adamant revenge hasn't played a part in their buildup as they seek to wrest back the initiative in the Rugby Championship.</p>

            <p>The defending champion All Blacks (5 points) are second in the standings behind the Springboks (10 points) and the New Zealanders must win at least one of their two back to back tests in South Africa (the second test is in Cape Town next week) to stay in title contention.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks suffered a one point defeat to the Springboks in last year's World Cup final, but Clarke says that heartbreak hasn't been a focal point this week.</p>
        
            <p>"Naturally we've had that at the back of our mind, but there hasn't been a theme around revenge or avenging the (World Cup) final. What we've been talking about is nailing our role and about how big of an opportunity this is to play here and try and get the win," Clarke said.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole idea around revenge from the World Cup isn't the biggest priority for this team. It's just about putting out a performance we're proud of and we've put in a good week, so we're all looking forward to it."</p>
