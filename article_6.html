            <p>A stellar lineup at the Cooks Classic athletics meet in Whanganui has been made all the more shiny by the presence of some Olympians.</p>
        
            <p>Among them were middle-distance runner Sam Tanner and long jumper-turned-sprinter para-athlete Anna Grimaldi.</p>
        
            <p>But there was no mistaking the star attraction - gold medal winner in Paris, high jumper Hamish Kerr, was the name on everyone's lips.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of fans crammed along the curve to Kerr jump in the flesh. Young fan Lucas Hasslebank was in awe just being in his presence.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty cool, you know? It's the first time I've been so close to him. I've watched him on TV, and now he's about 10 metres away from me."</p>
        
            <p>Another young fan, Jude Elms, had Kerr sign something a little less conventional - his Crocs.</p>
        
            <p>"They're the only thing I had on me," he said with a laugh.</p>

            <p>Cody MacPhail had travelled from Hawera, and had watched Kerr do a couple of warm-up jumps before he spoke to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"He looks really, really good, actually. That 2.05 he just did was unbelievable, he just sat over the bar there, it was crazy."</p>

            <p>Australian competitor Toby Stolberg, who came second in the women's event, was another who had an eye on Kerr.</p>
        
            <p>"I just think he has incredible spring off the ground, and I think he has a really good attitude towards high jump as well, he always looks so happy about it."</p>
        
            <p>"Just an incredible technique and athleticism, really."</p>

            <p>Kerr's performance didn't disappoint. Entering the competition at 2.06m, he took it out with a successful jump at 2.19 before bowing out at 2.24 - 10 centimetres shy of his gold medal leap.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington teenager Hugo Jones competed against him.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very inspirational, that's for sure. It's awesome to have him to look up to, because that's where hopefully a lot of us boys want to get to, in that end goal of being an Olympic champion."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the Olympic champion got right behind his fellow competitors.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a real friendly guy, makes sure everyone has a good time."</p>

Peter Snell put Cooks Gardens on the map in 1962 when he broke the world record for the mile on the track. More than 2000 fans turned up at the weekend to watch 300 athletes from seven coutries compete at the Cooks Classic.

            <p>Kerr, meanwhile, was stoked with his reception.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awesome, I love it," he said. "Obviously I've got a big summer coming up, but it's good to be back. Whanganui is a place that's pretty special to me, I've jumped here a lot."</p>

            <p>He said he had only just got back into jumping in the past few weeks, so to be getting anything at this time of the year was a good result.</p>
        
            <p>The Summer Circuit heads to Wellington on Wednesday for the Team Ledger Harcourts Capital Classic.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr will next line up against Australian record holder Brandon Starc at the International Track Meet in Christchurch, on 22 February at Nga Puna Wai.</p>
