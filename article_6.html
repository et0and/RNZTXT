            <p>New Zealand's most decorated Olympian Dame Lisa Carrington is planning to race at the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington was dominant at last year's Paris Olympics in canoe sprint, claiming three gold medals in the K4, K2 and K1.</p>
        
            <p>She has an all-time Olympic medal haul of eight gold medals and a bronze medal.</p>
        
            <p>Los Angeles would be Carrington's fifth Olympics after her first Games in London in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>In an Instagram post on Wednesday she signalled she was committed to another Olympic cycle.</p>
        
            <p>"And we're back. Let's go," Carrington said with the hashtag #LA28.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington said she was excited by the prospect of her fifth Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"In both sport and life, there are no guarantees, so I think the only real option is to make the most of the moment and whatever path you're on.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no doubt I'm passionate about growth, and I can't wait to see how the team and I progress from here. We all have big dreams, and I want to help my teammates achieve them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Canoe Racing New Zealand's high performance manager Nathan Luce was pleased Carrington committed to another Olympic cycle.</p>
        
            <p>Luce said there had never been a time where Carrington indicated she'd had enough.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think Lisa has ever displayed a lack of commitment or enthusiasm for just the simple things that it takes to be a world champion on a daily basis, so maybe that was a good sign that she enjoyed the challenge every step of the way," Luce said.</p>

            <p>Carrington had been awarded one of the Olympic movement's highest honours late last year, receiving the Association of National Olympic Committee (ANOC) Outstanding Sporting Career Award.</p>
        
            <p>"From winning my first gold in London back in 2012, through to the success this year in Paris, it's been an opportunity for me to reflect on the journey to get to this point. I'm so lucky to do what I do - sport is such a privilege," Carrington said at the awards presentation.</p>
        
            <p>After Paris, there had been questions about whether Carrington would want to continue towards the 2028 Games, which had been answered.</p>
