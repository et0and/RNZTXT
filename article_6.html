            <p>The South African cricketers have qualified for their second successive women's T20 World Cup final after upsetting Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The Proteas beat Australia for the first time at a World Cup with an eight wicket win in their semi-final in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>The defending champion Australians were hot favourites for their seventh title after riding a winning streak of 17 games.</p>
        
            <p>After being put into bat Australia scored 134 for five with Beth Mooney top scoring with 44.</p>
        
            <p>In reply South Africa strolled to their target in 17.2 overs with Anneke Bosch unbeaten on 74 and Laura Wolvaardt making 42.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Wolvaardt was stunned after their win.</p>
        
            <p>"This is one of the best wins of my career, I'm glad some of the plans worked today, our bowlers did excellently to restrict them," Wolvaardt told World Cricket afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>Australia captain Tahlia McGrath admits her side didn't turn up today and didn't score as many as they should have.</p>
        
            <p>"South Africa bowled really well, they bowled stump line and took the pace off nicely.</p>
        
            <p>"(In reply) South Africa made it look like a totally different wicket, they batted really well."</p>
        
            <p>Bosch was named player of the match with her knock of 74 included 8 fours and 1 six.</p>
