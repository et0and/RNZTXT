            <p>The All Blacks have made two injury-enforced changes to the team to play Ireland in Dublin on Saturday morning, with first-five Beauden Barrett and hooker Codie Taylor replaced in the starting lineup by Damian McKenzie and Asafo Aumua respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett and Taylor were both ruled out of the test after suffering head injuries in last week's win over England at Twickenham.</p>

            <p>George Bell and Stephen Perofeta come into the reserves as hooker and backs cover.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Barrett captains the side at lock alongside Tupou Vaa'i, with Tyrel Lomax and Tamaiti Williams the props.</p>
        
            <p>Ardie Savea, Sam Cane and Wallace Sititi once again make up the loose forwards and the All Blacks coaches will be hoping Sititi can continue his impressive international form.</p>
        
            <p>Cortez Ratima starts at halfback with Cam Roigard again on the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Jordie Barrett and Rieko Ioane are outside McKenzie in the midfield with Will Jordan, Caleb Clarke and Mark Telea, who scored two tries against England, in the back three.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks and Ireland's last match was the 2023 World Cup quarter final, which the All Blacks won to end Ireland's hopes of a maiden title.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson said that match will be fresh in the minds of many fans heading along to the game.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a highly anticipated match that promises to bring all the intensity and passion that we have come to expect from these two rugby-mad nations, both on and off the field.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really pleased with how the squad has come through this week and our focus has turned quickly to this encounter post-England. We have trained well, and the players are fresh and ready to face a fierce challenge from the Ireland team."</p>
