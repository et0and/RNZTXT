            <p>The Warriors have named their side of the round one opener in Las Vegas against the Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad has maintained his hold on the number one jersey, with Roger Tuivasa-Sheck shifting from the centres to the wing.</p>
        
            <p>Chanel Harris-Tavita and Luke Metcalf will combine for the first halves pairing of the season, with Te Maire Martin named on an extended bench.</p>
        
            <p>Taine Tuaupiki has been named on the wing in the wake of Dallin Watene-Zelezniak's wrist injury.</p>
        
            <p>Up front, co-skipper Mitch Barnett and James Fisher-Harris will prop the scrum, while Wayde Eagan takes the hooker role.</p>
        
            <p>Erin Clark has been named to make his Warriors debut return at lock.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster said his side has done well not to be distracted by the glitz of Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to complete, if you do that you go a long way to winning the game. People tell me Vegas is a bit of a finals atmosphere, so I expect it to be really physical."</p>
