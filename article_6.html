            <p>It was a ruthless response.</p>
        
            <p>The Eden Park graveyard has buried a 50th victim beneath its hallowed turf.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina are the latest to fall at the fortress, the All Blacks bouncing back in emphatic fashion to pulverise the Pumas, 42-10.</p>
        
            <p>For 50 tests the challenge has been laid, and for 50 tests, the All Blacks have repelled each and every one, as the greatest streak in international rugby reaches a half-century.</p>
        
            <p>Following the All Blacks' shock loss in the capital last week, plenty of questions were being asked of Scott Robertson's team, but Razor's men looked seriously sharp in the sodden conditions, running riot with six tries to one.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a second half scoring lull, the All Blacks had already put the result to bed by the break.</p>
        
            <p>The win takes Robertson's winning percentage to 80 from his first five tests, and sees New Zealand leapfrog Argentina on the Rugby Championship table.</p>
        
            <p>Halfback TJ Perenara responded to his critics with a polished performance, while Damian McKenzie also silenced doubters with a mercurial and measured display at 10.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks were presented with the first shot at points with a five metre lineout on the back of a surging Savea storm, but managed to butcher the throw.</p>
        
            <p>It would not cost them much though, as shortly after another raid into the 22, Jordie Barrett chipped one over the top into an acre of space with McKenzie winning the race and managing to grass it within inches of the dead ball.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie followed his try by sending one out on the full, Argentina then winning a penalty in front of the sticks which Carreras duly sent over.</p>
        
            <p>The Pumas were then pinged for taking too long to clear the kick off reception, New Zealand taking full advantage of the gifted territory, Savea rumbling his way over the line from a rolling lineout maul.</p>
        
            <p>A comedy of errors led to a third for the hosts, as the ball was consecutively ricocheted with Argentina trying to clear, the chaos leaving an unmarked Caleb Clarke out wide to coast in.</p>
        
            <p>Some Perenara magic created the fourth, the veteran halfback darting blind and in two tackles, managed to get his arms free and find the blistering speed of Will Jordan on the outside.</p>
        
            <p>The carnage continued, Beauden Barrett slicing through a gaping hole from a deft McKenzie offload, with the hosts hitting 30.</p>

            <p>The Pumas had one final opportunity to cross the All Black line before halftime, only for a knock on to leave them staring down a 35-3 deficit at the break.</p>
        
            <p>It took less than two minutes for the All Blacks to pick up where they left off in the first.</p>
        
            <p>After another barnstorming bust from Savea, the All Blacks put it through the hands as Jordan brushed aside some feeble defence for his double.</p>
        
            <p>The scoring slowed somewhat as the All Blacks cleared the bench, Sam Cane making his way on for his 96th test, and first since being sent off in the World Cup final.</p>
        
            <p>After a brief respite, heavy rain poured down for the final quarter, as things meandered toward the 80th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina enjoyed late consolation through Juan Cruz Mallia, giving their loyal fans something to cheer about.</p>
        
            <p>A lengthy delay then ensued as Asafo Aumua put a thundering hit on Matthew Carreras, resulting in a yellow for the reserve hooker for head on head contact.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks will now prepare for their two test tour to South Africa, who meet the Wallabies in Perth later on Saturday evening.</p>
