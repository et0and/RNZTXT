            <p>Wellington Phoenix's surge up the A-League women's standings continues with a 2-0 home win over Sydney FC - aided by a timely thunderstorm.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Paul Temple's team took control in the second half through goals to Grace Jale and Zoe McMeeken to maintain a four-match unbeaten streak.</p>
        
            <p>They climb from ninth to fourth in the standings although there are other round seven games still to be played, while two-time defending champions Sydney remain rooted to the bottom of the 12-team table.</p>
        
            <p>It was McMeeken's first win of her A-League career and Jale's first of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The result represents a superb turnaround after losing their first three games of the campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"I think these results are what we need to take that next step as a team," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know they're struggling for form, but they're Sydney FC and they've got serial winners in that team and good players in that team.</p>
        
            <p>"They're still very tough to beat and it's a big step for us as a team to do that today."</p>
        
            <p>The match was delayed for 45 minutes due to a thunderstorm and nearby lightning strikes, with the heavens opening on the stroke of halftime.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really good for us because we were not at the races in the first half," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"I really wasn't happy with how we were playing. I thought it was quite a way off how we want to be.</p>
        
            <p>"We weren't on the front foot and didn't show the intensity that I wanted so we had a good break, we reset ourselves. We watched a lot of the game back, looked at the things we needed to improve on and the second half was brilliant and much more like what we wanted to be."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's next match is a testing affair away to leaders Melbourne City on Saturday.</p>
