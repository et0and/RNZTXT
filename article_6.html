            <p>New Zealand golfer Ryan Fox stuttered late in his opening round at the US Masters to sit four shots behind early leader Bryson DeChambeau at Augusta.</p>
        
            <p>Fox made a sizzling start to the year's first major on Friday morning (NZT), powering to a two-stroke lead after his first nine holes in Augusta after rain had delayed the start to play by two hours.</p>
        
            <p>However, two dropped shots on his back nine saw the 37-year-old close on three-under 69, leaving him in a share of third in the clubhouse with much of the field still to complete their rounds.</p>
        
            <p>Fox's exceptional start featured birdies on each of the first three holes, followed by a brilliant eagle on the par-five eighth hole to go to five-under.</p>
        
            <p>However, he didn't pick up another shot for the reminder of his round, shooting bogeys on the par-five 13th hole and the par-three 16th.</p>
        
            <p>Upon completion, Fox was four behind the American big-hitter and one behind Englishman Danny Willett, who had both completed their opening rounds.</p>
        
            <p>He was level with seven others, including world No 1 and tournament favourite Scottie Scheffler of the United States.</p>
        
            <p>LIV Tour player DeChambeau was the standout performer, carding eight birdies, including five in the space of six holes on his back nine.</p>
        
            <p>The first round nevertheless represents a remarkable reversal of form for Fox, whose world ranking has dropped to 54th in recent weeks following a string of modest returns on the US PGA Tour.</p>
