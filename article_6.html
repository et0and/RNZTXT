            <p>Former Black Cap Martin Guptill has helped guide Islamabad United to the Pakistan Super League (PSL) title, becoming the first team to claim three PSL championships.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 160, Guptill made 50 off only 32 balls, plundered eight boundaries and three sixes, to put Islamabad in control - but was run out, giving opponents Multan hope,</p>
        
            <p>Islamabad needed eight from the final over, and Naseem Shah hit a four to leave three required off four balls.</p>
        
            <p>Naseem was out off the penultimate ball with the scores level, leaving his brother Hunain to hit the winning run.</p>
        
            <p>Multan scored 159-9, with Usman Khan making 57 and Islamabad spinner Imad Wasim taking 5-23.</p>
        
            <p>Islamabad's third title puts them one ahead of the Lahore Qalandars, while Multan have now lost three successive finals since their only triumph in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Former England World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley was a part of Multan's coaching team, alongside ex-Ireland international Cath Dalton, the first woman to be a fast bowling coach in a professional men's team.</p>
