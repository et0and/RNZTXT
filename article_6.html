            <p>New Zealand swimming is on the rise and Dunedin is leading the way.</p>
        
            <p>A nine strong New Zealand swim team has been named for the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>World champions Erika Fairweather and Lewis Clareburt head the squad, which is one of the largest to be selected for a pinnacle event.</p>
        
            <p>A third of the team come from one club in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's team announcement was held at Moana Pool in Dunedin, the home of two-time Olympic swimming champion Danyon Loader.</p>
        
            <p>Fairweather, Caitlin Deans and Kane Follows are a part of the Neptune club and all train there under the guidance of coach Lars Hummer.</p>
        
            <p>Fairweather, 20, has no doubts there is something special about Dunedin and Moana pool.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the breeding grounds of Olympians," Fairweather told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We have Danyon Loader who is one of our greatest Olympians, so yeah, just continuing that legacy I think."</p>

            <p>Fairweather and 24-year-old Deans have been training buddies since they were kids.</p>
        
            <p>Deans was delighted to be going to her first Olympics alongside her Dunedin mate.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been training partner since before I can remember, we both learnt to swim here, so having the announcement today at Moana pool was really special for us.</p>
        
            <p>"Having the three of us that train together, day in and day out, getting selected in the team together is just so special."</p>
        
            <p>The third member of the Dunedin trio was Kane Follows.</p>
        
            <p>Follows qualified for the Olympics just a few weeks ago at the National Championships and the Paris Olympics will be the first time he has represented New Zealand at senior level.</p>
        
            <p>He was born and raised in Auckland and studied and swam for the University of Hawaii. Moving to Dunedin 18 months ago was a bit of a shock.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely more of a tropical kind of guy, I love swimming outdoors and love the sun so coming down here (Dunedin), I actually saw snow for the first time last year, was a shock to the system.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still getting use to it, but during the race (200m backstroke at the nationals) I was thinking can I hack another winter down in Dunedin or a summer in Paris seemed a bit better so that helped me get over the line."</p>
        
            <p>Swimming New Zealand Olympic programme lead Gary Francis praised Dunedin coach Lars Hummer for what he has achieved with both young swimmers and internationals.</p>
        
            <p>"This programme now is a world class programme," Francis told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"There aren't many clubs or swim programmes around the world, even those directly funded by the national governing body or a government that puts three athletes on the same Olympic team, it's a magnificent achievement."</p>
        
            <p>Fairweather admitted she has a special bond with coach Hummer.</p>
        
            <p>"Lars is great, I've had him most of my senior career, we grown and developed that coach-athlete relationship and basically we can read each others minds."</p>
