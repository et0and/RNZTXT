            <p>Daily smoking rates have flat-lined after dramatic falls in previous years, while vaping among younger people continues to rise.</p>
        
            <p>According to the annual New Zealand Health Survey:</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello - who has been criticised by public health experts for rolling back smokefree laws and giving health officials a document that claimed "nicotine is as harmful as caffeine" - said the government was committed to the Smokefree 2025 goal.</p>
        
            <p>A "final push" to get people to quit smoking would build on what had worked to date and target the groups who most need support, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the survey data shows a continuation of the great progress that's been made in the last few years - especially with falling numbers of MƒÅori smokers and very low rates of youth smoking," Costello said.</p>
        
            <p>"Early next year I will also take proposals to cabinet for an improved regulatory regime around all nicotine and tobacco products with a view to having a system that is aimed at reducing harm, that is coherent across products, and enforceable."</p>
        
            <p>That included beefing up monitoring, compliance and enforcement and "addressing black market tobacco".</p>
        
            <p>The minister also announced that Cabinet on Monday approved the annual tobacco excise increase. It will increase by 2.23 percent from 1 January 2025.</p>
