            <p>The Warriors have finally beaten their bunny side for the first time in six seasons, routing the Rabbitohs 34-4 in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Johnson bagged a brace in another masterful performance, as the Warrior celebrated Roger Tuivasa-Sheck's 200th NRL appearance in almost flawless style.</p>
        
            <p>It's the third win on the trot for the Warriors, as they move inside the top eight for the first time in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson told Fox Sports consistency will be the key to success this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We spoke about being disciplined and we did that, we put the ball in the right spots and our defence backed it up."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson acknowledged the depth building within the squad.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been tested to start the season but whoever comes in we expect them to do the job, we have a lot to play for today, so to put that performance in is really special."</p>
        
            <p>Dallin Watene-Zelezniak was a late withdrawal, Adam Pompey coming in to the centres pushing Tuivasa-Sheck to the wing.</p>
        
            <p>The Rabbitohs struck first as Cody Walker shifted it to left, as Tuivasa Sheck left space out wide for Izaac Tu'itupou Thompson to exploit before he stood up Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad to score.</p>
        
            <p>An error from the first set from restart handed the Warriors the chance to reply immediately which they gladly took, as Rocco Berry thundered onto a flat Johnson ball to take a 6-4 lead.</p>
        
            <p>Latrell Mitchell snuffed a Warriors attack as he scooped up a Johnson grubber, but the souths fullback then inexplicably threw up an elbow as Johnson made the tackle, conceding a penalty deep in his own territory.</p>
        
            <p>A Warriors onslaught ensued, with the visitors given back to back sets, but Souths survived when Jazz Tevaga dropped a pass with the line wide open, the first error for the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>Another Mitchell brain explosion saw him placed on report for a second time, the fullback up-ending Harris.</p>
        
            <p>Another South's error lead to a second try for the Warriors, Johnson again serving it up on a platter for Jackson Ford to power over the line.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors were in again before half-time, Wayde Egan sending Nicoll-Klokstad through a gaping hole, the returning fullback finding Johnson roaming on the inside as he cruised over for a 16-4 half-time lead.</p>
        
            <p>Another enterprising Egan run from dummy half saw the Warriors extend their lead shortly after the break, Te Maire Martin surging clear with Johnson again in support to get his second.</p>
        
            <p>Jacob Laban made his way onto the park for his NRL debut for the Warriors as Tuivasa-Sheck marked his double century of caps with an acrobatic try in the corner, just managing to ground the steeden before being pushed into touch.</p>
        
            <p>Martin iced the cake with some dazzling footwork, dancing his way through the Rabbitohs defence to score under the sticks.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors return home next Saturday to host the Manly Sea Eagles.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 34 (Johnson 2, Berry, Ford, Tuivasa-Sheck, Martin, tries, Johnson 5 goals)</p>
        
            <p>Rabbitohs 4 (Thompson, tries, goals)</p>
