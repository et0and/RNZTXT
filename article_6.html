            <p>Mitchell Barnett and James Fisher-Harris have been named as co-captains for the Warriors' 2025 NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement was made at the club's season launch on Tuesday and is only the second-time in the club's history the Warriors will have co-captains.</p>
        
            <p>Barnett, 30, and Fisher-Harris, 29, replace incumbent captain Tohu Harris who announced his immediate retirement in January after leading the Warriors 52 times.</p>
        
            <p>The last time the Warriors had co-captains was in 2001, when Stacey Jones and Kevin Campion shared the responsibility, leading the club to the finals for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Both Barnett and Fisher-Harris bring significant leadership experience to the table, with Warriors chief executive Cameron George saying they were "terrific examples of what leadership is about".</p>
        
            <p>"Rather than having one captain, we felt Mitch and James have so much to offer as co-captains. It was a no brainer given their qualities."</p>

            <p>Barnett captained the side for the last nine games of the 2024 campaign following Harris' early exit, starting with the exceptional against-the-odds victory over the Dolphins.</p>
        
            <p>He also assumed the captaincy in Magic Round match against the Panthers after original skipper for the game Wayde Egan was forced off the field just 12 minutes into the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Barnett describes the co-captaincy as a "great opportunity" - "for me, for my family and also for Fish".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be anything different than I've already been. I just want to be the player everyone wants to play with."</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Harris brings credentials as Kiwi captain in 2023-2024, including leading his country to a record 30-0 win over the Kangaroos to secure the Pacific Championships title in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>For the last five seasons he has led the way for the Panthers' pack in five consecutive grand finals including four straight premiership victories.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a hectic last month or so for me getting used to the new surroundings here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Harris said he wants to "give back" to the game.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why I came back and being co-captain is really special."</p>
