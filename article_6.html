            <p>The Kiwi Ferns will bring in two new players as the side chases their first win of the Pacific Championships.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are away to the Papua New Guinea Orchids on Sunday in Port Moresby with a place in the Pacific Championships final on the line.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi Ferns lost their first game against Australia's Jillaroos last weekend when for the first time in 61 test matches the Kiwi Ferns were kept scoreless.</p>
        
            <p>Mackenzie Wiki will don the black-and-white jersey for the first time and will continue her family's legacy on the field.</p>
        
            <p>Wiki has already played international rugby league for the Cook Islands at the World Cup but her powerful runs could help New Zealand get on the board in the Pacific Championships when she starts in the number 2 jersey.</p>
        
            <p>Wiki made her NRLW debut in the Canberra Raiders jersey her dad, Ruben, first found fame in - and eventually followed in his footsteps by earning an international call-up for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old's progress continued in 2024 with four tries in seven matches, as well as racking up three try assists, six line-breaks and 31 tackle-breaks, with an average of 134 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Joining Wiki in the New Zealand side that will run out on Santos National Football Stadium in the high-stakes matchup is Brooke Talataina.</p>
        
            <p>Talataina, an Auckland-born utility, is a Wests Tigers regular in the NRLW , firstly at halfback then in the second-row.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old scored a try and averaged almost 30 tackles and 85 metres a game in 2024 before being named in New Zealand's Pacific Championships squad.</p>
