            <p>New Zealand Melbourne Cup winning horse trainer Michael Moroney has died after a short battle with cancer. He was 66.</p>
        
            <p>Moroney trained 2000 Melbourne Cup winner Brew.</p>
        
            <p>He moved from Matamata to Adelaide in the 1990s before going to establish stables in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>His Ballymore Stables confirmed the news of his death on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"Michael not only had a special knack with horses, but with people," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was loved and respected by his staff, his owners, his beloved partner Karen and his family. He will be remembered for his kindness, his willingness to share his time, expertise and his passion for the sport of horse racing.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a much loved member of the racing community and an outstanding conditioner of horses with a host of Group 1 wins, premierships and well-deserved awards."</p>
        
            <p>He and training partner Glen Thompson, accumulated more than 2000 winners at the track, including 45 victories at Group 1 level.</p>

            <p>While Brew's 2000 Melbourne Cup win was the stand out performance he also had two other runners, Emissary and Xcellent, place in the great race.</p>
        
            <p>The Age quoted Moroney as saying his life was never the same after winning the Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"When you go overseas, or no matter where you go, you're known as winning a Melbourne Cup," Moroney said during a 2023 interview. "That's the sort of race it is.</p>
        
            <p>"Our grandparents bred one [Hi Jinx won in 1960], and so from the time we were old enough to talk and walk, we were brought up on the Melbourne Cup."</p>
        
            <p>He said he an premonition a few years before taking out the 2000 Melbourne Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd dreamed that I trained the Melbourne Cup winner - and I dreamed it was Brew," Moroney said.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember telling my wife that I'd dreamed that I won by two lengths with Brew who was No.24. My wife said, 'Who is Brew?' My dream didn't make sense then though because at the time Brew was a three-year-old in work with Paul O'Sullivan, a trainer in Sydney."</p>
        
            <p>Moroney had been attending race meetings up until five days ago.</p>
