            <p>The Black Ferns produced a fine attacking display in their Pacific Four Series opener in a 57-5 demolition of the United States women.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand scored nine tries to one in a commanding performance as the Eagles were no match for the clinical World Champions in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>At halftime the New Zealand team were in control with a resounding 36-nil lead after running in six tries in the first 40 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns fullback Mererangi Paul scored a hatrick in a rollicking start in the opening 15 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>See how the match unfolded: </p>
        
            <p>New Zealand co-captain Ruahei Demant told SkySport she was satisfied with the big win.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got really fast outsides and we got a lot of purchase there," Demant said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the USA were a little bit concerned about our players on the edge, then it started to open up in through the middle.</p>
        
            <p>"You saw that with the likes of ball carries from Kaipo Olsen-Baker and Sylvia Brunt making big gain line carries through the middle."</p>
        
            <p>United States captain Rachel Johnson said the second half effort showed they have more potential than was displayed on the scoreboard.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we showed that our set piece can be a huge advantage on attack and defence," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We can be lethal if we can put those phases together."</p>
        
            <p>The United States stamped their mark in the second half as their improved defence slowed the rampant attacking of the Black Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>After 64 minutes Freda Tafuna barged over for the Eagles as a reward for their consistent pressure.</p>
        
            <p>But the floodgates opened again with the Black Ferns adding to their second half opener to Ruby Tui with tries to Layla Sae and Patricia Maliepo</p>
        
            <p>Exciting Black Ferns debutants halfback Maia Joseph and lock Maama Mo'onia Vaipulu impressed in their first taste of international rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Reserve Black Ferns first-five Hannah King ran on in the second half for a strong showing on debut off the bench.</p>
        
            <p>King converted three tries for her first points in international rugby.</p>
        
            <p>USA will look to bounce back after they also suffered a heavy 50-7 defeat to Canada in their series opener last month.</p>
        
            <p>And the Pacific Four Series moves to Australia tonight with the Wallaroos hosting Canada in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>All eyes will be on new Wallaroos coach Jo Yapp with the former England test halfback taking the helm for the Australian women.</p>
