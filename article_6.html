            <p>Joe Schmidt has been confirmed as the next head coach of the Wallabies.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt will coach the Wallabies until at least the conclusion of the British and Irish Lions Tour in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The 2018 World Rugby Coach of the Year spent more than six years as Ireland's head coach, winning three Six Nations titles (including the 2018 Grand Slam), beating the All Blacks for the first time, winning in South Africa for the first time, and leading Ireland to the World Number One ranking for the first time in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to his elevation as Ireland's national coach, Schmidt spent three seasons as head coach of Irish club Leinster, where he won two Heineken Cups (European Champions), as well as both the Challenge Cup and Pro 14 in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Most recently, Schmidt was an assistant coach for the All Blacks, where he helped guide New Zealand to the 2023 Rugby World Cup Final against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The former Manawatu provincial representative player in New Zealand has had two stints as an assistant coach for the Blues Super Rugby team, was an assistant coach of ASM Clermont Auvergne when it won the French Championship for the first time in 2010, and held the position of director of rugby and high-performance at World Rugby in 2020-21.</p>
        
            <p>The new Wallabies coach will report to Rugby Australia's new director of high-performance, Peter Horne, in a new structure designed to deliver stronger alignment of high-performance Rugby programs in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Joe Schmidt says he is eager to get started.</p>
        
            <p>"I am conscious that the Wallabies have weathered a difficult period, and I am keen to help them build a way forward, with greater alignment and clear direction. The upcoming Test matches against Wales will arrive quickly, post-Super Rugby, and the program through to the British and Irish Lions Tour next year presents plenty of opportunities and challenges - which I am sure will invigorate players and staff.</p>
        
            <p>"I am looking forward to connecting with Super Rugby coaches, RA staff, and getting to observe and meet players in the coming months."</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt is scheduled to start with the Wallabies on March 1st.</p>
