            <p>The Tall Blacks' Olympics dream is over after being eliminated by Slovenia at a qualifying tournament in Greece.</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks needed to lose by no more than 11 to head them off on points differential.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were beaten 104-78, leaving all three teams in their group on three points, Croatia and Slovenia through to the semi-finals with a superior points differential.</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks' equation was to lose by no more than 11 to head off Slovenia, but a commanding performance from NBA star Luka Doncic - who hit a triple-double - saw them fail by a big margin.</p>
        
            <p>Slovenia started far stronger with a 12-2 run, but the Tall Blacks rebounded in the second quarter, scoring 30 points. They kept going early in the second half, closing the gap to 49-43.</p>
        
            <p>But Doncic combined with Gregor Hrovat on a 13-0 run, spurring Slovenia to a 62-43 lead midway through the third quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Doncic nailed a three-pointer to push the lead to 77-57 at the end of the third quarter, and the New Zealanders couldn't bridge the gap in the final period.</p>
        
            <p>Slovenia missed out on winning by 29 which would have given them first place in the group. Croatia have that billing, as they head into the semi-finals as first seed.</p>
        
            <p>Doncic scored 36 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.</p>
        
            <p>Shea Ili had 28 points and 10 rebounds in a losing effort, while Izayah Le'afa had 12 as the Tall Blacks tried hard but battled fatigue as Doncic dominated.</p>
