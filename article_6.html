            <p>Tiger Woods believes he can still win on the PGA Tour but will only play one event per month in 2024 as he continues his recovery from ankle surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The 15-time major champion has had a limited schedule since suffering a leg injury in a car crash in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He carded a final-round 61 alongside his 14-year-old son Charlie at the PNC Championship in Orlando on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'm able to practise and do the things I know I can do, and prepare, I know I can still do it," Woods said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can still hit the golf ball. It's just a matter of prepping and get enough reps in and get enough work in and being right physically, and the endurance capability of it.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't had the leg good enough where I've been able to compete and play a lot of rounds.</p>
        
            <p>"I can still hit the golf ball. I can still chip. I can still putt.</p>
        
            <p>"Granted it's also putting it all together for 72 holes. That's the challenging part of it."</p>
        
            <p>Woods' last win on the PGA Tour was at the 2019 Zozo Championship in Japan, which saw him equal Sam Snead's record of 82 Tour victories.</p>
        
            <p>He made his latest injury comeback at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas earlier this month, having withdrawn during the Masters in April before having ankle fusion surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The American says his ankle continues to hold up well, though he was able to use a golf cart at the PNC Championship, something he is not allowed to do on the PGA Tour.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of things are aching a lot more than my ankle, which is the way it goes," said Woods, who turns 48 on 30 December.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been working out hard, been able to recover. We've been training every day, which is great.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been nice to knock off a lot of the rust and some of the doubt that I've had because, quite frankly, I haven't hit a shot that counted in a long time."</p>
        
            <p>As well as playing alongside son Charlie, Woods' 16-year-old daughter Sam was caddying at the Ritz Carlton Golf Club as Team Woods finished tied for fifth at the 36-hole event formerly known as the Father/Son Challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"To have both my kids out there the last two days has been so special," added Woods.</p>
        
            <p>"Just grateful for us to be able to have these types of experiences."</p>
        
            <p>The tournament was won by Germany's two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer, 66, and his son Jason.</p>
