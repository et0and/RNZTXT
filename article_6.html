            <p>The Black Caps powered into the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy, taking India along with them after Rachin Ravindra's century and inspired bowling from Michael Bracewell ensured a five-wicket win over Group A opponents Bangladesh in Rawalpindi.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 237 for victory thanks to Bracewell's four-wicket haul, New Zealand lost Will Young for a duck in the opening over and Kane Williamson for five shortly after but Ravindra's classy 112 and Tom Latham's 55 secured the victory in 46.1 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh earlier squandered a good start and made 236-9 in 50 overs thanks to Najmul Hossain Shanto's 77 and Jaker Ali's 45 but paid a heavy price for 178 dot balls in their innings.</p>
        
            <p>The result meant that defending champions Pakistan joined Bangladesh in being knocked out of the tournament after losing their opening two matches against New Zealand and India.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, that's nice (to go through). We knew Bangladesh were a tough challenge on this wicket," New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way we were able to pull it back in the middle with the ball was pleasing. It's probably the hardest thing to do in one-day cricket, take wickets in the middle and I think Bracewell was outstanding."</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra, who came into the side in place of the ill Daryl Mitchell, was nearly run out while on 25 but settled his nerves with delightful boundaries on the off side and brought up his half century with a driven four behind the bowler.</p>
        
            <p>After Devon Conway was castled by Mustafizur Rahman for 30, Ravindra continued to grind and made the most of being dropped on 93 by Mehidy Hasan Miraz before scoring his fourth one-day international century.</p>
        
            <p>The left-hander, who forged a 129-run partnership with the in-form Latham, was handed another lifeline after being dropped by Mahmudullah on 105 before finally departing with the job all but done.</p>

            <p>Glenn Phillips made an unbeaten 21 and Bracewell scored 11 not out to take their team home.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Bangladesh made a solid start after being asked to bat first but poor shot selection by their middle order batsmen meant they ended up with a modest total.</p>
        
            <p>The introduction of spinner Bracewell in the ninth over gave New Zealand the breakthrough as opener Tanzid Hasan departed for a run-a-ball 24, before seamer Will O'Rourke had Miraz caught for 13 to leave Bangladesh at 64-2.</p>
        
            <p>Shanto looked to steady the ship but New Zealand's bowlers applied the squeeze and Bracewell provided the cutting edge to finish with 4-26 after getting rid of Towhid Hridoy for seven, Mushfiqur Rahim for two and Mahmudullah for four.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell then pulled off a fine running catch to dismiss Shanto in the 38th over bowled by O'Rourke, leaving Bangladesh desperate for a strong finish to add some respectability to their total.</p>
        
            <p>Ali laid the platform with his rearguard effort but he was run out by wicketkeeper Tom Latham in the penultimate over, as Bangladesh limped to a below-par score.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a pretty good wicket to bat on. We needed two big partnerships but the way we batted was really disappointing," said Shanto.</p>
        
            <p>"The batting unit needs to improve a lot."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's last group game is against India in Dubai on Sunday which will decide the top qualifier.</p>
