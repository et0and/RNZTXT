            <p>Hughes, 20, has signed a three-year contract extension with the club, after making 11 appearances for the Phoenix last season having graduated from the club's academy.</p>
        
            <p>He has his sights set on becoming a regular in starting XI this season, with a spot opening up following Finn Surman's move to the Portland Timbers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to get a long-term deal sorted," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It means I have more time guaranteed to live my dream. I want to start every game and build a partnership with whoever is next to me.</p>
        
            <p>"The club has a clear philosophy at the minute of developing and selling young players and that's one of the reasons why I signed a long-term deal with the club, to give me that time.</p>
        
            <p>"If I do as well..I can move on into Europe and hopefully it can be a win-win."</p>
        
            <p>And he has lofty targets for the team in his second season as a professional.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everyone's main goal is the same; just win the league. We haven't won a trophy yet as a club and that's the main objective. I think we've got a really strong team and a really good opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>
With Finn Surman's (centre) move to the MLS, Hughes has the chance to cement a starting spot in the Phoenix this season.

            <p>A pair of Manchester United legends have inspired Isaac Hughes' position, playing style, and even his squad number.</p>
        
            <p>"Nemanja Vidic was always my favourite player growing up, and I've now got his proper number, 15.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to be like Vidic, hence why I took his number, but I also want to be like Rio Ferdinand.</p>
        
            <p>"In my head I think 'Rio on the ball and Vidic off the ball', show that quality on the ball and be as aggressive as I can off the ball and win everything."</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano says Hughes has all of the attributes he needs from a central defender, being "strong, a good communicator, and works very hard."</p>
        
            <p>"He's always got something to prove, always wants to get better, and he embraces learning.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes is the second player to commit to the Phoenix through to 2028, joining fullback Matt Sheridan who signed a three-year contract extension earlier this month.</p>
