            <p>The Black Caps have gone to lunch on day four of the second cricket test against Australia rueing what could prove to be an expensive dropped catch which could ultimately deny them a rare test win over Australia.</p>
        
            <p>At the break Australia are 174 for five needing a further 105 runs to win.</p>
        
            <p>The start of play at Hagely Oval was delayed by hour due to rain with the players eventually taking the field at midday with Australia resuming on 77 for four.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Marsh who started the day on 27 slashed at wide delivery from Black Caps skipper Tim Southee early on, offering a relatively straight forward chance to Rachin Ravindra at point who spilled it.</p>
        
            <p>The very next ball though Southee had the left handed Travis Head caught at point by Will Young, leaving Australia 80-5.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand thought they had a sixth wicket when Alex Carey on 19, was given out lbw to the bowling of Matt Henry but a subsequent review by Carey saw the decision overturned.</p>
        
            <p>Marsh has gone to lunch on 55 and Carey on 50, the pair having put on 94 for the sixth wicket.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps are chasing their first win on home soil against against Australia in 31 years.</p>
        
            <p>Australia lead the series one nil.</p>
