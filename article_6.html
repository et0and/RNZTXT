            <p>Two of last year's surprise packages open the 2025 edition of Super Rugby Pacific, but it's fair to say only one of them wants to remain known for what they achieved in 2024. The Hurricanes had their best season in years and reached a semi-final, while the Crusaders slumped to their worst ever finish since 1996. Both teams come in with a ton of injury disruption so there is a bit of intrigue, however it's hard not to think the Crusaders will be extra motivated to repay their fans' faith.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: 1. Tamaiti Williams 2. Ioane Moananu 3. Fletcher Newell 4. Scott Barrett 5. Antonio Shalfoon 6. Cullen Grace 7. Ethan Blackadder 8. Christian Lio-Willie 9. Noah Hotham 10. Taha Kemara 11. Sevu Reece 12. David Havili (c) 13. Levi Aumua 14. Chay Fihaki 15. Will Jordan</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Manumaua Letiu 17. George Bower 18. Sam Matenga 19. Tahlor Cahill 20. Corey Kellow 21. Kyle Preston 22. James O'Connor 23. Dallas McLeod</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 1. Xavier Numia 2. Jacob Devery 3. Tevita Mafileo 4. Caleb Delany 5. Isaia Walker-Leawere 6. Brad Shields (cc) 7. Du'Plessis Kirifi (cc) 8. Brayden Iose 9. Cameron Roigard 10. Harry Godfrey 11. Peter Umaga-Jensen 12. Bailyn Sullivan 13. Kini Naholo 14. Fatafehi Fineanganofo 15. Callum Harkin</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Raymond Tuputupu 17. Pouri Rakete-Stones 18. Pasilio Tosi 19. Hugo Plummer 20. Peter Lakai 21. Ereatara Enari 22. Riley Hohepa 23. Ngatungane Punivai</p>
        
            <p>Despite an avalanche of injuries, Rob Penney has been able to put together a pretty decent squad, particularly in the loose forwards. Ethan Blackadder, Cullen Grace and Christian Lio-Willie will play a big role in the way this one goes, but a lot of pressure will be on stand-in hooker Ioane Moananu to get the set piece right. A very powerful looking backline will revolve around Levi Aumua, who will be looking to play a much more decisive role than he did last season.</p>
        
            <p>Some real surprises from Clark Laidlaw with his first Hurricanes team, starting with unheralded Callum Harkin at fullback. Bailyn Sullivan finally gets a start in the backline but it's at second five, Riley Higgins isn't listed as injured so it's unknown as to how this has come about. Harry Godfrey has the first five spot outside Cam Roigard with new additions Ere Enari and Riley Hohepa on the bench. Two breakout All Blacks from last year, Pasilio Tosi and Peter Lakai, also will come into the game in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"We certainly owe them (Crusaders fans) a lot. They've stuck with us through thick and thin and we love playing at home. We just want to respect that by putting on great performances every week." - Crusaders captain David Havili.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 14 - 10 Crusaders</p>
        
            <p>This was arguably when the alarm bells really started to go off for the Crusaders last year, because the Canes didn't even look that good in winning this round four clash. Not only that, but it was a home game for the then-defending champs.</p>
        
            <p>Looking at the teams, it's quite clear the Canes will have a tough job on their hands, especially if the Crusaders can get the ball to Will Jordan often. However, there's just this nagging feeling that Rob Penney's team won't quite click into gear immediately, so if the Canes can get parity at set piece and rattle the home side early, we might see a repeat of last year's result.</p>
