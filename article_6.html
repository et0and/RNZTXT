            <p>It hasn't even been a fortnight since the Rugby World Cup final, but we can cast our eye ahead to next season with the squad namings of the Super Rugby Pacific sides.</p>
        
            <p>The first cab of the rank is last year's beaten finalists, the Chiefs, and there is a fair bit of turnover. Clayton McMillan has lost Sam Cane, Brodie Retallick and Bryn Gatland to Japan, Pita Gus Sowakula and Brad Weber to France, Angus Ta'avao is moving back up the road to the Blues, while Rivez Reihana is headed down south to the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Kaleb Trask and Reuben O'Neill return to Chiefs colours, while Jimmy Tupou's addition to the loose forwards is an exciting addition. While there are eight new full time contracted players, New Zealand U20 prop Sione Ahio is the only one to have not yet played Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Sione Ahio, George Dyer, Kauvaka Kaivelata, Reuben O'Neill, Jared Proffit, Aidan Ross, Ollie Norris</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Samisoni Taukei'aho, Bradley Slater, Tyrone Thompson</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Naitoa Ah Kuoi, Josh Lord, Manaaki Selby-Rickit, Tupou Vaa'i</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Kaylum Boshier, Samipeni Finau, Luke Jacobson, Simon Parker, Jimmy Tupou, Wallace Sititi, Malachi Wrampling-Alec</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Cortez Ratima, Xavier Roe, Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Damian McKenzie, Josh Ioane, Kaleb Trask</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Anton Lienert-Brown, Rameka Poihipi, Daniel Rona, Quinn Tupaea</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Liam Coombes-Fabling, Peniasi Malimali, Etene Nanai-Seturo, Emoni Narawa, Shaun Stevenson, Gideon Wrampling</p>
        
            <p>McMillan's side has nine All Blacks, however he is excited about the addition of some fringe players to the main squad.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys have been knocking on our door for a while now and we are excited to offer them a place this year. They have been impressive throughout NPC and during their time in our environment, so rightly earn their spot within our squad," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a new look squad for us but despite the changes, there remains a lot of continuity within this group. They are familiar with our environment, know how we do things, and bring a lot to the table."</p>
