            <p>Canterbury Kings have made the Super Smash men's final with a dominant victory over the Northern Brave in the elimination final at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>In an extraordinary match, the Kings took full advantage of a fresh, grassy wicket to have the Brave top order in knots early, as they couldn't handle the speed and guile from opening bowlers Matt Henry and Kyle Jamieson.</p>
        
            <p>At one stage the Brave were four wickets down for just seven runs, before a fighting 45 from skipper Jeet Raval gave them a little repeatability.</p>
        
            <p>Henry finished with the extraordinary figures of two wickets for two runs from his four overs, while Jamieson took three for 19, with Henry Shipley pitching in with three for 17 later on.</p>
        
            <p>One of the early wickets featured an amazing catch by Daryl Mitchell as he initially dropped the ball but managed to kick it up to his hands.</p>
        
            <p>The northerners eventually made 110 for nine, but the Kings chased this down easily to win by seven wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The Kings won after 13.1 overs, with Chad Bowes scoring an unbeaten 33 off 35 balls, after No 3 Matt Boyle had hit 48 off 25 balls.</p>
        
            <p>The Kings will play the Central Stags in Sunday's final.</p>
