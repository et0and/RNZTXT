            <p>The talk of silverware for Auckland FC has been unavoidable all season.</p>
        
            <p>It started with owner Bill Foley's statement that he wanted the team to win the A-League within three years - that was before his newest sporting side even had a name.</p>
        
            <p>Foley's penchant for trophies is something that coach Steve Corica mentions regularly.</p>
        
            <p>Corica and CEO Nick Becker know what the expectation is.</p>
        
            <p>But as the weeks countdown in the season and Auckland FC have a buffer over the chasing pack more people are saying the Premiers Plate is Auckland's to lose.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielder Jake Brimmer believes their latest win - a statement 6-1 victory over Wellington Phoenix - shows what the side is capable of.</p>
        
            <p>"It sends a massive message to the league but also to us as well I think we've proved that we're a championship team," Brimmer said.</p>
        
            <p>"All the staff have signed players that want to win and want to win championships and trophies... we're in a good position but it is important to remain humble now and just keep doing our thing."</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer has played in the A-League since 2017 with seasons for Perth Glory and his hometown club Melbourne Victory before joining Auckland so has a good gauge on where the team is at.</p>
        
            <p>"For the past three or four weeks our performances have only gotten better and better.</p>
        
            <p>"You not only win the derby, dominate a derby, it's very easy to get side-tracked and to stop doing the little things you do throughout the week but we've got a good bunch of boys that again want to win silverware and we know how important it is for this game [against second-placed Adelaide United]."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland has a 12 win, three draw and two loss record at this point in the season to be on 39 competition points - eight more than Adelaide United.</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer was part of Glory's premiership winning side in the 2018/19 season but had not won an A-League Grand Final.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't come around very often championships so I'm trying to get everyone to remain humble and look at it game by game rather than look at the future."</p>
        
            <p>Corica also wanted to keep his side on track ahead of Saturday's top of the table clash with Adelaide United in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Back in 2016/17 Corica was on the coaching staff of a Sydney FC side that won the premiership but failed to make the Grand Final so he is pushing Auckland to go all the way.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen a lot of teams after a win like that [against Wellington] that they go and lose the next match so we don't want to be part of that we've spoken about it to the players and they know they have to continue doing what they're doing to win especially against Adelaide they're a very good team, a very attacking team, very quick team, as well so we'll have to be at our best against them," Corica said.</p>
        
            <p>Corica said for Auckland to have their biggest win of the season against their closest geographical rivals a week before taking on their closest rivals on the points ladder was "perfect timing".</p>
        
            <p>"To do it in a derby is amazing to score six goals, to win all three derbies is also very special so obviously we'll see [Wellington] next year but I was really pleased with our first year against Wellington."</p>

            <p>Auckland have nine games remaining in the regular season. The Premiers Plate goes to the team that finishes the top of the standings after the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>The path to the Grand Final this season involves Elimination Finals for teams that finish the season in third, fourth, fifth and sixth place.</p>
        
            <p>Winners in the Elimination Finals progress to a two-leg semi-finals against the first and second placed teams from the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>The semi-finals winners play the Grand Final to be hosted by the highest placed team on the weekend of 31 May to 1 June.</p>
