            <p>All Blacks back Beauden Barrett will play rugby in Aotearoa for the next four years after re-signing with New Zealand Rugby (NZR) and the Blues until the end of 2027, the year of the next World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett is currently in Japan playing for Toyota Verblitz but will be eligible for All Blacks selection on return to New Zealand in 2024 and will return to Super Rugby Pacific in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The 2027 World Cup will be held in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett said this decision is a reflection of his desire to represent New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge privilege to put on the black jersey and one I will never take for granted. I'm still really passionate about playing alongside my brothers Scott and Jordie for Coastal, Taranaki or the All Blacks so looking forward to adding value where I can on my return from Japan. I am also grateful for the continued support from Taranaki, the Blues and New Zealand Rugby."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett, a 123 Test All Black and two-time World Rugby Player of the Year, made his international debut in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>He has scored 734 points and 43 tries during a career that includes a Rugby World Cup title in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Debuting for the Blues in 2020 against his former Super Rugby team the Hurricanes, Barrett has played 30 matches in the Blues jersey, scoring 199 points for the team.</p>
        
            <p>NZR chief executive, Mark Robinson, is thrilled Barrett will be continuing to play his rugby in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Beauden is not just an exceptional player but also an outstanding leader on and off the field. His return is a testament to the strength and appeal of our rugby environment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to have him return next year and be eligible to continue his career with the All Blacks while also lining up for the Blues the following year, contributing to the ongoing success of rugby in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks head coach, Scott Robertson said Barrett is a classy player.</p>
        
            <p>"He is the second most-capped All Black back in history for a reason and to have his knowledge and experience in our game is a reflection of his loyalty."</p>
        
            <p>Blues chief executive, Andrew Hore, said the club were elated to have the star playmaker back in blue.</p>
        
            <p>"Beauden is wonderful to have at the Blues, he's one of rugby's good people and treats everyone with respect," said Hore.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been a key driver for many of our social projects and community work over the last few years, such as our Covid and flood response, and is someone who's prepared to share his views in the team environment for the greater good."</p>
        
            <p>"Any contract extension is when we reflect on a player's time at the club and in finalising this contract it gave the Blues and Beauden the opportunity to review where we've come from and commit to the vision we have for the team and club."</p>
        
            <p>"We know Beauden feels he has unfinished business here at the Blues and we're confident he will come back with fire in the belly to take the club forward on and off the field," said Hore.</p>
