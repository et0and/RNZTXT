            <p>New Zealand cyclist Laurence Pithie has taken the overall lead on the Paris-Nice Tour.</p>
        
            <p>The 22 year old Groupama-FDJ rider was second in a sprint finish to stage two.</p>
        
            <p>He was third in the opening stage and following today's result he was handed the tour leaders yellow jersey.</p>
        
            <p>Pithie shares the same time as Mads Pedersen of Denmark and Dylan Groenewegen of the Netherlands</p>
        
            <p>He also leads the points and youth categories.</p>
        
            <p>"I was definitely not expecting it this morning but it's very nice to wear the yellow jersey in a race like this," he told the race website.</p>
        
            <p>"You're always fighting for the stage win. It's a bit disappointing not to have won it but De Kleijn (Dutchman Arvid de Kleijn) was super fast and he had a fantastic lead-out. I was able to follow the Tudor train and it was the right one to follow.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely surprising as it's my first World Tour stage race in Europe and I take each day as an experience. It's great for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Now I'm looking forward to help our leader David Gaudu. Tomorrow is a really hard day but we'll try to keep the jersey and do a good team work for David. We'll be starting last so we'll be able to see what the other teams are doing and try to learn from it."</p>
        
            <p>The eight stage tour continues tomorrow with a 27km team time trial.</p>
        
            <p>Paris-Nice, is nicknamed 'The Race to the Sun' and is the traditional start to the european season.</p>
        
            <p>Pithie became the youngest winner of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean race in January.</p>
        
            <p>He won two world junior track titles in 2019.</p>
