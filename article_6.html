            <p>NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster insists the ongoing investigation into assistant Richard Agar hasn't affected his team's preparation for their first home game of the NRL season against Manly Sea Eagles.</p>
        
            <p>Agar is the subject of an Integrity Unit probe over allegations that he physically assaulted English journalist John Davidson during the team's visit to Las Vegas for their season-opening defeat to Canberra Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>The confrontation reportedly traces back several years, when Agar coached Leeds in the Super League. He also served as head coach at Hull and Wakefield Trinity, before joining the Auckland club in 2022, as Webster's deputy.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still waiting on the NRL and letting it play its course," said Webster. "Richard is so respected in the game, one of the best assistant coaches in the game.</p>
        
            <p>"He's such a big supporter for me. If anyone knows him, he's got an unbelievable character, so we'll just let it play its course and see what happens.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of those things you have to give the care it needs and show the support to your staff member. It certainly hasn't been a distraction for any of us.</p>
        
            <p>"It's business as usual, but in the background, Cameron is dealing with the NRL and we'll just wait to see what the verdict is. All we can do is focus on support and winning.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got so much to play for, we can't let anything be an excuse or a distraction."</p>
        
            <p>Agar, 53, has been on the training field with his team and Warriors chief executive Cam George was quick to dismiss any notion he might be stood down during the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Not at all, that's all jumping at shadows at the moment," George said. "There's always two sides to every story and our job is to make sure we balance that out with the best process possible.</p>
        
            <p>"He won't be stood down at this point in time - that hasn't even crossed my mind."</p>
        
            <p>Webster and Agar have served together as Toa Samoa assistant coaches, while Webster's older brother, James, was Agar's assistant at Hull and replaced him as Wakefield Trinity head coach in 2014.</p>
