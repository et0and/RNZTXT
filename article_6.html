            <p>Australia's test and ODI captain Pat Cummins has signed a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns in a major coup for the fledgling Major League Cricket (MLC) T20 competition.</p>
        
            <p>Cummins will join Black Caps Finn Allen and Matt Henry, along with former Black Cap Corey Anderson who is now US-based and is currently playing for the USA at the T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The second season of MLC starts on 5 July, less than a week after the T20 World Cup co-hosted by the United States and West Indies wraps up.</p>
        
            <p>Fast bowler Cummins will join hard-hitting compatriot Jake Fraser-McGurk at the Unicorns and follows Australia team mates Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Steve Smith into the league.</p>
        
            <p>"MLC is developing at a rapid rate, and the U.S. market potential is huge for cricket," Cummins said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly, presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket."</p>

            <p>The Unicorns are co-owned by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan.</p>
        
            <p>Cummins is one of cricket's most recognised players as a top performer in all three formats (test, one day and T20) who led Australia to the test and one-day world championships last year.</p>
        
            <p>MLC was awarded "List A" status by the International Cricket Council last month, making it an official T20 league on a par with the Indian Premier League and other established franchise competitions.</p>
        
            <p>MLC organisers plan to expand the six-team competition to 10 in coming years.</p>
