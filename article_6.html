        <h2>Silver Ferns in good form but others biting at the heels</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - After six rounds of domestic netball, selectors will be pretty happy with the form of Silver Ferns players, but others are biting at the heels of the incumbents.

            <p>Analysis - After six rounds of domestic netball, selectors will be pretty happy with the form of Silver Ferns players, but others are biting at the heels of the incumbents.</p>
        
            <p>Before she got injured Silver Ferns starting shooter Grace Nweke was typically leading the domestic shooting stats with accuracy and high volume.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke, who has a knee injury, will be hoping to return to the court for the Mystics in a month's time.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio has been in imperious form for the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic.</p>
        
            <p>Maia Wilson, who missed January's tour to England after falling short of fitness requirements, has been in great form at the Stars and tops the league's shooting stats for volume.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson has had to carry a big load at the winless Stars, who have missed injured shooter Amorangi Malesala. Wilson has been good whether she is goal shoot or goal attack.</p>

            <p>Before she got injured at the end of round five, Amelia Walmsley was doing a great job for the Pulse at goal shoot and goal attack, a position she is not familiar with.</p>
        
            <p>She was filling the void at goal attack because another Silver Ferns shooter, Tiana Metuarau, has not seen the court so far while she works her way back from injury.</p>
        
            <p>Frustratingly, three Silver Ferns shooters and development squad member Malesala are currently rehabbing injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The court craft of development squad member Georgia Heffernan, who got her Silver Ferns debut in January, has been great for the Steel but she will be wanting to improve her 75 percent shooting accuracy.</p>
        
            <p>Tactix shooter Te Paea Selby-Rickit made herself unavailable for the international season post last year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old has never really pushed her way into a starting position for the Silver Ferns since debuting in 2016 and it might be time for selectors to look at other options early in the new world cup cycle.</p>

            <p>Pulse shooter Khiarna Williams looks like she has an incredible temperament, and is a smart cookie.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old displays a healthy level of nonchalance, regardless of whether she is coming up against the most experienced of defenders.</p>
        
            <p>Other young shooters who are standing out include the dynamic Saviour Tui, Grace Namana, and tall Mystics shooter Hannah Glen.</p>
        
            <p>Maddy Gordon was consistently delivering in the centre bib for the Pulse before an ankle injury struck her out a couple of rounds ago.</p>
        
            <p>The franchise will be hoping the Silver Fern can return for the business end of the season.</p>

            <p>Whitney Souness has taken her game to another level this year. She made a strong impact when she took to the court during January's Nations Cup and she has been immense for the Pulse.</p>
        
            <p>Her capacity to keep pushing up her work rate is incredible.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Silver Ferns midcourters Kate Heffernan and Mila Reuelu-Buchanan have both been playing well for their struggling franchises.</p>
        
            <p>It is easy to forget that Mystics wing attack Peta Toeava is a current member of the Silver Ferns squad.</p>
        
            <p>Toeava was named in the Silver Ferns 2023/24 squad last August but was not included in any of the three series since then because she did not meet fitness standards.</p>
        
            <p>Toeava has been at her best for the Mystics this year. At 30 years of age she is running out of chances to get another crack at the black dress and she will have to be fit enough to push her way in.</p>

            <p>Former Silver Fern midcourter Shannon Saunders showed she still has a lot to offer when she returned to the Steel from maternity leave but the 33-year-old was recently ruled out of the rest of the season with torn cartilage in her knee.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns development squad members Kimiora Poi, Fa'amu Ioane, and Tayla Earle, who got her international debut in January, are all having great seasons and will give selectors food for thought.</p>
        
            <p>Greer Sinclair has had great impact off the bench for the Tactix at centre and wing defence and looks determined to make her mark in elite netball.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns regulars Karin Burger, Kelly Jackson (nee Jury), Phoenix Karaka, and Jane Watson have all been in great form so far. Jackson in particular has been outstanding for the Pulse.</p>

            <p>Kate Burley and Paris Lokotui were promoted to the Silver Ferns for the first time last year and have been in excellent form.</p>
        
            <p>Lokotui is an intriguing proposition as she could offer power as a wing defence/centre slide in the future. But she has also got incredible elevation and can play goal defence.</p>
        
            <p>Development squad member Michaela Sokolich-Beatson has been in great form for the Mystics and has strong leadership qualities.</p>
        
            <p>Young defenders Carys Stythe and Parris Mason in particular, are knocking loudly on the door to get their first taste of international netball later this year.</p>
        
            <p>
Paris Lokotui should find herself in the black dress sooner rather than later.

            <p>At 29, Georgia Takarangi has been around the domestic scene for a few years now but seems to get better with age.</p>
        
            <p>The 1.83m tall Takarangi has been getting a lot of clean ball this year and while she is not super tall, neither is Silver Fern Jane Watson who is shorter at 1.81m.</p>
        
            <p>The Magic stalwart got a single test cap for the Silver Ferns in a Covid affected series against England in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Takarangi and Kelly Jackson top the stats for most intercepts this season with 19 each after six rounds.</p>
