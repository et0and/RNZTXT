            <p>Batsman Kane Williamson won't be on the plane with the rest of the Black Caps squad heading to India on Friday as he continues treatment on a groin strain.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson experienced groin discomfort during the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle and will require a period of rehabilitation before joining the squad for the three-test series in India.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Chapman has been called in as cover.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps selector Sam Wells said the plan was still for Williamson to play some part in the three-Test series which starts in Bengaluru next week.</p>
        
            <p>"The advice we've received is that the best course of action is for Kane to rest and rehabilitate now rather than risk aggravating the injury," Wells said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hopeful that if the rehabilitation goes to plan Kane will be available for the latter part of the tour.</p>
        
            <p>"While it's obviously disappointing to not have Kane available from the start of the tour, it provides an opportunity for someone else to play a role in an important series."</p>
        
            <p>Chapman, who has become a mainstay in New Zealand's white-ball sides, averages 41.9 in first-class cricket, with six centuries, including 114 for New Zealand A against India A at Bert Sutcliffe Oval in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>He featured in three of the Aces Plunket Shield fixtures last summer, notching 245 runs at 40, including 123 against the Otago Volts in Dunedin in February.</p>
        
            <p>Wells said Chapman possessed the right skillset for Test cricket in the sub-continent.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe Mark is one of our best players of spin and has a proven track-record in the sub-continent," said Wells.</p>
        
            <p>Allrounder Michael Bracewell will travel with the squad for the first Test in Bengaluru before returning home for the birth of his second child and will be replaced by Ish Sodhi for the remainder of the series.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder of the squad is unchanged from the recent Test series against Sri Lanka, with Tom Latham leading the side for the first time as full-time Test captain.</p>
