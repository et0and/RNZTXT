        <h2>Xavi Taele excelling on and off the field</h2>
        <p>
Xavi Taele is one of the new Blues faces in 2025.
</p>
        
            <p>Throughout his rugby life, Xavi Taele has always made sure to hit the books just as hard as he tackled opposition.</p>
        
            <p>Many young players dream of making it to Super Rugby, but few prepare for life beyond it.</p>
        
            <p>However, now signed with the Blues, the star schoolboy centre is continuing to balance his rugby ambition with his education.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely was my number one priority through school. I wasn't missing class for training or anything like that. I think it's all part of it. You're not just a rugby player at the end of the day."</p>
        
            <p>Taele said it was a value instilled by his parents.</p>
        
            <p>"My dad played rugby a long time ago now, but he sort of realised that when he was ending his career, you've got to have something to fall back on, so they really pushed that for me."</p>
        
            <p>His accolades on the field were just as prolific in the classroom, achieving all three NCEA levels with excellence.</p>
        
            <p>Taele was the inaugural recipient of the Michael Garner Scholarship, a grant which is awarded to a student showing exceptional promise both in and outside of sport.</p>
        
            <p>As well as potentially making a Super Rugby debut in 2025, Taele was studying exercise science at the University of Auckland.</p>

            <p>"Even if it's just one paper a semester, just to have something other than rugby to keep my mind on."</p>
        
            <p>Taele was captain of the St Kents 1st XV where he was regarded as one of the finest schoolboy centres in the country.</p>
        
            <p>His transition from school saw him selected for the New Zealand U20's, culminating in last year winning the Age Grade Player of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>"To actually be paid for your job, the pressure gets a little bit higher as well."</p>
        
            <p>After a season playing for Auckland in the NPC, the young midfielder was one of only a handful of new signings for the defending champions.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't expecting to play too many games in NPC, but ended up to playing every game. It was definitely a step up from under twenties, it was a bit of a eye-opener."</p>
        
            <p>He has now made the even bigger jump to Super.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been good learning off the older boys and feeling part of the team."</p>
        
            <p>However, he has been slightly star-struck seeing the likes of Beauden Barrett and Reiko Ioane at training.</p>
        
            <p>"Watching them on TV growing up to actually be hanging in the same team as them, it's pretty unreal, but also just learning from their standards on and off the field."</p>
        
            <p>Taele said he feels midfield is his strongest position, though he is just happy to be in the environment learning from some of the game's best.</p>
        
            <p>"Centre or second five. Wherever the spot, if there's an opportunity, I'll take it."</p>
        
            <p>Originally from Tauranga, Talea admitted he grew up dreaming of playing for the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>"Better keep that quiet around here," he joked.</p>
        
            <p>"But I've been in Auckland for a while now and been through the Blues age group team. So yeah, Blues has definitely been at the front of mind these past few years."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to his on field style, it emulates his approach to education.</p>
        
            <p>"I pride myself on hard work. I might not always be seen, but I'd be like to known, as the player that they can rely on to do the hard work."</p>
