            <p>Combatants</p>

            <p>Won the event in 1995 before retaining it in 2000. Unsuccessful challenges in 2003, 2007, and 2013. Regained the Cup in Bermuda in 2017 and defended it in Auckland in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The team was instrumental in the boat design change that is now the AC75.</p>

            <p>Boats</p>
        
            <p>AC75</p>
        
            <p>The 36th America's Cup has version two of the AC75 which is a 75 foot foiling monohull.</p>
        
            <p>The boats are a step up from those used in Auckland in 2021 with larger and lighter foils. The boats are all-up lighter and onboard, the electronics, hydraulics and software systems are vastly upgraded. The number of crew on the AC75 was reduced from eleven to eight to save weight in an effort to promote earlier flight, while cyclor power returned.</p>
        
            <p>To keep costs under control, it was also determined that teams would only be allowed to build one AC75.</p>
        
            <p>Crew</p>
        
            <p>Helmsmen</p>
        
            <p>The boats have two helmsmen-one sitting on the port side and the other on starboard. The helmsmen steer the boat and have multiple functions on their steering wheels, just like in F1, where they can trim the pitch, cant and angle of the boat at the press of a button.</p>
        
            <p>Flight Controller/Trimmer</p>
        
            <p>There are two Flight Controller/Trimmers onboard an AC75 and they are responsible for keeping the boat up in flight on the foils and achieving target speeds through trimming the sails effectively. They work in conjunction with the helmsmen and can also assist in tactical decisions, spotting wind pressure and boat-on-boat decisions.</p>
        
            <p>Cyclors</p>
        
            <p>The Cyclors are the power behind the sail controls, mainsail traveller, mast rotation and some additional mechanical outputs. The Cyclors are world-class athletes drawn from the most demanding</p>
        
            <p>physical sports such as rowing, long-distance running and cycling and effectively power all of the boat's functions other than the foil arm mechanism.</p>

            <p>The Trophy</p>
        
            <p>In 1848 the America's Cup, affectionately known as the 'Auld Mug,' was crafted by Messrs R&S Garrard & Co. of Panton Street, London. An ornate sterling silver bottomless ewer, it was bought and donated by Henry William Paget, the 1st Marquess of Anglesey.</p>
        
            <p>The oldest continually contested international sporting trophy, the America's Cup was originally known as the 'R.Y.S. £100 Cup,' standing for a cup of £100 or 'sovereigns' in value.</p>
        
            <p>The Cup was damaged in 1997 when an activist took to it with a sledgehammer at Auckland's Royal Yacht Squadron.</p>
        
            <p>History:</p>
        
            <p>First contested in 1851 when the US schooner 'America' sailed to Britain and took part in the Royal yacht Squadron annual regatta.</p>
        
            <p>In 1857 the trophy was renamed the America's Cup and American boats successfully defended the trophy 24 times between 1870 and 1980.</p>
        
            <p>In 1983 Australia II became the first successful challenger.</p>
        
            <p>The San Diego Yacht club won the 1987 event in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Black Magic won the America's Cup in San Diego in 1995.</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland in 2003 and 2007 is the only other nation to have won the Cup.</p>
