            <p>Suryakumar Yadav made an unbeaten half-century as India reached the Super 8s despite being given a fright in a seven-wicket win over T20 World Cup co-hosts USA.</p>
        
            <p>Left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh was rewarded for his diligence and accuracy with impressive figures of 4-9 as he helped restrict the United States to 110-8.</p>
        
            <p>Nitish Kumar played some stylish shots to top score for the US with 27 off 23 balls, but the total felt comfortably within reach of India's powerful batting line-up.</p>
        
            <p>However, a nervous hush descended on the predominantly India-supporting crowd in New York when they made a spluttering start to their reply.</p>
        
            <p>First Virat Kohli nicked off Saurabh Netravalkar for a golden duck then the US left-arm fast bowler picked up the wicket of fellow opener Rohit Sharma via a leading edge to leave India reeling at 10-2.</p>
        
            <p>A pivotal moment came in the 13th over, with India on 59-3, when Netravalkar spilled a high catch that would have dismissed Suryakumar on 22.</p>
        
            <p>From that point Suryakumar sensed it was his day as he and Shivam Dube, who finished with 31 from 35 balls, found the boundary more freely.</p>
        
            <p>The US will also qualify for the Super 8s if they avoid defeat in their final Group A match against Ireland in Florida on Friday, or if the game is rained off.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a particularly miserable time on the pitch in New York for one of India's star names.</p>

            <p>Kohli came into the tournament on the back of stellar season in the Indian Premier League where he was top runscorer with 741 at an average of 61.75.</p>
        
            <p>Off the field in the Big Apple he has been able to relax in high-end coffee shops with his Bollywood actress wife Anushka Sharma without the frenzied attention he would get a home.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli might have enjoyed his time spent in Manhattan, but his impact on the cricketing graph of the same name barely stretches above the height of a bungalow so far in this tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Scores of four, one and zero in his last three innings, albeit on tricky pitches at the venue inside Eishenhower Park, will be of a nagging concern to India supporters before the Super 8s.</p>
        
            <p>Memories of the USA's shock win over Pakistan might have caused a few palms to sweat particularly when Rishabh Pant, crucial in India's own win over Pakistan, saw his middle stump pegged back by Ali Khan.</p>
        
            <p>Recognising the precarious nature of the situation, Suryakumar, a flamboyant 360 player, initially reined in his approach to get India over the line.</p>
        
            <p>His heart would have been in his mouth when Netravalkar, a part-time software engineer and former India Under-19 player, pitter-pattered on the turf at short third underneath a top edge only to fumble it.</p>
        
            <p>For an Associate team to beat a powerhouse like India those types of chances have to be taken and from that point SKY and Dube were able to cruise home with 10 balls to spare.</p>
