            <p>FIFA's revamped Club World Cup planned for 2025 and set to feature 32 teams will be played from June 15 to July 13, while a new Intercontinental Cup will be played annually from next year, Gianni Infantino, the head of world soccer's governing body, said on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>FIFA had announced an expanded Club World Cup earlier this year and unanimously voted to appoint the United States as hosts for the first edition of the event.</p>
        
            <p>The Council met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to ratify the dates for the Club World Cup and confirmed next year's Intercontinental Cup would have the UEFA Champions League winner playing a team that comes through intercontinental playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>"The tournament will feature all current confederation premier club competition champions," FIFA President Infantino said.</p>
        
            <p>"(It) concludes with a final at a neutral venue between the UEFA Champions League winners and the winners of an intercontinental play-off between clubs from the other confederations."</p>
        
            <p>The Council also decided that Chile will host the Under-20 World Cup in 2025 while Poland will host the Under-20 Women's World Cup in 2026.</p>
