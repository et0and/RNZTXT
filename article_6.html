            <p>The Black Caps have been blown away by Pakistan by seven wickets in the second T20 international in Rawalpindi.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan bowled the inexperienced New Zealand side out for just 90 runs, and chased down the total in 12.1 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Shaheen Shah Afridi led the Pakistan attack with 3-13 while Mohammad Amir finished with 2-13. Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan took two wickets each.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was sent in to bat with openers Tim Seifert and Tim Robinson out cheaply for 12 and 4 respectively.</p>
        
            <p>The highest score for the Black Caps came from the bat of Mark Chapman with 19, with New Zealand bowled out in 18.1 overs.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's 90 runs was never going to be enough, with Pakistan's Mohammed Rizwan scoring an unbeaten 45 off just 34 balls to anchor the chase.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps captain Michael Bracewell said the Rawalpindi pitch was not an easy one to handle.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't score quite enough runs," Bracewell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were little bit slow to adapt to the surface and put ourselves under pressure there."</p>
        
            <p>With a short turnaround ahead of Monday's T20, also at Rawalpindi, he said the players would need to learn quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things we pride ourselves on as Black Caps is fighting right til the end," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We did that tonight particularly with the bowling and in the field, we'll reflect on that tonight and move onto the next game."</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan has taken a 1-0 lead in the five match series. The series opener was abandoned due to rain.</p>
