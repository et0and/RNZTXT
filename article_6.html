            <p>It's been a mixed bag for the Kiwis at the global showcase of the shortest format, making three semi finals and one final across eight appearances.</p>

            <p>A loss to Sri Lanka by seven wickets was followed by a nine wicket demolition of Kenya who were rolled for just 73, Mark Gillespie taking 4/7.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand went on to beat India with taking Vettori 4/20 and England courtesy of a Craig McMillian half century in Super 8's to progress to the final four. However, they suffered a six wicket loss to Pakistan after posting 143/8, led by Ross Taylor's unbeaten 37.</p>

            <p>Scraped through their three team pool to the Super 8's with a seven wicket win over Scotland before a heartbreaking one run loss to South Africa where Brendon McCullum's 57 went in vain. Then went on to drop games against Sri Lanka and Pakistan where Umar Gul snagged 5/6 as New Zealand was all out for just 99. Enjoyed a consolation win over Ireland with Aaron Redmond returning 63 with the bat.</p>

            <p>Topped their group with two wins from two over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, Scott Styris sending Zimbabwe crashing out of the tournament with 3/5.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Super 8's proved less fruitful, with losses to England and South Africa, their only win coming against Pakistan by one run thanks in large part to 3/19 from Ian Butler.</p>

            <p>Black Caps Finish- Super 8's.</p>
        
            <p>Again with just three teams in their group, the Kiwis cruised to the Super 8's with McCullum smashing the first World Cup century by a kiwi with 123 from 58 to beat Bangladesh first up, before going down to Pakistan. The Black Caps' campaign came to an end in incredibly cruel fashion. Soundly beaten by England, New Zealand then lost two super overs, first to Sri Lanka, as Tim Southee's 1/12 was bettered by Lasith Malinga's 1/5 and then to the West Indies where Taylor and McCullum's 17 would be just shy of Chirs Gayle and Marlon Samuels target of 19. Two ties. No points. and a ticket home.</p>

            <p>Black Caps Finish-Group Stage.</p>
        
            <p>With more countries entered, New Zealand were one of five in their group, winning two and losing two proving not enough to progress, the first time in their T20 World Cup history. Despite wins over England and the Netherlands, with McCullum blasting 65 against the Dutch, they would crash out following defeats to South Africa and Sri Lanka, Kane Williamson notably scoring 42 of the 60 runs mustered against the eventual champions</p>

            <p>The edition best known for Carlos Braithwaite's heroics, it was also a memorable run by the Kiwis, who went four from four in the group stage, beating India, Australia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Mitch Santner taking 4/11 against India while Martin Guptill put Pakistan to the sword with 80.</p>
        
            <p>However, their momentum came to a screaming halt in the semis against England, where they were well beaten by seven wickets.</p>

            <p>Black Caps Finish- Runners Up.</p>
        
            <p>After a five year absence, the World Cup returned with an extended Super 12's stage, where the Black Caps would finish second in their group, with four wins from five over India, Afghanistan, Namibia and Scotland before a stutter against Pakistan. Guptill plundered 93 against the Scots while Trent Boult was brilliant with the ball, sneering 3/17 against Afghanistan and 3/20 against India. In the semi final against England chasing 167, opener Daryl Mitchell blasted 72 not out to secure a five wicket win and book a first ever final for New Zealand. Williamson stood up in the big dance with 85, but it was not enough as Australia claimed victory by eight wickets.</p>

            <p>Just one year later and the Kiwis topped their Super 12 group with three wins from four with one washout. They kicked off the campaign in style as they hammered hosts Australia by 89 runs, posting 200 which featured 92 not out from Devon Conway and a Finn Allen onslaught of 42 from 16.</p>
        
            <p>A Glenn Phillips century and 4/13 from Boult led to another crushing win over Sri Lanka, before a 20 run loss to England, and scratchy win over Ireland saw them into the semis. Despite a fighting 53 from Mitchell, Pakistan took the game by seven wickets and their spot in the final.</p>
