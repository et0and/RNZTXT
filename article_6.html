            <p>Sky Stadium, Wellington</p>
        
            <p>Live blog coverage on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes put out a call for a big crowd and it seems like Wellingtonians have responded, with reports of ticket sales over 30,000 for Saturday night's game.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs have rolled into town with a tonne of confidence after their big win over the Reds in last weekend's quarter-final, while the home side will not want to blow it now after such an impressive regular season.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 1 Pouri-Rakete-Stones, 2 Asafo Aumua, 3 Tyrel Lomax, 4 Justin Sangster, 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 6 Brad Shields (c), 7 Peter Lakai, 8 Brayden Iose, 9 TJ Perenara, 10 Brett Cameron, 11 Salesi Rayasi, 12 Jordie Barrett, 13 Billy Proctor, 14 Josh Moorby, 15 Ruben Love</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 James O'Reilly, 17 Tevita Mafileo, 18 Pasilio Tosi, 19 James Tucker, 20 Devan Flanders, 21 Du'Plessis Kirifi, 22 Richard Judd, 23 Bailyn Sullivan</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 1. Aidan Ross, 2. Samisoni Taukei'aho, 3. George Dyer, 4. Jimmy Tupou, 5. Tupou Vaa'i, 6. Samipeni Finau, 7. Luke Jacobson (c), 8. Wallace Sititi 9. Cortez Ratima, 10. Damian McKenzie, 11. Etene Nanai-Seturo, 12. Rameka Poihipi, 13. Anton Lienert-Brown, 14. Emoni Narawa 15. Shaun Stevenson</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Bradley Slater, 17. Jared Proffit, 18. Reuben O'Neill, 19. Naitoa Ah Kuoi, 20. Simon Parker, 21. Xavier Roe, 22. Quinn Tupaea, 23. Daniel Rona.</p>
        
            <p>Clark Laidlaw has only had one setback this week, with Xavier Numia ruled out for the rest of the competition. Tyrel Lomax comes back in to bolster the front row and Ruben Love returns at fullback, in an otherwise settled side that beat the Rebels last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It is of vital importance to the Canes to get their backline involved early and often, with Brett Cameron's kicking game likely to be the target of the Chiefs' counter attack.</p>
        
            <p>No changes to the Chiefs unsurprisingly, after their very good win last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Wallace Sititi is looking like a real prospect and while he is probably not in Scott Robertson's thoughts right now, he certainly will be in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Cortez Ratima's battle with TJ Perenara is one with All Black implications, Damian McKenzie has benefited a lot from Ratima's assured service all season.</p>
        
            <p>"Playoffs rugby is not about how many, it's not even necessarily about how you perform, it's about finding a way to get to the next week. So, we're super happy and proud of the group." - Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw.</p>
        
            <p>"Our discipline was significantly better than what it was in previous weeks, and as a consequence we got better access into the game and played with a bit of freedom ... It's important, we've learned over the last few years that having 15 men on the field is advantageous. We're doing everything in our power to make sure that happens." - Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 20 - 17 Chiefs</p>
        
            <p>The Canes made it two for two over the Chiefs this season with a tense win in Hamilton, which came down to a nerveless Cameron penalty in the dying moments. Before that, the Canes had to play 20 minutes with 14 men after an early yellow card to Raymond Tuputupu.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs had discipline issues of their own with two yellow cards, so if either team can keep intact for the duration of this one, it may well mean the difference.</p>
        
            <p>This stands as a fantastic Super Rugby match-up between two sides that have played some excellent rugby this season. Goal kicking is going to be crucial, so the familiarity that Cameron and Jordie Barrett have at Sky Stadium is really important.</p>
        
            <p>The scrum battle will be huge - with Lomax back the Canes will be feeling pretty good about that area, although their lineout drive defence will need to be on point against a very clinical Chiefs side.</p>
