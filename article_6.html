            <p>World Boxing will need more countries to join the new international body if the sport is to be a part of the Los Angeles 2024 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>World Boxing attended its first formal meeting with the International Olympic Committee today with the goal to ensure boxing stays in the Olympics beyond Paris.</p>
        
            <p>As it stands, boxing is not part of the programme for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>The IOC has organised qualifying for this year's Games in Paris after banning IBA (International Boxing Association), but have stressed this cannot continue and a new International Federation is needed to run the sport.</p>
        
            <p>World Boxing was launched a year ago and since then they have staged three World Boxing Cup events in Germany, England and the United States and membership has steadily grown.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is a member of World Boxing.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement World Boxing said the IOC clearly indicated that the new International Federation had to be supported by a global body of National Federations and the new International Federation had to show evidence of proper governance and leadership for the sport for the IOC to consider to put boxing back on the Olympic programme of LA28.</p>
        
            <p>The IOC stripped the IBA of recognition last June after saying it had failed to complete reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues.</p>
        
            <p>Boris van der Vorst, World Boxing President stated after the meeting: "Once again, we thank the IOC for their commitment and perseverance with boxing in the Olympic Games having run two Olympic editions themselves. Now it is time for World Boxing and National Federations to learn from their best practices and applied ethical principles."</p>
        
            <p>"It is clearly imperative that those boxing nations interested to compete in the Olympic Games in the future need to show urgently their intent and commitment to the Olympic Games by joining World Boxing and retaining boxing at the Olympic Games. Otherwise, the loss of boxing's Olympic status would be our worst nightmare."</p>
        
            <p>Last month World Boxing stated that they had 28 members.</p>
