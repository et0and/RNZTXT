            <p>India won the Champions Trophy overcoming a plucky New Zealand by four wickets in a nervy final to cap their unbeaten campaign in the elite 50-overs tournament on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Rohit Sharma top-scored with a rapid 76 but it was KL Rahul's unbeaten 34 in the nerve-shredding final overs that helped India chase down a tricky 252-run target with one over to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Look back at how the final unfolded with RNZ's live update.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand fought tooth-and-nail defending a modest total of 251-7 and Michael Bracewell produced a memorable all-round display but reigning Twenty20 world champions India could not be denied a second successive global title.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been amazing," India batter Virat Kohli said after their tense victory.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to bounce back after a tough tour of Australia. We wanted to win a big tournament and that's what we've ended up doing."</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell made 63 and Bracewell contributed an unbeaten 53 but India could have restricted New Zealand to a lower total had it not been for four spilt catches.</p>
        
            <p>After just one four in the first 21 balls, New Zealand opener Rachin Ravindra (37) cut loose and appeared to have Lady Luck on his side.</p>
        
            <p>Mohammed Shami spilled a return catch from the opener while Shreyas Iyer spilled one in the outfield to give Ravindra a second respite.</p>
        
            <p>Spinner Varun Chakravarthy broke the 57-run opening stand when he trapped Will Young lbw for 15.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit introduced Kuldeep Yadav after the powerplay and the left-arm wrist-spinner responded by clattering Ravindra's stump with his first delivery.</p>

            <p>In his next over, Kane Williamson spooned a return catch to the curly-hair spinner and India were cock-a-hoop having seen the back of New Zealand's batting mainstay.</p>
        
            <p>Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja applied the squeeze but India continued to drop catches with captain Rohit and his deputy Shubman Gill being the culprits.</p>
        
            <p>Chakravarthy returned to remove the dangerous Glenn Phillips (34) and Mitchell fell to Shami just when he looked prime to launch a late assault.</p>
        
            <p>India's spin quartet bowled a combined 38 overs conceding only 144 runs to give their team complete control of the middle overs while also claiming five wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Having lost the service of pace spearhead Matt Henry through a shoulder injury, New Zealand bowlers had their task cut out and Rohit led India's powerplay assault.</p>

            <p>New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner opted for spin from both ends but Rohit and Shubman Gill (31) went on to forge the tournament's first opening stand of 100 or more.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips plucked a one-handed blinder to dismiss Gill and Bracewell removed Virat Kohli with his first delivery to peg back India.</p>
        
            <p>With boundaries drying up, player-of-the-match Rohit charged out against Ravindra only to be stumped - his dismissal injecting fresh excitement into the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Iyer (48) combined with Axar Patel (29) to steady India but New Zealand kept prising out wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the madness around him, Rahul batted with ice in his veins to take India closer to the target and Jadeja sealed their victory with a four.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously it is bittersweet," player of the tournament Ravindra said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a great final, we played some great cricket in the lead-up...</p>
        
            <p>"Individual accolades are great but the build-up to the tournament and playing for a great team was very enjoyable."</p>
