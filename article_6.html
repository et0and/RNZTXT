            <p>New Zealand have coasted into the semifinals of the Olympic women's sevens rugby tournament in Paris after dismantling China 55-5.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens scorched across for nine tries in a lopsided quarterfinal at the Stade de France, emphasising why they had advanced through pool play as the eighth qualifiers while China scraped through in eighth.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's semifinal at 1.30am on Wednesday (NZT) will be against the United States, who beat Great Britain 17-7 in the second quarterfinal.</p>

            <p>There were some early signs of rust from the Black Ferns, who led through an early try to Sarah Hirini but found themselves only 7-5 ahead after China broke the line and created a try to Dou Xinrong.</p>
        
            <p>Hirini also spent two minutes off the park, shown a yellow card for a high tackle.</p>
        
            <p>However, the defending champions discovered their rhythm to be 24-5 up at the interval before scoring five unanswered tries after the break.</p>
        
            <p>There were doubles for Hirini, Mahina Paul, Michaele Blyde and Jazmin Felix-Hotham while retiring great Portia Woodman-Wickliffe also crossed.</p>
