            <p>Ramsden won the NCAA 1500m outdoor title last year.</p>
        
            <p>She's in good form after setting a New Zealand 1500m record at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow last week.</p>
        
            <p>She finished 10th in the final.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a little fatigue (from the world indoors), but we'd trained really hard for this peak and I'm practising that racing every weekend which is fun," she told the media afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>However she wasn't expecting to race such a quick time.</p>
        
            <p>"I had no idea we were going that fast.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a credit to Kim, she took it out beautifully, I had no idea it was going to be that quick."</p>
        
            <p>She was particularly happy for May.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so cool, to think that in a couple of years we're going to be wearing black together, that's really special."</p>
        
            <p>After the race she was also asked for her autograph for the first time ever.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of crazy, a didn't know what to do and how big I should write it, but it's also really cool because I hope kids are excited by this."</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden will defend her NCAA 1500m outdoor title this year before lining up the Olympics.</p>
