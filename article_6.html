            <p>The Warriors season has hit a new low, after the team was hammered 60-6 by the Gold Coast this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Having already been beaten by the cellar dwellers at home on Anzac Day, the Titans completely outclassed the Warriors in Queensland, and marks easily the lowest point of Andrew Webster's tenure in charge of the side.</p>
        
            <p>Slumping to a 30-0 half-time deficit to the bottom-placed Titans, the result was assured before oranges.</p>
        
            <p>A quartet of tries for Alofiana Khan-Pereira helped his side to a commanding win for the Titans, and an embarrassing defeat for the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>Tries for Khan-Pereira, Beau Fermor, Chris Randall, Keenan Palasia and Sam Verrills all got over in the opening 40 to effectively end the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Just after the break with the Warriors looking set to finally break the Titans defence, Khan-Pereira plucked a Johnson pass out of the air and streaked away to score a sixth, summing things up for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Things continued to get worse for the Warriors, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck sin binned for a tip tackle.</p>
        
            <p>The Titans took immediate advantage to stretch their massive lead even further, Keano Kini strolling over.</p>
        
            <p>Former Warrior Kieran Foran helped drive the knife further in his old side, kicking ahead for halves partner Jayden Campbell to pounce.</p>
        
            <p>It took almost an hour, but the Warriors finally got on the board as Tohu Harris juggled a pass before offloading to Te Maire Martin.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Titans would hit 50 soon after, Khan-Pereira bagging his hat-trick before Kini's second saw the score hit 60.</p>
        
            <p>Khan-Pereira heaped more misery on in the final minute with a fourth.</p>
        
            <p>The win was just the fourth of the year for the Titans, while the Warriors concede their eighth and by far their worst loss.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors return home next weekend to take on the Broncos.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Titans 66 (Khan-Pereira 4, Kini 2, Fermor, Randall, Palasia, Verrills, Campbell, tries, Campbell 10 goals)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 6 (Martin, tries, Pompey, con)</p>
