            <p>Matthew Richardson has switched his international allegiance to Britain, days after the track cyclist won three Olympic medals for Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old won silver in the individual sprint and the keirin in Paris as well as bronze in the team sprint.</p>
        
            <p>Richardson was born in Maidstone, England and moved to Australia at the age of nine.</p>
        
            <p>"I have made the decision to pack up my entire life and move half way across the world to begin the next chapter in my cycling career. It is with a sense of excitement and renewal I announce I have joined the Great British Cycling Team," Richardson posted on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>"Switching nationality was a difficult decision, and not one I took lightly. It was a personal choice, made after careful consideration of my career and future... I deeply respect Australia and the Aus Cycling Team and it will always be a part of who I am."</p>
        
            <p>Jesse Korf, the AusCycling executive ceneral manager-performance, said the decision was disappointing.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that the desire to compete for a country one was born in can bring forth strong emotions," Korf said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We have many talented riders that now will see increased opportunity as we set our sights on LA 2028 as a stepping stone towards Brisbane 2032."</p>
