            <p>The Hurricanes have suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of the Brumbies in Canberra.</p>
        
            <p>Although both teams scored three tries apiece, it was the boot of Brumbies first-five Noah Lolesio that proved the difference in his side's 27-19 win.</p>
        
            <p>Without regular starting hooker Asafo Aumua due to injury, his replacement James O'Reilly was forced from the field early with concussion.</p>
        
            <p>This was a superb response from the Brumbies, who were battered by the Blues in Auckland last weekend - a timely reminder of their title credentials.</p>
        
            <p>Tamati Tua and Tom Wright in particular were sensational for the home side. Wright told Stan Sport the conditions allowed for entertaining footy, which suited them well.</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies captain Ryan Lonergan said it was a complete team performance and last week they had lacked intensity.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes skipper Brad Shields said the team had a poor start, which was really disappointing.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just a bit off tonight."</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies galloped out of the gates as a strong rolling maul came down just a metre short of the line, before Lolesio fired to the blindside and took a beautiful pass from Lonergan to score in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes made multiple early errors but would respond in rather sloppy fashion, as TJ Perenara shifted it to the right with an ugly bounce pass that found Xavier Numia, who rumbled over.</p>
        
            <p>Soon, the Brumbies struck straight back as Tua exploded through two tacklers and sprinted away for his side's second.</p>
        
            <p>They were in again moments later, thanks to some superb passing between backs and forwards, which freed up Sapsford on the left wing and he streaked away to score.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before halftime, the Canes managed to pull another one back following several pick-and-goes, with Numia crashing over for a double.</p>
        
            <p>Lolesio edged his side further ahead with two penalty goals, but the Hurricanes were not taking it lying down.</p>
        
            <p>A brilliant run from Ruben Love - after claiming a high ball - saw him break several defenders, before Barrett found himself unmarked on the wing for the try.</p>
        
            <p>They had plenty of opportunities to erase the deficit, but repeated mistakes ultimately cost them their first loss of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes will remain top of the table but the Blues could draw even with a bonus point win over the Reds later tonight.</p>
        
            <p>They return home to take on the Waratahs next week while the Brumbies will host the Drua.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies Lolesio, Sapsford, Tua, tries, Lolesio 3 cons, 2 pens)</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 19 (Numia 2, Barrett, tries, Cameron 2 cons)</p>
