            <p>Warriors utility Dylan Walker has been granted an early release on compassionate grounds to leave the club and return to Australia immediately.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old joined the Warriors on a three-year deal at the start of the 2023 NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>Australian media report that Walker, a premiership-winner who played two games for NSW in 2016, has signed with the Parramatta Eels.</p>

            <p>Warriors boss Cameron George said they didn't want Walker to leave, but were understood why he wanted to go.</p>
        
            <p>"We were keen for Dylan to stay until the end of the season but we appreciate why he needs to return to Sydney," George said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've really enjoyed having him at our club and he has given us tremendous service. He goes with our support and best wishes."</p>
        
            <p>Walker, who has played 232 NRL games, joined the Warriors after 124 appearances for Manly.</p>
        
            <p>He is former Dally M Centre of the Year but has played various positions in the forwards and backs.</p>
        
            <p>His 46th and final match for the Warriors was last Friday's 14-6 win over the Roosters at Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
