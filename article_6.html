            <p>In their 30th NRL season, will 2025 finally be the Warriors' year?</p>
        
            <p>Their path to glory has been laid out with the release of next season's draw.</p>
        
            <p>Kicking off with a historic clash in Las Vegas, the Warriors will also take their Anzac Day event to Christchurch for the first time, playing Newcastle in the round eight game at Apollo Projects Stadium on 25 April.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors chief executive Cameron George said the move was an easy one following the support the Garden City has shown in recent times.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw how much the fans from the city and surrounding areas got behind the Warriors for our trial against the Tigers and then our NRL match against the Raiders this year. The same happened again last month when the Kiwis played the Kangaroos."</p>
        
            <p>The match would be the second season running and just the third time in history that the Warriors will have staged their Anzac Day game in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors open their season playing a game in the United States for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>The Las Vegas clash with the Canberra Raiders at Allegiant Stadium on 1 March coincided with the return of the Warriors' NRLW side, which will have double headers with the NRL team four times next year.</p>
        
            <p>Another highlight was the confirmation four-times premiership-winning Penrith Panthers were set to make a rare trip to Mount Smart Stadium, their first in six years.</p>
