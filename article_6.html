            <p>New Zealand's Steven Alker carded a 9-under 63 to win the Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai in Ka'upulehu-Kona, Hawaii.</p>
        
            <p>It is his eighth win on the over fifties tour.</p>
        
            <p>Alker racked up seven birdies to go along with an eagle at the par-5 seventh to finish at 25-under 191 in the season-opening event.</p>
        
            <p>He finished four strokes ahead of Harrison Frazar, who logged a 65 in the third and final round.</p>
        
            <p>"I got it done on the putting green for sure. I made some nice putts," Alker said. "I knew (Steve) Stricker and Harrison were going to come at me, so just kept the pedal to the metal. I knew I had to be aggressive, stayed aggressive and just that mindset, just keep committing to my shots. Yeah, it worked out."</p>
        
            <p>Stricker, who won the eventi in 2023, shot a 6-under 66 to finish in third at 20-under 196.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have needed something pretty special to catch Steve, he played great," Stricker said. "Yeah, so it was -- I hit the ball solid. Didn't make some of the putts like I should have probably, but all in all it was a good start to the year, good week."</p>
        
            <p>Alker was able to start the season on a high note after winning the Charles Schwab Cup Championship last November. He believes the victory is going to serve him well moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"I took some really good downtime, I took a good three weeks off after Champions Cup. I had a nice week before coming out here and then the game just kind of, you know, built as the week went on," Alker said. "Having the family here and their support, and where we play, it's a great place to start the year."</p>
        
            <p>Alker's 63 on Saturday was good enough for low-round honors.</p>
        
            <p>Alker will play the New Zealand Open in Arrowtown next month.</p>
