            <p>The New Zealand Breakers coach Mody Maor has been fined $500 following critical comments he made about match officials following his sides' recent win over the Adelaide 36ers.</p>
        
            <p>Basketball Australia has ruled Maor's comments breached the ANBL's code of conduct.</p>
        
            <p>Maor was ejected from last week's game in Christchurch, which the Breakers won 96-83, for arguing with match officials about a the foul count which overwhelmingly favoured Adelaide.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time in Maor's professional coaching career that he'd been thrown out of a game and he had to spend the second half of the match in the locker room, with assistant Daniel Sokolovsky taking over the sideline coaching duties.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers currently sit in eighth spot in the ten team competition, with only Adelaide and Illawarra behind them.</p>
        
            <p>Their next match is against second placed Tasmania on Saturday in Auckland.</p>
