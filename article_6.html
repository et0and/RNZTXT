            <p>The Kiwis have confirmed a huge coup for Samoan Rugby League.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors superstar and former All Black Roger Tuivasa-Sheck has pledged his international playing future to the country, continuing trend of Pacific stars turning out for their home nations.</p>
        
            <p>Tuivasa-Sheck, who returned to league this year after a stint in union, has told Kiwis coach Stacey Jones he won't be available for the Kiwis upcoming internationals against Australia and Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>There was a seismic shift in international league in 2013 when Tonga secured players such as Jason Taumalolo, Michael Jennings and Andrew Fifita.</p>
        
            <p>Tonga games are now one of the hottest tickets in international league.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa had a similar influx of big names in Jarome Luai, Brian To'o and Stephen Crichton in 2022 which saw them go from being winless at the 2017 world cup to their first ever world cup final five years later.</p>
        
            <p>The class and experience of Tuivasa-Sheck will only add to the quality Samoa will boast come next year's world cup.</p>
        
            <p>He has played 20 tests for New Zealand, but not since he returned from his stint in union where he earned an All Black test cap.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Stacey Jones said he was hoping he would be available for selection, but certainly doesn't begrudge him for it.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had talks to Roger and he indicated when he came back to the game he wanted to play for Samoa, represent his family, which I respect. I said 'I would love you to be available for the Kiwis', but he had already made his decision when he came back to rugby league to represent Samoa, which I respect."</p>
        
            <p>The first chance for Tuivasa-Sheck to play for Samoa will come when they take on England in the UK on October 27.</p>
