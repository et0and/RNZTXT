            <p>Promoted pair Josh Lord and Harry Plummer will remain in the All Blacks squad for the Rugby Championship tour of South Africa as the injury struggles continue for Blues pair Patrick Tuipulotu and Stephen Perofeta.</p>
        
            <p>Lock Lord and utility back Plummer were called into the New Zealand squad as injury cover for the two home tests against Argentina this month, with Tuipulotu and Perofeta having both suffered calf injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Lord came off the bench in both Pumas tests, with the locking stocks particularly thin following a finger injury that sidelined captain Scott Barrett.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett has been declared fit for next week's test against the Springboks in Johannesburg, with the second match down for Cape Town a week later.</p>

            <p>All Blacks medical staff also cleared loose forward Luke Jacobson (hamstring) and prop Ethan de Groot (neck) for the tour despite both being unavailable for the 42-10 win over Argentina at Eden Park on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Blues back Plummer, who can cover first-five and fullback, is one of two uncapped players in the squad along with fullback Ruben Love.</p>
