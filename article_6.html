            <p>Analysis - If there was a set of football fans best prepared to never give up hope it might be those at Auckland FC. For nearly two decades, following the implosion of the New Zealand Knights, TƒÅmaki Makaurau sat as a desolate wilderness for professional football. The biggest city in the world without a professional football team.</p>
        
            <p>But fans in New Zealand's biggest city never gave up hope and this year that has been rewarded with a stellar start to life for Auckland FC. But they are not making it a comfortable ride for fans of the fledgling franchise.</p>
        
            <p>This week saw Auckland turn what might have been one point earned on the road to four, with goals in the final stages of stoppage time at both Adelaide United and Western Sydney Wanderers.</p>
        
            <p>In midweek, Logan Rogerson's close-range header came in the 99th minute - much to the chagrin of Adelaide boss Carl Veart. He wondered where the extra minutes of stoppage time came from, deliberately failing to recall the one minute apiece for celebrating Archie Goodwin's second goal and Ethan Cox's beleaguered free-kick delay.</p>
        
            <p>Rogerson's hero's contribution was timely, especially as it also allows him forgiveness and forgetfulness for a howler of a miss in the 1-0 win over Western Sydney at the weekend. On that occasion it was Neyder Moreno, the super sub, who scored in the 95th minute.</p>

            <p>Of course, this is not the first time Auckland have managed to grab something at the death in the A-League this season. They may as well kick Stephen Colbert off The Late Show because Auckland are redefining the term.</p>
        
            <p>Nando Pijnaker's last ditch winner against Sydney, Jake Brimmer's quickfire double in the first Kiwi Classico and Moreno-inspired late salvos against Newcastle and Melbourne City. If football matches were just 80 minutes long, Auckland would be 10 points fewer off this season, a chunky difference which would have them seventh in the table.</p>
        
            <p>But Aucklanders spent 18 years waiting for a successful professional unit in their city. Their patience for good things is iron tight and the Black Knights are obliging them with some thrilling late drama.</p>
        
            <p>It's a testament to the conditioning and self-belief of the players and coaching staff but also perhaps a reflection of the DNA of professional football in Auckland now. Good things come to those who wait, a famous beer ad once claimed. Auckland FC are certainly living by such a slogan.</p>
        
            <p>In other football news:</p>
        
            <p>The long wait for the Wellington Phoenix to return to Christchurch also came to an end this week but a drab 0-0 draw was not what Cantabrians had in mind. The biggest spot of contention was whether Kazuki Nagasawa should have earned a penalty but even Giancarlo Italiano agreed it would have been a harsh call.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood had a mixed week. New Zealand's star striker bagged himself a new contract at high-flying Nottingham Forest. However, he was brought crashing down to earth as Forest fell afoul of five-star Bounemouth.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix's A-League Women's side have been in great form of late but came unstuck against table rivals Central Coast Mariners, Tiana Fuller scoring the only goal of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester City survived an awful start to life in English football from newbie Abdukodir Khusanov, He gifted Chelsea the opener in their top-four battle but City fought back to win 3-1.</p>
