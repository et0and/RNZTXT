            <p>Young New Zealand jockey Kelsey Hannan is grateful to be alive after being thrown from her horse during a race in Adelaide at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old was riding Iva Dream at the Strathalbyn Cup, when the horse stumbled shortly after crossing the finish line, launching her head first into the turf.</p>
        
            <p>Hannan was put in an induced coma after the fall, but was released from hospital on Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>She has a fracture in her C1 vertebrae and faces a long recovery, having just returned to racing from a broken jaw.</p>
        
            <p>Still shaken following the fall, Hannan said she is thankful the injuries weren't more severe.</p>
        
            <p>"To have another setback. It almost feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth, but ultimately, it could have been a lot worse, and I could not have been here so I just have to be grateful that I am still here."</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old is adamant however, that she will race again.</p>
        
            <p>"It does happen, so it's something we just have to work around and use it as a bit of fuel to get back and get hungry for more wins, as long as it doesn't kill me, I'll always get back on."</p>
        
            <p>Hannan said she doesn't remember anything from the day of the accident and is now suffering significant pain in her back and neck.</p>
        
            <p>She anticipates another lengthy spell on the sidelines.</p>
        
            <p>"To start off with it's three months and then I suppose we see how we go from there."</p>
        
            <p>It was only October last year that Hannan, shortly after making the permanent move to Adelaide, broke her jaw when a horse she was riding bucked and headbutted her.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't remember much about that one either."</p>
        
            <p>Iva Dream was found to have some cut on her legs and is being treated by a vet.</p>
        
            <p>She believes it was a misstep by Iva Dream which caused the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"If you zoom in on the replay, she hasn't clubbed heels. It was her inside front leg which didn't come forward so she's tipped on an inside leg."</p>
        
            <p>Hannan said Iva Dream will also return to the track.</p>
        
            <p>"She has pulled up ok, she will take a bit of time to get herself right again and then I'm sure she will be back out and around."</p>
