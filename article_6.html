            <p>All Whites coach Darren Bazeley admits finding a balance between consistency and giving players an opportunity remains a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>The side is in Egypt for a FIFA series tournament which also involves the hosts, Croatia and Tunisia.</p>
        
            <p>Bazeley says there will be some changes to his side for Wednesday's third place play-off against Tunisia in Cairo.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand started the series without three key players, with Chris Wood, Joe Bell and Tim Payne all injured.</p>
        
            <p>For the game against Egypt - which the home side won 1-0 - Max Mata was named up front, Dane Ingham at right back and Max Crocombe in goal.</p>
        
            <p>Bazeley doesn't want to make too many changes as he wants goals and results.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a balance, - we're trying to get some consistency and the more we play together, the more we can build performances," Bazeley said in a pre-game media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"But also balancing that with opportunities for players that are in form.</p>
        
            <p>"We do need consistency [of selection] because we still don't play that many games."</p>
        
            <p>Bazelely has talked about an evolution that is needed to turn possession into more shots on goal.</p>
        
            <p>"We've really worked on becoming a possession-based team, now we're talking about the trigger of turning possession into attacking play and actually starting to hurt teams."</p>

            <p>That is made difficult without the likes of Nottingham Forest star Chris Wood. However midfielder Marko Stamenic is sure it will happen.</p>
        
            <p>"Over time this will come. We're still a very young and enthusiastic team, so we're all willing to improve.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at it over the last couple of years there has been a big improvement in the way we play. Now we're at that next stage of converting that possession into goals."</p>
        
            <p>Tunisia is ranked 41 in the world, 62 places above New Zealand. But the All Whites coach isn't fazed.</p>
        
            <p>"We're at a stage where we can compete with teams ranked in the 30s, but we were disappointed that they didn't get a win [against Egypt]," Bazeley said.</p>
        
            <p>"So this team is ready to take that next step and start turning performances into results."</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off is at 9am NZ time on Wednesday.</p>
