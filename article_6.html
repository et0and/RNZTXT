            <p>Auckland Hearts pulled off a spectacular final-ball win over Canterbury Magicians on Sunday to lodge their first victory of the women's T20 Super Smash season.</p>
        
            <p>Needing to score two runs off the final ball bowled by Australian international Sophie Molineux, Molly Penfold did exactly that, running two off a shot to long-on to carry the Hearts to a four-wicket victory that looked unlikely as their run chase faltered early on at Christchurch's Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>The home side posted 152-7 from 20 overs, built on 33 off 27 balls from Pakistan international Fatima Sana, followed by a blazing 45 off 28 from allrounder Izzy Sharp.</p>
        
            <p>Seamer Skye Bowden maintained her prolific wicket-taking form this season for Auckland, although her figures of 3-36 off four overs were expensive.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors' chase to 153-6 was built around a brilliant 71 off 53 balls from White Fern Maddy Green, who struggled to find a partner to stick around.</p>
        
            <p>The run rate kept climbing, to the point they needed 57 runs off the last four overs, and still needed 20 off the last eight balls when Green was run out off the penultimate over.</p>
        
            <p>Needing 18 off the final over, Anna Browning (16 not out off 10) struck two fours before Penfold completed a win that still leaves Auckland last in the standings, having registered three losses and been affected by two abandoned results from their five previous games.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury remain in fourth place with a two win-three loss record.</p>
