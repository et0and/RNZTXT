            <p>Former All Blacks prop Jeffery Toomaga-Allen is set to make an injury-delayed return to Super Rugby for a Queensland Reds side that he said will not "roll over" against New Zealand teams.</p>
        
            <p>The one-test forward missed the opening two matches with a knee niggle but is set to run off the bench against the undefeated Chiefs for his first Super clash since leaving the Hurricanes in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Though New Zealand has dominated the Australasian competition for years, the unfancied Reds gave the Chiefs a huge scare in last year's quarter-finals in Hamilton before falling 29-20 to the eventual finalists.</p>
        
            <p>Under new coach Les Kiss, the Reds' host the Chiefs rematch at Lang Park, where 33-year-old Toomaga-Allen is keen to get stuck in.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the years you could say teams have rolled over against Kiwi teams, but we're not that team," said Toomaga-Allen, who crossed to the Reds from Irish side Ulster after a few seasons with England's Wasps.</p>
        
            <p>"They bleed, bruise, fatigue like us - it's anyone's game.</p>
        
            <p>"And going to dark places when you need to ... that's what I'm bringing to the team."</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs spent the off-season smarting over their home defeat to the Crusaders in last year's decider but beat the champions in the grand final re-match in round one before trouncing Australia's strongest side, the ACT Brumbies, last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Upset 37-24 by the New South Wales Waratahs, the Crusaders have had their worst start in 10 years under new coach Rob Penney and face a tough trip to Lautoka to take on Fijian Drua on Saturday.</p>

            <p>The Hurricanes will test their midfield depth in the absence of suspended All Black Jordie Barrett when they meet the Blues at home in a battle of undefeated sides.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes will welcome the long-awaited return of one of their favourite sons should scrumhalf TJ Perenara take the field.</p>
        
            <p>Named on the bench, Perenara has not played competitive rugby since rupturing his Achilles in a test against England at the end of 2022 but is determined to regain a spot in the All Blacks under new coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>His battle with the Hurricanes' incument halfback Cam Roigard will be closely watched through the season as both look to succeed Aaron Smith as the next All Blacks number nine.</p>
        
            <p>Buoyant after toppling the Crusaders, the Waratahs will look to defeat another New Zealand side when they host the Otago Highlanders on Friday after Moana Pasifika open the round against the Melbourne Rebels at Hamilton's Waikato Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies scrumhalf Nic White will return to Canberra to take on his old Brumbies side on Saturday as Western Force search for a first win and the hosts look to rebound from their 46-12 demolition by the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Loose forward Michael Wells said Force would look to support their marquee halfback from a cold reception at Canberra Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Whitey is naturally a bit of a target for anyone because he's a mouthy halfback so naturally people will go after him whether they're on the field or in the stands," he added.</p>
