            <p>Joshua Zirkzee scored the winning penalty for 10-man Manchester United against Arsenal after their hectic FA Cup third round tie finished 1-1 after extra time at the Emirates Stadium on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal's Kai Havertz was the only one of the first four penalty takers to miss, denied by a brilliant stop from Altay Bayindir, before Zirkzee - booed off in a defeat by Newcastle United last month - stepped up to win the shootout 5-3.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to help this great team," second-choice goalkeeper Bayindir told the BBC. "I want to make everyone happy for this great club ... if you are not playing it doesn't matter.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to be ready every minute, every second - if you are a Man Utd player you have to be ready always."</p>
        
            <p>After an underwhelming first half, United took the lead in the 52nd minute through Bruno Fernandes' curling effort from just inside the box after a great run by Alejandro Garnacho.</p>
        
            <p>The game turned on its head 10 minutes later though, as United's Diogo Dalot - already booked for a wild challenge on Myles Lewis-Skelly - received a second yellow card for a reckless tackle on Mikel Merino.</p>
        
            <p>Two minutes later, Bayindir's poor attempted punch fell at the feet of Gabriel, whose shot took a wicked deflection off Matthijs de Ligt and in to put the Gunners in charge of the tie.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal could have completed the comeback when they were awarded a questionable penalty after Havertz went down under minimal contact from Harry Maguire.</p>
        
            <p>But, after a brief melee which saw Maguire, Havertz and Gabriel booked, Bayindir produced a superb save from Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard in the 72nd minute.</p>
        
            <p>The Gunners sought to press their numerical advantage as United sat deeper and deeper, with substitute Declan Rice heading straight at Bayindir when unmarked.</p>
        
            <p>Havertz then spurned a golden chance late on, slicing horribly wide from close range, and Bayindir again saved from Rice at the death to ensure another 30 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>De Ligt produced two moments of brilliance in extra time, blocking a Rice shot and then preventing Leandro Trossard from pulling the trigger from two yards out as United clung on.</p>
        
            <p>United almost nicked an unlikely winner in the second period of extra time, with David Raya just pushing Zirkzee's goalbound shot wide.</p>
        
            <p>But defending champions United, who needed penalties in last year's semi-final against Coventry City en route to their 13th FA Cup triumph, prevailed in the shootout.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a difficult start for new boss Ruben Amorim, who suffered his first defeat as United coach at Arsenal in the league last month, Sunday's victory suggests United may have turned a corner.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially in the first half, we played well, better than in the first game," Amorim told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>They will play Leicester City, managed by former United great Ruud van Nistelrooy, at home in the fourth round.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, was left to rue his side's inability to score.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't get what we deserved," he told reporters.</p>
