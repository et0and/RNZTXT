            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead says all-rounder Rachin Ravindra and pace bowler William O'Rourke will be brimming with confidence after the pair played crucial roles in the team's first test victory in India for 36 years.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand withstood some hostile bowling in the series opener in Bengaluru on Sunday to successfully chase down 107 for an eight-wicket win, handing the hosts only their fifth home defeat in the longest format in 11 years.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra, who has roots in the south Indian city, scored 134 and 39 not out in the game. Pacer O'Rourke bagged seven wickets, including four in the first innings to help dismiss India for their lowest home score of 46.</p>
        
            <p>"Any time you play big roles in the team, you walk away with confidence. Rachin has made every post a winner in all the games he has played in and he was at his very best in this game," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"He played beautifully in both innings and probably put us in a position that we could win.</p>
        
            <p>"O'Rourke as well ... first time in India, many people have come over here and never had that win so it's lovely for him to experience that early on in his career."</p>

            <p>Stead conceded there was an element of fortune involved after the pitch improved for batting following India's dismal first-innings display.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever you bowl a team out for a score like that (46), you put yourself in a strong position," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"We were lucky that the ball nipped around early and the pitch flattened out pretty quickly after that.</p>
        
            <p>"All our seamers - Matt Henry, Tim Southee and O'Rourke - were outstanding and certainly put India on notice. To back it up with some fine batting after that was important."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will eye a series victory when the teams head to Pune for the second of three tests starting on Thursday.</p>
