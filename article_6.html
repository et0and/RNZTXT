            <p>Netball New Zealand and Sky TV have agreed on a one-year extension to their existing broadcasting partnership, while the 2025 ANZ Premiership will be reduced to a new two-round format.</p>
        
            <p>There will be 30-round robin matches and two finals over a 12-week period. Under the current three-round format, 45 matches and two finals are played over a 17-week period.</p>
        
            <p>The national body said the change was designed to ensure an engaging and exciting competition in response to teams' and audience feedback.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, RNZ reported Netball NZ had already inked a significantly reduced broadcast deal with Sky Sport for another year.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ also reported the one-year deal was to effectively buy the national body some time as it explored joining Australia's Super Netball competition from 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Netball NZ has also entered into a further 12-month partnership with TVNZ, for free-to-air coverage of ANZ Premiership Saturday matches, which was a new initiative this year.</p>
        
            <p>Further partnership conversations for 2026 and beyond were due to begin later this year, Netball NZ said.</p>

            <p>"We've had a really positive response to the Saturday matches already, and we're looking forward to bringing netball into more homes across the motu in 2025. Allowing Kiwis to see their sporting heroes play is something we're hugely passionate about," O'Donnell said.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ NZ head of sponsorship Sarah Rogan said it was excited by the new opportunities for the 2025 ANZ Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>"The new two-round format will undoubtedly provide a heightened level of competition and intensity across the 12-week long season. It can only be good for the fans and the players and we are looking forward to being part of the action," Rogan said.</p>
