            <p>Alinghi and American Magic have staved off elimination in the America's Cup challenger series.</p>
        
            <p>In a day of light winds when their opponents didn't finish, Alinghi beat Britannia and American Magic beat Luna Rossa.</p>
        
            <p>Alinghi and Britannia both fell of their foils in their race with the Swiss just managing to beat the 45 minute race time limit to take the point.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything can happen in the next few days, it doesn't look so great for the breeze, so we've got one win, still in the game and we keep pushing," Arnaud Psarofaghis, skipper of Alinghi said.</p>
        
            <p>In the other semi-final the Italians grabbed the early lead before the Americans overtook them on a split tact on the second leg.</p>
        
            <p>American Magic were then able to stay on their foils, while Luna Rossa was unable to gain flight after a slow turn on the fourth leg.</p>
        
            <p>American helmsman Tom Slingsby was obvious happy with the day.</p>
        
            <p>"The boat felt really good. We have been making some changes, and in those light conditions that were kind of a weak spot for us a week ago, the boat feels as good as it ever has in those conditions. That's exciting and we are going to try to be faster again on Wednesday."</p>
        
            <p>Luna Rossa and Britannia lead their respective best of nine semi-final series' 4-1.</p>
