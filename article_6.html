            <p>The BBC has come under fire for hiring Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios as a commentator for the upcoming Wimbledon tournament due to his history of violence against women.</p>
        
            <p>Kyrgios pleaded guilty to assaulting former girlfriend Chiara Passari in 2021, however those charges were dismissed.</p>
        
            <p>Kyrgios is also known to support Andrew Tate, who is currently facing rape and human trafficking charges in Romania.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC has confirmed Kyrgios will join their team of commentators under the assumption he will not be playing due to injury.</p>
        
            <p>British MP Caroline Nokes told the Telegraph the BBC should hang their head in shame over the appointment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a disgrace and shows the utter contempt our national broadcaster has towards women," she told the publication.</p>
        
            <p>"Not content with consistently underpaying their own female staff and forcing out women once they hit a certain age, they now bring a man who admitted assaulting a woman on board for Wimbledon."</p>
        
            <p>A number of women's advocates have expressed their distaste for the appointment.</p>

            <p>Jamie Klingler, co-founder of UK social justice group Reclaim These Streets, told RN Breakfast there were millions of better-qualified people to commentate Wimbledon.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead of doing that, they're going for lowest common denominators for what they consider the newest bad boy of tennis," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, if the bad boy of tennis has to include beating up women, I don't want them on my screens, I don't want them in the country."</p>
        
            <p>She criticised the taxpayer-funded channel for "excusing sexism" by allowing Kyrgios on the show.</p>
        
            <p>"We seem to have a wide gap between treating violence against women the way it should be treated when a man can hit either a ball or a musical note," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Klingler said she and other social groups had reached out to the BBC for comment. The broadcaster said they would respond in 12 days.</p>
        
            <p>BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore announced Kyrgios would be joining a line-up including John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pat Cash, Tim Henman, Tracy Austin, Annabel Croft and Johanna Konta.</p>
        
            <p>"And also joining the line-up this year will be 2021 champion Ash Barty and, if he's not playing, the 2022 - Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios - anything could happen there," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kyrgios recently did commentary at the Australian Open for ESPN.</p>
