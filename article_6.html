            <p>The Black Caps one day skipper and wicketkeeper Tom Latham has been ruled out of the upcoming three match series against Pakistan with a fractured right hand.</p>
        
            <p>Latham suffered the injury while batting in the nets at training with an X-ray revealing the fracture which will require a cast and at least four weeks rest and rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Bracewell, who led the side in the T20 series win over Pakistan, will take over the captaincy duties while Mitch Hay will take over the gloves.</p>

            <p>Canterbury batter Henry Nicholls will replace Latham in the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls, who has played 78 one day internationals, played his last international against Sri Lanka in November but has missed much of the season with a calf injury. He has returned this month with five 50-plus scores in his six domestic innings.</p>
        
            <p>Opener Will Young will play just the first game of the series in Napier on Saturday, missing games two and three of the three match series to be with his wife ahead of the birth of their first child.</p>
        
            <p>He will then be replaced in the squad by 23-year-old Canterbury batsman Rhys Mariu who's earned his maiden call-up.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead is unperturbed by the comings and goings.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously disappointing to lose Tom as captain on the eve of the series and we wish him a speedy recovery. The side is in safe hands with Michael who's done a great job through the T20I series," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had to be flexible this tour with numerous players unavailable for different reasons. What it does do is offer opportunities to others players and it's nice to introduce Rhys into the environment for the first time, as well as welcome back Henry."</p>
