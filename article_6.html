        <h2>'A big arm wrestle' - Warriors reflect on tough win over Knights</h2>
        <p>
Chanel Harris-Tavita played 70 minutes off the bench while Kurt Capewell made almost 50 tackles. Video

            <p>"I'd be happier if I made less," joked Kurt Capewell after being reminded that he had made 48 tackles in the Warriors' hard fought 20-12 win over the Knights at Go Media Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The second rower was one of the standout performers in a game that was dominated by defence, although he came within inches of scoring what would have been a memorable try.</p>
        
            <p>"It was one of those games, they completed high and they played really well. We were lucky to get away with a few things, but it was a good effort out there from our boys," Capewell said.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors did it the hard way against an extremely physical Knights side, in front of another sold out crowd. For the second game in a row they needed to hold onto an eight point lead against a fast-finishing opposition, something that utility Chanel Harris-Tavita said the Warriors were proud of.</p>
        
            <p>"We're learning how to close out these games," Harris-Tavita said.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, if we go to the next level, we should be able to put on a few more points at the end of the game. Just so we're not in that position that we have to hold that lead."</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita was thrust into the match after only 10 minutes, when Luke Metcalf was stretchered from the field after suffering a serious leg injury. It was easily the longest stint Harris-Tavita has had in first grade since returning to the club after a year off, and he marked it with a crucial try in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing that utility off the bench, you don't know when you're going on. Last two weeks I came on when the game was in the balance, this time I was on after 10 minutes. For me it's just about fixing what I can control and building combinations."</p>

            <p>Coach Andrew Webster praised both sides after the bruising encounter.</p>
        
            <p>"I just thought it was a tough game, it was a big arm wrestle in the second half and a lot of sore bodies. It was just a grind."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said Metcalf's injury could be a fracture, which would potentially mean that Harris-Tavita will stay at half for the time being. Another scenario could see Te Maire Martin return to the starting line up with Harris-Tavita retaining his useful utility role off the interchange bench.</p>
        
            <p>However, Webster did not want to be drawn on any talk of Roger Tuivasa-Sheck remaining at fullback despite an impressive display. The former All Black topped the run metres count for the Warriors with 283 and made a crucial defensive play near fulltime that denied the Knights a try.</p>
        
            <p>"Charnze (Niccol-Klokstad) is playing, definitely playing," Webster said when asked about the number one jersey's status once last season's fullback returns from injury.</p>
        
            <p>"The things only Roger can be good at, he was good at tonightâ€¦everyone thinks fullback is about highlight plays, it's about where you put yourself defensively, how thick you make the defensive line look."</p>
        
            <p>The win moves the Warriors up to ninth on the NRL ladder, they head to Sydney to play the Rabbitohs next Saturday afternoon.</p>
