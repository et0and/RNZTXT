Following a historic loss to Uruguay, the All Black Sevens can aim to finish only as high as ninth in Perth.

            <p>It's not been a very happy new year for the All Black Sevens, whose stock continues to plummet.</p>
        
            <p>Following a historic loss to Uruguay on day one, the damage was too much for the All Blacks who were eliminated from quarter-final contention in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>With a sixth-placed finish in Cape Town late last year, hopes of a revival have been quickly quashed.</p>
        
            <p>After the 17-12 loss to the South Americans, New Zealand bounced back with a 29-14 win over Kenya, leaving them in a must-win showdown against old rivals Fiji in their final pool match.</p>
        
            <p>Looking sharp early on, the Fijians swooped on a stray pass by the Kiwis who were hot on attack, Iowane Teba streaking away to score under the sticks.</p>
        
            <p>One of the few veterans remaining for New Zealand, Andrew Knewstubb struck back to make it 7-5, but it would be the last time the All Blacks crossed the white line.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji ran riot to register a 33-5 win and progress, leaving New Zealand needing other results to go their way, which they didn't.</p>
        
            <p>The final try summed up New Zealand's woes as Terio Veilawa steamrolled some feeble defence and swan-dived over in front of his adoring fans.</p>
        
            <p>Both Fiji and Uruguay advance to the final eight alongside Spain, Argentina, Great Britain, South Africa, France and hosts Australia.</p>
