            <p>The All Blacks have confirmed that Ardie Savea will captain the side, with Scott Barrett ruled out for both tests against Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>Blues first five Harry Plummer has also been added to the squad after an injury to Stephen Perofeta.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett injured a finger during the All Blacks 47-5 win against Fiji in San Diego, which required a surgical treatment after his return to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant coach Jason Ryan made the changes public on Monday at the team's base at the NZCIS campus in Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said that the All Blacks have "definitely got to build up from where we left off pretty quickly" after three wins to start the season.</p>
        
            <p>"Argentina bring a different intensity to the first three tests that we had…it should be a good contest, they've been playing really well," Ryan said of Pumas, who split a series 1-1 with France and demolished neighbours Uruguay in their three tests so far in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they've always been a passionate side, they play with energy and momentum. (Matias) Kremer and (Pablo) Matera are big around the breakdown."</p>

            <p>Ryan said that the focus now the squad had reassembled for the Rugby Championship was to adapt to challenge that the Pumas, Springboks and Wallabies would pose.</p>
        
            <p>"You've always got to be evolving your game, week to week. We're always trying to tweak things."</p>
        
            <p>As for what the biggest work on was after the two English victories, Ryan pointed to the breakdown.</p>
        
            <p>"We learned a lot around our carry and clean game. We were really accurate around our decision-making, we're looking forward to building off our scrum and set piece.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some good lads who made contributions in our loosies, our locks are a competitive area…yeah I think we've got a lot of confidence in everyone. It makes selection meetings a bit tastier."</p>
