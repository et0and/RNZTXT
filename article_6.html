A run of dominant results over the weekend leaves no doubt where the power lies in rugby right now, writes Jamie Wall.

            <p>Analysis - They say there's a fine line between success and failure. There was a literal one if you're talking about rugby results over the weekend: the equator, because everything went the way of teams south of it.</p>
        
            <p>While obviously the big attention was on the All Blacks' 23-13 win over Ireland, the big one of the weekend was a resurgent Wallaby effort to beat England in thrilling circumstances at Twickenham. The Springboks' 32-15 victory over Scotland was the most predictable, but Argentina and Fiji rounded off a dominant weekend with wins over Italy and Wales.</p>

            <p>It's a stretch to say this is some sort of power shift, given three out of the last World Cup's semi-finalists were southern hemisphere teams - also that the north has only ever won one trophy ever. But this was a very big reminder of a few things.</p>
        
            <p>Firstly, rumours of an All Black demise have been answered yet again by a redemptive performance. Secondly, it's now very clear that perception of the Springboks being a team that only peaks for World Cups is out of date. Add in that the Pumas are in one of the best periods of their history - they have also beaten the All Blacks and Springboks this season - and that Fiji can still play like the team we all know they are with only 13 players on the field.</p>
        
            <p>Even the second tier of rugby got the same treatment. Georgia, long touted as the potential extra entrant into the Six Nations, were comfortably beaten 33-13 by the All Blacks XV on Monday morning.</p>

            <p>So, what happens next weekend? The All Blacks head to Paris to take on France, while it doesn't get any easier for England with a visit from the Boks. Hilariously, after all the tribulations they've been through in the last two seasons, the Wallabies are suddenly able to consider resting players against a wretched Welsh team that's suffered 10 straight defeats.</p>
        
            <p>Arguably the most intriguing clash, Pumas also head to Dublin where they will most likely win easily if Ireland play as badly as they did against the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>However, that alone does take some of the gloss off what the All Blacks have achieved so far on this tour. Scott Robertson will be under no illusion at all that the Irish were horrible, while the win the weekend before was once again aided by an English side that made all the wrong decisions at the most crucial part of the test. Ideally, the All Blacks would've punished Ireland with more than one try, but at least Will Jordan's effort came at the exact moment it was needed.</p>
        
            <p>France is a different proposition, having benefited from an easy warm up win over Japan and therefore being the only Six Nations team not to lose over the weekend. The scoreline and way the game unfolded was strikingly similar to the All Blacks' win over Japan three weeks ago, but Eddie Jones' side is so poor right now it's hard to really take anything of value out of either test.</p>
        
            <p>There will be an interesting team selection this weekend, with Sam Cane's deep cut on his head maybe preventing him from attempting a redemption act at the same Stade de France field he was sent from in last year's World Cup final. Will this mean a switch for Ardie Savea to openside and Wallace Sititi to number eight? Or perhaps a promotion for Peter Lakai?</p>
        
            <p>With all due respect to Italy, who admittedly don't really deserve any, this one stands as the final big one for the All Blacks in Robertson's first season in charge.</p>
