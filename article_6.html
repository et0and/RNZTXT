            <p>The Hurricanes Poua have been dealt a hefty blow ahead of next year's Super Rugby Aupiki competition with World Cup winning Black Ferns winger Ayesha Leti-l'iga ruled out of the entire season with a serious knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>Ngatai Walker, who is in charge while regular head coach Victoria Grant is away on maternity leave, said losing Leti-l'iga is disappointing.</p>
        
            <p>"Ayesha is one of the most powerful wingers in world rugby so she will be a big loss to our squad. Everyone here at the Poua wishes her all the best in her recovery and looks forward to her playing a big part in the future when she returns."</p>

            <p>The Poua will also be without the services of Black Ferns World Cup winning prop Krystal Murray and 2022 Black Ferns loose forward Kaipo Olsen-Baker, with Murray moving to the Chiefs Manawa for next season, and Olsen-Baker joining Matatū.</p>
        
            <p>Walker has named a squad with 13 new players including current Black Ferns Layla Sae and Iritana Hohaia who were involved in the recent WXV1 tournament.</p>
        
            <p>One more contracted player is yet to be announced in the squad of 30.</p>
        
            <p>Former Black Ferns prop Leilani Perese returns to the Poua after spending time away from the game to be a mum.</p>
        
            <p>Super Rugby Aupiki kicks off on 2 March with the full draw to be announced next week.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa have made the most notable gains, with the return of Ruby Tui and Chelsea Semple, while Black Ferns Ariana Bayler from the Blues, Krystal Murray from the Hurricanes and Grace Steinmetz and Renee Holmes from Matatū all join their ranks.</p>

            <p>International players Seina Saito (Japan) and Bitila Tawake (Fiji) are two of six rookies that will make their debuts for the Manawa, who were beaten finalists last season.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa head coach Crystal Kaua believes they have a side capable of winning the title.</p>
        
            <p>"We have selected a team that by nature plays to our DNA - brutal and beautiful. Players that love the dark spaces, are decisive, instinctive and wanting to play what's in front.</p>
        
            <p>"Every player and staff member brings their unique piece to our team puzzle. There will be no lack of edge, and weekly selection is going to be tough."</p>
        
            <p>Following playing breaks to have their children, former Black Fern and Black Fern Sevens star Chelsea Semple and Black Fern XV representative Mia Anderson are set to run out in Chiefs colours again this coming season.</p>
        
            <p>Matatū</p>
        
            <p>Defending champions Matatū will again be captained by Black Fern Alana Bremner.</p>
        
            <p>They have managed to retain the majority of the title-winning squad from last season, with senior players and playmakers set to line up alongside eight new signings and one returner.</p>

            <p>Maia Joseph joins the squad from Otago and played for the Black Ferns XV in September.</p>
        
            <p>Other new recruits for Matatū who also played for Black Ferns XV include Laura Bayfield and Holly Wratt-Groeneweg.</p>
        
            <p>Stacey Niao and Winnie Palamo join from Canterbury, Tegan Hollows joins from Otago and Fiaali'i Solomona joins from Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>2022 Black Ferns loose forward Kaipo Olsen-Baker has plied her trade with Hurricanes Poua until now, but has made the move south to challenge herself in a new environment.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Liv McGoverne has returned from a stellar season with the Exeter Chiefs in the Premier 15s competition in England, alongside another Exeter Chiefs teammate and Matatū recruit, Charlotte Woodman.</p>
        
            <p>McGoverne was a foundational member of Matatū in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Matatū head coach Whitney Hansen said the squad was a mix of fresh talent and experience.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a squad to be excited about, we have really great depth across all positions, which is reflective of the great work being done in Otago, Canterbury and Tasman and the connections and pathways growing across these spaces.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a large number of returning players who are all phenomenal athletes, have great connections and will be great role models for the new talent coming through. Most importantly this is a squad of athletes all committed to finding out how great they can be and great we can become as a team" Hansen said.</p>
        
            <p>Blues women</p>
        
            <p>Former Black Ferns Sevens representative, Niall Williams-Guthrie, joins the the Blues as part of the 30-player squad for the upcoming Super Rugby Aupiki season.</p>
        
            <p>Williams-Guthrie had a decorated career with the Black Ferns Sevens and comes fresh off an NRLW season with the Gold Coast Titans.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Aldora Itunu and back Daynah Nankivell are back with the team after missing the 2023 season.</p>
        
            <p>Itunu returns to the side after taking time off to give birth to her first child while Nankivell is back after a stint playing Sevens in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Itunu, who comes off the back of a successful Farah Palmer Cup campaign with Auckland, said the chance to return to rugby after giving birth is something she is proud of.</p>
        
            <p>"It's special and rewarding to be back into rugby and back with the nib Blues," said Itunu.</p>
        
            <p>"Your body goes through a lot when you're carrying a little human, but to be able to play again and have my son there watching is a dream come true!"</p>
        
            <p>"I'm grateful to the Blues for their support in this area, it's given me a new perspective on life and I'm looking forward to linking up with the girls and getting stuck into this Aupiki campaign."</p>
        
            <p>The majority of the Blues squad returns from the 2023 campaign, with eight new faces.</p>
