        <p>
Mutombo was selected as an NBA All-Star eight times, using his tremendous 2.1m frame to become one of the league's most fearsome shot-blockers.

            <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo has died at the age of 58 from brain cancer, the NBA said.</p>
        
            <p>Beloved by fans, the Congolese centre was selected as an NBA All-Star eight times, using his tremendous, seven-foot, two-inch (2.1m) frame to become one of the league's most fearsome shot-blockers and earn defensive player of the year honours four times.</p>
        
            <p>"Dikembe Mutombo was simply larger than life. On the court, he was one of the greatest shot blockers and defensive players in the history of the NBA. Off the floor, he poured his heart and soul into helping others," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Mutombo's gregarious personality - with a trademark finger-wag celebration - made him a fan favourite as he played 18 seasons with six different teams in the league. He reached the NBA Finals twice.</p>
        
            <p>Mutombo finished with 3289 blocked shots by the time he retired in 2009, second in league history only to Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon. Mutombo was named to the Hall of Fame in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>An eight-time All-Star and an NBA high-tying four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Mutombo averaged 9.8 points and 10.3 rebounds in 1196 career games (997 starts) with the Denver Nuggets, Atlanta Hawks, Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers, then-New Jersey Nets and New York Knicks.</p>
        
            <p>His No. 55 is retired by both the Nuggets and Hawks.</p>
        
            <p>After retiring in 2009, he became NBA's first global ambassador and helped promote the sport in Africa.</p>
        
            <p>"He loved what the game of basketball could do to make a positive impact on communities, especially in his native Democratic Republic of the Congo and across the continent of Africa," Silver said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was always accessible at NBA events over the years with his infectious smile, deep booming voice and signature finger wag that endeared him to basketball fans of every generation."</p>
