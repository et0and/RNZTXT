            <p>There is no fear of a power struggle with the Warriors as their co-captains get set to lead their side in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster has appointed both James Fisher-Harris and Mitch Barnett to lead the Warriors this season in the wake of incumbent Tohu Harris' forced retirement.</p>
        
            <p>Not initially planning to name two skippers, Webster said the two props presented as an obvious answer.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like Barney would be our captain when Tohu retired, and we never wanted 'Fish' to come here and have that responsibility, we just wanted him to play really good footy, but he hit the ground running straight away with his leadership and the way they bounced off each other, they naturally drove our standards."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Kiwi international and State of Origin rep complemented each other well.</p>
        
            <p>"They are yin and yang off the field. On the field they are both hard nosed but off it the dynamic of their relationship is yin and yang, but a good yin and yang, it's a powerful combination."</p>
        
            <p>Webster had no concerns of philosophical or tactical clashes between the pair, and they would share the duties of captain.</p>
        
            <p>"One week someone will do the toss, one week someone will do the press conference. Both could do everything each week if they have to but they don't have to, organically there are natural roles that have already developed."</p>
        
            <p>The duo also have the support of the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Kurt Capewell said the two captains had already instilled a strong work ethic.</p>
        
            <p>"They work really well together, with Fish, he's really lifted the intensity and last year Barney put the club on his shoulders and held down the fort. There are no more deserving players than those two."</p>
        
            <p>Capewell said Fisher-Harris, a four-time premiership winner, was just as grounded as he was prior to his unprecedented success with Penrith.</p>
        
            <p>"He very rarely misses a rep and he does it 100 percent."</p>
        
            <p>However, he also remains a foreboding physical presence.</p>
        
            <p>"If you run at him at training you know you're going to get hit. He's got the hard edge for sure."</p>
        
            <p>Co-captains the new norm?</p>
