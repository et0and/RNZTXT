            <p>Blues number eight Hoskins Sotutu has been suspended for three weeks after being sent off for a dangerous tackle in the win over the Hurricanes at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The tackle on his Hurricanes opposite Peter Lakai occurred late in the match and meant the Blues finished the match, which was their first win of the season, with 14 players.</p>
        
            <p>The three game ban means the Blues will be without Sotutu for some crucial upcoming games.</p>
        
            <p>They play the Brumbies this weeks in Auckand and then away to the Chiefs in Hamilton and then host the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>He could however be back for the Crusaders game if he takes part in the a coaching intervention programme as a substitute for the third game.</p>
        
            <p>The Super Rugby Judiciary ruled the foul play was a mid-range offence with a starting point of six weeks suspension but with Sotutu accepting the charge and his previous disciplinary, a 50 percent reduction was applied.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues could also be without loose forward Dalton Papali'i who was forced from the field during the game with a head knock.</p>
