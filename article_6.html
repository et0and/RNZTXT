            <p>The Black Ferns did it easy in the sevens but for mountainbiker Sam Gaze it wasn't "the day of redemption" he had hoped for.</p>
        
            <p>As New Zealand still seeks a place on the medal table [(https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/olympics-2024/523562/paris-2024-how-unusual-is-new-zealand-s-lack-of-olympic-medals we're always slow starters)] the Black Ferns blew away China in a nine-try blitz in their quarterfinal mismatch.</p>
        
            <p>However, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Gaze, who has suffered mental health problems, was left heartbroken despite a creditable sixth place finish in the mountain biking final.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather said she was pleased with her efforts which saw her finish seventh in the 200m freestyle final.</p>
        
            <p>The glory days of Blyth Tait and Sir Mark Todd in eventing seem to be a distant memory as the Kiwis finished eighth in the event.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at how photographers captured some of the action.</p>
