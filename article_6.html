        <h2>Why Beyoncé convinced tennis star Naomi Osaka to jump off the Sky Tower</h2>
        <p>
Top seed Madison Keys and star attraction Naomi Osaka are eager to take the court in the first round of this year's ASB Classic.
</p>
        
            <p>Top seed Madison Keys and Naomi Osaka are keen to get on the court at Stanley Street and let their talent do the talking. Both are big attractions for this year's edition of the ASB Classic women's singles, which starts on Monday, with Osaka in particular a fascinating story given her career trajectory to this point.</p>
        
            <p>The four-time Grand Slam winner almost walked away from the sport in 2021, after becoming one of the most marketable athletes in the world. Osaka also became a mother last year and said daughter has given her a new perspective on life and tennis.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really fun, I would call it a constant journey. I think she teaches me a lot about myself, and I feel like we're going on an adventure together," she said on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Osaka credits time with her family as a main reason for restarting her career, one which has taken her to a world number one ranking in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"Having my daughter gave me the space to realise I have a deep love for tennis, and I'd love to see where that could go.</p>

            <p>"I'm really competitive. I love to win matches and play against the best players in the world, see what I can achieve. But I think a year or two back there was a time when I didn't know whether I wanted to play again…but it was such a fast whirlwind, I didn't have time to breathe."</p>
        
            <p>Osaka has made the most of her time in Auckland so far, doing the Sky Tower bungee jump in between training sessions.</p>
        
            <p>"Initially I was just going to watch my friend, but I saw Beyoncé did it a couple of years ago. I'm actually really scared of heights but in my head I was thinking 'if Beyoncé did it, it must be really safe'. I feel like it's such a landmark, you kinda have to do it."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Keys said her top ranking wasn't going to affect the way she would approach the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think so. No matter what the number is next to your name, or if you even have one, you feel the same. It's always that same amount of pressure and expectation, same amount of nerves.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, there's the reality that everyone playing you is playing a bit more free, but at this point of my career that's happened a few times, it's something I've gotten used to," the world number 21 said, adding that she wasn't particularly concerned at who she might be facing later on in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't usually look at the draw…all I know is who I've got in the first round."</p>

            <p>The 31-year-old had a relatively successful season this year, however it was punctuated by injury.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had some really great years, I've had some lulls. But last year I played some really good tennis…I think this year the goal is to continue and make a few tweaks to my game."</p>
        
            <p>Keys said that "the average of players has just gotten much higher" on the WTA tour than when she first turned pro, but she has the added benefit of playing some of the greatest ever.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like I played (Venus and Serena Williams) consistently, so I've gone through different eras of tennis. And it's hard to compare one to another."</p>
        
            <p>Keys joked that her overriding feeling about having such experiences makes her "feel old" more than anything else.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike Osaka, she passed on the opportunity to bungee jump off the Sky Tower, saying that she was happy to stay on the ground and offer support.</p>
        
            <p>She opens her tournament against unseeded Italian Lucia Bronzetti, while Osaka will take on a qualifier in what looks to be very favourable early draws for all the top names.</p>
