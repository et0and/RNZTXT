            <p>Some returning veterans, exciting rookies and international imports make up the 455 contracted players name in Super Rugby Pacific squads.</p>
        
            <p>Amongst the players donning new colours in 2024 is Angus Ta'avao who has gone full circle back to the Blues where he started his Super Rugby career in 2012, and Julian Savea, who will link with Moana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>Brad Shields and Ryan Crotty are other familiar faces to return to their roots with the Hurricanes and Crusaders respectively, bringing vast experience back to their clubs.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby General Manager Professional Rugby and Performance Chris Lendrum said they are proud of the innovations implemented both on and off field in Super Rugby 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw an increase in viewership and I think that was related to the brand of rugby, we had less dead time, more points and more tries and I think we will see another season of great rugby in that same vein."</p>
        
            <p>With a number of All Blacks sitting out the Super season, Lendrum said there are benefits to those arrangements in that we will see them again in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"The focus is on the new talent, think back four years ago, no-one knew who Cam Roigard, Will Jordan, Mark Telea, so it's an opportunity to identify those stars of the future and watch them grow."</p>
        
            <p>On the topic of the woeful Wallabies, Lendrum does not believe their poor Rugby World Cup performance will trickle down to the Super franchises.</p>
        
            <p>"Clearly the World Cup was a low ebb for Australian rugby but that's not indicative of their talent base or how they will perform in Super Rugby. There has been a lot of movement of talent there."</p>
        
            <p>Lendrum also confirmed Beauden Barrett could be back in black in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"If we we end up in a position where he plays at Toyota and then is returning to New Zealand Rugby for the second half of 2024 then yes, he would be available for the All Blacks in 2024. That's on the basis he signs a multi-year contract."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett's sabbatical see him available next July when the All Blacks host England.</p>
