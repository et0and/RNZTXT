            <p>A resurgent Arsenal have romped to a 5-2 victory at capital rivals West Ham United in a Premier League derby, with all seven goals coming in a mind-boggling first half.</p>
        
            <p>Gabriel's trademark ninth-minute header opened the floodgates and Arsenal ran riot with Leandro Trossard tapping in after 26 minutes before Martin Odegaard's penalty and Kai Havertz's cool finish in the space of a minute sent some home fans heading for the exits.</p>
        
            <p>Incredibly, West Ham responded almost immediately with Aaron Wan-Bissaka sliding home before a stunning free kick by Emerson offered hope of an unlikely comeback.</p>
        
            <p>But Arsenal were awarded a second penalty of the game in first-half stoppage and this time Bukayo Saka stepped up to dispatch his spot kick past Lukasz Fabianski.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison the second half was something of an anti-climax as Arsenal cruised to the win that moved them up to second in the table with 25 points, six behind leaders Liverpool who host struggling champions Manchester City on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal have now scored 13 goals in their last three games as they return to form in spectacular fashion after a slump which saw them fall away in the title race.</p>
        
            <p>For the second season running they went to West Ham and dished out a humiliation. Last year they won 6-0 and the way they began on Saturday they looked like surpassing that.</p>
        
            <p>As it was, all the fireworks arrived before halftime as for only the fourth time in a Premier League match seven goals were scored in the first period, the last occasion being Reading against Manchester United in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was purring at his side's display, West Ham manager Julen Lopetegui, who was watching from the stands because of a touchline ban, is back under pressure.</p>
        
            <p>They have now lost four times at home in the league this season under the Spaniard, who replaced David Moyes.</p>
        
            <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo praised the attitude of his players as they edged a resolute Ipswich Town 1-0 at the City ground.</p>

            <p>Kiwi Chris Wood's second half penalty was his ninth goal of the season, and his 24th Premier League strike for Forest to take him level with former winger Bryan Roy at the top of the club's list of scorers in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"We are delighted to keep seeing him breaking records because he is a great person," Nuno told reporters, adding he was relieved his side were back to winning ways after consecutive defeats to Newcastle United and Arsenal.</p>
        
            <p>"The main goal was to bounce back from the two previous games," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"All the games in the Premier League are so tough so that is why we go game by game.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a balance but the basics for us is not the clean sheet, it is the attitude. (Ipswich are a) tough team, we knew that. We started well and they countered the attack."</p>
        
            <p>Forest are next in action at Manchester City on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We will assess them (the players) now. We had players coming back from injury but we will assess them and then think about the next one," Nuno said.</p>
        
            <p>Bournemouth forward Justin Kluivert said he was thrilled to become the first player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick of penalties in a single match as he spurred his side to a 4-2 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old Netherlands international, who is the son of Dutch great Patrick Kluivert, punished an error-strewn display from Wolves, converting two first-half penalties and another one in the second spell to snap Bournemouth's two-match losing streak.</p>
        
            <p>With the victory at the Molineux Stadium, Bournemouth sit 11th in the table with 18 points from 13 games, while Wolves dropped back into the relegation zone in 18th place with nine points.</p>
        
            <p>"That sounds beautiful (the record). To go in the history books, that's amazing, super happy with it," Kluivert told Premier League Productions.</p>
        
            <p>"I train them (the penalties). We have a great goalkeeper with Kepa (Arrizabalaga). We try some stuff, the first one I stop, and look at the keeper, what is he doing? I switch it up for the second one. Then the third, he doesn't know what I'm going to do. I waited and he chose for me. Easy as that.</p>
        
            <p>"We have shown we can beat a lot of teams in this league. I am happy."</p>
