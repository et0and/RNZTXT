        <h2>'This year has shattered my mindset' - Olympic gold medallist Hamish Kerr</h2>
        <p>
2024 was a career-best year for Olympic high jump champion Hamish Kerr, but a new year brings new challenges.

            <p>As the year winds down, high jumper Hamish Kerr is taking the time to soak up his success.</p>
        
            <p>In the space of six months he became a world indoor champion and then an Olympic gold medallist. Feats that no other New Zealander had ever achieved in high jump.</p>
        
            <p>The comedown from reaching new heights in sport can take a toll, but Kerr is making sure his milestone moments do not pass him by.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the greatest year of my career so far and there was a lot of learnings that we took out of that," the 28-year-old said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just finished that review process it's been great to celebrate with the team the success but also delve into why that happened and where to next... we've done a massive thing this year but it does continue to grind on and that's something I'm really excited about."</p>
        
            <p>Straight after his success at the Paris Olympics, Kerr opted to finish the European season early and concentrate on celebrating rather than competing.</p>
        
            <p>Before the domestic athletics season started in January, Kerr would ease back into training with a focus on looking after himself ahead of another big four-year cycle.</p>

            <p>Ranked as the number one high jumper in the world, Kerr wanted to replicate this year's winning formula with his new mindset next year.</p>
        
            <p>"This whole year has shattered my mindset quite frankly. It's weird as athletes we're always looking for the next big thing and part of that is the grind part of that is trying to get through all of those comps and win enough to fund the rest of the year so to know that now I have won the biggest thing and now it's around what's next it's definitely a different mindset and it's around how do we make that sustainable."</p>
        
            <p>In 2025, Kerr and his team would make careful choices about the events he competed in.</p>
        
            <p>"I've definitely got the freedom to pick and choose now. I will be very much structuring the year next year around the majors so we've got world indoors in March and then world outdoors in September so those two meets will be the big ones for me and then whatever my coach Jimmy decides is appropriate to lead into those things we will do.</p>
        
            <p>"Once Diamond League and all the professional stuff kicks in, I'm in an awesome position now where I can really pick which ones I want to do and make the most out of those."</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said after getting into the sport for the love of it he never imagined he would be in the position he was now, but he had a few more boxes to tick.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I can jump higher and I think that's going to really be the big thing for the next few years is how can we jump 2.40m plus and what does that look like from a physical and mental perspective and a life perspective and we'll go from there."</p>
        
            <p>One thing Kerr would change was who was with him when he was overseas. Winning in Paris gave a boost to his bank balance with all athletics gold medallists given US$50,000, which allowed him to do things he could not before.</p>
        
            <p>"The people that we had in specific roles at specific times of the year could be done better especially now that we have the means to do it... it will look different.</p>
        
            <p>"My girlfriend probably won't travel as much as she has this year, she's my rock she's just done so much for me in my career and I'm really lucky she was able to put her life a little bit on hold this year for me but that will change and it will go back to me flying home to see her rather than her flying out."</p>

            <p>Kerr would enter the new international season with a target on his back, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an interesting space to be in it's something I am going to have to contend with for the next few years instead of turning up to meets and parking up in the background and hoping that I have a good day and that I can prove everyone wrong essentially it's going out there and actually expecting a good performance now and expecting the pressure that comes with that.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something that I relish, I got into this because I wanted to be the best and obviously I enjoy it as well but it's something I want to do really well at so that title is something I've earnt but I still haven't won the Diamond League so I think there is a small bit of unfinished business there as well.</p>
        
            <p>"I do have the Olympic gold but I think to really truly call myself a generational high jumper - someone who is one of the best ever - there is definitely a couple more things to do before that."</p>
