            <p>It is less than 24 hours from the opening ceremony of the 17th Paralympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>A team of 25 New Zealand athletes is in Paris and although the country's greatest Paralympian won't be there - the 11-time gold medallist Dame Sophie Pascoe - hopes are high for success.</p>
        
            <p>Like the Olympics, the opening ceremony won't take place at a stadium but will be staged in central Paris - at Place de la Concorde - a giant public square.</p>

            <p>The Kiwi flagbearers are Dunedin athlete Anna Grimaldi and Auckland swimmer Cameron Leslie.</p>
        
            <p>The two-time long jump gold medallist said she was very excited.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite emotional being asked. I got to see Cam just before and had a bit of a chat. I think we're both really honoured and excited to lead the team tomorrow night."</p>
        
            <p>The welcome at the Games Village on Wednesday had been "beautiful" with a much different feeling to the Paralympics in Tokyo in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been really nice to get together, be close to each other, talk to each other, share the same spaces and everyone is excited to be part of the team."</p>

            <p>Grimaldi who is embarking on her third Paralympics said every experience at a Games was different, however, she could move through the event with more confidence having done it before.</p>
        
            <p>Her preparation had gone well and she was feeling positive.</p>
        
            <p>Despite Pascoe's absence she was also feeling optimistic about the team's medal chances.</p>
        
            <p>"It's those top two inches of whether you can get it together [on the day] but I'm feeling really positive about this team.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone seems to be really happy and I think people perform at their best when they're happiest so I'm hopeful."</p>
