            <p>England finished top of Group C and Slovenia reached the knockout rounds of the European Championship for the first time after playing out a lacklustre 0-0 draw, sparking wild celebrations among their fans at the Cologne Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>England, who had already qualified for the round of 16, ended the group stage with five points but it was another desperately disappointing night for Gareth Southgate's side who have managed only two goals in three games.</p>
        
            <p>While the final whistle sparked joy in the Slovenian ranks, many England fans left before the end and showed their frustration by booing the players.</p>
        
            <p>Slovenia defended superbly to hang on for the draw which meant they finished with three points in third spot, the same as second-placed Denmark who were held to a 0-0 draw by Serbia.</p>
        
            <p>Although they had the same goal difference, goals scored and disciplinary record, the Danes advanced in second place above Slovenia due to their UEFA ranking and will face hosts Germany.</p>
        
            <p>The tie breaker was who had the best qualifying record - and Denmark edged Slovenia on the head-to-head after both sides also finished on the same points in the qualifiers.</p>
        
            <p>England, despite 71 percent possession, managed only three shots on target and while they move into the last 16 as group winners, they will need a drastic improvement to go one better than Euro 2020 when they were beaten by Italy in the final.</p>
        
            <p>England's fans were in full voice as kick off approached on a muggy night by the Rhine - buoyed by other results that meant European heavyweights France, Germany, Spain and Portugal have all ended up in the other half of the knockout round draw.</p>
        
            <p>England knew a win would guarantee avoiding an early showdown with those sides, but, by halftime, many of their fans had disappeared for refreshment with their team again toiling as an attacking force against a well-drilled Slovenian outfit.</p>
        
            <p>England took a stranglehold in the second half with 80 percent of the ball as Slovenia camped in their own half, but clear chances remained elusive.</p>
        
            <p>England will play either the Netherlands in the next round or whoever finishes third in Group E, which could be Romania, Belgium, Slovakia or Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>It will depend on the Group F results on Thursday.</p>
