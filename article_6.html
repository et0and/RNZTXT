            <p>The All Blacks have arrived in Dublin for a rare Friday night (local time) test match. While there's been a bit of drama and intrigue surrounding the team selections, one thing is clear: this one sits right up there with the tests against the Springboks in terms of difficulty for Scott Robertson's side. Win this and they prove a real point that things are on track, lose and the All Blacks' record this year gets into the status of most losses ever.</p>
        
            <p>Things have been relatively subdued this week, but it doesn't mask the fact that there is a lot of feeling between the two teams due to their recent history. Andy Farrell's Ireland have proven themselves to be a true powerhouse in test rugby and while they haven't had the World Cup success they desperately want; they have achieved pretty much everything else.</p>

            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Ireland: 1. Andrew Porter, 2. Rónan Kelleher, 3. Finlay Bealham, 4. Joe McCarthy, 5. James Ryan, 6. Tadhg Beirne, 7. Josh van der Flier, 8. Caelan Doris (c), 9. Jamison Gibson-Park, 10. Jack Crowley, 11. James Lowe, 12. Bundee Aki, 13. Garry Ringrose, 14. Mack Hansen, 15. Hugo Keenan</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Rob Herring, 17. Cian Healy, 18. Tom O'Toole, 19. Iain Henderson, 20. Peter O'Mahony, 21. Conor Murray, 22. Ciaran Frawley, 23. Jamie Osborne</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks: 1. Tamaiti Williams, 2. Asafo Aumua, 3. Tyrel Lomax, 4. Scott Barrett (c), 5. Tupou Vaa'i, 6. Wallace Sititi, 7. Sam Cane, 8. Ardie Savea 9. Cortez Ratima, 10.

            <p>Only two enforced changes for the All Blacks starting XV but they're big ones, Asafo Aumua in at hooker and Damian McKenzie at first five. A lot will be resting on both men's shoulders in two key skill areas of lineout throwing and goal kicking, however they're coming off solid stints at both last weekend. Their inclusion sees George Bell and Stephen Perofeta come onto the bench, otherwise the All Blacks are unchanged.</p>

            <p>This is Ireland's first test of their season, but their side isn't too different to the one that split a series 1-1 with the Springboks back in July. Jamison Gibson-Park comes straight back in at halfback and pairs up with Jack Crowley in the inside backs. Garry Ringrose gets the nod over Robbie Henshaw at centre and Mack Hansen comes back in on the wing. Hansen's inclusion has raised some eyebrows as Calvin Nash, the player he replaced, was impressive during the Springbok series.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see the relevance of [last year's quarter-final] at all, really. We got asked straight after the World Cup about the hangover and that subject is in the past now, with the Marseille game [against France in the Six Nations] etc. We've moved on since the quarter-final, that's for sure." - Ireland coach Andy Farrell.</p>

            <p>"We are really pleased with how the squad has come through this week and our focus has turned quickly to this encounter post-England. We have trained well, and the players are fresh and ready to face a fierce challenge from the Ireland team." - All Black coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 28 - 24 Ireland</p>
        
            <p>One of the greatest Rugby World Cup matches ever played, and probably the greatest one between these two sides, the epic quarter-final from last year will live long in the memory. It's a match in which the All Blacks never relinquished the lead, but ultimately had to hold off a thrilling last attack by the Irish as they searched in vain for the winning try. The result meant the Irish were consigned to yet another quarter-final exit at a World Cup, while the All Blacks went within a missed conversion of winning the whole thing.</p>
        
            <p>A lot has happened since that match. First off, the All Blacks don't have the experience of Richie Mo'unga, Aaron Smith, Brodie Retallick and Samuel Whitelock to draw on. However, if they can connect all the positive parts of this season with the way they finished off the English victory, they can pull off what would be an immensely satisfying win in Dublin. Expect the Irish to be their usual drilled self, with little regard for what the All Blacks are doing and simply focusing on running into the many gaps they're capable of creating.</p>
