        <h2>Savea brings much-needed world class aspect to Moana Pasifika</h2>
        <p>
"I think it's more than a rugby game for us," the new Moana Pasifika captain said.
</p>
        
            <p>Ardie Savea stepped out as the newly-minted captain of Moana Pasifika today, with the most obvious change be the increase in media attention he's brought with him. However, while the cameras will be on him every step of the way, the 94-test All Black is more than happy at his new home.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, being around these brothers and the sisters in our team, it means a lot. I think it's more than a rugby game for us," he said at the team's base at North Harbour Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"It's when you're playing for a bigger purpose, not only just for a team, for everyone that we represent. I think there's like this spirit there. That's what makes you want to just give it all."</p>
        
            <p>Savea made the shock switch to Moana last July, after 11 seasons at the Hurricanes. He spent the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific season playing for Kobelco Kobe Steelers in Japan Rugby League One, an absence in which his hometown side managed to work around very effectively by finishing top of the table at the end of the regular season. Savea said that he is still "really close" with some of his former teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"When we cross the line, we're enemies and try to smash each other and then afterwards, you know, we hug each other."</p>
        
            <p>Another Hurricanes legend who will be feeling the same way is Moana coach Tana Umaga, who said the decision from his playing group to make Savea captain was "unanimous".</p>

            <p>"I put it out to them… it didn't take us long to come to this conclusion," Umaga said.</p>
        
            <p>"His reputation precedes him. But then when they get to see the man behind the mask kind of thing, they realize he's just like us, and he leads with his actions. And he's got a wealth of knowledge."</p>
        
            <p>Savea certainly brings a world class aspect that Moana have been lacking in their short existence. They've been unable to make the playoffs in the last three seasons, with last year's return of three wins their best yet.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about, bringing that and also game awareness, smartness, controlling our game, being able to play in the right areas of the field, with a bit of flair," Savea said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we've working on that. I've had a few runs today, the lungs have been blowing, but… it's looking exciting."</p>
        
            <p>Then there's the question of exactly where Savea will play, given that he's joining a very well accomplished loose forward group. There is a long term aspect to that question too, as the openside flanker spot in the All Blacks is now open with Sam Cane's departure. Savea unsurprisingly brushed that off, saying that for now, he's happy to play anywhere.</p>

            <p>"My mindset is not like I own the (All Black) jersey or not. You've got to play well in the season and that starts with Moana."</p>
        
            <p>Savea's side will play the Chiefs in a warmup match in Pukekohe this Saturday, before heading away for games against the Force and Reds to start the Super Rugby Pacific season. It's something that he hopes will bring the team together as they attempt to become a competitive outfit in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past we used to go to Africa for two weeks, and that's been pretty good for the boys to come closer, be together. So those next two weeks are probably looking at that, like being able to connect. We'll be around each other, 24/7, be able to do our work."</p>
