            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have signed off from Auckland in style, maintaining their perfect record at Eden Park with a 2-1 win over Sydney FC.</p>
        
            <p>In what will likely be the last time the side appears in the city of sails as the home team before Auckland FC join the A-League, the Phoenix showed they will be missed as 12,000 passionate fans cheered them home.</p>
        
            <p>Down 1-0 at halftime, it was a stunning strike from Kosta Barbarouses which sealed the Phoenix victory to see them back on top of the table and end their era at Eden Park without a loss from 12 games.</p>
        
            <p>On the back foot at the break, Alex Rufer told Sky Sport the message in the sheds was clear.</p>
        
            <p>"We needed to be a bit more aggressive but we were calm and I think we were lucky to be 1-0 down, we were faced with a tough team today and we came back strong."</p>
        
            <p>He said Eden Park has been a home away from home for the Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>"We've loved playing here, it's always a blessing, a great crowd but now we will have games against another team so that will be fun."</p>
        
            <p>Dominating early territory, the Sky Blues struck first after just five minutes after Anthony Caceres stripped the Phoenix of possession.</p>
        
            <p>His first shot rebounded to his feet, but he then opted to pass to Robert Mac who thundered into the right of the net.</p>
        
            <p>Not long after, Barbarouses found himself in an acre of space, but was unable to get past Andrew Redmayne.</p>
        
            <p>A big blow then came for the Phoenix, with Tim Payne hobbling off the pitch with a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Paulsen was called on to tip a Jordan Courtney-Perkins rocket over the crossbar, immediately followed by a Gabriel Lacerd shot going just wide as Sydney were all over the hosts in the opening half hour.</p>

            <p>Sydney continued to pepper the Phoenix, and when they failed to clear a cross, Courtney-Perkins took full advantage to score, but replays showed his hand had touched the ball and the Phoenix survived.</p>
        
            <p>After being dominated early, the Phoenix started to find their rhythm.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix had one last chance for points before the break, but again Barbarouses' effort was saved by Redmayne.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington would draw level shortly after oranges, Barbarouses looking to find Kraev in the area, his cross intercepted by the Sydney defence who chipped it into the Phoenix net.</p>
        
            <p>Initially ruled out due to offside to the relief Hayden Matthews, replays saw the own goal stand as the home fans erupted.</p>
        
            <p>Anthony Caceres went within inches of retaking the lead for the visitors, but sent it just over the bar.</p>
        
            <p>Some stunning goalkeeping followed, Paulsen managing three consecutive saves within a few seconds in an incredible defensive display.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney's energy returned as the Phoenix survived a sustained period on defence in the box.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix survived the onslaught, and completed their comeback in the 70th minute with Barbarouses netting his 11th goal of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Set up by Youstin Salas, Barbarouses showed incredible speed to get inside the Sydney defence before unleashing a superb strike.</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses almost went back to back immediately after the restart as he was fed a beautiful cross from Sam Sutton but a moment of hesitation allowed Redmayne to snuff the chance.</p>
        
            <p>Another injury blow came for the Phoenix as Isaac Hughes forced from the field as the match entered seven minutes of injury time.</p>
        
            <p>They had their chances, but Sydney was unable to convert to see the Phoenix reclaim its spot atop the A-League table.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix 2 (Own Goal 54', Barbarouses 70')</p>
        
            <p>Sydney 1 (Mak 5')</p>
