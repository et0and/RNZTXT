            <p>The 34 year old has played more than 300 games for her country and recently featured at the Basin Reserve when Australia reclaimed the Rose Bowl against the White Ferns, taking the series 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>Her signing will give a boost to a Blaze side looking to retain their Super Smash title, having won the competition by one run in last season's final.</p>
        
            <p>The Women's Ashes series later in January means Perry will depart after two rounds of the Super Smash to prepare for the series.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's first game is against the Northern Brave in Hamilton on Wednesday, with their second against the Central Hinds in Nelson on 4 January.</p>
        
            <p>In T20 internationals Perry has a batting average 31 and has taken 126 wickets at an average of 18.78.</p>
        
            <p>She has also played 134 games in the women's Big Bash in Australia with a batting average of 49 and has taken 70 wickets at an average of 32.</p>
