        <h2>NZ's strongest man is 'quite small' but can pull 10-tonne trucks</h2>
        <p>
Rich Farrell may be "quite small" for a strongman but backs himself against the superior power of his bigger rivals.

Food to fuel his training and competing costs Rich Farrell a fortune, he says.

            <p>He can lift a small car with his bare hands, eats up to eight eggs for breakfast and is the "strongest old fella in the country".</p>
        
            <p>For the record, Rich Farrell is 46 and use his skills as a strongman to "do everything except scratch the middle of my back".</p>
        
            <p>He is also the inaugural winner of the New Zealand's strongest man masters division competition.</p>
        
            <p>Farrell is currently in Atlanta, Georgia, training for the Official Strongman Games to be held in Wisconsin that will also feature four other Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint that while he has often been asked to help people move house, he turned them down because he lifted enough heavy items in training.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't lift pianos and couches anymore."</p>

            <p>As well as his large breakfasts, he ate rice, steak and vegetables "multiple times" a day washed down with lots of water.</p>
        
            <p>"It costs a fortune especially when you're trying to get big ...when you're training you put a little bit extra away a day."</p>
        
            <p>He estimated he ate 75-80 percent of the household budget, leaving the rest of the food for his partner.</p>
        
            <p>Depending on the competition, he might be lifting weights up to six times a day.</p>
        
            <p>At present he is training for the worlds, which consists of two days of competition and one for the finals.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes [in a strongman competition] you pull 10-tonne trucks, sometimes you lift big boulders ranging from 100kg to 200kg and tip them over the bar.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you're throwing sandbags around, sometimes you're carrying them."</p>

Rich Farrell backs his technique ahead of "brute strength".

            <p>Farrell has been competing for so long, nerves were a thing of the past, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believed he was "quite small" but backed his superior technique rather than the "brute strength" of his rivals.</p>
        
            <p>"That seems to get me places. I'm a big advocate for working on that technique and then you can play with the big boys no problem."</p>
        
            <p>He did the sport for "love" because it was not professional and he had to combine training with being a production engineer.</p>
