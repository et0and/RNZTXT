        <h2>Late finishes 'unhealthy', says US Open champion</h2>

Tennis matches finishing at 3am should be stopped, says Coco Gauff.

            <p>Defending champion Novak Djokovic wrapped up a five-set victory against Lorenzo Musetti at 3.07am on Sunday at the French Open - by far the latest ever finish at the clay-court Grand Slam.</p>
        
            <p>It reopened the discussion around why matches are allowed to continue into the early hours and the impact on player welfare.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like a lot of times people think you're done, but really at 3am [you're] probably not going to bed until 5am at the earliest, maybe 6am or 7am," said US Open women's champion Gauff.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely think it's not healthy.</p>
        
            <p>"For the health and safety of the players, it would be in the sport's best interest to try to avoid those matches finishing or starting after a certain time."</p>

            <p>In January, the ATP and WTA Tours jointly brought in a new rule which means no matches can start after 11pm.</p>
        
            <p>However, the ruling has not been applied to the four majors, which make their own policies. Tour matches are also played over three sets, while men play best-of-five at the Grand Slams.</p>
        
            <p>Iga Swiatek, the defending women's champion, also called on the authorities to act.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not easy to play and it's not like we're going to fall asleep one hour after the match," said the Polish world number one.</p>
        
            <p>"[Change] is not up to us. We need to accept anything that is going to come to us."</p>
        
            <p>The decision by the French Open to put Grigor Dimitrov's unfinished match against Zizou Bergs on Court Philippe Chatrier before Djokovic and Musetti in the night session backfired.</p>
        
            <p>That match, which was rained off on Friday, was moved to Chatrier when it looked like Alexander Zverev was going to wrap up a four-set victory against Tallon Griekspoor in the final match of the day session.</p>
        
            <p>However, that went to five sets before Dimitrov, who restarted the match with a one-set advantage, needed four sets to beat Bergs.</p>
        
            <p>It meant Djokovic and Italy's Musetti, who should have started at 8.15pm local time, did not step on court until 10.37pm.</p>
        
            <p>After sealing victory four-and-a-half hours later, Djokovic said he did not "want to get into" discussing the scheduling decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I think some things could have been handled a different way but there's also a beauty in winning a match [so late]," the 37-year-old Serb added.</p>
        
            <p>"Physically, I really went to my limits to win this match."</p>
        
            <p>The French Open has been asked by BBC Sport for comment about the decision.</p>
        
            <p>British doubles player Jamie Murray highlighted the knock-on effect of a late finish on a player's recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"You're totally goosed the next day and then the day after that is a battle as well," said Jamie Murray, whose brother Andy finished an Australian Open match last year at 4am.</p>
        
            <p>"It won't be easy for Novak to recover. It's not like he's 25 anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic, who plays Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round on Monday, was not down on the practice schedule for Sunday.</p>
