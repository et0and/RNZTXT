            <p>Black Ferns Sevens player Tysha Ikenasio has followed teammate Michaela Blyde in signing with the Warriors for their return to the NRLW next year.</p>
        
            <p>Signing up for three seasons, the 27-year-old Ikenasio is among four more player signings confirmed as the Warriors continue to build their squad.</p>
        
            <p>She is joined by Payton Takimoana, Kalyn Takitimu-Cook and Makayla Eli - all of whom have rugby union backgrounds.</p>
        
            <p>Blyde's signing with the Warriors was announced earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>After five years playing sevens rugby union in Japan, Ikenasio returned home where she had a season playing rugby league with the Richmond Roses in the Auckland premiership before breaking into the Black Ferns Sevens squad in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>As well as Sevens, she has represented New Zealand in touch and tag.</p>
        
            <p>Ikenasio said when coach Ron Griffith contacted her she was nervous but "it was instantly effortless".</p>
        
            <p>"He hadn't asked me one thing about league or sport - it was all about me as a person, my family, where I grew up - and I knew from then that he was a genuine, good human being.</p>
        
            <p>"The way he talked about building a culture, building a community and just being good people, not only reflected on him but also the way the team culture is going to be built," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming from the Black Ferns Sevens, you know just how important culture is off the field and so hearing his vision for the Warriors there was no doubt in my mind I wanted to be part of that.</p>
        
            <p>"My family are absolutely stoked with me making the change. They were proud of me and my sevens career but they're a league family so they are even prouder (now)."</p>

            <p>Takimoana has signed for 2025 and 2026, and is in the Hurricanes Poua squad for the 2025 Super Rugby Aupiki season alongside former Black Fern Shakira Baker, whose signing with the Warriors was announced in September.</p>
        
            <p>Takitimu-Cook - also signed for 2025 and 2026 - has played in the Farah Palmer Cup for the Manawatu Cyclones and the Bay of Plenty Volcanix while she made three appearances for the Hurricanes Poua in Super Rugby Aupiki this year.</p>
        
            <p>A member of New Zealand's gold medal-winning sevens rugby team at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, she tried her hand at rugby league this year with the Richmond Roses and helped the Akarana Falcons to victory in the New Zealand Rugby League's national premiership.</p>
        
            <p>Eli, 23, is a rugby union-rugby league double international. With club links to both codes in the Counties Manukau area, she has appeared at Test level for Samoa's national women's rugby union side Manusina and for Fetu Samoa in rugby league.</p>
        
            <p>She has also played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in the New South Wales women's premiership.</p>
        
            <p>Eli has also been signed for 2025 and 2026.</p>
