            <p>The second T20 cricket international between New Zealand and Bangladesh in Mount Maunganui has been abandoned due to the weather.</p>
        
            <p>Only 11 overs of play was possible with New Zealand reaching 72 for two before the rain forced the players from the field and they never returned.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh chasing an historic series win, won the toss and opted to field.</p>
        
            <p>They grabbed the early wicket of Finn Allen (2) to have the home side 1-9 but Tim Seifert and Daryl Mitchell put on 49 for the second wicket with Seifert clubbing 43 off just 23 balls, including six boundaries and one six.</p>

            <p>When the rain arrived Mitchell was unbeaten on 18 and Glenn Phillips was on 9.</p>
        
            <p>The abandonment means New Zealand can't now win the series as Bangladesh lead the series one nil after comfortably winning game one.</p>
        
            <p>Game three is again in Mount Maunganui on Sunday, with the Black Caps having to win it to level the series.</p>
