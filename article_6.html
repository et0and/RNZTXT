        <h2>Brain not brawn required for Sail GP</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand sailor Andy Maloney is quite happy to have swapped brawn for brains as the sport rides a wave of new technology.

            <p>New Zealand sailor Andy Maloney is quite happy to have swapped brawn for brains as the sport rides a wave of new technology.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand team lines up in the latest round of SailGP in Sydney this weekend, with Maloney the Flight Controller onboard Amokura.</p>
        
            <p>It's a long way from where he first started as a youngster in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He made his name in the Laser class, winning the 2008 world title before being a part of the New Zealand team that won the Youth America's Cup regatta in 2013.</p>

            <p>"At that stage I would never have thought about being a flight controller on a boat, but it has developed so much," Maloney told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"My first taste of flying a boat was ahead of the Bermuda America's Cup campaign (2017) and as it was so new it was an amazing opportunity to learn as much as I could, so to now be a flight controller is a dream come true really."</p>
        
            <p>The Flight Controller on a SailGP and America's Cup boat controls the foils and the ride height of the boat.</p>
        
            <p>Maloney was a cyclor (people that provide the power to adjust sails) on that America's Cup boat in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to bulk up after after my Laser days finished and I joined Team New Zealand for the 2017 America's Cup, but trimmed down again two years ago when I became full time flight controller.</p>
        
            <p>"I've now transferred the weight off my arms and legs and into my brain."</p>
        
            <p>SailGP has been described as the Formula One of sailing and while the technology has changed dramatically in recent years Maloney says it still feels very much like sailing.</p>
        
            <p>"A hundred percent, you still got the puffs hitting the boat and the wind shifts and it's really tactical so there is still a lot of that deep down feel and instinct about it.</p>
        
            <p>"The fundamentals are similar no matter what role you have on the boat, the instinct is very similar.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's about finding the edge in your specific role and finding the limit and that just takes a lot of experience across the different conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of it is feel and how the boat is going to react in different situations and different wind shifts, but there are also a lot of numbers on the screen on the boat that tell you what pitch and height the boat is flying at which you can then reference."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is second in the SailGP standings, behind Australia, heading the Sydney round.</p>
        
            <p>Regular driver Peter Burling is unavailable for this round as he's on parental leave with Nathan Outteridge taking over behind the steering wheel.</p>
