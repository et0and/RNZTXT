        <h2>Warriors face acid test of team culture as Vegas lights beckon</h2>
        <p>
The Auckland NRL team will head to 'Sin City' for their season-opening fixture against Canberra Raiders on 2 March.
</p>
        
            <p>NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster is braced for an early test of his team's culture, when they head to Las Vegas for their NRL season-opener against Canberra Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors-Raiders fixture is part of a doubleheader scheduled for 'Sin City' on 2 March, with a high-octane clash between four-time defending champions Penrith Panthers and the team they beat in last year's semi-finals, Cronulla Sharks.</p>
        
            <p>While there's a ripple of excitement through the Auckland club at being selected for this blatant attempt to market the code in the United States, there must also be some apprehension over how this challenge will play out in the quest for a maiden NRL crown.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've all been lost in Las Vegas at some time," grinned Webster. "That's the bit I'm most excited about.</p>
        
            <p>"Here's a challenge where you've got distractions, things aren't normal.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of these boys, honestly, have only gone to Australia to play footy and that's the furthest they've travelled. Some of them will get all the way to Las Vegas and they've got to know how to handle it."</p>

            <p>After a spectacular 2023 season under the rookie coach, followed by a disappointing sophomore campaign that saw the Warriors tumble back to the competition also-rans, Webster's pre-season catchcry has become 'consistency'.</p>
        
            <p>Consistency from one season to the next, consistency from one game to the next… consistency from one moment to the next.</p>
        
            <p>"There were big periods last year when we dominated teams, but we have to work on having the complete 80 minutes," admitted Webster.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors must achieve that without captain Tohu Harris or veteran half Shaun Johnson, who both struggled to stay healthy last year and ultimately waved the white flag on those physical battles. Vegas looms as the first examination of a newlook leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a really good opportunity for our club on the world stage," said Webster. "It's a cool thing to be part of… awesome for our fans, awesome for the NRL, awesome for the players.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to be really clear that this is our first challenge. We've got to be able to go enjoy ourselves in Vegas, but keeping ourselves really level headed and knowing that we're there to win and enjoying the win.</p>
        
            <p>"Then Vegas will feel so much more special, as opposed to not getting what we want and walking away frustrated. Vegas would never feel the same again."</p>
        
            <p>Coincidence or not, the two teams that lost in Vegas last year - South Sydney Rabbitohs and Brisbane Broncos - did not make the NRL post-season.</p>
        
            <p>After last year's letdown, Webster has keyed on three aspects in pre-season training.</p>
        
            <p>"There were definitely things around our execution and our tryline defence," he mused. "Those two simple things, the stats don't lie around them.</p>

            <p>"We want to address scenarios, certain types of situations and how we handle them. Those are three big bang-for-our buck things.</p>
        
            <p>"There are different ways to work on that and we've tried to put in situations as often as possible, without losing what we're good at. I think you can get real reactive and start throwing out what you're good at."</p>
        
            <p>Webster put his squad through a week-long, live-in camp at St Kentigern College, with no TV or mobile phones, forcing players to strengthen bonds with their teammates through board or card games.</p>
        
            <p>"We just wanted to get away and have time to ourselves," he said. "They had phones for an hour at the end of the day, just to make sure their loved ones were OK and let them know they were alive.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a hard training camp and when they weren't doing that, they were connected, building some new relationships and deeper conversations, rather than staring at your phones and pretending to talk to someone."</p>
        
            <p>They will need that kind of laser focus, when the bright lights of the Vegas strip beckon.</p>
