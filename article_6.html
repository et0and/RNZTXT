            <p>Scotstoun would be the likely venue for athletics if Scotland hosted a scaled-back Commonwealth Games in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Scotland could host an event comprising 10 to 13 sports, rather than the 18 Glasgow staged in 2014, with a decision on the 2026 Games expected in May.</p>
        
            <p>No public investment would be involved and all venues would be within an eight-mile radius in Glasgow.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria was to be the host but the Australian state pulled out, as have options such as Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>"There are other interested parties but I think it's possible," Ian Reid, chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland, told BBC Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>"We recognise how important the event is to Scottish sport and we are one of the few cities in the world that can do this at a reasonable budget, with no public investment, to a really high standard.</p>
        
            <p>"The [Commonwealth Games] federation is willing to invest the money it received from the Victorian settlement when they pulled out of the Games - so there's £100m (NZ $210m) that could be directly invested.</p>
        
            <p>"We would seek to enhance that with raising money through ticketing, sponsorship and other mechanisms, but that would still mean we would have to slim down the event from previous editions."</p>

            <p>Reid said CGS is currently "going through the discussion" on which sports would be cut from 2014 as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"There are two mandatory sports - aquatics and athletics - and of the others, we've said we'll only pick sports that fit into the venue footprint that we've got available to us," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"We wouldn't compromise in quality. We would do a smaller number of sports really well. If you came as a spectator, if you came as an athlete or if you were watching on television, you would still engage with a very, very high-quality sport event."</p>
        
            <p>Reid says CGS has looked at several options in Glasgow to host the athletics that would involve some temporary work in terms of spectator seating as well as a new track.</p>
        
            <p>Scotstoun - the multi-purpose arena that is the home of Glasgow Warriors rugby team - is "the most likely" venue, according to Reid.</p>
        
            <p>Scotland's sports minister Maree Todd has said she is "like an excited puppy" at the prospect of Glasgow hosting the Commonwealth Games again.</p>
        
            <p>"The Commonwealth Games are really important to Scotland and a vital part of the fabric that enables our athletes to be on the pathway to the Olympics," she told BBC Scotland News.</p>
