            <p>The lack of test experience is galvanising the Proteas ahead of their upcoming two test series against the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>The bulk of South Africa's leading male players are committed to their domestic Twenty20 tournament meaning the Proteas have arrived in Christchurch with a virtually unrecognisable lineup.</p>
        
            <p>Missing leading players include Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Marco Jansen, Gerald Coetzee and Nandre Burger.</p>
        
            <p>They'll be captained by batsman Neil Brand who will make his test debut against New Zealand in the first test at Mount Maunganui which starts on February 4th.</p>
        
            <p>Eight of the squad have yet to play a test.</p>
        
            <p>"We are all aware of why the side is what it is," said coach Shukri Conrad</p>
        
            <p>"We made peace with it a long time ago. It's a conversation that has been well ventilated... so if anything it has been used as a galvanising agent.</p>
        
            <p>"We are here as a Proteas side - we are not a second or third rate side."</p>
        
            <p>Conrad said his squad has a lot of first class experience and lot of motivation and doesn't regard themselves as underdogs.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think any South African likes to be regarded as an underdog and we are certainly not assuming that underdog tag... they are itching to get going."</p>

            <p>Conrad said an A series against the West Indies a couple of months ago has served the team well in allowing the players to get to know each other.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to give a really good account of ourselves. We are not here to participate. We are hear to compete."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have never beaten South Africa in a test series and this series would seem an ideal opportunity to achieve that milestone but Conrad says that only further adds to his side's motivation.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact New Zealand have never beaten us in a test series looms large and its a proud feat that we won't easily surrender."</p>
        
            <p>South Africa have a three day warm up match against a New Zealand XI in Christchurch starting on Monday before the first test.</p>
