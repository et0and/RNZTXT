            <p>Despite fighting cancer, Cameron Suafoa has made good on his promise to return to the rugby field.</p>
        
            <p>Last month the Blues forward revealed his cancer diagnosis said he was taking a break from the sport to complete radiation therapy.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old North Harbour forward played two Super Rugby Pacific games in March but had decided to step aside temporarily as training and playing while receiving treatment became too much.</p>
        
            <p>"In my mind, if let this bog me down and I keep thinking about it, it's just not going to help me move forward," Suafoa said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be stuck saying 'why me' all the time, if I can pull something positive out of this and come back fitter and stronger and hopefully then aim to pick up where I left off."</p>
        
            <p>However, he vowed to return for the Blues and he'll do so on Friday night after being named on the bench for the Auckland based side's clash with the Rebels in Melbourne, completing a remarkable comeback less than a month after saying he was taking a break.</p>

            <p>Suafoa opened up about his medical status in a video released by the Blues in April, explaining how his outlook had changed since being diagnosed last November and having a tumour removed.</p>
        
            <p>He played a third-round match against the Hurricanes on 9 March, followed a week later by a game against the Waratahs in Sydney, which was preceded by a highly unusual buildup.</p>
        
            <p>After undergoing radiation on a Friday, Suafoa flew to Sydney that night and played the following day, coming off the bench for his 20th Super Rugby appearance.</p>
        
            <p>He said playing at a high level while receiving treatment had become too difficult to sustain.</p>
        
            <p>"I get real tired easily," Suafoa said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the mornings I'm pretty good, I've just woken up so I'm usually full of energy but after 12 or 1, that's when I'm usually on the decline fatigue wise."</p>
        
            <p>However, Suafoa, who played two matches for the All Blacks XV last year, said he was more determined than ever to succeed in his chosen sport.</p>
        
            <p>"In my mind, if let this bog me down and I keep thinking about it, it's just not going to help me move forward," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be stuck saying 'why me' all the time, if I can pull something positive out of this and come back fitter and stronger and hopefully then aim to pick up where I left off."</p>
