            <p>A massive year for Australian international rugby will begin with a revenge mission for one of the darkest days in the history of the Wallabies.</p>
        
            <p>The team will play a one-off Test match against Fiji in Newcastle on 6 July, its only hit-out before the three-Test series against the British and Irish Lions.</p>
        
            <p>The Newcastle game will be the first match between the two nations since Fiji achieved a major boilover in the 2023 Rugby World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji, along with Wales, progressed out of the group to the semifinals while Australia missed out on the knock-out phase for the first time in its history.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji was narrowly beaten by England in the quarterfinal of that World Cup, and last year defeated Wales in Cardiff for the first time.</p>

            <p>Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt, who guided Australia to wins against England at Twickenham and Wales in Cardiff last spring, said the Test against Fiji will be an excellent preparation for the Lions.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be great to get the squad together and to have a genuine Test match prior to the British and Irish Lions series," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>In its bid to make the semifinals, Fiji was just six points shy of beating England at the last World Cup in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The Flying Fijians beat Wales in Cardiff last November and bring a physicality and flair that makes the team entertaining to watch and tough to beat.</p>
        
            <p>The British and Irish Lions series comes to Australia for the 10th time since the inaugural tour in 1899.</p>
        
            <p>The team has toured every 12 years since 1989.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors claimed the 2013 series 2-1, with a 41-16 victory in the third and deciding Test match at Stadium Australia.</p>
