            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have barely registered a shot in a 2-0 loss to Melbourne City in their first match of 2025, stretching their winless run at AAMI Park to 22 matches.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix had only one shot in the defeat and were not able to force City goalkeeper Patrick Beach to make a single save.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Giancarlo Italiano said a "poor first half" cost his team but he believed the game could have turned out differently if they had not conceded inside 10 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very poor goal to concede early on and that really puts you on the back foot. We conceded and then we kind of got pinned for large parts of that first half.</p>
        
            <p>"When we were brave enough to find that forward pass we were actually dangerous. We had a couple of good chances, but again just the linkage player into that final third…just wasn't good enough."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano remained "very optimistic" he can turn his side's fortunes around.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're maybe one or two performances short of turning our season around.</p>
        
            <p>"For me it's now just going back to the drawing board, seeing what players I have available and finding a style that suits the players.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very important for the coach to steer the direction, but I need to make sure that my players know that they have my confidence and the other way around as well that we can do something still in the season."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano made just the one enforced change to the eleven which started the 2-1 win over Newcastle Jets on Saturday, with centre back Isaac Hughes returning to the side in place of captain Alex Rufer, who is sidelined indefinitely with illness.</p>
        
            <p>Harry Politidis put the hosts in front in the seventh minute from a sharply worked short corner routine, after Phoenix goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi had done well to make his first save of the night to deny Callum Talbot from long-range.</p>
        
            <p>Oluwayemi made a further three saves before halftime, to deny Arion Sulemani (twice) and Benjamin Mazzeo, but none of them really tested the keeper.</p>
        
            <p>However all three shots came after the Phoenix were careless with possession inside their half.</p>
        
            <p>They weren't able to register a shot of their own before the break as they found it difficult to break City's press.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano made a couple of attacking switches at halftime, bringing on forward Oskar van Hattum in place of midfielder Kazuki Nagasawa and changing from a back five to a back four, with Matt Sheridan pushing into midfield in Nagasawa's absence.</p>
        
            <p>The changes had an impact with the Phoenix more comfortable in possession and able to make more regular forays into the opposition half.</p>
        
            <p>Teenager Luke Brooke-Smith registered Wellington's first shot shortly before the hour mark when he burst into the City box but his effort was well-blocked.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke-Smith was replaced soon after, following a tireless 60 minutes on the right wing, with fellow teenager Luke Supyk making his way on the pitch for the first time this season.</p>
        
            <p>With 10 minutes remaining Nathan Walker and Lukas Kelly-Heald replaced Sheridan and Sam Sutton.</p>
        
            <p>Moments later City doubled their lead, with Nathaniel Atkinson putting the final touch on a sweeping move into the Wellington penalty area to all but seal the three points.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano made his final change shortly before the start of time added on, bringing on Corban Piper for an ailing Tim Payne.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have no time to dwell on the defeat as they will return home prepare for their match against Adelaide United at Sky Stadium on 11 January.</p>
