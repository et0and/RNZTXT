        <h2>Super Rugby round six review: Crusaders wake up, Blues close gap</h2>
        <p>
All the action from the latest round, that was all over too soon on a long weekend. Video

            <p>The Blues might have been gifted an extra home game, but they weren't in a particularly charitable mood when they thumped Moana Pasifika at Eden Park. In what coach Vern Cotter said was their best performance of the season, his side ran in six tries to record a 47-8 win - but really, you feel like they could go a bit further.</p>
        
            <p>Again, the Blues were sluggish at the start, Moana had plenty of ball and territory before Mark Tele'a went the other way and finished off a well-worked chance that set the tone for a 28-8 halftime lead.</p>
        
            <p>Only three tries in the second half - picky? A little bit, but the Blues had already gashed Moana for two long range tries in the first half that really shouldn't have come so easily. Stephen Perofeta and Bryce Heem both went in untouched after getting the ball near halfway, Moana's defence falling to bits under not really that much pressure.</p>
        
            <p>It's a shame for Moana, who looked so promising after a friendly draw to start the season. That's now two hidings in a row, now they have over a month before they play another 'home' game in Auckland. They face the Highlanders at Mt Smart in round 11, a venue that's already been sold out three time in a row this season by the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues now move within five points of the Hurricanes, right now those two meeting at the business end seems highly likely.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders will probably have something to say about that, though. Everyone knew they were going to come right at some stage, however, to do so in emphatic fashion against a powerful Chiefs side was something only their most ardent fans were expecting.</p>
        
            <p>The theory about Damian McKenzie's 'resting' - that he was actually injured but Clayton McMillan used the chance to give him an All Blacks-enforced break - does make a bit more sense in retrospect, but the Chiefs came out half-cocked anyway and paid the price.</p>
        
            <p>The Drua and the Force did as much swimming as playing footy in Lautoka on Saturday afternoon. The constant rain and heavy track didn't stop the home side trying to keep the ball alive when the wanted to, but the Drua balanced it well with a smart and powerful set piece that laid the foundations for a 31-13 victory.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Australian derby between the Brumbies and Reds was an intense affair in Brisbane. The Brumbies took the game 20-19 after 80 minutes of cut and thrust, Brumbies fullback Tom Wright the difference with two well-taken tries. Noah Lolesio is putting together a pretty compelling case for a test recall with a perfect record off the tee when it mattered most.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of other talking points from the weekend involve the unfortunate injuries to Cam Roigard and Lachlan Lonergan, who both may well have had their Super Rugby campaigns ended by what looked like hip drop tackles. That style of tackle was made illegal in the NRL due to its danger to the ball carrier's knees and ankles, but if rugby wants to follow suit it was be slightly at odds with its overwhelming narrative around high shots resulting in head contact.</p>
        
            <p>Once again, Super Rugby Pacific's draw has had all its games played in just over a 24-hour period. This seems very odd, given that it's a long weekend and the NRL and AFL both have long-standing fixtures on Good Friday and Easter Monday, but given Super Rugby has effectively waived regular Sundays anyway it at least tracks with rugby's lack of ambition in broadcast scheduling.</p>
        
            <p>Four teams are on a bye next weekend, so you can't blame load management for this either.</p>
