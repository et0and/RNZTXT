            <p>Luxenbourg have staved off a gutsy New Zealand challenge to win the Davis Cup tennis tie 3-2 in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were on the brink after trailing the visitors 2-nil when KP Pannu and Ajeet Rai lost their singles matches on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>But New Zealand kept the World Group Two tie alive when Rai and Finn Reynolds defeated Rafael Calzi and Gilles Kremer 6-3 6-2 in 56 minutes in the opening doubles match on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Rookie Jack Loutit then upset Luxembourg No 1 Chris Rodesch 7-5 6-4 in his very first Davis Cup match, to level the tie 2-all.</p>
        
            <p>But in the deciding singles tie Alex Knaff beat New Zealand's Rubin Statham 6-3 6-2.</p>
        
            <p>Beating Rodesch, who was on a 16-match winning streak, was Loutit's biggest win to date in his career.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand captain Artem Sitak showed his faith in the 20-year-old Aucklander to select him for his maiden Davis Cup match, which had so much riding on it.</p>
        
            <p>Loutit rewarded that confidence by playing tenacious tennis, going for his shots and using his footwork to stay in points until an opportunity presented itself.</p>
        
            <p>Statham was expected to play Sunday's doubles but New Zealand's Davis Cup tennis captain Artem Sitak decided to bring Rai in to play alongside doubles specialist Reynolds.</p>
        
            <p>Against players with significantly lower rankings, Rai and Reynolds looked confident right from the beginning of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Even though there was only one break of serve in the opening set, on Kremer's serve, it always seemed likely that the first set would go their way.</p>
        
            <p>It was Statham's final appearance for the New Zealand Davis Cup team. The 37-year-old plans to continue playing next season, but has decided that after making his debut for his country in 2005, he feels the time is right to stand aside.</p>
