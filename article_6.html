            <p>All Blacks v England</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm, Saturday 13 July</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park, Auckland</p>

            <p>Here is all you need to know about the match, how to buy tickets, and where it's going down.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks beat England 16-15 in the first test of the series on Saturday night in Dunedin. It was an exciting, controversial game in front of 30,000 at Forsyth Barr Stadium, but now the action moves to Eden Park in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The reason why there's so much interest in this second test is that the All Blacks certainly looked like they could improve in a few areas. They scored two good tries but also bombed several more chances, so there's work to be done on attack. Also, they let in a couple of English tries that could have been avoided with better defence.</p>
        
            <p>But mainly, this is about one man again: Scott Robertson. The new coach came in with an aura of freshness and evolution, but it will take more than one test to see the sort of change that All Black fans are expecting.</p>
        
            <p>A lot. Robertson's new regime has piqued the usually high NZ interest in the All Blacks, while England have come down with a very understandable confidence. There are around a dozen journalists that have travelled over from England for this, which is quite staggering given that the Euros and Wimbledon are on right now, as well as an Olympics coming up. Every NZ media outlet has several representatives covering the All Blacks.</p>

            <p>Well, no. Saturday night's result was the first time the All Blacks had beaten England since 2018 - a match that ended with the exact same score. England famously toppled the All Blacks in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and then drew 25-all in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>This is a very promising and, dare we say it, exciting English side. Their back three of George Furbank, Imanuel Feyi-Waboso and Tommy Freeman all had big games in the first test, with Feyi-Waboso crossing for a try. Had Marcus Smith's goal kicking been a bit better, they may well have pulled off only their third win ever on NZ soil.</p>
        
            <p>No, but he won't need to. After the debacle on Saturday night that saw him take too long to kick a penalty goal and hand the ball back to England with a minute to play, NZ Rugby have seen fit to install a shot clock on the Eden Park big screen.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks haven't lost at Eden Park in 30 years, which is a staggering statistic even for them. The closest anyone has got to beating them was the British & Irish Lions in 2017, who drew 15-all in a dramatic deciding test. Simply being at the country's biggest stadium is a massive psychological boost to the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>If you're planning on going and haven't got a ticket, bad news: this game was sold out months ago with 47,000 expected in at Eden Park. However, the surrounding area of Kingsland will be busy and local bars are a good option because you can hear the roar of the crowd just down the road. If you're anywhere else, don't worry! We've got you covered with Jamie Wall's live blog on RNZ Sport, coverage starting at 6:30pm Saturday night.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks name their side on Thursday at 11:30am, half an hour later Robertson will be in the hot seat talking to the media to explain his choices. England have been pretty fluid with their timings since they've been in New Zealand, but it's expected that their side will land overnight to suit the time difference for media back home.</p>
        
            <p>You'll have to tune in and find out on Saturday night, but All Blacks + Eden Park has been a very productive relationship for three decades.</p>
