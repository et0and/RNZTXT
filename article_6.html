            <p>All Blacks first five-eighth Richie Mo'unga has revealed he turned down an NRL contract offer six years ago in a face-to-face meeting with then-Warriors coach Stephen Kearney.</p>
        
            <p>Mo'unga, who has professed to a soft spot for rugby league, is in Brisbane helping the New South Wales Blues prepare for the third and deciding State of Origin match on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Mo'unga told the Sydney Morning Herald he had been invited for "a bit of personal development" after playing at fullback in a practice game against the NSW side.</p>
        
            <p>Mo'unga's older brothers both played rugby league and the 30-year-old had been tempted to play the 13-man code at school level.</p>

            <p>Mo'unga revealed he was made a serious offer to join the Warriors in 2018, the year he played the first of his 56 tests.</p>
        
            <p>"It got as serious as meeting with Stephen Kearney, my agent, my father-in-law and 'Sully' (Warriors recruitment manager Peter O'Sullivan)," Mo'unga said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason I stayed was because I played rugby, and my only dream and goal was to be an All Black to play at a World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of those things you'll always have conversations with your mates, saying how it would have been awesome (to switch)."</p>
        
            <p>Mo'unga began a three-season Japanese club contract after last year's World Cup and helped lead the Toshiba Brave Lupus to the domestic title.</p>
        
            <p>He is ineligible for the All Blacks until his contract ends and told the Sydney Morning Herald he is "working towards" representing New Zealand at the 2027 World Cup in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Mo'unga was in the crowd when the All Blacks beat England in the first test at Dunedin this month, their first match under new coach Scott Robertson.</p>
