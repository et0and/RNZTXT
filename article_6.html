            <p>Arsenal moved up to second in the Premier League and within six points of Liverpool after a largely trouble-free, if slightly pedestrian, 1-0 win at home to struggling Ipswich Town on a chilly night in North London.</p>
        
            <p>A first-half goal from Kai Havertz, who pounced on a smart pull-back from Leandro Trossard, proved the winner although the hosts should have scored more goals as the Gunners' performance failed to provide many pre-New Year fireworks.</p>
        
            <p>Lacking the creativity of the injured Bukayo Saka, it took 19 minutes before Arsenal mustered their first shot although four minutes after that Havertz netted his sixth of the season in all competitions by tapping in Trossard's whipped cross.</p>
        
            <p>Ipswich had a spell of pressure after 10 minutes of the second half but it proved fleeting and Arsenal should have comfortably put the game to bed after that.</p>
        
            <p>Defender Gabriel Magalhaes missed a golden opportunity to extend his run of scoring from corners when he headed just wide when completely unmarked. Captain Martin Odegaard then blazed over after he danced from midfield into the visitors box.</p>
        
            <p>Brighton & Hove Albion were held to a 0-0 draw with Brentford in a mid-table clash after dominating the match but lacking a finishing touch.</p>
        
            <p>Fabian Hurzeler's hosts extended their winless run to six games and are 10th in the table with 26 points after 18 games, two points ahead of 11th-placed Brentford who are still without an away victory this season.</p>
        
            <p>Brighton peppered Mark Flekken's goal with shots all night after Julio Enciso set the tone in the fifth minute when Joao Pedro, with his back to goal, laid the ball off for the Paraguay international, who clattered his shot off the woodwork.</p>
        
            <p>It was a sign of things to come for the 20-year-old Enciso, whose eight shots in the first half were the most by a player in the first half of a Premier League game since Luis Suarez's eight for Liverpool against Aston Villa in March, 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Brentford's Yoane Wissa celebrated what he thought was a sumptuous goal against the run of play in the first half when he latched onto Mads Roerslev's through ball on the counter and fired into the top corner but it was ruled out for offside.</p>
        
            <p>Flekken limped off late in the first half with a hamstring injury, which could have been costly with Brighton having had 15 shots to the visitors' two. However, back-up Hakon Valdimarsson and a resolute defence limited Brighton to a point.</p>
        
            <p>Brentford fans shouted for a red card when Joao Pedro threw an elbow near Yehor Yarmoliuk's head in the second half after the Ukrainian dragged him back. But a lengthy VAR check ruled there was no violent conduct as Joao Pedro made no contact.</p>
