            <p>Sunrisers Hyderabad will clash with Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL) final after the Pat Cummins-led side beat Rajasthan Royals by 36 runs in the second qualifier.</p>
        
            <p>Hyderabad posted 175-9 and restricted Rajasthan to 139-7 to give themselves a chance to avenge their defeat by Kolkata in the first qualifier.</p>
        
            <p>Put into bat, 2016 champions Hyderabad could not quite accelerate in the final overs and posted a competitive total at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Trent Boult rattled Hyderabad with his three-wicket burst before Travis Head (34) and Rahul Tripathi (37) steadied the innings.</p>

            <p>Heinrich Klaasen struck a breezy 50 down the order but the late flourish Hyderabad expected did not materialise.</p>
        
            <p>Yashasvi Jaiswal (42) led Rajasthan's robust reply but their top order could not quite capitalise on it.</p>
        
            <p>Dhruv Jurel smashed 56 off 35 balls but he did not get enough support from the other end.</p>
        
            <p>Spinner Shahbaz Ahmed (3-23) led Hyderabad's tidy bowling claiming 3-23, while all-rounder Abhishek Sharma also impressed claiming figures of 2-24.</p>
        
            <p>"Pat used the spinners really well. There was more turn in the second innings," Sharma said referring to Hyderabad captain Cummins.</p>
        
            <p>"It is one of my dreams to play the IPL final, and it is coming true this year."</p>
