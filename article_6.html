        <h2>Watch: All Blacks assistant coach on Pumas loss</h2>
        <p>
Scott Hansen revealed the team's review of the Argentina match involved a few "honest conversations".
</p>
        
            <p>The dust has barely settled from the new All Black regime's first defeat, but attention has quickly turned to this weekend's rematch against the Pumas at Eden Park. Assistant coach Scott Hansen said the review of the 38-30 loss, the latest in a six-year winless streak at Sky Stadium, had involved telling some harsh truths of what's expected out of an All Black team.</p>
        
            <p>"They're men, you let them feel it because they care," Hansen said.</p>
        
            <p>"You give them the time and space to feel that and we still are hurt, and we should be. So we get into our work and that's started with the review this morning."</p>
        
            <p>While the details of the actual review were something that would remain behind closed doors, anyone who actually watched the game would be able to make a pretty accurate guess.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks were not ruthless or clinical enough on attack, the bench added little and the lineout failed spectacularly at the worst possible time. They gifted the Pumas a chance to win, which was happily taken in fine style, while the lack of any significant carries by the forwards - other than Ardie Savea - was noticeable.</p>
        
            <p>Hansen said it was an "honest review" with "honest conversations".</p>
        
            <p>"It's an opportunity to see our game where we can be better. Our preparation and our performance. Where our game is, where it needs to be. What we've been given is an opportunity to respond."</p>

            <p>Just how they will do that was something Hansen acknowledged was "a fair question".</p>
        
            <p>"What we're engaged around is the quality of our skill sets, our roles and execution around the field. The components of our game, the synergy of our attack."</p>
        
            <p>Hansen said simply relying on a natural response to losing was not good enough.</p>
        
            <p>"There should be a response because of what we go through during the week. Because of the learnings, because of our adjustments - it could be attitude, it could be physicality. It won't just happen, and we've answered that as a group â€¦ we've discussed that it needs to take us through the year, not just the weekend."</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Scott Robertson is expected to make changes to his starting side, with the wings and loose forwards most likely to get a shake-up.</p>
        
            <p>The Pumas scored 38 points in Wellington - a new record for points conceded by the All Blacks on home soil - however they return to a ground on Saturday night where they have not lost in 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>Hansen was firm, however, that Eden Park was not going to do anything for the All Blacks if they did not do the work first themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a performance that we need to correct, around our intent and us making a stamp on the game."</p>
