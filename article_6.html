            <p>The most pulsating sport on the planet will no doubt deliver more chaos, drama, and stunning feats of violence in 2025. Vicious knockouts, ingenious submissions, blood feuds, and iconic mic moments are all on the menu this year, as is the inevitable match making and armchair criticisms. With that in mind, here is Jonty Dine's UFC wishlist for 2025:</p>
        
            <p>With Israel Adesanya unlikely to see UFC gold again, the time has come for a new face of Kiwi MMA. In the wake of the Last Stylebender's trailblazing run lie two men more than capable of taking up the mantle. Carlos Ulberg's rise through light heavyweight will see him meet former title holder Jan Błachowicz while flyweight Kai Kara France is emerging as the likely challenger to Alex Pantoja's throne. Navajo Sterling has also shown glimpses of what the future of New Zealand mixed martial arts looks like beyond Adesanya.</p>
        
            <p>While some argue the title of baddest man on the planet is undisputed, majority of the MMA community believe until Jon Jones steps up to fight Tom Aspinall, he cannot claim to be they greatest heavyweight walking the earth. Jone's recent win over former title holder Stipe Miocic will continue to age like milk while Aspinall has cleared out all contenders to date. It seems to be the fight everyone except Jones wants booked.</p>
        
            <p>Two phenoms with 42 wins and just a single career loss combined. Pitting Islam's relentless wrestling against Topuria's piston like punching power, the winner could comfortably lay claim to the pound for pound best in the world. When factoring in the challenge featherweight Alex Volkanovski put to Islam Mackachev in their first super fight and the subsequent knockout of the Australian at the hands of Illia Topuria, there is no reason to think this would not be a clash for the ages.</p>

            <p>The boogeyman's brutal blitz through both the middle and light heavyweight divisions has been unparalleled. Winning both belts in brutal fashion, Alex Pereira has risen to the top echelons of the sport in rapid time. Could Poatan match the same feats in the hardest hitting division in the game? A win over either Jones or Aspinall could cement Pereira as the greatest combat athlete of all time.</p>
        
            <p>Another case of unstoppable force meets an immovable object with this dream middleweight match up being touted by fans since the South African sneered the strap. Though Chimaev has lost a large chunk of fans over the past two years, his standing as an elite mixed martial artist cannot be questioned while the puzzle that is Dricus du Plessis continues to be unsolvable for most men. Could Khamzat finally claim the crown earmarked for him since is destructive first 60 days in the UFC?</p>
        
            <p>Please Tony. On a tragic eight fight losing skid, much like his moniker, El Cucuy is a ghost of his former self.</p>
        
            <p>While Ferguson may be hanging onto his career far too long, Amanda Nunes, the greatest female fighter of all time, still has plenty to offer inside the cage. Nunes retired in 2023 and bowed out on top, but recently she has hinted at a potential comeback for a dream bout against PFL champion and new UFC signing Kayla Harrison.</p>
        
            <p>Sean O'Malley fell short, Bo Nickal boasts no personality, Chimaev has aligned himself with warlords. The UFC is crying out for a mega star on par with the likes of Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey and Brock Lesnar. Someone who transcends the sport, invites a new generation of eyeballs and ignites the fanbase. Sadly they've been few and far between in recent years.</p>

            <p>Pereira is currently holding down the fort for pure strikers in the sport, with a grapple heavy approach becoming ubiquitous for champions in 2024. Islam Mackachev, Belal Muhammed, Merab Dvalishvili, and even du Plessis all won or defended titles largely relying on their ground game. From a purely entertainment standpoint, lets hope some strikers can stuff the threat and swing their way to gold.</p>
        
            <p>A necessary evil during the Covid-19 outbreak, the Apex in Las Vegas provided a stage for fights during lockdown protocols, giving the masses some much needed relief from the pandemic. However, the novelty wore off quickly and everyone soon yearned for the return of a live crowd. However, the UFC insists on continuing to hold events at the empty arena, much to the frustration of fans.</p>
        
            <p>The pandering during the 2024 presidential campaign trail for Donald Trump by the UFC was nauseating. We will be seeing enough of the president over the next four years as it is, can we please get a reprieve during sport? Does he not have work to do anyway?</p>
        
            <p>Speaking of the president, no matter how hard UFC president Dana White tries to sell it, the MMA community is not buying the CTE-inducing farce that is PowerSlap. In his desperation to legitimise the 'sport,' White has taken to the UFC social media, forcing slap fights in the faces of followers, all while delusionally heralding it as bigger than the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, WWE, NASCAR and UFC combined. Enough!</p>
