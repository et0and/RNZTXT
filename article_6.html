            <p>The Waratahs have overcome the Highlanders 37-36 in a thrilling encounter in Sydney on Friday. In a game that featured nine lead changes, including several in the last 10 minutes, and fittingly ended on a try to Tahs prop Siosifa Amone that was converted by Jack Bowen.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Highlanders scored the first two tries but also picked up two yellow cards. Mitch Dunshea and Caleb Tangitau both sat in the bin and watched the Tahs claw back a 13-12 lead at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>It was an entertaining game in the first half but both teams cut loose in the second, both teams going try-for-try until Amone's heroics on the last play.</p>
        
            <p>New Highlanders co-captain Timoci Tavatavanawai was prominent for the visitors, scoring a try and putting in some bug shots in a game where tackling often wasn't the priority.</p>
