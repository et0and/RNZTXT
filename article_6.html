            <p>After a strong showing on the first official day of the Olympics, there's plenty more action coming up for New Zealand athletes.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday night (NZT) saw victory for swimmer Erika Fairweather in the 400m freestyle heats, earning her a spot in the final. But she narrowly missed out on winning New Zealand's first medal this Olympics after finishing fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Rowers Tom Mackintosh, Emma Twigg, Lucy Spoors, Brooke Francis, Robbie Manson and Jordan Parry also had strong showings and secured places in the quarterfinals.</p>
        
            <p>With rugby sevens, artistic gymnastics, equestrian cross-country, sailing, football and mountain biking all on the schedule for day two, sports fans will be spoiled for choice.</p>
        
            <p>Here's who to look out for. All times are in NZT.</p>

            <p>The 20-year-old swimmer is back in action again and vying for a spot in another final.</p>
        
            <p>She won silver in the 200m freestyle at this year's world championships in Doha, so odds are good that she'll sail through these heats.</p>
        
            <p>Danyon Loader is New Zealand's only Olympic swimming champion to date, but there is a good chance that Lewis Clareburt will soon join him.</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt competed alongside Fairweather at the Doha world champs, where he won the 400m individual medley title.</p>
        
            <p>He also made the finals for both the 200m and 400m medleys at the Tokyo Olympics, but finished down the field.</p>

            <p>Flagbearer Jo Aleh is a two-time Olympic medallist, having won gold at London 2012 and silver at Rio 2016 alongside crew mate Polly Powrie.</p>
        
            <p>Aleh has since teamed up with Rio silver medallist Molly Meech, with the pair set to compete in the 49er FX.</p>
        
            <p>These Games mark a return to top-level sailing for Aleh, who took five years off after Rio to focus on coaching.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have been on the podium both times since the sport was introduced to the Olympics in 2016 - now it's time for a three-peat.</p>
        
            <p>The team's history in the sport is unrivalled, having won the World Series five times and being World Cup champions in 2013 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>They take on China at 4am, then Canada at 7.30am.</p>
