            <p>Antonio Felix da Costa gave Porsche a first home win in Formula E in the second of two races in Berlin, while Jaguar's Nick Cassidy stretched his lead in the all-electric championship to 16 points.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealander Cassidy finished runner-up to the Portuguese, who has now won three times in his career on the track at Berlin's old Tempelhof airport, after passing Nissan's Oliver Rowland with two laps to go.</p>
        
            <p>Cassidy also set the fastest lap of the race after winning the first race of the round.</p>
        
            <p>The second race win was da Costa's first victory since Cape Town in 2023 and made him the eighth different driver to win in the space of 10 rounds.</p>
        
            <p>Porsche's Pascal Wehrlein, Cassidy's closest championship rival, was fourth with reigning champion and pole-sitter Jake Dennis fifth for Andretti and New Zealand's Mitch Evans sixth for leaders Jaguar.</p>
        
            <p>Maserati's Indian rookie Jehan Daruvala had his best result yet with seventh while McLaren's 19-year-old stand-in Taylor Barnard, replacing the injured Sam Bird, was eighth after starting 18th.</p>
        
            <p>Envision's Joel Eriksson was ninth and Jean-Eric Vergne collected the final point for DS Penske.</p>
