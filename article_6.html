            <p>The Silver Ferns opened their 2024 season with a 13-goal loss to Australia, unable to bridge the gap with their trans-Tasman rivals.</p>
        
            <p>The World Champion Diamonds led from start to finish in the Nations Cup opener as New Zealand were outclassed 63-50.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Liz Watson played a starring role for the Australian side with goal attack Kiera Austin a standout in their attack line.</p>
        
            <p>Australian defender Courtney Bruce was a constant thorn for the Silver Ferns as the Diamonds surged out to a 14-9 first quarter lead.</p>
        
            <p>Experienced New Zealand shooter Ameliaranne Ekenasio has been rested for the tour, replaced by the Southern Steel's Georgia Heffernan on debut at Wembley.</p>
        
            <p>Heffernan partnered Grace Nweke in the shooting circle, while the midcourt featured centre Maddy Gordon and wing defence Karin Burger.</p>
        
            <p>Mila Reuelu-Buchanan and Whitney Souness shared the wing attack duties.</p>
        
            <p>Australia pushed on from their five-goal lead at the first break to a 29-22 halftime advantage.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's best passage of play came in the third quarter with Nweke scoring 14 goals for the quarter as New Zealand trimmed the deficit to 44-39.</p>
        
            <p>With the match set for a tight finish New Zealand faded badly, outscored in the last quarter by eight goals.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns coach Noeline Taurua says there will be plenty to address before the team plays Uganda on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"It was disappointing how that last quarter ended but overall, it was not too bad," Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ability, once again, to hold right through, our ability not to turn over ball and probably our fitness levels let us down a bit but it's a start, we know where we're at, so know the gaps and what we need to improve on."</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns:</p>
        
            <p>Grace Nweke 41/42 (98%)</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Heffernan 9/11 (82%)</p>
