            <p>The reigning world champion White Ferns have slumped to an 82-run loss to Australia in their T20 match in Tauranga, in their second heavy loss of the series.</p>
        
            <p>With the commanding victory at Mt Maunganui's Bay Oval tonight, the visitors have wrapped up the series 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>Batting first, Australia made 204 for 3, with opener Beth Mooney top scoring with 70 off 42 balls.</p>
        
            <p>The stand-in wicketkeeper combined for a 57-run opening stand with Georgia Voll (36) to again stun the White Ferns with an early onslaught.</p>
        
            <p>Needing 205 for victory, the White Ferns were bowled out for 122 in the 16th over.</p>
        
            <p>Melie Kerr (40) and Maddy Green (22) were the best of the New Zealand batters in a batting order that failed to fire.</p>
        
            <p>Highly regarded allrounder Annabel Sutherland recorded figures of 4 for 8 in 2.1 overs, for the best outing by an Australian woman in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists also dominated the opener at Eden Park with an eight-wicket win.</p>
        
            <p>The third and final match will be played in Wellington on Wednesday.</p>
