            <p>Phoenix captain Alex Rufer thrilled the 9000-strong crowd soaking up the drama in the A-League top-of-the-table clash in Wellington to salvage an unlikely 1-1 draw with Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>Rufer stepped up to the spot after a brief chat with the in-form Kosta Barbarouses and slotted the stoppage time penalty into the right corner, but the wild celebrations weren't shared by the opposition camp.</p>
        
            <p>After the match, Melbourne Victory coach Tony Popovic said the VAR decision to award the penalty in the fifth minute of stoppage time was frustrating at best.</p>
        
            <p>"At first I didn't think it was a penalty," the visiting coach Popovic said.</p>
        
            <p>Young Wellington forward Oskar van Hattum had flashed a left-footed shot narrowly wide of the same post in the 90th minute when he cut into the box from the right wing and moments later he was brought down in the box by Jason Geria.</p>
        
            <p>"When he went to look at the screen I thought 'we're in trouble here'," Popovic said.</p>
        
            <p>Referee Daniel Elder initially waved play on but a minute later was asked by his VAR to look at the replay. It didn't take him long to award the penalty.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it was just a coming together, but they deemed it differently," Popovic said.</p>
        
            <p>"The overriding emotion is frustration. I'm frustrated we didn't come away with the three points. I thought we were very good in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>"At 1-nil it shows we've got a lot of growing to do because at that point we lost control of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to do better when we face that situation again, but for 80 odd minutes it was a very good performance."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington were forced to play the entire second half with 10 men after fullback Tim Payne was sent off shortly before halftime and they defended bravely before finding a breakthrough in the 79th minute.</p>

            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano brought on young forwards van Hattum and Luke Supyk in the closing stages to try and grab and equaliser and van Hattum earned the penalty at the start of stoppage time.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano couldn't watch as Rufer stepped up to the spot and cooly send the goalkeeper the wrong way.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in the corner just watching the crowd's reactions," he told media post-match. "I didn't even know Rufs took the penalty to be fair because I turned around as soon as the penalty was given.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually really happy that he took it because it's a big defining moment in the season.</p>
        
            <p>"For me that's what real leadership is; stepping up, irrespective of whether he scored or not. It takes a lot of bravery.</p>
        
            <p>"My gut was telling me that Victory were starting to drop off and were actually a little bit fearful and I felt as though if we kept pushing we were going to get a goal.</p>
        
            <p>"The moment that gave me the biggest belief was when Oskar van Hattum came into the top of the box and cut back in and I felt like 'right, we're in this game' so hats off to them."</p>
        
            <p>With the 1-1 draw the Phoenix secured a valuable point ensuring they will remain atop the A-League ladder for another week.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington will be back in action on Saturday week when they will visit Newcastle Jets in their first of five matches in just 21 days.</p>
