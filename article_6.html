            <p>Another Grand Slam, another quarterfinal for the New Zealand and Canadian combination of Erin Routliffe and Gaby Dabrowski.</p>
        
            <p>The second seeded pair are through to the last eight at the Australian Open, but only after another come from a set down victory.</p>
        
            <p>This time it was over 15th seeds Beatriz Hadda Maia (Brazil) and Germany's Laura Siegemund 6-7(5) 6-3 6-4 in two hours 29 minutes on Margaret Court Arena.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Dabrowski have now won all three of their matches in the tournament after dropping the first set.</p>
        
            <p>In the first set they led 5-2 only to see their lead chipped away as Dabrowski was broken in the ninth game and they lost the tiebreak with a Routliffe double fault and net error.</p>
        
            <p>In the second set Siegemund was broken on three occasions while Dabrowski had one break against her.</p>
        
            <p>The final set featured just the one vital break of serve which went against top 20 singles player Haddad Maia in the 10th game.</p>
        
            <p>The win follows on from their quarterfinal performance at the 2024 US Open, a runner-up finish at Wimbledon, semifinal at the 2024 Australian Open and a win at the 2023 US Open.</p>
        
            <p>The pair didn't play together at the 2024 French Open as Dabrowski was undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>
        
            <p>The victory will pit them against the unseeded pair of Miyu Kato (Japan) and Mexico's Renata Zarazua for a place in the semifinals at this year's tournament.</p>
