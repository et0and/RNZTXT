            <p>Wednesday 8 January</p>
        
            <p>Prelims begin 6.15pm NZT, main event expected about 11.45pm</p>

            <p>After an outstanding amateur career highlighted by two Commonwealth Games gold medals and an Olympic bronze, Kiwi David Nyika has been very vocal about his professional ambitions.</p>
        
            <p>Tonight, his future comes rushing to meet him, with an unexpected - and perhaps premature - shot at the IBF world cruiserweight title, currently held by Aussie Jai Opetaia.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika's opportunity has arisen, after German Huseyin Cinkara broke his foot in training and had to withdraw. Rather than let the occasion slip by, Opetaia's management compiled a short list of replacement fighters and Nyika did not hesitate when he got the call, even on just three weeks' notice.</p>
        
            <p>Now based in Queensland, the 10th-ranked Hamiltonian has compiled a 10-0 pro record, including nine knockouts, but this bout represents a massive step up from his previous fights.</p>
        
            <p>Opetaia won the IBF belt from Latvian Mairis Briedis at this same venue in July 2022 and has defended it four times, including a rematch against Briedis that left him with a broken jaw in two places last year.</p>

            <p>He has a 26-0 pro record, including 20 knockouts, and has sparred against Nyika previously.</p>
        
            <p>"We've shared very competitive rounds, but I think sparring is very different," said Nyika. "Come fight night, it's going to be whatever happens happens, but I truly believe the fans are going to get a really good show."</p>
        
            <p>Record: 26-0 (20 KO)</p>
        
            <p>From: Wyong, New South Wales</p>

            <p>Style: Orthodox</p>
        
            <p>If he wins, Nyika will be catapulted into the spotlight, facing challengers for his IBF belt. That could mean a rematch with Opetaia or an eventual showdown a healed Cinkara, who remains the No.1 contender in the division.</p>
        
            <p>He could also look to unite his crown with the other main belts, currently held by Mexican Gilberto Ramirez (WBA & WBO) and Armenian Norairn Mkaeljan (WBC).</p>
        
            <p>His success would give New Zealand three reigning world champions, with Lani Daniels holding the women's IBF light-heavyweight belt and Mea Motu ruling the women's IBO super-bantamweight ranks.</p>

            <p>That number may become four next month, if Joseph Parker can navigate his way past Daniel Dubois for the men's IBF heavyweight championship.</p>
        
            <p>If he loses, Nyika would presumably tumble back to the foot of the ladder and have to work his way back near the top. He could do this by targeting those other belts.</p>
        
            <p>In boxing, you're only ever one punch away from an upset, so you can never discount anyone prepared to step into the ring. Sylvester Stallone created an entire movie franchise on that premise.</p>

            <p>Given his limited preparation, Nyika is a heavy underdog and it wouldn't be a shock to see him simply outclassed by his opponent in a unanimous points decision. Whatever the outcome, he will doubtless learn valuable lessons that will serve him well in the future.</p>
