            <p>Black Caps senior players are buoyed by the bowling form of pace man Will O'Rourke ahead of the Champions Trophy which begins on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Cantabrian took four for 43 off 9.3 overs in New Zealand's victory over Pakistan in the final of the ODI Tri-Series in Karachi on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>He struck early in the Pakistan innings, having opener Fakhar Zaman caught by Will Young for 10 and later bowled danger man Mohammad Rizwan, also troubling other batters with his speed, bounce and swing and bounce.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan scored 242 in their 50 overs, and New Zealand won the final in their 46th over, with Daryl Mitchell top-scoring with 57 and Tom Latham hitting 56 in a welcome return to form.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the way O'Rourke bowled at the top of the innings was one of the keys to victory.</p>
        
            <p>"He's pretty tall and he gets a bit of bounce even on these surfaces, and he bowls at a good pace," said Mitchell. "He set the tone early.''</p>
        
            <p>Captain Mitch Santner was similarly complimentary, noting the fine efforts of O'Rourke and fellow opening bowler Jacob Duffy (1-48 off seven overs) in the early power play.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys did a great job upfront," Santner said. "We got wickets in the power play and it made us squeeze through the middle which was good."</p>
        
            <p>Santner was impressed with O'Rourke's ability to swing the ball, terming it "outstanding".</p>
        
            <p>He was also pleased with the return to form of Tom Latham, who had scored ducks in his three preceding innings.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone had faith and knew he could do it, it was just a matter of time,'' said Santner.</p>
        
            <p>The Tri-Series has been a valuable lead-up for the Black Caps, with Santner pleased that so many of his side have struck form.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone in the top six or seven fired at some stage and the bowlers have gone overs under their belt."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps play Pakistan at the National Stadium in the Champions Trophy opening match, starting 10pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Santner said he was ''pretty happy'' with how the lead-up has gone.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's crunch time in a few days' time."</p>
