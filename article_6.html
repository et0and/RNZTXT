            <p>Breakers import Freddie Gillespie will miss the opening game of the season after being given a one game suspension by the NBL Game Review Panel (GRP).</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie headbutted Sydney Kings player Shaun Bruce late in Friday night's match at the pre-season tournament on the Gold Coast, with the GRP determining the incident as intentional medium impact and high contact resulting in a two-game suspension, reduced to one game with an early guilty plea.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers and Gillespie have accepted the decision and submitted an early guilty plea.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers chief executive, Losa Edser, said Gillespie expressed deep remorse for his actions and recognised the impact on both the club and the league.</p>
        
            <p>"Freddie has owned his actions and shown genuine remorse, and we support him as he moves forward from this," Edser said.</p>

            <p>"The club accepts the suspension as a fair outcome, and we are focused on moving on in a positive manner. We are committed to making the 2024/25 season one of growth, unity, and success both on and off the court."</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie will sit out the Breakers' season opener on Saturday night against the Brisbane Bullets in Perth and should be available for the second round game against South East Melbourne Phoenix in Auckland the following weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers finished the pre-season tournament with three losses from three games, beaten by the Adelaide 36ers, the Perth Wildcats and the Sydney Kings.</p>
        
            <p>The Bullets won all three of their games to finish top of the standings.</p>
