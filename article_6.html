            <p>Silver Fern defender Kelly Jackson (nee Jury) has received the Dame Lois Muir supreme award for the second straight year.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson shared netball's top award with Silver Ferns goal shooter Grace Nweke in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The award recognises the best netballer across all competitions and campaigns.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke missed half of last year's international season when she got injured part-way through the Netball World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson, who has thrived since assuming the Pulse co-captaincy duties in 2022, topped the rebounds and deflection counts while placing second in intercepts across all players in the 2023 ANZ Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>At 1.92m, Jackson is a constant threat with her lean and rebounding ability while adding another dimension with her ball hunting skills.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson became a regular Silver Ferns starter and continued to grow her game and impact at international level.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson told Sky Sport that 2023 was full of ups and downs and the side's fourth finish at the World Cup was heartbreaking.</p>
        
            <p>"It was devastating, hard to look back on but I know we can only get stronger from that experience. It was really heartening to finish the Constellation Cup off with two big wins against Australia so we know we've got it in us," Jackson said.</p>

            <p>"At the moment Australia are extremely dominant, probably give them a little bit too much respect, need to back ourselves a little bit more.</p>
        
            <p>"I look at the group of players we've got and man a few more years of experience and we could be walking away with some gold medals."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson, who normally plays goal keep, spent some games at wing defence at last year's World Cup and said while the unfamiliar position was "uncomfortable" it helped her game.</p>
        
            <p>In a players' vote and launched for the first time, Southern Steel midcourter Kate Heffernan was the inaugural winner of the Sandra Edge Medal as the Silver Ferns Player of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old was one of New Zealand's best performers at the World Cup in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>Heffernan was named the midcourter of the World Cup; she picked up the same accolade at the Quad Series in January last year.</p>
        
            <p>The Men's Netball Player of the Year was shooter Thomson Matuku, who played a big part in the Net Blacks claiming another Fast 5 World title in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Livewire Silver Ferns midcourter Maddy Gordon was named the ANZ Premiership player of the year after another strong season with the Pulse.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon rebounded from a disappointing 2022 where she missed half the season due to injury and was not named in the Commonwealth Games team.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon also made a return to the Silver Ferns when she was named for in the World Cup team.</p>

            <p>Stythe said she had dreamed of being a Silver Fern since a young age and it was exciting knowing she was on the right track.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old was named in the Silver Ferns development squad last year.</p>
        
            <p>Defender Lisa Putt was named the National Netball League (NNL) player of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Putt had another strong season for the Comets, the feeder team to the South Auckland based Stars, who she was also a member of.</p>
        
            <p>Putt, who is on her OE in the United Kingdom, has signed with Team Bath in the England domestic competition.</p>
