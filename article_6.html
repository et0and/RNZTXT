            <p>New Zealand's Holly Robinson has won a silver medal in the shot put at the Par Athletics World Championships in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson threw an Oceania record 12.25m with her final throw to move up from third to second.</p>
        
            <p>It was the experienced 29-year-old's sixth Par World medal of her career.</p>
        
            <p>World record-holder Noelle Malkamaki of the US mounted a successful defence of her title with a best throw of 13.12m.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson, the Paralympic javelin F46 champion who opted to focus on the shot put only in Japan, was rewarded with more precious metal after steadily building through the competition which reached a glorious crescendo in the final round.</p>
        
            <p>Her 12.25m added 8cm to her national and Oceania record mark set in Christchurch in February.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said: "It was a real nerve-wracking comp a lot of the girls were throwing shorter distances. Heading into my last throw I knew I had a medal in the bag, but I really wanted silver.</p>
        
            <p>"I just wasn't technically nailing it [in the earlier rounds], I was a bit out of time the circle was quite sticky, so I needed to focus on getting that foot underneath. I managed to do that, and to produce a very good throw, I'm very happy.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling a bit of relief and excitement. Today proves I can get over that 12m mark again. I've only been over 12m once in my life before today, so to hit it again I was really happy. I know there is a lot more there, so I can't wait for Paris and I'm looking forward to what the next few months will hold."</p>
