            <p>Middle distance runner Maia Ramsden has shattered the New Zealand women's mile record which has stood for 37 years.</p>
        
            <p>Competing at the Bor√•s Folksam meet in Sweden, Ramsden finished second in the race running 4 minutes 24.79 seconds to better Christine Pfitzinger's 1987 mark by almost six seconds.</p>
        
            <p>This result builds on a successful debut Olympic campaign, during which she lowered her own New Zealand 1500m record to 4:02.20 in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old Harvard graduate recently moved from the NCAA to the professional circuit and is now to be permanently based in Boulder, Colorado with the On Athletics Club joining fellow Kiwi George Beamish who is the New Zealand steeple chase record holder.</p>
