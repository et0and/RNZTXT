            <p>A dominant India ended England's title defence by handing them a 68-run thumping in the second semi-final of the cricket T20 World Cup, securing their place in the final against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Put into bat in the rain-hit match, India posted a strong 171-7 with skipper Rohit Sharma (57) and Suryakumar Yadav (47) scoring bulk of the runs on a slow track at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.</p>
        
            <p>The 2007 champions then returned to bundle out England for 103 inside 17 overs with their spin duo of Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav wreaking havoc with the turning ball.</p>
        
            <p>It will be a clash of the tournament's two unbeaten sides when India lock horns with South Africa in Bridgetown on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very satisfying to win this game," an elated Rohit, playing potentially his last T20 World Cup, said.</p>
        
            <p>"We worked really hard as a unit. To win like that was a great effort from everybody."</p>
        
            <p>Rain and a wet outfield delayed start of the match and England captain Jos Buttler elected to field after winning the toss.</p>
        
            <p>India managed 46 runs from the six power-play overs and it cost them the wickets of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit began with a couple of streaky shots but soon grew in confidence.</p>
        
            <p>Suryakumar, at the other end, scooped Chris Jordan over fine leg in what has been his trademark shot for a six before rain stopped play with India 65-2 in eight overs.</p>
        
            <p>Once play resumed more than an hour later, Rohit reached his 36-ball fifty with a six, which also brought up India's 100 in the 13th over.</p>
        
            <p>Adil Rashid bowled Rohit and Jofra Archer denied Suryakumar a fifty to temporarily peg back India.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan (3-37) dismissed Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube with successive deliveries but India still managed to post a competitive total.</p>
        
            <p>England began briskly but were reeling at 49-5 after a top order meltdown triggered by Axar (3-23).</p>
        
            <p>The left-arm spinner dismissed Buttler (23) with his first ball and removed Jonny Bairstow for a duck in his next over.</p>
        
            <p>In between, Phil Salt had his leg stump pegged back by Jasprit Bumrah.</p>
        
            <p>Player-of-the-match Axar returned to dismiss Moeen Ali, stumped before fellow spinner Kuldeep (3-19) twisted the knife on a slow pitch where the ball occasionally kept low.</p>
        
            <p>The left-arm wrist spinner trapped both Sam Curran and Jordan and clean-bowled Harry Brook (25) to put India firmly in charge.</p>
        
            <p>"India outplayed us, certainly," Buttler said.</p>
        
            <p>"We let them maybe get 20-25 too many on a challenging surface that they played well on. They fully deserved to win."</p>
        
            <p>Under Buttler, England failed to defend their 50-overs World Cup title in India last year.</p>
