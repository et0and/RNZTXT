            <p>The Black Caps have scored a four run win over Pakistan in the fourth T20 cricket international in Lahore.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps lead the series 2-1, with the final game on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>After being asked to bat first New Zealand scored 178 for seven, while Pakistan finished on 174 for eight.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Robinson and Tom Blundell put on 56 for the opening wicket with 21-year-old Robinson finishing on 51.</p>
        
            <p>Blundell made 28, while number three batter Dean Foxcroft added 34.</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowler Abbas Afridi took three wickets for Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>In reply Pakistan lost regular wickets with Will O'Rourke dismissing both openers and Ben Sears the next two.</p>
        
            <p>The homeside fell behind the required run-rate and needed 18 off the last over, which was bowled by James Neesham.</p>
        
            <p>Fakhar Zaman top scored with 61.</p>
        
            <p>O'Rourke took three wickets for 27 runs, while Sears finished with two for 27.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking after the game, captain Michael Bracewell said it was pleasing they had made progress.</p>
        
            <p>"The way we have learned from game to game is hugely important. Fortunately, we are able to come on the right side today. I think our last five overs as a bowling unit were particularly impressive," Bracewell said.</p>
        
            <p>The first match was washed out, Pakistan won the second by seven wickets and New Zealand won the third by seven wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The fifth and final game is in Lahore on Sunday morning.</p>
