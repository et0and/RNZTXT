            <p>The New Zealand athletics contingent for the Paris Olympics has been finalised, with 1500m runner Maia Ramsden securing her place.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden's confirmation completes the makeup of the New Zealand athletics team with 17 Kiwi athletes set to compete in the black singlet in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden, a 22-year-old Harvard University graduate student, has had a phenomenal 2024, winning NCAA mile and 1500m gold, and setting a new 1500m national record of 4:02.58 in Los Angeles in May.</p>
        
            <p>"I really didn't have the words when I was told, I kind of just burst into tears. I think it's just every kids dream and so I'm definitely still processing but I feel so excited for this opportunity," Ramsden said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was lucky to have a really good support system of people who recommended I keep going on this path while we didn't know the outcome.</p>
        
            <p>"The best preparation for the games is going to be what I have been doing, which is training hard, recovering well while continuing to enjoy running in the way that I do. I tried to stay present while my coaches and I discussed shutting down the season when we did because there were a couple more weeks where I could have kept chasing the standard, but it has been a really long season.</p>
        
            <p>"We talked about how if I did qualify, I would want to be prepared and put my best self on the line in Paris so that was really a big part of the decision."</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden has a proven international record and is known for her tactical abilities. She has back-to-back 2023 and 2024 NCAA Division 1 titles, and is the first woman in 20 years to achieve the feat. She also finished 10th in the 1500m in her debut World Indoor Championships, in March this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Maia has had an inspirational year, confirming her potential and ability to race well when it really matters. It's fantastic to have her joining the team in Paris," said Scott Newman, Athletics NZ high performance director.</p>
        
            <p>"We are thrilled with the 17-strong team we have assembled for Paris. With an exciting mix of debutants and experienced campaigners, we are optimistic for our team's performance at this Summer Olympic Games."</p>
