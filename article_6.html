            <p>Tayla Ford will become the first New Zealand woman to wrestle at the Olympics after winning selection for this year's Games in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The Adelaide-based 30-year-old will cap 20 years in the sport, which has previously taken her to three Commonwealth Games, where she won bronze models at both Glasgow 2014 and Birmingham 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a dream come true and it still feels pretty surreal at the moment," Ford said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always wanted to make the Olympics, and to become the first female wrestler from New Zealand to do so is pretty special.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in Glasgow, I made history as the first New Zealand woman to win a Commonwealth Games medal in wrestling. It's always been a goal of mine to make history, it's part of what motivates me so it's pretty amazing."</p>

            <p>Ford secured her Olympic qualification last month, winning her pool in the under-68kg division at the Africa / Oceania qualifying event in Egypt.</p>
        
            <p>She began wrestling when her father heard that women's wrestling had been added to the sport programme at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"He wrestled in high school so he got back into it and I joined him," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a mat in the garage where we'd train and we had a video tape of wrestling at the Sydney Olympics which we'd just play constantly while we were training."</p>
        
            <p>The Nelson-born, Christchurch-raised, athlete is based in Adelaide where she coaches wrestling.</p>
        
            <p>NZOC Nicki Nicol was delighted history would be made in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"I know a huge amount of work has gone in to get to this point and I'd like to congratulate Tayla for her perseverance, and for showing a generation of young New Zealand wrestlers what's possible when you put your mind to it," Nicol said.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic wrestling programme will be held from 5-11 August at the Champ-de-Mars Arena in Central Paris.</p>
