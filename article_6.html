            <p>Queenstown skier Alice Robinson admits she's probably been a bit braver this season, hoping that will help her at the World Championships in Austria over the next week.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old currently sits top of the World Cup giant slalom standings after a stunning start to the season, including four podium finishes and a victory.</p>
        
            <p>The win in Italy last month was the fourth of her career, but first since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson will be competing in her fourth World Championships this week after making her debut in 2019. Her Super G race will be on Thursday night, with the Giant Slalom to follow next week</p>
        
            <p>"I feel really calm. I feel like I'm just going into another World Cup race," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The Saalbach resort in Austria was familiar - it hosted the World Cup Finals last year, and she occasionally trains there.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said she was going into the world champs feeling competitive.</p>
        
            <p>"My performances have been really solid and I've been consistent this year, so coming into this my confidence is high and I'm just focusing on executing on the day."</p>
        
            <p>While her results may look better this season, Robinson did not feel she was skiing any better.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year I was skiing really well as well and I was on the podium and close to winning.</p>
        
            <p>"This year is the same, but maybe I'm more confident. And when I won a couple of weeks ago I was finally brave and had the confidence to take a few more risks and try and take it up a gear."</p>

            <p>Over her career Robinson has 14 World Cup podiums in giant slalom, including the win at Kronplatz in Italy last month. That event was her main focus this week.</p>
        
            <p>She had history on the course in Saalbach, finishing second in a World Cup race there last year.</p>
        
            <p>"I like the hill - it's a track that you have to be pushing a lot the whole way down, which is cool and so I'm feeling good.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited - it's special being in a place like this just because it's a big part of their culture with the biggest event of their year."</p>
        
            <p>The stars of the sport were all at the World Championships, including Mikaela Shiffrin, Lindsey Vonn, Lara Gut-Behrami and Federica Brignone. So did Robinson feel like she was a part of that group now?</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still just happy to keep my head down, but I guess it's pretty cool to be considered one of the favourites going into a medal event.</p>
        
            <p>"I compete with these girls every weekend and so it's business as usual."</p>
        
            <p>The giant slalom is a longer course than the slalom, with the poles or gates spaced further apart and skiers sometimes able to reach speeds of 80km/h.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson will also race the Super G, which is longer than the giant slalom but not as long as the downhill.</p>
