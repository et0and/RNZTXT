            <p>The Warriors will return to the NRLW next season with one of the competition's leading players named as their first signing.</p>
        
            <p>Fullback Apii Nicholls was a foundation player for the Warriors' women's side in 2018 and made six appearances for the club before they exited the competition four years ago.</p>
        
            <p>After missing the 2020 and 2021 seasons during the Covid outbreak, Nicholls resumed her NRLW career with the Gold Coast Titans in 2022 before linking with the Canberra Raiders last year.</p>
        
            <p>During her time away from the Warriors, Nicholls has been a finalist for the NRLW Golden Boot award last year and the 14-Test Kiwi Ferns fullback was named in the team of the tournament at the 2022 Rugby League World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls has now made 26 NRLW appearances and new Warriors women's coach Ron Griffiths said the 31-year-old personified the type of player and person he wanted to build the team around.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been calculated in the players we have targeted, people with the right character," Griffiths said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important that all have an understanding that there is a natural order of club, team and individual. Furthermore we will be invested in the community and immerse ourselves in and respect all cultural aspects of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls, a former Otahuhu Leopards junior, said the decision to return to New Zealand "came down to both footy and family and the support we have back home on and off the field".</p>
        
            <p>The mother of two said her conversations with Griffiths were "really positive" and she was looking forward to developing her game under his guidance.</p>
        
            <p>"The Raiders really welcomed me here and I'm forever grateful for this opportunity but I'd be lying if I said I didn't always want to get home, eventually. To pull that (Warriors) jersey on again, it's going to be special.</p>
        
            <p>"The Warriors is always where I wanted to end up, it's home. And the opportunity to help grow and guide some of our awesome local talent is something that really excites me."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors are one of two teams added to the expanded 12-team NRLW competition next year.</p>
