            <p>Afghanistan's one-off "home" test against New Zealand near Delhi could not get underway even on day two on Tuesday raising questions about the preparedness of the venue.</p>
        
            <p>Deemed unsafe by touring teams, Afghanistan are forced to play their home matches in venues abroad, including at the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sport Complex in Greater Noida.</p>
        
            <p>The venue has a basic drainage system and the ground staff's task became doubly difficult after the region witnessed regular rain in the last two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>For the second day in a row, overnight rain left several damp patches and a wet outfield that did not allow any action.</p>
        
            <p>"Day 2 of the one-off #AFGvNZ Test has officially been called off. Despite multiple efforts to dry the surface, the outfield remained unfit for play," the Afghanistan Cricket Board said on X.</p>
        
            <p>The groundstaff brought chunks of green patches from the practice area and even used standing fans to dry the outfield before match officials called off play.</p>
