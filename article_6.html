            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have created history.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time ever, the club will finish the regular A-League season inside the top two after a dramatic win over Victory in torrential Wellington rain.</p>
        
            <p>They left it late, but Finn Surman delivered the decisive blow in the 94th minute, which deflected off Melbourne player Roderick Miranda.</p>
        
            <p>It came courtesy of a pinpoint-free kick by substitute Oskar Van Hattum, as 20-year-old defender Surman stormed ahead of the crowd to head it home.</p>
        
            <p>Returning Phoenix captain Alex Rufer told Sky Sport it was crucial that they bounced back from last week's loss to Central Coast Mariners.</p>
        
            <p>"We fought right till the end, so pleased for the lads, it was a tough result last week, but we wanted to take how we felt then into this game, I think we did that and we thoroughly deserved the win."</p>
        
            <p>Rufer said the message was to stay calm and not do anything silly.</p>
        
            <p>"Games are won from small moments and we did that at end. We didn't doubt ourselves, we have always believed and now we are showing everyone what we can do, now we have to not be complacent, and stay consistent."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington tops the A-League table with 49 points, eight clear of third-placed Victory and three ahead of Mariners in second.</p>
        
            <p>The Nix' created a plethora of scoring opportunities throughout the 90 minutes, but struggled with their final execution.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Paulsen was called on to make a number of strong saves, while Ben Old was threatening throughout.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix can still end up in second, but have already guaranteed their best-ever regular season finish.</p>
        
            <p>Next weekend they will meet the Jets in Newcastle.</p>
