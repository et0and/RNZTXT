            <p>Sri Lanka stayed on course for victory against New Zealand in the opening test in Galle despite Rachin Ravindra's unbeaten 91 on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 275 for victory, New Zealand got off to a shaky start and kept losing wickets particularly to Sri Lankan spinners Prabath Jayasuriya (3-66) and Romesh Mendis (3-83), who tormented them on a day four track.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists were 207-8, 68 runs behind their victory target, at stumps with hosts Sri Lanka taking the upper hand in the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra hit nine fours and a six in his defiant knock while Ajaz Patel was yet to open his account at the other end having faced 15 deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Patel ran through the bottom half of the Sri Lanka lineup as the hosts reached 309 before being all out.</p>
        
            <p>After Saturday's rest day due to the presidential election in the country, Sri Lanka resumed on 237-4 hardly anticipating a batting collapse in which their last six batters managed a combined 72 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Left-arm spinner Patel removed Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva (40) and Angelo Mathews (50) claiming five of the last six Sri Lankan wickets to finish with figures of 6-90.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opener Devon Conway fell early in their chase and the tourists kept losing wickets every time a partnership began to bloom.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Latham (28), Kane Williamson (30) and Tom Blundell (30) got starts but could not convert them into big knocks.</p>
        
            <p>While the target is not beyond New Zealand's reach, Sri Lanka will bank on their spinners to get the job done on a day five pitch.</p>
