            <p>Pollution in the River Seine has forced the cancellation of proposed swimming training for Olympic triathletes in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>A joint statement from Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said that tests had shown the water quality was below an acceptable standard.</p>
        
            <p>In June, tests revealed unsafe levels of E coli and enterococci bacteria in the Seine.</p>
        
            <p>After further testing in July, the River Seine was deemed to be clean enough for swimming but heavy rain in the French capital over the past 48 hours has seen the quality diminish.</p>
        
            <p>"The priority is the health of the athletes," the statement read.</p>
        
            <p>"The tests carried out in the Seine [on Saturday] revealed water quality levels that in the view of the international federation, World Triathlon, did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the weather forecast for the next 48 hours, Paris 2024 and World Triathlon are confident that water quality will return to below limits before the start for of the triathlon competitions (on 30 July)."</p>
        
            <p>Should the water quality not reach the required standard, the triathlon events could be postponed for a few days or moved to Vaires-sur-Marne, east of Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The swimming leg of the triathlon familiarisation had been due to take place this morning. The bike and running training will go ahead as planned.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic triathlon was due to begin on Tuesday with the men's event, followed by the women's a day later.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Hayden Wilde won bronze at the Tokyo Games and is a contender for a medal in Paris.</p>
