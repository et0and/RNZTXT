            <p>Richard Tutaki, a former New Zealand heavyweight title contender, has died aged 46.</p>
        
            <p>Tutaki, who was known as the Tutaki Express Train, fought in the same era as well-known New Zealand fighters like Shane Cameron and Joseph Parker.</p>
        
            <p>He died earlier this week after what was believed to be a heart attack.</p>
        
            <p>Tutaki had 49 professional fights for 21 wins.</p>
        
            <p>In 2012, Tutaki was named to fight Sonny Bill Williams for the New Zealand heavyweight title but he was later dropped from the card as he was facing criminal charges.</p>
        
            <p>Later that year, Tutaki fought the future world champion Joseph Parker as the headline bout at Fight for Life, losing in three rounds.</p>
        
            <p>The Aucklander was pegged as a promising heavyweight prospect but did not reach the heights of former champions David Tua and Parker.</p>
        
            <p>Boxing New Zealand president Steve Hartley said the organisation extended its condolences to Tutaki's family.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand professional boxing judge Benjamin Watt said Tutaki's death was a huge blow to the boxing community.</p>
        
            <p>"Richard Tutaki was a great man who achieved a lot in boxing and has fought some of the best heavyweight boxers to come out of the south Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"In his 22-year boxing career, he won his first professional title winning the New Zealand national and WBC Australasian Silver titles in 2023. He will be missed."</p>
