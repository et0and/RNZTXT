            <p>Unbeaten Kiwi cruiserweight David Nyika has joined forces with current WBO interim heavyweight boxing champion Joseph Parker to headline a card in Auckland later this year.</p>
        
            <p>In Parker's first foray into promotion, he has signed a multi-fight partnership, starting with a main event featuring Nyika on 14 September.</p>
        
            <p>A collaboration with Duco Events and streaming service DAZN, the card promises to bring 'big time boxing' back to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Parker said he has long known Nyika, who is 9-0 as a professional, was touted for greatness.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember sparing him in the Junior Fa camp, we had some great rounds together, he has the talent, skills, drive and work ethic, and now he has the right team around him that can take him to the top. There is no ceiling, we have such a talent here in front of us."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika has been blasting thorough the cruiserweight division of late, racking up six consecutive knockouts since July 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"You just look at the amateur pedigree he has, now it's time for him to show the world what he can do, everyone will be buzzing about having him back fighting on home soil."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika last fought in Aotearoa on the undercard of Parker vs Fa in February 2021, also his professional debut.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, Covid-19 robbed the young prodigy of a proper celebration following his 29-second knockout of Jesse Malo.</p>
        
            <p>Five minutes before he walked out, alerts blasted throughout arena.</p>
        
            <p>"So everyone had to go home after, I didn't get to enjoy it with my friends and my family so I am looking forward to going out and having a beer with you all."</p>
        
            <p>His September opponent is yet to be announced but promoter David Higgins assured it would be a tough fight.</p>
        
            <p>"All that's left to do now is to perform and to keep performing. I feel like i've got the right team behind me to slingshot me into the galaxy, man, we're going to go all the way."</p>
        
            <p>Parker said Nyika had the temperament, marketability and skills to become a world champion.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very excited for the opportunity to be promoting David to the world. He has great work ethic. He's got good height, got good reach, abs that I've always wanted. He looks good, speaks very well. And the thing is, he trains very hard. And he takes his training as seriously. I think under the guidance of Noel Thornberry, David Higgins, and myself, backing him, we're gonna go all the way to the top, and I'm very excited about this."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika said the investment in his future does add a bit of pressure on his shoulders.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm starting to feel a little bit of impostor syndrome creeping in, we have so many amazing people backing us and I feel incredibly blessed to be in this position, I feel like I've grown so much in the last few years."</p>
        
            <p>He said September's card will help see a resurgence in the sport in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"All eyes are going to be on Auckland city, it's going to be huge."</p>
