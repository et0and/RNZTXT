            <p>The Kiwis have bolstered their coaching line-up with almost 90 caps of test experience.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Stacey Jones has finalised his coaching staff ahead of the 2024 Pacific Championships. It features six former Kiwis, including assistant coaches Nathan Cayless and Adam Blair.</p>
        
            <p>Former Warrington and St George head coach Steve Price returns for his third year as Kiwis assistant coach, having been with the team since the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Jones' former Kiwis teammate Cayless also returns to the staff after serving as Kiwis assistant coach and Kiwis A head coach in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Steve Price brings his defensive mindset. That was a big part of the group last year, having a strong defensive game plan and he brought that," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nathan Cayless has a strong connection with our middle forwards and brings both attacking and defensive knowledge."</p>
        
            <p>Fifty-test Kiwi Adam Blair enters his maiden season as Kiwis assistant coach off the back of his involvement with both Kiwis and Kiwis A teams in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"The Kiwis has always given me a place of purpose ... to be able to represent my country and my family was always an honour," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now being given an opportunity to be involved as an assistant coach, it is a privilege to help shape the next generation of Kiwi players.</p>
        
            <p>"I am a competitor and want the Kiwis to be the best team in the world."</p>
        
            <p>The team's wider staff is bolstered by Stephen Kearney, the 2008 World Cup-winning Kiwis head coach and former Kiwi who steps into the role of culture and leadership advisor.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw what Steve did in the campaign last year, the connection he created by giving the group a good understanding of what playing for the Kiwis means. Steve's got a strong insight into that," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Halligan (kicking coach) and David Solomona (wellbeing manager) round out the cohort of six former Kiwis in Jones' team staff.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Kiwis will play in the Pacific Championships international test series later this year, with a full schedule still to be released.</p>
