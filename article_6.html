        <p>

            <p>Cam Roigard might have played himself into the All Blacks starting XV and he can't wait to test himself against the "best" halfback in the world.</p>
        
            <p>With Cortez Ratima struggling in last weekend's win over Ireland Roigard was called on as a replacement and impressed as the All Blacks ended the hosts' 19-match winning run in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>He was also solid in his time off the bench in the win over England at Twickenham.</p>
        
            <p>Roigard, who missed the Rugby Championship through injury, isn't worried if he stays in the reserves.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah. I've loved it. It's obviously great being back in the All Black environment. It was a goal from when I was injured to get back here and to play the past three games has been awesome," Roigard said.</p>
        
            <p>"I love my role coming off the bench and to get the results we were after was great. Obviously, really tight games against great sides. It's the games that you want to play in and to be able to contribute what I have so far has been pleasing for myself.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever comes over the next few weeks I'm just hoping that I can keep putting my hand up and doing what's best for the team."</p>
        
            <p>Whether he starts or not Roigard should get a shot at taking on France star Antoine Dupont, who many pundits consider not only the best halfback in the world, but the best player full stop.</p>
        
            <p>Roigard said it was the kind of challenge that motivated a player.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hugely exciting. He's got a great skill set and he has the ability to make or break games,' Roigard said.</p>
        
            <p>"He can create line breaks from nothing and put his side in the right areas of the field to win games. So, if I do come across or go against him it'll be a really exciting opportunity for myself to play against the best."</p>
        
            <p>Dupont took a break from rugby after the World Cup to help France win Sevens gold at this year's Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks assistant coach Scott Hansen who was a halfback in his playing days said the Frenchman's abilities were exceptional.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot spoken about Anton and for me he's an absolute pleasure to watch. He loves the game. He plays with great passion. He's obviously a great leader. His skill set, his power, he's a phenomenal player, and one I've watched for many years," Hansen said.</p>
        
            <p>"A young man to play the game the way he does, many would say he's one of the greatest already."</p>
        
            <p>Hansen believes the All Blacks halfbacks, Ratima and Roigard, will relish the opportunity to take on Dupont.</p>
        
            <p>"They'll be inspired to play against essentially the master on the weekend and they'll learn from that."</p>
        
            <p>Roigard hasn't played a lot this year due to a serious knee injury and the World Cup runner-up is keen to make up for lost time. He said one benefit of his layoff is that he's feeling fresh near the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"It was probably six months before my return to play games. So it sort of felt like my season was just beginning. Everyone's getting to the back end where they might have played 10 games or something for the All Blacks and the Super Rugby season as well.</p>
        
            <p>"That adds up for them. But me coming in, I feel like I'm pretty fresh. I guess with that as a positive thing that I'm able to add some energy where I can.</p>
        
            <p>"I am really keen to come into the group and try add some value where I can and get back to trying to play the best rugby that I can and add some value within the group, whether it's playing or off the bench or whatever they might look like."</p>
        
            <p>After wins over England and Ireland, Roigard said the All Blacks are determined to end their two-game losing streak against the French and gain some revenge for last year's loss in their opening World Cup pool game in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"As a whole team we've had two big tests and the challenge for us now is to back it up again against the quality French side, in their backyard as well.</p>
        
            <p>"So, yeah, it's another big week, but we're really excited for it."</p>
