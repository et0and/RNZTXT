        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific: Blues keen to focus on performance, rather than final opponent</h2>
        <p>
Skipper Dalton Papali'i says his side has learned from their 2022 final experience: "We know what's on the line."
</p>
        
            <p>The Blues are looking to get back into training and focus on their own performance, rather than who they are playing in next weekend's final.</p>
        
            <p>Their 34-20 win over the Brumbies at Eden Park on Friday night was one that coach Vern Cotter said made him "really, really happy".</p>
        
            <p>"They prepared well during the week, you could feel the concern, tension around big games. We started well because of it ... we probably needed that, things aren't going to be easy all the time," Cotter said.</p>
        
            <p>The win over the Brumbies was built on a very fast start, with AJ Lam scoring inside two minutes, then tries to Ricky Riccitelli, Sam Darry and Caleb Clarke establishing a 24-6 lead after only 20 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>A strong scrum provided some crucial penalties and field position, while the Blues' direct attack kept the Brumbies backpedalling far too often for the Australians to ever gain any momentum of their own.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskins Sotutu's massive return to form continued, crossing the line for the 12th time in 2024 and equalling Doug Howlett and Mark Tele'a's record for tries in a season for the Blues.</p>

            <p>Cotter was pleased with the way his side executed straight from the opening kick-off.</p>
        
            <p>"Those are things we can take to the final. We need to be smarter and better but overall, really happy this group gets to go [to] a final and gets a crack at it."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said he did not have a preference as to who he would like to win Saturday's second semi-final, saying that the prospect of playing the Hurricanes or Chiefs was like "choosing between the plague or cholera".</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be the team that wins and we'll do our prep based on what we can do, how we can pay our game. Winning is the key."</p>
        
            <p>His sentiments were echoed by skipper Dalton Papali'i, who was quick to point out the Blues were keen to play "any team".</p>
        
            <p>"We've been reminded twice this year, once against the Canes and once against the Crusaders, we can't leave anything unchecked."</p>
        
            <p>Papali'i said that the lessons learned from the 2022 final, where they lost 21-7 to the Crusaders despite having home field advantage, would come in handy next week.</p>
        
            <p>"In the back of our mind we've got one more job to do. We've been in this situation before and failed, so we know what's on the line. We know we have to train the house down and get our bodies right."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Papali'i had initially failed a head injury assessment towards the end of the game, but said there had been some confusion in the way it had been taken.</p>
        
            <p>He said that he was confident of passing a second test and being available for next weekend's final, wherever it would be played.</p>
