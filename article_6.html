            <p>A former All Blacks captain has been called on to lead the charge in selecting the next New Zealand Rugby Board.</p>

            <p>The panel encompasses representatives from grassroots right through to the professional level.</p>
        
            <p>The panel has already met twice over the past ten days to express their vision for the board and outline the sought after credentials of its future members.</p>
