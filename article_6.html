            <p>England women's captain Heather Knight has been reprimanded and issued a suspended 1,000 pounds (NZ$2127) fine after she admitted to a charge over a 2012 social media post, England's Cricket Regulator said.</p>
        
            <p>Knight was pictured in blackface in a social media post in 2012 when she attended a fancy dress party at a cricket club in Kent.</p>
        
            <p>The photo was deemed offensive and in breach of ECB directive 3.3, about "acts or omission prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring cricket/cricketers into disrepute".</p>
        
            <p>The report by the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC), however, stated that Knight had "no racist or discriminatory intent".</p>

            <p>Knight, who was 21 at the time of the incident, apologised for her naivety and said there was no malice behind the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm truly sorry for the mistake I made in 2012," Knight said in a statement issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).</p>
        
            <p>"It was wrong, and I have long regretted it. Back then, I simply was not as educated as to the implications and consequences of my actions as I have become since. There was no ill-intent meant.</p>
        
            <p>"While I can't change the past, I am passionate and committed to using my platform to promote inclusivity across the game, ensuring under-represented groups are afforded the same opportunities and fulfilment within the game as I have."</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old was appointed England captain in 2016 and will lead the team in the upcoming women's T20 World Cup, starting on 3 October in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
