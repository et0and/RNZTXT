            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson has had his first outing on the Albert Park circuit ahead of this weekend's Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson hit the circuit in an Australian Supercar, driving former champion James Courtney on a hot lap of the Melbourne track.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson said 2010 Supercar champion Courtney was one of his heroes growing up.</p>
        
            <p>It was Lawson's first time behind the wheel of a Supercar.</p>
        
            <p>The 23 year old has 11 F1 races under his belt but none have been in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>There will be four Supercars races across four days at Albert Park this week.</p>
        
            <p>Formula One practice starts on Friday with qualifying on Saturday and the race at 5pm (NZ time) on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson had some issues with his car in pre-season testing in Bahrain last month.</p>
