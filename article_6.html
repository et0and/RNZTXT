            <p>Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep mounted a defiant 10th wicket stand to help India avoid the follow-on on day four of the third test in Brisbane on Tuesday as Australia's slight hopes of victory were further diminished by an injury to Josh Hazlewood.</p>
        
            <p>Opener KL Rahul and recalled all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also scored brave fifties as India dug deep on another rain-blighted day at the Gabba.</p>
        
            <p>With a gloom falling over the stadium, Deep sent a thick edge off Pat Cummins flying over a leaping fielder at gully for four runs to push India to safety, sparking celebrations among teammates watching in the stands.</p>
        
            <p>Number 11 Deep smashed the Australia captain for six two balls later with a touch of arrogance, then blocked another delivery before stumps were called due to failing light.</p>
        
            <p>Deep was unbeaten on 27, with Bumrah on 10, the tailenders having pushed India to 252 for nine, still 193 runs behind Australia's first innings 445.</p>
        
            <p>Their unbroken 39-run partnership has all but saved India from defeat and a 2-1 deficit in the five-test series, with Australia forced to bat again and left with little time to take another 10 wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts' task has been made tougher with a calf injury to fast bowler Hazlewood, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the test and is expected to miss the rest of the five-match series.</p>
        
            <p>"It was not just the runs they got but the heart they showed. It will give us as a group a lot of confidence," Rahul said of the Deep-Bumrah rearguard.</p>
        
            <p>"When it mattered they played some very exciting shots.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really good to see that they could get that partnership and avoid the follow-on.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes a huge difference knowing that there is a bit of rain around. We needed to find a way to stay in the game. Bumrah and Akash did that. It was a good way to end the day for us."</p>
        
            <p>India had resumed on 201 for seven after tea, still 45 runs short of avoiding the follow-on.</p>
        
            <p>It looked bleak for them when Jadeja holed out with a pull-shot off Cummins to fall for 77, with Mitchell Marsh bolting in from deep square leg to take a fine, low catch.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Starc had earlier done for Mohammed Siraj, the number nine caught behind for one.</p>
        
            <p>But with Hazlewood out of commission and spinner Nathan Lyon ineffective, a fatigued Starc and Cummins were unable to grab the last wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Rain breaks continuously sapped Australia's momentum but Cummins found time to take the wicket of Nitish Kumar Reddy for 16 before tea when the all-rounder chopped onto his stumps.</p>
        
            <p>That broke a patient 53-run stand with Jadeja, who was crucial to India avoiding the follow-on.</p>
        
            <p>As was Rahul.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Smith dropped Rahul on 33 with the first ball of the morning when Cummins had the opener edge to the slips.</p>
        
            <p>Rahul went on to score 84 before Smith redeemed himself with a stunning catch at slip to deny him a century, leaping to his right to pluck a one-hander off Lyon's bowling.</p>
        
            <p>Though Australia have dominated the rain-hit test, time will most likely deny the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>Whichever way the match goes, India captain Rohit Sharma will face more scrutiny after another failure with the bat.</p>
        
            <p>He was caught behind for 10 in the morning, nicking fast bowler Cummins with a lead-footed drive after being softened up by a bouncer from the Australian skipper.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit has 19 runs from his three innings in the series, having missed India's victory in Perth while caring for his newborn son.</p>
