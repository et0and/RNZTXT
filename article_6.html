            <p>Football Ferns captain Ali Riley has reminded her teammates that Olympic selection is at stake when they play Thailand in the second international friendly in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are firm favourites to send the Asian side home winless on Tuesday (7pm kickoff) after dissecting the world No 47 ranked side 4-0 at the same venue on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>With the 28th-ranked Football Ferns emerging with no injury concerns from the opener - their first match on home soil since co-hosting last year's FIFA World Cup - Riley expects their standards to stay high.</p>

            <p>Coach Jitka Klimkova described the squad as a "competitive environment" as she mulls her 18-woman squad to attend the Paris Games in August and Riley said that message won't be lost.</p>
        
            <p>"There are young players here so it's driving home that we still have standards and habits and there are things that we want to have in place because we are getting ready for an Olympics right now and we're competing for spots for an Olympics," Riley said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think that message has been really clear and you saw in the mentality in the performance (on Saturday) that we weren't happy with one goal, two goals.</p>
        
            <p>"The second game will be a good challenge because Thailand will want to come back and change something.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to not only change the performance, but be even better."</p>

            <p>Klimkova was pleased with four goals on the scoresheet but equally satisfied to keep a clean sheet - having not allowed the Thais a single shot on goal - and she said solidity at the back would be a priority once again.</p>
        
            <p>"We know we are tough to play against defensively so we want to keep that shape so we are not conceding any shots on goal," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our goal is to keep our presence on the field similar to what we have done because that was one of our very very strong performances defensively."</p>
        
            <p>The buildup to the match has been dominated by the retirement announcement of Football Ferns great Ria Percival, whose 166 senior international appearances was the most by any New Zealand player - male or female.</p>
        
            <p>Klimkova said the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder had established an immeasurable legacy and that many of the players in her squad this week had long looked up to 34-year-old Percival.</p>
        
            <p>"She has done so much for women's football and for this team. She was always inspirational and a great role model for a lot of players in this team."</p>
