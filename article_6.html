            <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are chasing an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl crown, while the Philadelphia Eagles are eyeing a second title overall in the NFL's championship game.</p>
        
            <p>The clash will be a rematch of Super Bowl LVII in 2023 when the Chiefs defeated the Eagles 38-35.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagles have played 54 playoff games (28-26) since being founded 91 years ago, winning their only Super Bowl in 2018 when they beat the New England Patriots.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs have played 47 playoff games (26-21) since their formation in 1959, winning four Super Bowls -- the third highest in the league's history alongside the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagles' latest Super Bowl appearance came in 2023 when they let a 10-point halftime lead slip through their fingers as the Chiefs triumphed 38-35 at Super Bowl 57.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs will make their fifth trip to the NFL title decider in six years and could become the first team to hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy three years in a row if they beat the Eagles, having beaten the San Francisco 49ers last year.</p>

            <p>The Eagles have played in four Super Bowls in their history, losing three.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs hold a commanding 4-2 record in six Super Bowls.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, the Eagles delivered an inspiring script by upsetting the then defending champions the Patriots with a 41-33 victory to clinch their only Super Bowl title, completing a remarkable turnaround after finishing last in their division in the 2016-17 season.</p>
        
            <p>For the Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes threw a touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime to give his side a 25-22 win over the 49ers in a Super Bowl thriller to cement their status as an NFL dynasty last year.</p>
