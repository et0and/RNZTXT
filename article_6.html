            <p>Warriors v Dolphins</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 6.05pm, Sunday 26 May</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Stadium Mt Smart, Auckland</p>

            <p>The Warriors' task today against the Dolphins just got that much harder, with Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad ruled out with illness.</p>
        
            <p>Rocco Berry has also been pulled from the side after failing to recover from a hand injury.</p>
        
            <p>Originally named to play at five-eighth, Nicoll-Klokstad is replaced by Chanel Harris-Tavita, with Moala Graham-Taufa starting at centre in the 22-year-old's first-grade debut.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors found themselves the talk of the town after they stole the show at Magic Round in Brisbane last weekend, but then were dealt a savage midweek reality check when it was made public that star front rower Addin Fonua-Blake has been stood down for this weekend's game.</p>
        
            <p>In classic Wayne Bennett style, his imminent move to the Rabbitohs could be taken as a bit of an attempt to shift the focus onto himself and away from the Dolphins, who currently sit fourth on the NRL ladder.</p>
        
            <p>The team found themselves in a near-identical position last season before slumping to just three wins out of their final 14 games, but after a strong showing against the Tigers last weekend they're not showing signs of falling off the pace any time soon.</p>

            <p>No Shaun Johnson this week, or Wayde Egan, who is replaced by Freddy Lussick.</p>
        
            <p>Again we see Taine Tuaupiki step into the fullback role as Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad remains at five-eighth with Te Maire Martin in the halfback role. Marata Niukore is rushed straight back into starting prop, with Paul Roache retained on the bench as utility cover.</p>

            <p>Max Plath returns from concussion protocol standdown this week for the Dolphins, who besides that remain unchanged from last weekend. Former Warriors halfback Kodi Nikorima has been setting the league alight this season, leading his side to an impressive 7 - 3 record that sees them sitting in fourth on the NRL ladder.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 30 - 8 Dolphins</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 10 - 34 Dolphins</p>
        
            <p>It seems the two clubs were taking turns running riot on each other at different parts of the season last year, first up with the Warriors beginning a hot streak of form by notching up an impressive 30 - 8 victory over the Dolphins. In the return match, which was the last game of the regular season, the Dolphins turned the tables on a weakened Warriors side, winning 34 - 10.</p>
        
            <p>Being based over in Redcliffe for a big stint of their Covid years, they share a special bond with the Dolphins, as well as Nikorima and Euan Aitken signing there after their stints at the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will head into this Sunday's match against The Dolphins at Mt Smart with a new-found confidence, after notching up such a big win last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Dolphins field a very similar-styled team to the Warriors, relying heavily on team work rather than individual brilliance. Having a proven game plan will really serve the Warriors well after looking extremely disjointed the month prior.</p>
        
            <p>Besides practising good discipline when it comes to errors and penalties, both teams will be looking to make strong contact up front and win the game in the middle first.</p>
        
            <p>Then it will be down to both teams' halves to engage the opposition lines and provide opportunities on attack.</p>
        
            <p>The last two games between these sides have been high-scoring shootouts with plenty of tries scored, but this Sunday's game might come down to more of a grind to see who can poke their noses ahead at the end of the 80 minutes.</p>
