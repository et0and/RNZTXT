            <p>Black Caps batter Kane Williamson will miss the second cricket test against India, still not having recovered from the groin injury which ruled him out of the historic first Test win in Bengaluru at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson suffered the injury during the recent test series loss to Sri Lanka and didn't leave with the team for India, remaining in New Zealand to continue his rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps head coach Gary Stead said Williamson was making progress, but not ready to return to Test cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"We're monitoring Kane and he's tracking in the right direction, but isn't yet 100 percent fit," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hopeful to see further improvement over the coming days and have him available for the third Test.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll give him as much time as possible to get himself ready, but certainly continue to take a cautious approach."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps second Test against India begins on Thursday in Pune.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand lead the three match series 1-nil after securing an eight wicket win in the first test - New Zealand's first test win in India since 1988.</p>
        
            <p>The third Test is due to start in Mumbai on 1 November.</p>
