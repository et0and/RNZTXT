            <p>A second-half rally has propelled Fijian Drua to an upset 28-24 win over the Chiefs at Lautoka, ending the visitors' unbeaten start to the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season.</p>
        
            <p>Trailling 12-6 at halftime, the home side snatched the lead with a try to No.8 Meli Derenalagi, but relinquished it moments later, when All Blacks midfielder Anton Lienert-Brown responded for the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Back-to-back tries to fullback Vuate Karawalevu and winger Ponipate Loganimasi provided the winning edge for the Drua. Loganimasi's effort was spectacular, as he gathered a kick inside his own half, spun through a tackle and kicked ahead, before winning the chase for the touchdown.</p>
        
            <p>The Drua kept their opponents pinned inside their own 22 for much of the final minutes, but the Chiefs eventually salvaged a bonus point, with a converted try to captain Tupou Vaa'i after the final siren.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew it would be tough coming here to play the Drua," reflected Vaa'i. "We lost our way after halftime, but I'm sure we will regroup and focus ahead."</p>
        
            <p>While the Chiefs had started their campaign with three wins, the Drua had suffered three heartbreaking losses, conceding leads in the final moments of each contest.</p>
        
            <p>"We could have won three games," said captain Frank Lomani. "I think it's about time we owe our fans, our supporters who came out today a win and we did the job today."</p>
        
            <p>Churchill Park has become a graveyard for visiting teams, with the Drua winning seven consecutive games at the venue, many in wet and humid conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The result leaves Queensland Reds as the only unbeaten side this season - they had a first-round bye and face the Crusaders in Christchurch on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs played without injured All Blacks first-five Damian McKenzie, but now return to Hamilton to face the Blues next Saturday, while the Drua visit the ACT Brumbies on Friday.</p>
