            <p>Kiwi Erin Routliffe and partner Canada's Gaby Dabrowski have been eliminated from the Australian Open after losing their women's doubles semi final.</p>
        
            <p>The second seeds started strongly but were ultimately defeated in three sets 7-6 3-6 6-3 by third seeds Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei and JeÄ¼ena Ostapenko. of Latvia.</p>
        
            <p>In a gruelling semi which lasted two hours and 23 minutes, Dabrowski and her partner looked untouchable early on, before succumbing in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an amazing atmosphere, I feel like we didn't play our best in the second set but in the third we just tried to play our game," the winning duo told media.</p>
        
            <p>Having dropped all three first sets across their opening three rounds, Dabrowski and Routliffe were again forced to come from behind, but it was a furious battle in the opener.</p>
        
            <p>Breezing through the opening three games in just twelve minutes, the pair soon found themselves in a tantalisingly tight contest.</p>
        
            <p>Su-wei and Ostapenko would eventually fight their way to a tie break and prevail 7-3.</p>
        
            <p>Dabrowski and Routliffe fought back in the second, running away with the second set 6-3 to force a third.</p>
        
            <p>It was another shot for shot battle in the decider, but on the back end it was Su-wei and Ostapenko showing more accuracy and calm under pressure.</p>
