            <p>Black Caps batter Will Young has become accustomed to life as a first reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Young has long been first cab off the rank for New Zealand, most recently stepping in to replace the injured Kane Williamson on the tour of India.</p>
        
            <p>The 31 year old averaged 49 in the three test series batting at number three.</p>
        
            <p>His steady performance earned him the player of the series award.</p>
        
            <p>He made his test debut in 2020 and in that time has played 19 tests.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah it's a tricky one, you've got to prepare as best you can," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm use to that now, I know how to get myself ready for games and if I'm called upon I'm ready to put my best foot forward."</p>
        
            <p>The Central Districts batter, who has played 130 first class games, admits he's happy to have got the international games he has with plenty of competition for places.</p>
        
            <p>"There are heaps of guys that are itching to get a game, so we just have to bide our time and when the opportunity arises just put your best foot forward, do it in an authentic way and the team will continue to have success."</p>
        
            <p>Young has had to cope with the deflation many fans may feel when he has been called into replace someone like Williamson.</p>
        
            <p>He was satisfied that the team was able to silence a number of critics with their performance in India.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand became the first team ever to win a test series 3-nil in India.</p>
        
            <p>"To do what we did was just remarkable, it's a reminder of how fickle test cricket can be that exactly the same squad was in Sri Lanka and we lost two nil."</p>
        
            <p>Young is now in Sri Lanka preparing for a white ball series.</p>
