            <p>Auckland may have won the first battle, but the war between the country's newest and most successful football franchises is far from over.</p>
        
            <p>The newest sporting rivalry in Aotearoa writes its second chapter this weekend, when the Wellington Phoenix come north in an attempt to conquer the current A-League kings.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC have surpassed even the boldest predictions across their first five appearances, sitting unbeaten at the top of the table without a goal conceded.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Nick Becker is anticipating plenty of off-field chat between the respective fan bases.</p>
        
            <p>"We welcome them with open arms. Expect the Auckland fans get stuck in as they do, but I think it's going to be a brilliant atmosphere, a great friendly rivalry, and it's going to be a fantastic match."</p>
        
            <p>One of the most exciting sporting feuds in the country after just a single fixture, the match-up already has a moniker - 'Kiwi Clasico'.</p>
        
            <p>"I think New Zealand's been waiting for a good sporting rivalry, some of the other ones have sort of fallen away and so this is something new, something fresh. Wellington have been around for so long that us coming in, they've stood up to it and of taken on the challenge. The fans have been brilliant. Everybody's got some pretty fun banter going on," Becker said.</p>
        
            <p>Mount Smart is sold out for the clash, with capacity added on the embankment and an expected crowd of 26,000.</p>
        
            <p>"You get really pumped about the derby and given that this is the second one, our first one at home, and we got the result from the first one, it's a big occasion for Auckland City fans and definitely for the club as well."</p>
        
            <p>Becker admitted the franchise's success had surpassed even his wildest expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"If you'd asked me what success would look like before the season started, I wouldn't have been as bold as to go as far as it has. I don't want to jinx anything, but we certainly want to continue the way that we're going. When you keep some clean sheets, the confidence really grows within the team."</p>
        
            <p>Recently returning to the city after leaving in 2003, Becker said the shift in the game has been seismic in Tāmaki Makaurau.</p>
        
            <p>'When I left, football was about a fourth or fifth sport down the down the list, and now the growth of the consistent growth of the game is really impressive."</p>
        
            <p>He said Auckland was crying out for a franchise.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the fifth biggest city in Oceania and we didn't have a professional football club. It made complete sense to start one."</p>
        
            <p>However, it was never simply about participation.</p>
        
            <p>"We weren't here to make up the numbers. Right from day one, we've talked both publicly and within the club of making sure that we were super competitive."</p>
        
            <p>He believed their on-field style has also enamoured the side to fans.</p>
        
            <p>"We play high-press, attacking, exciting football. I think that's helped us both win over the fans and also, start the season the way that we intended to, as well."</p>
        
            <p>The question is now, just how long will the fairy tale last?</p>
        
            <p>"We certainly want to be in the mix (for the title). We want to be there or there abouts when it gets down to the business part of the season. I don't want to come in and say we're going to win in the first year, but we really want that silverware, and we're going to be doing everything we can to get our hands on it."</p>
