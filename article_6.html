            <p>Police are following "strong" lines of enquiry after a fiery rugby match ended in a van in Hastings being shot at.</p>
        
            <p>The van was attacked after a match between Tamatea and Young Māori Party (YMP) on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Hastings YMP was established in 1956 and is not related to the political organisation Te Pāti Māori or the Young Māori Party rugby club based in Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>The match was abandoned early due to safety concerns, but YMP's van encountered trouble after it left.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Sunday said the shotgun attack was "gang-linked".</p>
        
            <p>However, on Monday, Hawke's Bay area commander Inspector Lincoln Sycamore would not comment if gangs were involved, just that police were looking into it.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report police were reviewing CCTV footage throughout Hastings to identify those involved.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an extremely serious event," Sycamore said,</p>
        
            <p>"The risk when a firearm is discharged ... I can't overstate how dangerous it is."</p>
        
            <p>He said he would be "pretty frightened" for those in the back of the van.</p>
        
            <p>"It appears to be a single, maybe two blasts from a shotgun."</p>
        
            <p>He asked for witnesses or anyone with information to contact police.</p>
        
            <p>"The lines of enquiry we've got are really strong," he said and there was no ongoing risk to the public.</p>
        
            <p>The team's coach, Guy Taylor, was in the driver's seat at the time, and he said the van was rammed as well as shot at.</p>
        
            <p>He was able to turn the van around and return to Bill Mathewson Park, where he knew there was a police presence.</p>
        
            <p>Sycamore said police were at the game due to reports of a disorder event.</p>
        
            <p>He said police had never had problems with either team before.</p>
        
            <p>A witness said after a Tamatea player was floored by a tackle, young supporters of the team ran out onto the field and pulled out weapons, including knives.</p>
        
            <p>The YMP on social media Sunday said the game was called off early "due to a number of sideline abusers, one who kicked our player while he was on the ground".</p>
        
            <p>"The situation then escalated once the team was back at the changing rooms where one of the Tamatea players called for a fight with a YMP player."</p>
        
            <p>Tamatea Rugby & Sports Club chairperson Stewart Whyte said the club did not support gangs or have association with gangs.</p>
        
            <p>He said the incident "involved gang members who are not associated with Tamatea and are not members of our club".</p>
        
            <p>The YMP hoped Hawke's Bay Rugby Union would address the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It is disappointing when these type of things happen whilst being hosted by other clubs and is very concerning for our younger whānau and tamariki who enjoy watching their parents/uncles play a game of footy on a Saturday afternoon."</p>
