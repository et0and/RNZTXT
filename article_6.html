            <p>The Blues have joined the Hurricanes as Super Rugby Pacific semi-finalists, beating the Fijian Drua 36-5 with a clinical display in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>However, they will be sweating on the fitness of not only their captain, Patrick Tuipulotu, who limped from the field in the first half with a suspected knee injury, but also Akira Ioane, who left in the second half after suffering a knock.</p>
        
            <p>Their semi-final will be in Auckland on Friday night, with their opponents not known until after the Highlanders v Brumbies match later on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues took on a finals approach for the match, employing forward drives, dominant scrummaging and the tactical kicking of first five Harry Plummer to put pressure on a spirited Drua, who contested fiercely before bowing out of the competition for this season.</p>
        
            <p>The drives off the lineout earned the Blues their first try when Dalton Papalii reached out, and halfback Finlay Christie and left wing Caleb Clarke also scored before halftime, with Clarke's coming via a skilful looping pass from Plummer.</p>
        
            <p>It was 22-0 at halftime, but the second half was ignited by a n individual try to the Drua's Selestino Ravutaumada, who glided past a number of defenders in a dazzling run from halfway before sealing the deal with an extravagant dive.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues seemed stunned by that as much as the crowd and dropped off in their intensity in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>But when they did rally they made it count, with Kurt Eklund's try in the 64th minute maintaining the buffer, before Clarke put the icing on the effort with a classy try in the dying minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Papalii, who stood in as captain when Tuipulotu departed, said the Drua proved uncomfortable opponents with their fast-paced rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think the scoreboard reflects how tough a game that was. They really brought the game to us," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Papalii said he hoped Tuipulotu, whom he called an exceptional leader, would return for the semi-final. "I am hoping it's not serious, but if the worst comes to worst I am pretty comfortable leading these boys."</p>
        
            <p>Drua captain Meli Derenalagi said his side were proud to have finished seventh, their highest placing in their three seasons in Super Rugby .</p>
        
            <p>"We knew the Blues would come out hard on us and be physical," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will go back and try to learn from it and come back for next season."</p>
        
            <p>Scorers: Blues 36 (Caleb Clarke 2, Dalton Papalii, Finlay Chrisite, Kurt Eklund tries; Harry Plummer 4 cons, pen)</p>
        
            <p>Fijian Drua 5 (Selestino Ravutaumada try).</p>
        
            <p>Halftime: 22-0.</p>
