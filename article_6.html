            <p>The fallout from the All Black world cup loss to the Springboks has become very personal for New Zealand golfer Ryan Fox.</p>
        
            <p>Fox, the son of former All Blacks Grant Fox, has had to wear a Springbok jersey during a golf tournament after losing a bet with his South African caddie.</p>
        
            <p>"This feels like blasphemy to me, to be honest," said Fox who's ranked number 27 in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a little bet on the final, no money at all, but purely pride. If the Springboks won I had to wear this for three holes in the (Sun City) pro-am.</p>
        
            <p>"We all know the result."</p>
        
            <p>Had to honour the bet but this did hurt a lot https://t.co/5l7XKc1vU5</p>
        
            <p>Had the All Blacks won Fox's South African Dean Smith - would have had to use a yardage book with an All Blacks cover for a year.</p>
        
            <p>While he may have lost the bet, 2023 has been a lucrative one for Fox have won over $6 million enjoying three top-three finishes in his last four starts on the DP World Tour.</p>
