            <p>Former Australia cricketers Michael Slater has been refused bail by a court in Queensland after being remanded in police custody and charged with multiple domestic violence offences, including stalking and intimidation.</p>
        
            <p>Slater, 54, faces 19 charges relating to alleged offences on Queensland's Sunshine Coast between 5 December and 12 April, a Maroochydore Magistrates Court registrar said.</p>
        
            <p>The charges include unlawful stalking, assault occasioning bodily harm and choking or strangulation.</p>
        
            <p>The court was told Slater denied any allegations of violence against the complainant, News Corp media reported.</p>
        
            <p>Slater was taken into custody after his bail application was refused and his matter was listed for a committal hearing on May 31.</p>
        
            <p>Australian media outlets reported that Slater, one of Australia's finest opening batsmen, collapsed in court when Magistrate Raelene Ellis denied his bail application.</p>
        
            <p>He was helped to his feet by prison officers and led away to custody, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation said.</p>
        
            <p>Slater played 74 tests from 1993-2001 and became a successful cricket commentator before being axed by the Seven Network in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He has been charged with multiple domestic violence offences in recent years and struggled with mental health issues.</p>
        
            <p>Slater was sentenced to a two-year community corrections order by a Sydney court in late-2022 after pleading guilty to charges including common assault and attempted stalking of a woman.</p>
        
            <p>A community corrections order is a non-custodial punishment in Australia.</p>
