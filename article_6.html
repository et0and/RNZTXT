            <p>Allrounder Michael Bracewell is back for the Black Caps and will captain the T20 side on its five-match series in Pakistan later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell has been sidelined since his most recent international appearance in March last year - first, with a ruptured Achilles and then with a broken finger.</p>
        
            <p>Since recovering, he's made a spectacular return to cricket, claiming his best first-class figures with the ball in his first match back in the Plunket Shield.</p>
        
            <p>The squad includes seven members of previous T20 World Cup squads, along with T20 debutants Wellington's Tim Robinson and Canterbury's Will O'Rourke.</p>
        
            <p>Trent Boult, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner and Kane Williamson were all unavailable due to Indian Premier League commitments.</p>
        
            <p>Will Young was also unavailable for selection as he takes up a winter contract with Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, as was Tom Latham, who is awaiting the birth of his second child.</p>
        
            <p>Test skipper Tim Southee - the team's leading T20 wicket taker since the last T20 World Cup - also will not tour after the decision was made to rest him after a busy playing schedule across formats.</p>
        
            <p>Colin Munro was also unavailable for selection.</p>

            <p>Robinson earns his maiden selection on the back of a strong domestic T20 campaign, where he finished as the second-highest run scorer in the men's competition, despite playing only six of the Firebirds' 11 games due to injury.</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowler O'Rourke's selection caps a summer that has seen him make his debut across the two other international formats, including the best match return on Test debut for New Zealand - nine for 93 against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps selector Sam Wells said Bracewell had shown commendable patience and dedication in the past year to work his way back from injury.</p>
        
            <p>"Michael has faced a long period on the sideline and it's exciting to see him back playing cricket again," said Wells.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact he's back playing at a high level after an Achilles rupture is testament to his hard work and application.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a well-respected leader and has captaincy experience for Wellington along with New Zealand A and New Zealand XI teams, which we believe holds him in good stead to lead the group in Pakistan."</p>
        
            <p>The side leaves for Pakistan on Friday week with the first match against Pakistan in Rawalpindi on 18 April.</p>
