            <p>It's been 25 years since the Black Caps won their first and only major ICC trophy in a shorter format. </p>
        
            <p>But it took one of the bravest knocks in New Zealand's white ball history to do so. RNZ looks back at the Kiwis' historic winning run at the ICC Champions Trophy in 2000. </p>
        
            <p>ICC Knockout Trophy </p>
        
            <p>Nairobi Gymkhana, Kenya.</p>
        
            <p>October 3rd-15th</p>
        
            <p>2000</p>
        
            <p>The deck was stacked against them from the start. Flat pitches, short boundaries, dry conditions, not exactly the conditions suited for a New Zealand side rife with allrounders who thrived in low-scoring scraps. An injury to their star Chris Cairns in the first game, and two Asian juggernauts awaiting them, little was expected of Stephen Fleming's team in Kenya.</p>
        
            <p>Teams- Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, India, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps squad- Stephen Fleming (c), Nathan Astle, Craig McMillan, Chris Nevin, Adam Parore, Craig Spearman, Roger Twose, Chris Cairns, Chris Harris, Dion Nash, Scott Styris, Daniel Vettori, Geoff Allott, Paul Wiseman, Glen Sulzberger.</p>
        
            <p>Game One - Win comes with big loss </p>
        
            <p>Quarterfinal vs Zimbabwe</p>
        
            <p>NZ 265/7 def. ZIM 201/10 by 64 runs </p>
        
            <p>Taking on one of the stronger Zimbabwe sides in their history and in African conditions, Heath Streak's side were never going to be easy-beats. Removing Nathan Astle for a duck, Zimbabwe also sent Craig Spearman packing for just 20 followed by Stephen Fleming and Cairns to have New Zealand on the ropes at 120-4. However, the innings was rescued by Craig McMillian's 52 from 51 balls and Roger Twose, who accrued 85 from 111. Some late fireworks from Adam Parore saw the Black Caps post 265-7. Zimbabwe made a strong start to the chase, led by Alistair Campbell with 47 and Stuart Carlisle's 67. They appeared comfortable at 88-1, before Paul Wiseman removed Campbell, Andy Flower and Grant Flower in quick succession, triggering a Zimbabwean collapse. Astle bagged two wickets including the key scalp of Streak and Wiseman finished with 4-45 as the New Zealanders got home by 64 runs to advance to the semis. However, it wasn't all good news for New Zealand, Chris Cairns succumbing to a knee injury and touted as unlikely to feature in the tournament again.</p>
        
            <p>Game 2 - O'Connor takes honours </p>
        
            <p>Semifinal vs Pakistan</p>
        
            <p>Pak 252/10 lost to NZ 255/6 by four wickets </p>
        
            <p>Cairns was sidelined and replaced by Scott Styris for the rematch of the previous year's World Cup semi in which Pakistan crushed New Zealand by nine wickets. A blazing Saeed Anwar century had Pakistan well set at 111-1, however, he lacked support from his middle order, leaving Abdul Razzaq, 48 from 49, and Wasim Akram with a run-a-ball 34 to build Pakistan a solid platform to launch a late assault. However, Shayne O'Connor put an end to those ideas with 5-46, mopping up the tail with four wickets in eight balls while Astle again chipped in with the prized dismissals of Mohammed Yusuf and Inzamam Ul-Haq.</p>
        
            <p>Spearman went early in New Zealand's response and Fleming followed soon after but Astle and Twose then combined for 135 runs, Astle falling one short of a half century. Twose went for 87 but McMillian kept things ticking along with a quickfire 51. He and Styris, still needing 60 runs from 12 overs, combined patiently before Styris sent one over the ropes in the 48th over to all but guarantee victory, sending the Black Caps into their first ICC tournament final.</p>
        
            <p>Game 3 - Cairns the conqueror</p>
        
            <p>Final vs India</p>
        
            <p>India 264/6 lost to NZ 265/6 by four wickets</p>
        
            <p>Entering the final as rank outsiders against a powerhouse Indian batting lineup, New Zealand welcomed back Cairns under a massive injury cloud, his knee far from 100 percent, as Wiseman was omitted from the XI. India took command through an imposing opening partnership of 141 between Sachin Tendulkar and centurion Sourav Ganguly. The legendary Tendulkar was run out by Styris for 69 and the allrounder showcased his prowess in the field by also catching Rahul Dravid short of his crease. India were still sitting pretty at 202/2 with 12 overs remaining but they were unable to capitalise, losing momentum when Ganguly holed out to Chris Harris.</p>
        
            <p>A nevertheless challenging target became steeper when Spearman was again first to fall, followed soon afterwards by Fleming. Twose and Astle once again steadied the innings with 31 and 37 respectively, but things again looked bleak when Astle fell with the Black Caps still needing 180 runs. Enter a hobbling Cairns, who took the chase on his shoulders when New Zealand were reduced to 132-5. The burly allrounder proceeded to dominate the Indian attack, hammering eight fours and two sixes in one of the country's more memorable ODI knocks. Admirably assisted by Harris with 46 in a partnership of 122, Cairns brought up his match-winning century in the 49th over. He and Parore nudged four singles in the final over to get home with two balls to spare and cap an historic day for New Zealand cricket - capturing their only men's title in a white ball format.</p>
