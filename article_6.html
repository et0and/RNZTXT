            <p>A group of Football Ferns players have reportedly criticised NZ Football's (NZF) handling of allegations they made against former head coach Jitka Klimkova.</p>
        
            <p>According to the New Zealand Herald, a complaint was made about alleged inappropriate behaviour from Klimkova towards a player after the team was eliminated from last year's World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald said the incident was reported to NZF in February, and prompted an independent employment investigation commissioned by the governing body.</p>
        
            <p>Having stepped aside from the team's tour to Spain in May, Klimkova was cleared to return in June but she never did, with coaching duties for last month's Paris Olympics picked up by assistant coach Michael Mayne.</p>
        
            <p>Klimkova resigned earlier this month, with three years remaining on her six-year contract, and moved into a high performance role at NZ Football.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald said "about eight" unidentified players had written letters to NZF criticising its handling of the issue, with one saying players were now "fearful" of reporting incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"This whole situation has been handled poorly, it feels as though there's been little regard for player safety and wellbeing," another player said.</p>
        
            <p>The players voiced multiple concerns towards NZF's handling of the issue, saying:</p>
        
            <p>NZ Football and the NZ Professional Footballers' Association Statement were available to comment to RNZ, instead providing a joint statement.</p>
        
            <p>"In April 2024, New Zealand Football received approval from a complainant to progress an investigation into an incident in the Football Ferns team environment.</p>
        
            <p>"A highly qualified independent workplace investigator was appointed who undertook a thorough and confidential workplace investigation, and made findings available to the parties in May.</p>
        
            <p>"The parties accepted the investigation findings and NZF took legal advice on its course of action to ensure it was appropriate, making sure to inform the relevant parties to the complaint of the outcome and actions.</p>
        
            <p>"As is standard in workplace investigations, details of the investigation are not made public and findings are strictly confidential.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the outcome of the investigation, the New Zealand Professional Footballers' Association, as the representative body of the players, and NZF, worked together to engage a restorative process to enable all parties to come together, however, owing to time constraints, this was unable to be completed before the Paris 2024 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"NZF and the NZPFA have worked collaboratively following the formal investigation and are now focused squarely on the future to ensure the team is in the best place to qualify for, and succeed at, the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not be making any further comment on this matter."</p>
        
            <p>A new head coach will not be advertised for until next year, with Mayne staying on as interim coach.</p>
