            <p>Despite mixed results on the field, the Warriors fans have been keeping the faith.</p>
        
            <p>The club has enjoyed a hot run of crowd attendance, and are now eying an NRL record of selling out every home game in a season.</p>
        
            <p>With upcoming clashes against Melbourne and Brisbane already sold out, the Warriors will just need to fill the house in their final three games to reach an unprecedented mark.</p>
        
            <p>With sellouts for their two trials in February as well, it leaves them on track to deliver 14 sold-out home games for the year.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors chief executive Cameron George said the fan base has taken its support to another level in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely brilliant seeing the way members and fans have got behind their club. To sell out the Melbourne game almost three weeks ahead of game day and the Broncos almost five weeks out is unbelievable."</p>
        
            <p>After the blockbusters against the Storm and Broncos, the Warriors end their home season with games against the Tigers, Eels and Bulldogs.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can sell out those games as well it will be an amazing achievement and another statement about what the club and rugby league mean to New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have sold out 17 of their 22 home games since the start of 2023, which saw home games in Wellington, Brisbane, Napier, and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>In 10 matches at Go Media Stadium last year, the crowd average was 22,739 with the biggest 26,083 against the Knights.</p>
