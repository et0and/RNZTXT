            <p>The World Champion Black Ferns can no longer win the WXV title after falling to a comprehensive 49-31 defeat to England in Canada.</p>
        
            <p>It was a fast start from the Black Ferns on a hot, sunny day in Langley, but that early dominance soon swung the other way.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns opened the scoring through No.8 Kaipo Olsen-Baker in the sixth minute with Renee Holmes adding the conversion. Though their lead was short lived, and England hit back with a converted try to right wing Abby Dow soon after, to level the ledger at 7-7.</p>
        
            <p>From the resulting kickoff, England quickly parked themselves in New Zealand's 22 before left wing Jess Breach crashed over from close range in the left hand corner.</p>
        
            <p>The try went unconverted by centre Helena Rowland, leaving England ahead 12-7 midway through the first half.</p>

            <p>Basic errors hurt the Black Ferns as they coughed up possession in their own half and England took full advantage with fullback Ellie Kildunne scoring in the right hand corner for their third try of the match and a 17-7 lead.</p>
        
            <p>Momentum seemed firmly with England, however the Black Ferns had more possession and were the next to strike, with World Cup-winning wing Ayesha Leti-I'iga scoring six minutes before halftime to cut the defending WXV champions lead to 17-12.</p>
        
            <p>England though weren't done, and managed to storm back into the Black Ferns territory.</p>
        
            <p>A few phases later they had their fourth try with Kildunne dotting down for her second five pointer on the stroke of halftime, to extend England's lead to 22-12 at the break.</p>
        
            <p>England's scrum was dominant, pushing the Black Ferns back on several occasions and earning multiple penalties, while Red Roses generally looked the most likely team to score.</p>
        
            <p>They carried on in that vein in the second half and extended their lead to 27-12 in the 45th minute, with Dow bagging her brace - then were over again just minutes later, with halfback Natasha Hunt scoring after England charged down a Black Ferns box kick inside their 22.</p>
        
            <p>That try was converted by Howland to put England ahead 34-12, and they started to run away with the match: Breach scored her second try (and England's third in the first 11 minutes of the second half), to increase their lead to 39-12.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns though refused to lie down and scored next, through hooker Georgia Ponsonby, with the try converted by first-five Hannah King to cut England's lead to 39-19 with 20 minutes remaining.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns started to make inroads into the English defence and made several big breaks but failed to score points, before an intercept to Olsen-Baker just outside the English 22 led to a try to lock Maia Roos as the New Zealanders reduced England's lead to 14 points (39-24).</p>
        
            <p>However, the momentum would again swing back England's way as they started to hold on to the ball and some missed tackles from the Black Ferns proved costly as wing Breach completed her hattrick of tries to put the English 20 points clear, at 44-24, with ten minutes left in the test.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns needed to hold on to the ball, but again an unforced error turned over possession and England capitalised with another try - this time to Emily Scarlett in the 77th minute, to extend England's lead to 49-44 and put the result beyond doubt.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns would score a consolation try just before fulltime to with the final score 49-31 to England, who now have two wins from their first two WXV games.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns have two losses following their opening round defeat to Ireland, with New Zealand's chances of winning the WXV title now over.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns finish their WXV campaign with a test against France (one win and one defeat) in Vancouver on Sunday morning (NZT).</p>
