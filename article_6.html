            <p>The Central Stags have won the Super Smash men's crown, beating the Canterbury Kings by six wickets in the final at Wellington's Basin Reserve on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>They claimed their first Super Smash title since in 2019, while the Kings have again missed out, having last won the final in 2006, the competition's inaugural year.</p>
        
            <p>The Kings, fresh from their win over the Northern Brave in the elimination final yesterday, scored 135 for eight, never truly recovering after a disappointing start.</p>
        
            <p>At the top of the order they lost Mitch Hay, Matt Boyle and Chad Bowes cheaply early, with the score 37 for three when Daryl Mitchell (46) and Cole McConchie (27) joined forces.</p>
        
            <p>They combined to put on 49 for the fourth wicket and Daryl Mitchell (46) combined for a steady 59-run stand for the fourth wicket. Wickets fell quickly once their partnership was broken, with Toby Findlay taking two wickets in the last over to finish with three for 29 off his four overs. Brett Randell (2/27 off four) and Blair Tickner (1/17 off four) also helped keep the brakes on the Kings innings.</p>
        
            <p>The Stags lost Jack Boyle early, but Will Young with 35 and player of the match Dane Cleaver with 43 put them well on the road to victory with a 75-run partnership.</p>
        
            <p>They were able to thwart a Black Caps-laden bowling attack that had looked lethal in the Kings' elimination final victory over the Northern Brave on Saturday, on an admittedly much easier-paced pitch on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>When Curtis Heaphy struck a well-timed boundary for the winning runs, the Stags had 16 deliveries to spare, reaching their target of 136 for the loss of four wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Kyle Jamieson took four for 24 off his four overs for Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Stags captain Tom Bruce said it was a great thrill to claim the silverware.</p>
        
            <p>"We have played some great cricket this year and I am super proud of them," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a fair few guys who were in their first final game today. Against a quality opposition it was awesome that a lot of these boys were able to stand up today and get the result."</p>
        
            <p>Kings captain McConchie said it was a pretty frustrating game for his side as they couldn't quite get the momentum going with the bat.</p>
        
            <p>"Hats off to the Stags today, they outplayed us."</p>
