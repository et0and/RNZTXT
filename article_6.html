            <p>Crusaders coach Rob Penney says he's in a good space and just concentrating on the job in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Penney's side is bottom of the Super Rugby Pacific standings with just one win from eight games.</p>
        
            <p>It's a far cry from where the 14-time champion Crusaders have been in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>They're coming off a humiliating 37-15 loss to the Western Force.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just all part of the job," Penney said at a media conference on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not where we want to be and within the organisation there is a bit of anxiety around that, but I'm doing really well and just focused on what's in front of us."</p>
        
            <p>Penney is in his first year with the Crusaders after taking over from now All Black coach Scott Robertson, who won five titles in their various forms.</p>
        
            <p>Penney says he's had discussions with the organisation which he described as "honest but very supportive, they've been amazing".</p>
        
            <p>The club hardly resembles the team of last year with a number of players moving on following the World Cup while they've also been hit with a long list of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"There's just not one issue, but (we're) very positive about what's coming up and the way forward," Penney said</p>

            <p>Penney does believe some of his players need to stand up.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel there are guys that aren't doing enough, we've been encouraging them all year to be brave and do more.</p>
        
            <p>"This level of pressure on the group is not great because it hinders that growth and development, but it's going to bear fruit at some point."</p>
        
            <p>Penney will welcome back captain Scott Barrett and back David Havili from injuries for the game against the Melbourne Rebels on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett, who broke his finger during training in early March, has defended his coach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's easy for people outside of the environment to look in and throw stones, but when you (Penney) come into a new environment it takes time to install what you're trying to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the responsibility falls on the players to perform as well and it's individual accountability."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett says there is still belief that they can win the competition this year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly a big challenge ahead and it's a challenge we're excited by."</p>
