            <p>The Magic nearly pulled off the third comeback of the round before the unbeaten Tactix hung on 54-53 in Hamilton last night.</p>
        
            <p>The Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic are now sitting fourth on the ANZ Premiership netball ladder and despite the loss put out their best performance of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The last minute of the game was intense when Tactix defender Paris Lokotui made a heroic intercept but had a heavy fall on her landing.</p>
        
            <p>As a result Claire O'Brien became the sixth player to be suspended this season as umpires deemed her contest for the same ball was dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>With just 21 seconds left the Tactix were able to play the clock down with a goal in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Leading by four at half-time, the Tactix just managed to avoid becoming the third team in three games to fall victim to a comeback.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday the Pulse pulled off a stunning come from behind victory when they mowed down an 11 goal half-time deficit to the Mystics in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse managed to hold the defending champions to just 10 and six goals through the third and fourth quarters.</p>

            <p>On Saturday the relief was palpable when the Steel finally broke their unwanted record, notching up their first win in nearly two years with a thrilling 63-61 extra time win over the Stars.</p>
        
            <p>The Steel turned around an eight-goal deficit at the start of the final quarter to draw level with the Stars at the end of regulation time in Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ Premiership organisers will be rapt with the recent results.</p>
        
            <p>Boasting a stacked roster, the Mystics are a side that threatens to win week after week.</p>
        
            <p>But the Tactix win over a nearly full strength Mystics in round three gave the competition the shake up it needed.</p>
        
            <p>Tight games and unpredictable results increase engagement and organisers will be hoping for more.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse will be without star midcourter Maddy Gordon for up to 12 weeks after scans revealed ligament damage to her ankle.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>If Gordon's rehabilitation goes better than expected, the franchise will be hoping she might be ready for the final round of the regular season, which is in about 10 weeks time.</p>
        
            <p>The unbeaten Pulse just edge the Tactix at the top of the table courtesy of a superior goal percentage.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon is one of the most consistent performers in the competition but the Pulse managed to navigate her loss in their game against the Mystics.</p>
        
            <p>They are also lucky to have a genuine third shooting option with Khiarna Williams doing a stellar job while Tiana Metuarau rehabs from a foot injury.</p>
        
            <p>Hopefully Mystics strike shooter Grace Nweke will be able to get over the knee issue that kept her out of the round four game against the Pulse.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022 the Mystics were on top of the ANZ Premiership ladder before Nweke rolled her ankle and the side lost four straight games without her.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics, who sit third on the ladder, will be desperate to get a win if they do find themselves without the Silver Ferns shooter this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Mentally they don't want to be dealing with a constant narrative hanging over them that they can't win without their star shooter.</p>
        
            <p>Some extraordinary statistics appeared on the broadcast before the Pulse-Mystics game, which highlighted Nweke's impact on her side.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Since joining the franchise in 2019, the Mystics on average have scored four more goals per quarter with Nweke on court, compared to when she's not on court.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars, last year's beaten finalists, are yet to register a win and will be looking forward to the return of shooter Amorangi Malesala, who's getting over an ankle injury.</p>
        
            <p>In a departure from previous years it's fans who are now picking the Player of the Match at the end of each game.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the results have been what you would expect, but others not so much.</p>
        
            <p>You have to wonder if some of the results are more reflective of a popularity contest, rather than which player has had the most impact on the game.</p>
        
            <p>In round three Magic shooter Saviour Tui was named Player of the Match after an excellent return of 17 from 18 but she was only on court for 26 minutes.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>In round two Stars' goal shooter Summer Temu picked up the award after an impressive debut scoring 20 goals at 100 percent in three quarters.</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the court Tactix goal shooter Ellie Bird scored a whopping 47 goals at 92 percent accuracy in 60 minutes to help her side to a win.</p>
        
            <p>Picking MVPs has never been a completely scientific data-driven process and it never should be.</p>
        
            <p>We've seen more players on the losing side picking up well deserved MVP awards, which is usually very rare.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, Mystics wing attack Peta Toeava was named MVP following her side's loss to the Pulse.</p>
        
            <p>A number of players would have been worthy recipients including Pulse players Parris Mason, Whitney Souness, and Amelia Walmsley.</p>
        
            <p>Toeava was at her creative best and ticks the popularity box but on close inspection of the game statistics she also did a power of work.</p>
