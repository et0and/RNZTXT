            <p>Swiss entry Alinghi has improved its chances of making the America's Cup challenger series semi-finals after a vital win over American Magic.</p>
        
            <p>Their second win of the regatta moves them off the bottom of the standings into fourth position.</p>
        
            <p>The Swiss capitalised on some uncharacteristic manoeuvre execution errors, and a penalty in the pre-start by the Americans to score a 38-second victory.</p>
        
            <p>Alinghi have three times challenged for the America's Cup, winning in 2003 and 2007.</p>
        
            <p>Luna Rossa of Italy remains top of the challenger series after beating Orient Express of France today.</p>
        
            <p>They're unbeaten after five matches - two wins ahead of Britannia and American Magic. Alinghi have two wins and Orient Express one. The top four after the second round robin will contest the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand, who are allowed to race in the round-robin part of the challenger series, scored wins over Britannia and Orient Express.</p>
        
            <p>Britannia fell off their foils at the final turn to hand the Kiwis a four-minute victory.</p>
        
            <p>In the second race Team New Zealand lost the lead to Orient Express when they fell off their foils, but powered back for another big win.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Peter Burling was happy to come away with that win.</p>
        
            <p>"They were incredibly tricky conditions right at the bottom end of the wind limits. But it was awesome racing, and for us great to be able to make a few mistakes and still take a win. The French showed just how tough it was in the light air."</p>
        
            <p>The conditions were especially taxing on the Team New Zealand cyclors, who had to work overtime to provide all of the power to keep Taihoro moving and on the foils, which Burling was especially thankful for.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an amazing group of cyclors that provide us with plenty of power, so you never feel short. It's a huge credit to the hard work the cyclors have put in right throughout the campaign."</p>
