            <p>The Kahu, New Zealand's national women's Australian Rules Football side, has made history this week by winning their first ever match. They defeated Papua New Guinea 16-13 on Wednesday in a low scoring, tight encounter played in torrential rain in Maroochydore on the ironically named Sunshine Coast in Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>The women then followed it up with a dominant 41-2 win over Tonga on Thursday, which sets up a final against Nauru on Saturday afternoon. The Kahu and Nauru played in the opening game of the women's tournament, with Nauru taking the game 43-41 in a match that came right down to the wire.</p>

            <p>Standout players for the Kahu in the three games have been full forward Latisha Trigwell-Achmad, who opened the scoring with a crucial goal against PNG, alongside midfielder Demi Salton and halfback Kirsten Meates. Captain Liv Waldron's big boot was crucial clearing the ball downfield, especially in the trying conditions.</p>
        
            <p>However the Falcons, the NZ men's side, have found it tough going. After an opening loss on Monday against a very impressive Nauru side 50-44, a defeat that could've been a lot heavier considering Nauru kicked 14 behinds, they then had a must win match on Wednesday and PNG.</p>

            <p>Like the women's game on the same day, they faced horrific conditions throughout but couldn't match the Kahu's control of proceedings, going down 20-10 in a game where a couple of goals made all the difference. The Falcons salvaged some pride with a very good 49-21 win over Fiji on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the losses, there have been real positives on the field for the Falcons. Tane Kirton has proven to be an energetic presence on the field, while Lachie McBride kicked three goals in the win over Fiji.</p>
