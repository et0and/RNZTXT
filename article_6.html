            <p>Auckland FC have announced the addition of Alex Paulsen, despite A-League rules currently prohibiting the All Whites and former Phoenix goalkeeper from doing so.</p>
        
            <p>The new club has touted their star signing on social media this morning, after the league announced the 'Caceres Rule' regarding player movement.</p>
        
            <p>The rule was brought in 2016 to prevent overseas clubs buying players and loaning them to sister clubs, after Manchester City signed Anthony Caceres with no intention of actually playing him. Cacares was then immediately loaned to Melbourne City, which is owned by the same City Football Group as Manchester City.</p>
        
            <p>AFC Bournemouth and Auckland FC are both owned by Bill Foley, the billionaire American whose other sporting holdings include French Ligue 1 club FC Lorient and the Las Vegas Golden Knights NHL franchise.</p>
        
            <p>However, in a statement released this morning, the A-League said it "was approached by a number of clubs in May about the possibility of reviewing the 'Caceres Clause' due to the increased transfer market opportunity for clubs and the change in broader club ownership structures in place across the league".</p>
        
            <p>"The review process sought feedback from all clubs about the rule change and what, if any guardrails would be required, and took into consideration the league and Clubs' emphasis on youth development, improving overseas talent pathways and increasing opportunities for international player transfer and loan fees.</p>
        
            <p>"A player contracting rule change was supported by all clubs, with the premise that the APL reviews and maintains certain guardrails."</p>
        
            <p>Paulsen, who was born in Auckland, was one of the standout performers from the Phoenix's last season that saw them reach the A-League semi-finals.</p>

            <p>"Auckland is my home, and I haven't had many opportunities to play in my city and in front of my friends and family. I'm really excited by the opportunity to return to my hometown and continue to develop as a player," Paulsen said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is so much excitement around the club and what we're building here. I've only been home for a few days, and I've seen people walking around in the new home strip and you can feel the energy around the club and the city."</p>
        
            <p>New Auckland FC head coach Steve Corica was understandably pleased with the new addition to his squad.</p>
        
            <p>"He is athletic, a strong shot-stopper and a commanding presence on crosses. He has also demonstrated superb anticipation and is comfortable playing out from the back off both feet. I am delighted he has decided to join us," Corica said.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix and Auckland FC play their first game against each other on 2 November at Sky Stadium.</p>
