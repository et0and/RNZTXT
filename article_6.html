            <p>New Zealand snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has landed the world's first triple cork in a women's slopestyle competition, which has also seen her take gold in the 2025 Aspen X Games slopestyle competition.</p>
        
            <p>The Wānaka local created history at Beijing 2022, winning New Zealand's first ever Winter Olympic gold medal after landing a hugely technical sequence in slopestyle.</p>
        
            <p>But the OIympic champion has pushed the boundaries again and the 23-year old can't quite believe what she has achieved in Aspen.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott was absent from the invite-only event last year while she recovered from an ankle injury which saw her out of most of 2024 competitions.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to do that run, which is a dream run of mine I never thought was possible, it means the world to me to be back here at X Games," Sadowski-Synnott said.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I didn't know if I would be on the podium again going through this injury, so to be back here in the mix with the girls and to be part of the progression means so much to me and to win this comp, I can't even believe it."</p>
        
            <p>With clear, calm weather in Aspen, and temperatures much warmer than last night's big air, the scene was set for the women's snowboard slopestyle.</p>

            <p>The X Games slopestyle format consists of eight women in the play-offs, which gets cut down to four in the finals.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott came out swinging in the play-offs, stitching together a solid rail section before putting down her switch backside 1260 (which she only debuted last weekend at the LAAX Open) then stomping back-to-back double corked 1080's on the last two jumps. Scoring a 92.33, she cruised through to the final round with ease.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott kicked it up a gear in the finals, putting down a huge backside triple corked 1440 on the third and final jump, making history as the first women (ski or snowboard) to ever land a triple cork in a slopestyle competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I am just stoked to be here, and a big congrats to everyone, we got such epic conditions to ride here today so I am just so grateful."</p>
        
            <p>With a huge score of 94.66 on the board, Sadowski-Synnott remained untouchable for the remainder of the competition and took the win. Kokomo Murase of Japan and Great Britain's Mia Brookes joined her on the podium in second and third respectively.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday Sadowski-Synnott won bronze in the Women's Snowboard Big Air at the 2025 Aspen X Games.</p>
        
            <p>It takes her career total X Games medal count to a staggering 11 medals, of which six are gold.</p>
