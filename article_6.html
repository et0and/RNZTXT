        <h2>'I'm being cheated': Coco Gauff knocked out, argues, cries</h2>
        <p>
Gauff was in tears in the second set when an over-ruled line call saw her slip 4-2 behind and became embroiled in an argument with the umpire and tournament supervisor.

            <p>Spain's raging bulls Rafa Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz blazed into the quarter-finals of the Olympics men's doubles but a host of women's singles medal contenders were knocked out as the heat was turned up at Roland Garros on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Once again the dynamic duo received top billing on the schedule and they did not disappoint a fevered crowd as they fought off Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof to claim a 6-4 6-7(2) 10-2 victory.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, as the mercury soared into the mid-30s Celsius leaving spectators and players wilting, the women's singles was blown apart as second seed Coco Gauff, fourth seed Jasmine Paolini and seventh seed Maria Sakkari all perished.</p>

            <p>Women's top seed Iga Swiatek of Poland stayed on course for gold though with a 6-3 6-4 win against injury-hampered Chinese player Wang Xiyu to reach the quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Defending men's singles champion Alexander Zverev of Germany stayed cool in the oven-like heat as the third seed kept on track for a repeat of his Tokyo title with a 6-3 7-5 defeat of Czech player Tomas Machac to reach the third round.</p>
        
            <p>There was only one place to be on a tropical evening alongside the Bois de Boulogne though -- the claustrophobic Court Suzanne Lenglen for the latest 'Nadalcaraz' show.</p>
        
            <p>Up against a former doubles world number one in Koolhof, the Spaniards found themselves involved in a red-dirt dogfight as the Dutch showed scant regard for reputations and threatened to spoil the party by deservedly levelling the match.</p>

            <p>But the 38-year-old Nadal and Alcaraz, 21, have 26 Grand Slam singles titles between them for a reason, and they caught fire again in the deciding tiebreak, with some electrifying tennis moving them within three wins of a dream gold medal.</p>
        
            <p>"Our goal to try to get a medal is closer. So I'm really, really happy about it and let's see tomorrow," Alcaraz said.</p>
        
            <p>The Spaniard plays a third-round singles against Roman Safiullin on Wednesday before joining Nadal to take on Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in the doubles.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm trying to enjoy every single second out there."</p>
        
            <p>Gauff, like Alcaraz an Olympic debutant, still has medal hopes but not in the singles after her shock exit to Croatia's 13th seed Donna Vekic.</p>
        
            <p>The American was in tears in the second set when an over-ruled line call saw her slip 4-2 behind and became embroiled in an argument with umpire Jaume Campistol and the tournament supervisor in which she was heard to say "I'm being cheated".</p>
        
            <p>Gauff had grounds for complaint as a call of "OUT" on a Vekic shot was quickly overruled but the American insisted it put her off. Vekic remained focussed to seal a superb victory and become the first Croatian woman to reach the Olympic singles quarter-finals since 1996.</p>
        
            <p>"Afterwards they apologise, but 'Sorry' doesn't help you once the match is over," Gauff said.</p>
        
            <p>Italian Paolini, runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon in the build-up to the Olympics, lost 7-5 3-6 7-5 to Slovakian Anna Karolina Schmiedlova while Sakkari lost a lengthy battle against Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev reached the French Open final this year and looked perfectly at home on the Parisian clay as he maintained a strong start to his bid to repeat his Tokyo gold.</p>
        
            <p>He was pushed hard by Machac but turned on the afterburners at 5-5 in the second set with two searing forehands earning a break of serve before he ended the contest a game later.</p>
        
            <p>Germany's Angelique Kerber, a singles silver-medallist in Rio, will retire after the Olympics but stayed on course for a golden farewell by beating Canada's Leylah Fernandez 6-4 6-3 to reach the last eight where China's Zheng Qinwen awaits.</p>
        
            <p>The lineup for the women's quarter-finals is complete with Kostyuk to face Vekic, Schmiedlova up against Czech Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova and Swiatek playing American Danielle Collins.</p>
        
            <p>In the men's singles, two Americans reached the third round with Taylor Fritz beating Britain's Jack Draper 6-7(3) 6-3 6-2 and Tommy Paul overcoming Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3 6-1.</p>
        
            <p>Fritz will face Italy's 11th seed Lorenzo Musetti, who beat Argentina's Mariano Navone. Felix Auger-Aliassime also reached round three by thrashing Germany's Maximilian Marterer 6-0 6-1 but Swiss three-times Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka lost to Australia's Alexei Popyrin.</p>
        
            <p>Britain's Andy Murray kept his career going for one more match at least as he and Dan Evans saved match points for the second contest in a row -- beating Belgians Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen in a cliffhanger to reach the quarter-finals.</p>
