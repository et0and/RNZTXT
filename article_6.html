            <p>Despite some bowling heroics from Matt Henry, the Black Caps have lost to India by 44 runs in their final Champions Trophy pool match in Dubai, setting up a semi-final against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand run chase led by 81 from Kane Williamson crumbled against Indian spin as they were dismissed for 205 in the 46th over, having initially threatened to run down India's 249-9, with Henry claiming 5-42.</p>
        
            <p>Unbeaten India finish top of the pool and will face Australia in the first semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday while the Black Caps face a showdown with the Proteas in Lahore a day later.</p>
        
            <p>On a wicket that was two-paced at times, India struggled for momentum after Henry reduced them to 30-3.</p>

            <p>Shreyas Iyer ground out 79 off 98 balls, putting on 98 for the fourth wicket with Axar Patel (42) before Hardik Pandya's late 45 at a run-a-ball ultimately proved important.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's pursuit began soundly enough, reaching 93-2 of 25 overs but Williamson fought a lone hand over the second half as leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy (5-) took advantage of helpful pitch conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was the seventh wicket to fall, ending a stoic 120-ball knock before captain Mitchell Santner went on to post New Zealand's second biggest score of the day of 28.</p>
