            <p>It hasn't even been a fortnight since the Rugby World Cup final, but we can cast our eye ahead to next season with the squad namings of the Super Rugby Pacific sides.</p>
        
            <p>Defending champions set to rebuild </p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders look to continue their dynasty without their three generals in 2024. The departure of Scott Robertson, Sam Whitelock, and Richie Mo'unga will leave a significant void, however, incoming coach Rob Penney has looked to international veteran to fill it. Welsh legend Leigh Halfpenny will make the move to Christchurch where he is likely to be given the ten jersey in the absence of the injured Fergus Burke.</p>

            <p>The season looms as a big one for Macca Springer, who should take the spot of Mako teammate Leicester Fainga'anuku who departs for France. Former All Black Ryan Crotty is back to sure up the midfield, while Ethan Blackadder will be a man on a mission after limited game time during his late World Cup call up.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Joe Moody, Tamaiti Williams, George Bell, Fletcher Newell, George Bower, Finlay Brewis.</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Codie Taylor, Brodie McAlister Ioane Moananu.</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Scott Barrett, Quinten Strange, Tahlor Cahill, Zach Gallagher, Jamie Hannah.</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Ethan Blackadder, Tom Christie, Cullen Grace, Dominic Gardiner, Corey Kellow, Christian Lio-Willie.</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Noah Hotham, Mitch Drummond, Willi Heinz.</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Fergus Burke, Rivez Reihana.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Ryan Crotty, Levi Aumua, Dallas McLeod, David Havili.</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Will Jordan, Sevu Reece, Macca Springer, Leigh Halfpenny, Manasa Mataele, Jone Rova, Chay Fihaki, Heremaia Murray.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks hooker Codie Taylor has been named though will nmiss majority of the season as he takes a non-playing sabbatical. A squad riddled with class and experience, the Crusaders still look formidable on paper.</p>
        
            <p>Settled Blues side heads into post-MacDonald era</p>
        
            <p>The Blues are welcoming in a new coach, as the Leon MacDonald era comes to a close at Eden Park. Vern Cotter takes over a team that hasn't actually suffered quite as much turnover as the other New Zealand sides, while they have lost Beauden Barrett to Japan, there are still 11 former or current All Blacks in the side.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Angus Ta'avao comes back into the front row after being at the Chiefs. There's four rookies in the side in Kade Banks, Lucas Cashmore, Cole Forbes and Meihana Grindlay, Cashmore is the son of Auckland and Blues legend Adrian.</p>
        
            <p>Head Coach Vern Cotter said he is eager to get stuck into pre-season training with the squad later this month.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a wealth of Super Rugby experience in this squad, players who have been there and done the business for several seasons. I'm excited for what 2024 holds and if we can get on the same page as a collective, we should be competing at the pointy end of the season."</p>
        
            <p>Blues 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Jordan Lay, Marcel Renata, Angus Ta'avao, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, PJ Sheck, Joshua Fusitu'a</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Kurt Eklund, Ricky Riccitelli, Soane Vikena</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Sam Darry, Laghlan McWhannell, Patrick Tuipulotu, Josh Beehre</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Adrian Choat, Akira Ioane, Dalton Papali'I, Rob Rush, Anton Segner, Hoskins Sotutu, Cameron Suafoa, James Thompson</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Finlay Christie, Sam Nock, Taufa Funaki</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Stephen Perofeta, Zarn Sullivan, Lucas Cashmore</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Corey Evans, Harry Plummer, Bryce Heem, Meihana Grindlay</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Caleb Clarke, Rieko Ioane, AJ Lam, Mark Tele'a, Kade Banks, Cole Forbes, Caleb Tangitau</p>
        
            <p>Once again, the Blues have a powerful forward pack that will utilise the ball carrying talents of Hoskins Sotutu and Akira Ioane, while eyes will be on Dalton Papali'i as he presses a case to be the starting All Black openside. Another one to watch is Cameron Suafoa, widely tipped to be called up to the test side at some stage.</p>
        
            <p>Interesting halfback situation for the Canes</p>
        
            <p>New Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw will be without the services of two team legends but welcomes back two more in their place. Ardie Savea is off to Japan for the season, while Dane Coles had put off retirement to join him. TJ Perenara returns from a long-term injury and Brad Shields from an even longer term stint overseas, that saw him earn nine test caps for England.</p>
        
            <p>With Cam Roigard coming off a season that saw him make the All Blacks, just where does that put Perenara, a former Canes captain?</p>

            <p>Wellington's James O'Reilly, Canterbury's Ngatungane Punivai, North Harbour's Ben Grant, ManawatÅ«'s Josh Taula, Waikato's James Tucker, and Bay of Plenty's Richard Judd join as full time contracted players. For Punivai, it's his fourth NZ Super Rugby side after time at the Crusaders, Highlanders and Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 2024 squad: </p>
        
            <p>Props: Siale Lauaki, Tyrel Lomax, Tevita Mafileo, Xavier Numia, Pouri Rakete-Stones, Pasilio Tosi Hookers: Asafo Aumua, Jacob Devery, James O'Reilly</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Caleb Delany, Ben Grant, Justin Sangster, Josh Taula, James Tucker, Isaia Walker-Leawere</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Devan Flanders, TK Howden, Brayden Iose, Du'Plessis Kirifi, Peter Lakai, Brad Shields</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Richard Judd, TJ Perenara, Cam Roigard - Counties Manukau</p>
        
            <p>First five-eighths: Brett Cameron, Aidan Morgan</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Jordie Barrett, Riley Higgins, Billy Proctor, Bailyn Sullivan, Peter Umaga-Jensen</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Harry Godfrey, Ruben Love, Josh Moorby, Kini Naholo, Ngatungane Punivai, Salesi Rayasi, Daniel Sinkinson</p>
        
            <p>Laidlaw is pragmatic about his first season in charge, after spending six years as coach of the All Blacks Sevens:</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously the ultimate goal is to win Super Rugby Pacific, but we are well aware all teams will have the same goal in mind. We know how tough the competition is going to be, so initially our key goal it is to connect well as a full group, get clear on how we want to play and work hard."</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika contract 20 new players</p>
        
            <p>The real talking point around Moana Pasifika's third season is not so much about who is on the playing roster, but in the coaching box. Former All Black captain and Blues head coach Tana Umaga takes over from Aaron Mauger and is joined by Tom Coventry and Welsh rugby legend Stephen Jones. In all, there are 20 new contracted players in a squad that boasts 19 players that featured at Rugby World Cup 2023, and 11 Super Rugby debutants.</p>

            <p>Julian Savea is the big name signing out wide, where he joins the impressive cohort of Nigel Ah Wong, Neria Fomai, Anzelo Tuitavuki and Villiame Fine. There's a couple of new faces in the front row, James Lay shifts down the road from the Blues and Sateki Latu comes in from the Waratahs. Englishman Tom Savage is an interesting signing, coming in at age 34 after a long career at Gloucester.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: James Lay, Abraham Pole, Sateki Latu, Donald Brighouse, Sekope Kepu, Suetena Asomua</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Samiuela Moli, Sama Malolo, Tomasi Maka</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Samuel Slade, Tom Savage, Ofa Tauetavalu, Irie Papuni, Viliame Napa'a</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Miracle Faiilagi, Ola Tauelangi, Alamanda Motuga, Solomone Funaki, Semisi Paea, Sione Havili Talitui, Lotu Inisi</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Jonathan Taumateine, Ereatara Enari, Aisea Halo</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: William Havili, Christian Lealiifano</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Lalomilo Lalomilo, Henry Taefu, D'Angelo Leuila</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Pepesana Patafilo, Fine Inisi, Neria Fomai, Anzelo Tuitavuki, Viliame Fine, Nigel Ah Wong, Julian Savea, Danny Toala, Otumaka Mausia</p>
        
            <p>And you're not reading that wrong - that's nine outside backs listed but count some of them as midfielders as well. Julian Savea has spent a bit of time at second five at NPC level and given the wealth of wing talent that Moana have he may well find himself back there soon. Neria Fomai and Fine Inisi are more than capable in the midfield too.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders welcome in exciting backs</p>
        
            <p>Youthful is a positive way of describing the Highlanders' squad this season, inexperienced is another way - but that's nothing new for the perennial battlers of Super Rugby. Clarke Dermody says goodbye to Aaron Smith and Shannon Frizell, leaving Ethan de Groot as the only test player in his squad, but there are some interesting names that have come in.</p>

            <p>Timoci Tavatavanawai and Jacob Ratumaituvuki-Kneepkens join from Moana Pasifika and the Blues respectively, while Welsh test player Rhys Patchell takes over from Freddie Burns as the Highlanders' import first five. Argentinean Martin Bogado returns on the wing, while Tom Sanders will provide good leadership in the loose forwards after his long stint at the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Jermaine Ainsley, Daniel Lienert-Brown, Ethan De Groot, Ayden Johnstone, Luca Inch, Saula Ma'u</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Henry Bell, Ricky Jackson, Jack Taylor</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Mitchell Dunshea, Fabian Holland, Pari Pari Parkinson, Max Hicks, Will Tucker</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards; Nikora Broughton, Billy Harmon, Tom Sanders, Sean Withy, Oliver Haig, Hayden Michaels, Hugh Renton</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: James Arscott, Folau Fakatava, Nathan Hastie</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Rhys Patchell, Cameron Millar, Ajay Faleafaga</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Sam Gilbert, Josh Timu, Jake Te Hiwi, Tanielu Tele'a, Matt Whaanga</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: MartÃ­n Bogado, Jacob Ratumaituvuki-Kneepkens, Jonah Lowe, Timoci Tavatavanawai, Connor Garden-Bachop, Jona Nareki</p>
        
            <p>"We have had a few changes in our squad and our coaching group so it will be great to get everyone together and start building some cohesion through the preseason. We will just about have our whole squad together from day one, which is a nice opportunity for us," Dermody said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am also pleased to see some of the younger players that we have invested in over the last few years start to come through to Super Rugby level. I am sure their individual enthusiasm will be infectious for the squad."</p>
        
            <p>A new look for the Chiefs</p>
        
            <p>There's been a fair bit of turnover at the Chiefs. Clayton McMillan has lost Sam Cane, Brodie Retallick and Bryn Gatland to Japan, Pita Gus Sowakula and Brad Weber to France, Angus Ta'avao is moving back up the road to the Blues, while Rivez Reihana is headed down south to the Crusaders.</p>

            <p>Kaleb Trask and Reuben O'Neill return to Chiefs colours, while Jimmy Tupou's addition to the loose forwards is an exciting addition. While there are eight new full time contracted players, New Zealand U20 prop Sione Ahio is the only one to have not yet played Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 2024 squad:</p>
        
            <p>Props: Sione Ahio, George Dyer, Kauvaka Kaivelata, Reuben O'Neill, Jared Proffit, Aidan Ross, Ollie Norris</p>
        
            <p>Hookers: Samisoni Taukei'aho, Bradley Slater, Tyrone Thompson</p>
        
            <p>Locks: Naitoa Ah Kuoi, Josh Lord, Manaaki Selby-Rickit, Tupou Vaa'i</p>
        
            <p>Loose forwards: Kaylum Boshier, Samipeni Finau, Luke Jacobson, Simon Parker, Jimmy Tupou, Wallace Sititi, Malachi Wrampling-Alec</p>
        
            <p>Halfbacks: Cortez Ratima, Xavier Roe, Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi</p>
        
            <p>First five eighths: Damian McKenzie, Josh Ioane, Kaleb Trask</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Anton Lienert-Brown, Rameka Poihipi, Daniel Rona, Quinn Tupaea</p>
        
            <p>Outside backs: Liam Coombes-Fabling, Peniasi Malimali, Etene Nanai-Seturo, Emoni Narawa, Shaun Stevenson, Gideon Wrampling</p>
        
            <p>McMillan's side has nine All Blacks, however he is excited about the addition of some fringe players to the main squad.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys have been knocking on our door for a while now and we are excited to offer them a place this year. They have been impressive throughout NPC and during their time in our environment, so rightly earn their spot within our squad," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a new look squad for us but despite the changes, there remains a lot of continuity within this group. They are familiar with our environment, know how we do things, and bring a lot to the table."</p>
