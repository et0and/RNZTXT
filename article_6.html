            <p>A Taranaki rugby player has been banned for nine weeks after flooring an opponent during post-match handshakes after a premier grade match at Yarrow Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>A Spotswood United player punched a Coastal Rugby player, who was taken by ambulance to Taranaki Base Hospital examined, then later discharged after the June incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Taranaki Rugby Football Union had previously declined to reveal the penalty the offending player received because of an ongoing police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Mike Sandel said a judicial panel with three members had imposed the ban which was "towards the upper limit" of New Zealand Rugby sanctions for striking a player.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a confidential process and I won't be naming the player involved."</p>
        
            <p>The player was sanctioned for misconduct under section 10 of NZR's disciplinary rules which captures "conduct on or off the field during or in connection with a match including (without limitation) any tunnel, changing rooms and/or warm-up areas".</p>
        
            <p>And in this case, the panel looked to section nine of the rules - sanctions for foul play - to find an indication of what the penalty would've been if the offending had occurred during the game.</p>
        
            <p>Under law 9.12, a player must not physically abuse anyone with offences ranging from biting, stamping, eye-gouging to striking with the head among others.</p>
        
            <p>Penalties range at the low-end from a two-week ban to a suspension of 18-plus weeks for offending at the top-end with a maximum penalty of 208 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>For punching or striking a player with the hand, arm, elbow or shoulder top-end offences attract a ban of 10-plus weeks with a maximum penalty of a year-long suspension.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood the offending Spotswood player's suspension will carry through to next season.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison in July, a Canterbury rugby coach was suspended for 15 weeks or matches for misconduct towards a referee.</p>
        
            <p>The coach had been accused of assaulting a referee in Ashburton on 20 July, at the end of the senior B semi-final match between Hampstead and Celtic.</p>
        
            <p>A Mid Canterbury Rugby Union judicial hearing found the coach guilty of using threatening words or actions and grabbing the referee's shirt.</p>
        
            <p>The maximum penalty for the coach's behaviour was 23 weeks suspension.</p>
        
            <p>Sandel said the Coastal player who had been hit in Taranaki "was quite within his rights to take the incident up with the police" which he believed he had done.</p>
        
            <p>Police told RNZ "the investigation into this matter remains ongoing - charges have not yet been filed".</p>
        
            <p>Spotswood United and Coastal Rugby have been asked for comment.</p>
