            <p>Wellington Phoenix general manager David Dome says his side fears no one going into the A-League men's play-offs.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix finished second on the table following the conclusion of the regular season on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Central Coast Mariners finished two points ahead on top and grabbed the Premiers' Plate with a 2-0 win over Adelaide United in their make up game.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend, the Elimination Finals are played with third seeds Melbourne Victory playing sixth seeds Melbourne City and fourth seeds Sydney FC playing fifth seeds Macarthur FC.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will then play the highest placed Elimination Final winner in a home and away series and the Mariners will play the lowest place Elimination Final winner.</p>
        
            <p>While a little disappointed they did not finish the regular season on top, Dome was delighted with the sides performance so far this season.</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely thrilled, much much higher than anyone gave us credit for," Dome told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"The way the team has played and the way the young players have come through, really done the club proud. It's been fantastic.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually back us to beat anybody, we don't fear any club now given that we've beaten every club throughout the season."</p>
        
            <p>About 15,000 fans turned up for the club's last home game of the regular season and Dome was hoping they could double that for their home semi-final game.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the difference a huge crowd makes fo the players on the day."</p>
        
            <p>The highest attendance for a Phoenix home game was in the play-offs in 2010 when 32,792 turned up to watch them play Newcastle Jets.</p>

            <p>After clinching top spot, Central Coast coach Mark Jackson was full of praise for the Phoenix under new manager Giancarlo Italiano with Wellington spending a long part of the season on top of the League.</p>
        
            <p>"When they came to our place it was a terrific game of football and nil-nil at their place," Jackson said after Wednesday's game.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time we've asked them a question they've answered it, every time they've asked us a question we've answered it, so we've gone toe-to-toe.</p>
        
            <p>"Full congratulations to them for the position they finished in, they've had a terrific season and I'm sure they'll be ready to go in the finals."</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have made the A-League play-offs nine times but have never reached a grand final.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney have won the title five times, Melbourne Victory four, Central Coast two, Melbourne City one and Macarthur FC none.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix return leg of the semi-final will be on Saturday 18 May.</p>
