            <p>White Ferns star Amelia Kerr has no intention of specializing in batting or bowling and intends to stay an all-rounder.</p>
        
            <p>As a youngster Kerr started playing cricket as an opening batter, but gained selection for Wellington and then New Zealand as a leg spinner.</p>
        
            <p>She became the youngest White Fern ever when she debuted in 2016 at the age of 16.</p>
        
            <p>Two years later she burst onto the international stage as a batter when she scored a world record unbeaten 232 in an ODI against Ireland in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to be just as good at both and get the best out of myself in both facets," Kerr told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm batting, I'm batting and when I'm bowling, I'm bowling and so I don't think they need to interfere with each other."</p>
        
            <p>However her batting in recent years has been heavily relied upon by both her province and country.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr topped the batting and bowling statistics in the recent Super Smash T20 competition, outscoring Suzie Bates for the most runs.</p>
        
            <p>On the international stage she ranks in the top 15 batters in both ODIs and T20 internationals.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old now has an ODI batting average of 44.25 with four centuries in 68 matches</p>
        
            <p>Her bowling statistics are also first class, but it's her batting than has impressed many over the last couple of years.</p>

            <p>She credits both the Wellington and New Zealand set-up for that, her father Robbie for his time, while former Black Cap Grant Elliott has been mentoring her for the last five years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been something I've trained for for a long time and more so in recent years with some very good coaches.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to bat consistently in the top order in the last few years and have the opportunity to score runs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's allowed me to work out my game plan and what type of cricketer I want to be."</p>
        
            <p>One feature of Kerr's dominant batting has been her ability to play the ball late.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more about playing each ball on its merit, I like to play the ball late because that allows you to get into the best position.</p>
        
            <p>"To hit the ball along the ground you need to play it late, it also gives you more options around the field."</p>
        
            <p>Kerr has become a popular draft in the various global leagues including the Big Bash in Australia, the Hundred in England and the WPL in India.</p>
        
            <p>She'll play the first few rounds of the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield 50-over competition for Wellington before returning to the Mumbai Indians in the WPL in late February.</p>
        
            <p>"Those leagues are awesome because you're challenging yourself against the best players in the world all year round so you're constantly training and playing under pressure with the world's best. It gives you more opportunities to learn."</p>
