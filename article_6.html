            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead believes nations selecting below strength touring sides is set to happen more and more often.</p>
        
            <p>The South African Cricket Board has defended their decision to name seven debutants in their squad to play a test series in New Zealand in February.</p>
        
            <p>The majority of their first-string players will instead play the South African T20 League.</p>
        
            <p>Stead says unfortunately it's the way of international cricket these days.</p>
        
            <p>He says he's never felt he's had to justify his selections.</p>
        
            <p>"In the last year we've sent a team to Pakistan where our players have been released to play in the IPL (Indian Premier League), Stead told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's part of the changing world at the moment and that we may see this a little bit more.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly not ideal, the fans want to see the best players playing in international cricket all the time but I think the last 24 months has shown that that is unrealistic.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also unrealistic all around the world and so it's not just New Zealand that has this situation."</p>

            <p>Stead is happy with the arrangement New Zealand Cricket has with it's players.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand regularly has players involved in the Indian Premier League, while some have also featured in other Leagues around the world.</p>
        
            <p>However Stead isn't sure what the calendar might look like in the next few years.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's something we're trying to be flexible with at New Zealand Cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"To work with the players to make sure that for the pinnacle events we have the players available for us but still have the opportunity (for them) to go and play for these franchise competitions as well.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there are players that will still enjoy the luxury of a New Zealand contract and the security that that provides them.</p>
        
            <p>"Only time will tell."</p>
