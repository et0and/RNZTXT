            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have made the final of the Vancouver world series leg with a comprehensive 29-10 win over arch-rivals Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The win was a strong response to their 28-26 loss to the Australians in the Perth leg final late last month.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi side started strongly in today's semifinal, with Stacey Waaka touching down after a skilful offload from Jorja Miller, one of the game's dominant figures.</p>
        
            <p>Aussie veteran Charlotte Caslick replied, but minutes later Michaela Brake dotted down for the Kiwi side, on the end of a brilliant lead-up featuring most of the side.</p>
        
            <p>Miller scored before halftime after driving play from Sarah Hirini caused a turnover.</p>
        
            <p>It was 19-5 at halftime, and Australia desperately needed to score first in the second spell - and did with Faith Nathan sprinting away after a nice set-up by Teagan Levi.</p>
        
            <p>But the Black Ferns had easily the stronger finish, with Stacey Waaka and then Kelsey Teneti scoring.</p>
        
            <p>The win means they will extend their world series lead over Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Waaka said it was a ''massive'' performance.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been drilling on it every single moment since we lost in Perth. It was only three or four moments but we managed to counteract that today, and I'm just stoked that the girls pulled through for the big dance," she told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns' win came after big victories in the three pool matches - beating Ireland 58-7, China 38-7 and United States 37-0, before downing Canada 34-12 in their quarterfinal.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji beat Japan in the other semifinal.</p>
        
            <p>The final is at 2.41pm.</p>
        
            <p>In the men's competition play-off for fifth, Great Britain thumped the All Blacks Sevens 31-10.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's sixth placing in Vancouver follows their ninth place finish in Perth.</p>
