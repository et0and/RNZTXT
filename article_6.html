            <p>Australian middle order batter Cameron Green proved to be a thorn in the Black Caps' side during day one of the first Test in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>At stumps on day one Australia were 279-9 courtesy of a second Test century from Green.</p>
        
            <p>Green took only 46 balls to move from 50 to 100 runs during a day that was dominated by New Zealand's pace attack.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old from Western Australia arrived at the crease with Australia at 65-2 and continued to see off the Black Caps' bowlers to be unbeaten on 103 at the end of the day's play.</p>
        
            <p>For the home side Matt Henry was the best with the ball taking 4-43 off his 20 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Will O'Rourke and Scott Kuggeleijn finished with two wickets each.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Marsh, with a better than run-a-ball 40, was Australia's next biggest contributor before coming Henry's third wicket of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Marsh's was the first wicket to fall after tea and he was shortly followed by wicketkeeper Alex Carey who was Kuggeleijn's second wicket as the pace bowlers continued to improve.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Starc was O'Rourke's second wicket as New Zealand worked through the Australian tail.</p>
        
            <p>The spin of Rachin Ravindra was introduced late in the day and he took the wicket of captain Pat Cummins with an LBW for 16.</p>

            <p>Henry capped off his and New Zealand's day by taking Nathan Lyon's wicket late in the last session.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Black Caps struck three times after lunch to knock off Australia's top order as the visitors tumbled from 61-1 to 89-4 in the second session.</p>
        
            <p>In his first Test in New Zealand Marnus Labuschagne did not last long.</p>
        
            <p>Kuggeleijn had an out-of-form Labuschagne caught in the slips by Daryl Mitchell for 1 run off 27 balls in the fourth over after lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Opener Usman Khawaja was the next to go as Henry was rewarded with his second wicket when he bowled him for a cautious 33.</p>
        
            <p>Travis Head barely troubled the scorers getting out for 1 off six balls as O'Rourke got his first wicket of the series.</p>
        
            <p>Australia were 62-1 for at lunch after being sent in to bat on a green pitch in overcast conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Some inaccurate bowling to start the day gave openers Steve Smith and Khawaja an opportunity to capitalise.</p>
        
            <p>Smith was New Zealand's first wicket of the day when he edged a Henry delivery to wicketkeeper Tom Blundell in the 25th over be out for 31.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps bowled 15 overs of pace in the first hour of the day headed by captain Tim Southee who took the new ball alongside Henry.</p>
        
            <p>Newcomer O'Rourke and Kuggeleijn in his second Test were the other bowlers used in New Zealand's all-out pace attack in the first session.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opted to include Kuggeleijn in the playing 11 in place of spinner Mitch Santner.</p>
        
            <p>Australia are playing with the same 11 that lost to the West Indies in Brisbane in January.</p>
        
            <p>This the first test series between the Black Caps and Australia in New Zealand since 2016.</p>
