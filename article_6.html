            <p>Dame Lydia Ko has finished sixth at the LPGA tour's Tournament of Champions in Florida, her first event of the year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's top golfer started the day third equal, four shots from leader A-Lim Kim, heading into the final round of the LPGA season-opener, a title she won last year.</p>
        
            <p>But three bogeys in her first six holes meant she was unable to challenge the South Korean, who went on to win by two shots.</p>
        
            <p>Kim completed a wire-to-wire victory, despite the world number one Nelly Korda breathing down her neck. Kim posted her second straight 5-under-par 67 to finish the event at 20-under.</p>
        
            <p>Korda made a late push, with nine birdies in her round of 65, but she fell short and placed second at 18 under. Sweden's Linn Grant shot a 69 to take third at 15 under.</p>
        
            <p>It marks Kim's third win on the LPGA Tour and her second in a three-month span. In early November, she broke through at the Lotte Championship for her first victory stateside since the 2020 US Women's Open.</p>
        
            <p>Kim had to birdie three of her last four holes to make sure Korda wasn't too close. Korda, a seven-time winner last season, could only manage pars at Nos. 16 and 17.</p>
