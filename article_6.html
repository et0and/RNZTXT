        <h2>Ever-reliable Pompey continues Warriors legacy with contract extension</h2>
        <p>
In 2023, the centre played every minute of every game...until he was sinbinned in the semifinal defeat against Brisbane.

            <p>NZ Warriors stalwart Adam Pompey is quietly creating a legacy at the Auckland NRL club that will now extend at least another two years, after his most recent contract extension to the end of 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Now in his seventh season with the club, Pompey, 26, is just six games away from his century and has carved out a reputation as a reliable performer at centre or wing.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 30 contracted players for the 2025 season, only veteran forward Bunty Afoa has been at the club longer. Others, like Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, Chanel Harris-Tavita and Erin Clark have gone away and returned during that time.</p>
        
            <p>"I chose to stay here because I love the club," said Pompey. "I'm just really grateful that they've given me another opportunity to keep playing here."</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, he played every minute of every game for the Warriors, until the final game - the semi-final defeat to Brisbane Broncos - when he was sinbinned for 10 minutes to ruin his perfect record, but ran into a road block last season, when coach Andrew Webster tried to convert Tuivasa-Sheck into a centre, after his return from rugby.</p>

            <p>This season, Webster has moved Tuivasa-Sheck back to his original position on the wing, somewhat easing the logjam, but Pompey still faces competition from Rocco Berry and Ali Leiataua in the centres. He wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
        
            <p>"Every year is a competition, with the likes of Ali and Rocco coming up," he said. "They train really hard during the week to give me that competition and I love that.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll put my hand up for this club any time."</p>
        
            <p>The prospect of a one-club career appeals to Pompey.</p>
        
            <p>"I think so, depends whether they want me."</p>
        
            <p>All signs indicate they do.</p>
        
            <p>"Wets is such a valuable member of our squad, one of those players who always puts the team ahead of himself," said Webster.</p>
        
            <p>"He works so hard at his game, so reliable and dedicated. He knows his role and always wants to improve.</p>
        
            <p>"We love having him at the club."</p>
        
            <p>Pompey was forced to pull out of the weekend's NRL MƒÅori v Indigenous All Stars fixture with a minor hand injury, but all indications are he will be on the plane, when the Warriors head to Las Vegas for their season-opener against Canberra Raiders next week.</p>
