            <p>After more than two weeks of action-packed sport, Paris is preparing for the 2024 Olympics closing ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>It will take place on Monday, 12 August and is being held at the Stade de France, which has hosted athletics and rugby sevens during the Games.</p>
        
            <p>It is scheduled to start at 7am (NZ time) and finish at 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Sky has the New Zealand broadcast rights for the 2024 Olympics, including the opening ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Sky will have 12 channels dedicated to the games. Some will be screened on Sky Open, which is free-to-air.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers have remained tight-lipped about who is appearing, but film star Tom Cruise is heavily rumoured to be taking part by abseiling down the stadium.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a segment during which Paris hands over to the next hosts of the summer Olympics - Los Angeles in 2028 - and that could be where the Hollywood star features.</p>
        
            <p>The closing ceremony will feature performers, dancers and circus artists taking part alongside famous headlining acts, both French and American.</p>
        
            <p>Snoop Dogg, who has been prominent throughout the Games, is set to perform - as are French artists Air and Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Artistic director Thomas Jolly said the show was called 'Records', and it promises to take the audience on a science-fiction dream-like immersive journey through time.</p>
        
            <p>That will begin from the origins of the Olympic Games and will go to a dystopian future when the Olympics have disappeared and must be reinvented.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the unique artistic section, the closing ceremony will also include more traditional elements, including:</p>
        
            <p>Although the closing ceremony is taking place inside a stadium, unlike the rain-soaked opening ceremony along the River Seine, it is still open to the elements.</p>
        
            <p>No rain is forecast for Sunday. Instead it will be extremely hot, with temperatures peaking at 33C in the French capital.</p>
