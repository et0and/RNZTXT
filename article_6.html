            <p>Another chapter in the trans-Tasman rugby rivalry will be written this Sunday as the All Blacks look to defend the trophy they have had locked away for 21 years.</p>
        
            <p>With another blockbuster series against the Wallabies on the horizon, RNZ looks at 10 iconic moments between the All Blacks and Wallabies.</p>

            <p>With the trophy gathering cobwebs in a basement in Eden Park, most All Blacks up until the '70s had never even seen the Bledisloe Cup. That all changed on this fateful day in 1979 when the victorious Wallabies decided to parade the trophy around the ground, sparking one of the greatest rivalries in rugby.</p>

            <p>A thorn in New Zealand's side throughout the nineties, Campese's finest hour came in 1991 as he sent the All Blacks crashing out of the tournament with his stunning speed and footwork.</p>

            <p>They were on the wrong end of the result, but the All Blacks managed to score one of the greatest Bledisloe tries only to go down 16-15 in Sydney.</p>

            <p>Disrespect the haka at your peril. This was a lesson the Wallabies learnt the hard way as the All Blacks proceeded to put on one of the most complete performances in history after Australia opted to do some warm-up drills during the pre-game challenge.</p>

            <p>One of the most brutal don't argues in the game's history. Big Radike palmed off Adam Thompson before sprinting almost 50 metres, bisecting Corey Jane and Mils Muliaina to score the 2011 Try of the Year.</p>

            <p>The 2015 Rugby World Cup was the swansong for half a dozen All Blacks legends, and they were sent off in style as New Zealand shut out the Wallabies in the final at Twickenham. The result was put beyond doubt when Ben Smith chipped ahead and Barrett tore after as Justin Marshall cheered him over the chalk.</p>

            <p>Perhaps only second to the Sydney stunner in 2000 as the best test in the storied history between these teams. After a bloodied Kurtley Beale looked to have sealed things for the visitors, some slick interplay between Kieran Reed, TJ Perenara and Barrett saw the All Blacks pull one out of the fire.</p>

            <p>Dan Carter's first test, Joe Rokocoko at his peak bagging a treble, and the first time New Zealand put a half century on the board against the Wallabies. Things were looking promising ahead of the World Cup later in the year. That was until...</p>

            <p>More World Cup heartbreak courtesy of the old foe as a wayward Carlos Spencer wide pass saw Stirling Mortlock snatch All Black dreams out of the sky and streak the length of the field to score.</p>
