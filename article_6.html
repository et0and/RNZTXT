        <h2>One player, two clubs: Howieson’s Auckland football journey</h2>
        <p>
The Auckland FC midfielder's focus is on the clash with the Jets at Mt Smart, but he will have high hopes his old teammates can claim National League silverware.

            <p>The Auckland FC midfielder Cam Howieson's focus is on the clash with the Jets at Mt Smart, but he will have high hopes his old teammates can claim National League silverware.</p>
        
            <p>After their incredible first six weeks of professional football, there are not many fixtures in Auckland that can rival Auckland FC's for potential consequence at present. However, this weekend might be different.</p>
        
            <p>While Auckland prepare for the latest defence of a perfect start to their inaugural A-League campaign against the Newcastle Jets on Saturday, New Zealand's national champions will be crowned the following day.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's National League Championship Grand Final takes place at North Harbour Stadium on Sunday (4pm NZT) with two of the City of Sail's best teams, Birkenhead United and Auckland City getting ready to face off.</p>
        
            <p>While the Black Knights and their rivals Wellington Phoenix might enjoy professional status they stand alone in that field in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But below the fervour around the new Auckland start-up and the devotees of Wellington there is an often forgotten football system, competed for by amateurs from March till December, concluding with Sunday's showpiece.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC midfielder Cam Howieson is a man with a vested interest in both fixtures. While his focus is on the clash with the Jets at Mount Smart, he will have high hopes his old teammates at Auckland City can claim National League silverware.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, I'll be watching the final on Sunday, all things going well from our game," says former City captain Howieson.</p>
        
            <p>"Both teams deserve to be in the final and I think it will be an exciting match."</p>
        
            <p>There is plenty to play for at North Harbour on Sunday. Not just the bragging rights of being crowned the nation's top football team and qualification for next season's OFC Champions League but also, it seems, a potential route into the professional game.</p>
        
            <p>For 17 years, playing professional football in New Zealand, meant playing for the Phoenix. Now, that monopoly is at a welcome end, with more opportunities into the professional game on offer.</p>

            <p>Howieson is the perfect example. The 29-year-old has arguably been the best player in New Zealand domestic football for the past seven years. In his time at Auckland City, he won three domestic titles, five OFC Champions League medals and one Chatham Cup. But prior to his stint at Kiwitea Street, Howieson played professionally with Burnley in England and Scottish outfit St Mirren.</p>
        
            <p>"The quality is higher," he says of his step back into the pro game. "But I knew that coming in, having been away with the national team for six or seven years, I know the level.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously [been] a dream start. This is what we wanted at the start of the season. We hold very high standards within the club, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
        
            <p>"I've loved everything and am enjoying the high standards we hold each other accountable to every day."</p>
        
            <p>The emergence of Auckland FC has dramatically improved the chances of stepping into the A-League for National League players, much like Howieson has done. Of the 26-player Auckland squad, 16 have experience of playing in New Zealand's domestic league.</p>
        
            <p>That total includes the in-form Francis de Vries and Liam Gillion, who were playing National League football just last season with Eastern Suburbs and Auckland City respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's game will feature some top talent as well, including All Whites caps in City's Ryan de Vries and Myer Bevan as well as Birkenhead's Monty Patterson.</p>
        
            <p>Howieson, who has featured in every A-League game so far, is a prime example of the talent on offer in the National League system. Another is his former teammate at City, Brian Kaltak, who has arguably been the A-League's outstanding defender in two title-winning seasons at Central Coast Mariners.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a pool of players out there, and they just need the opportunity to showcase their talent," says Howieson.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Brian is a prime example of someone who waited so long for an opportunity. He's gone back-to-back and shown all the attributes. I know Brian well and he just needed a chance, and the Mariners gave him that. Hopefully, more clubs, not just New Zealand clubs, can give Kiwis and those playing in the National League a chance."</p>
        
            <p>So while Auckland's successful breakout professional stars go for a record-breaking fifth win on Saturday, the battlers of the National League system will be looking to earn the tag of New Zealand's best domestic club team - while also potentially putting themselves in the shop window for a life-changing opportunity.</p>
