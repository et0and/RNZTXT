            <p>A highly contested Sportswoman of the Year category should produce the Supreme Awardwinner at Tuesday's Halberg Sports Awards.</p>
        
            <p>Olympic champions dominate all the categories in the 62nd Awards.</p>
        
            <p>Track cyclist Ellesse Andrews, canoe sprinter Dame Lisa Carrington and golfer Lydia Ko are the obvious contenders.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews was the dominant women's sprinter at the Paris Olympic veledrome winning the sprint and keirin and claiming silver in the team sprint.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's most successful Olympian, Dame Lisa won another three gold medals in Paris to take her tally to eight. She also held off the challenge of fellow kiwi Aimee Fisher in the K1.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lydia completed her set ofOlympic medals with a two-shot victory in the women's golf event in Paris, she then went on to win the British Open and qualified for the golf Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>She also claimed the NZOC's Lonsdale Cup for her achievements in 2024.</p>

            <p>It is also a competitive men's category.</p>
        
            <p>Olympic champions, highjumper Hamish Kerr and white water paddler Finn Butcher, are obvious choices while it is great to see Premier League footballer Chris Wood among the five finalists.</p>
        
            <p>Olympic champions also dominate the team award with the Black Ferns Sevens, the K2 and K4 women's sprint canoe teams and double scull rowers Lucy Spoors and Brooke Francis (the 'rowing mums'), getting plenty of competition from the T20 World Cup winning White Ferns and the victorious Team New Zealand America's Cup team.</p>

            <p>Sportswoman - Dame Lydia Ko (and Supreme Award)</p>
        
            <p>Sportsman Hamish Kerr</p>
