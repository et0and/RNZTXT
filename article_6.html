            <p>The Hurricanes barely missed a beat without Jordie Barrett, bagging a bonus point victory against the Blues at home to start their Super Rugby season with three wins from three.</p>
        
            <p>With their star All Black sidelined through suspension, the Canes ran in four tries at Sky Stadium for a hard fought 29-21 win.</p>
        
            <p>It was a brave effort from the Blues who were struck by a double injury blow early, forcing them to play their reserve halfback on the wing for majority of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Ruben Love, Kini Naholo and Josh Moorby were outstanding for the hosts who were also missing their regular skipper brad shields and openside Du'Plessis Kirifi.</p>
        
            <p>Moorby told Sky Sport they had put a huge emphasis on defence during the week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's big, we came back from Australia with two wins under our belt, obviously a New Zealand derby so ticking that one off was massive."</p>
        
            <p>The win marks the best start for the Canes to a Super Rugby season in over a decade.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes struck first after fourteen minutes as Brett Cameron chipped it over the top and Love collected it on the full with the ball then going wide for Moorby to dive over.</p>
        
            <p>Disaster then struck for the Blues, Blues backs Zarn Sullivan and AJ Lam forced off the field after a collision.</p>
        
            <p>Both failed their HIA's, and due to the make up of the Blues bench of just two reserve backs, replacement halfback Taufa Funaki slotting in on the wing.</p>
        
            <p>His opposite immediately took advantage, Moorby going back to back after scooping up a Love pass on the double bounce before holding off Funaki to go in again in the right hand corner.</p>
        
            <p>Some fortune fell the Blue's way, Mark Telea reading the Hurricanes play a week ago and snatching an intercept to score under the bar.</p>
        
            <p>The tries kept coming for the wingers after oranges, this time Naholo the beneficiary of some Cam Roigard magic, the All Black halfback busting straight through the middle of the Blues defence, Naholo taking the final pass from Love.</p>
        
            <p>A much needed response came from the back of a lineout maul for the Blues, Kurt Eklund crashing over.</p>
        
            <p>The Canes would essentially put the result to bed after Naholo exploded through five Blues tacklers in a powerful burst before linking with Riley Higgins to push it it 29-14.</p>
        
            <p>TJ Perenara made his long awaited return to rugby, as the Blues managed another try from a driving maul, Ricky Riccitelli giving his side some hope with eight minutes remaining.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues opted for a late shot at goal in search of a consolation bonus point, but Perofeta hit the posts on the final whistle.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 29 (Moorby 2, Naholo, Higgins, tries, Cameron 3 cons, 1 pen)</p>
        
            <p>Blues 21 (Telea, Eklund, Riccitelli tries, Perofeta 3 cons)</p>
