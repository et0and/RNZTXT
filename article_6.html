            <p>Melbourne Victory will be without their influential midfielder Zinédine Machach for the A-League semi-final series against the Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Machach has been given a two-game ban after being sent off in their win over Melbourne City at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The Frenchman was given a straight red card for violent conduct in the 37th minute of the first round play-off game.</p>
        
            <p>Victory progressed to the semi-finals with a 3-2 penalty shootout victory after the game ended 1-1 after extra time.</p>
        
            <p>Machach was given his marching orders for violent conduct, after kicking out at City winger Leo Natel.</p>
        
            <p>The A-League Match Review Panel (MRP) concluded Machach had committed the offence of "assault on a player (e.g. violent conduct when not challenging for the ball) or against any other person other than a Match Official, including an attempted Assault".</p>
        
            <p>After reviewing the incident, the MRP dealt Machach the minimum two-game ban, ruling him out for both legs of Victory's Semi-Final with Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Machach has until 2pm AEST on Tuesday to advise Football Australia whether he wishes to refer the matter to the independent Disciplinary and Ethics Committee.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the Frenchman signed on for another two seasons with Victory.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old has scored seven goals so far this season and is also near the top of the league's assist category.</p>
        
            <p>The first leg of the semi-final is in Melbourne on Sunday with the second leg in Wellington the following Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Top seeds Central Coast and Sydney FC meet in the other semi-final.</p>
