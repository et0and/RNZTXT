            <p>Australia coach Joe Schmidt has inherited a "fragmented" playing group from predecessor Eddie Jones and says building cohesion in the Wallabies will be a new challenge for him.</p>
        
            <p>Jones, who resigned after the Wallabies suffered their first-ever group stage exit at the World Cup in France, axed several veteran players, including captain Michael Hooper, while promoting rookies who struggled at test level.</p>
        
            <p>Former Ireland boss Schmidt, who helped New Zealand reach the World Cup final as a selector and assistant coach to Ian Foster, said the Wallabies were a different project to the more established squads in his previous roles.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably a little bit fragmented at the moment, just on the back of last year," the New Zealander told reporters in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a number of changes during the year and it just means that there's probably not as much continuity as what I'd be used to - or that cohesion that comes with players who have played a number of years together, particularly in a national team.</p>
        
            <p>"I've come in recent times from two very settled national teams so that will be a new challenge for me."</p>
        
            <p>Once a fixture in the top two of world rankings, Australia are languishing at ninth before they face 10th-ranked Wales in a two-test series in July.</p>
        
            <p>With most Wallabies occupied with their Super Rugby Pacific clubs until June, Schmidt will have little time to decide on his best squad and put players through their paces.</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies fans hoping for a rapid rebound in the team's fortunes might be disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing's ever a short-term fix. Everything takes time, particularly cohesion when you're trying to build that relationship between players where they can almost act instinctively off each other," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>"All those things do take a bit of time but it's not a luxury we do have, so we'll be as ready as we can be when we kick off against Wales."</p>
