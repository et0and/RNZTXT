            <p>The opening day of the first test between India and New Zealand was called off without a ball being bowled due to incessant rain on Wednesday, with bad weather forecast throughout the week in the south Indian city of Bengaluru.</p>
        
            <p>The umpires inspected the surface at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium shortly before tea and decided that no play would be possible.</p>
        
            <p>It was another frustrating day for the touring side, whose Asian tour began with a one-off test against Afghanistan abandoned due to rain in Greater Noida last month.</p>
        
            <p>The current series, which also features matches in Pune and Mumbai, is part of the World Test Championship. India are eyeing a big win over the 2021 champions to improve their chances of making a third consecutive final next year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are without batting mainstay Kane Williamson for the opening match due to a groin injury sustained during the 2-0 series defeat in Sri Lanka. Pace bowler Ben Sears was ruled out of the series with a knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>The match marks Tom Latham's first assignment as the new permanent captain of the Black Caps after he took over from Tim Southee this month.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit Sharma's India, fresh from beating Bangladesh 2-0, are looking to win their 19th straight series on home soil since a 2-1 defeat by England in 2012.</p>
