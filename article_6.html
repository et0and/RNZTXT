            <p>French tennis star Gael Monfils is coming back to the ASB Classic.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils, who has completed his 21st season as a professional tennis player, has never ended a season ranked outside the Top 100 since starting his career in 2004.</p>
        
            <p>He has won 12 ATP titles, reached a career-high No. 6 in the world rankings in 2016 and played at least one final for 19 consecutive seasons. He is currently ranked world No.55.</p>
        
            <p>This year the Frenchman made the semifinals in Doha and Mallorca, and the fourth round at both the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Shanghai.</p>
        
            <p>His season includes two victories over players in the Top-10.</p>
        
            <p>He beat Poland's Hubert Hurkacz at Indian Wells and 2024 French Open and Wimbledon champion, World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, in Cincinnati.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils believes 2025 will be a pivotal year for his career, but he said he's not ready to retire.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really hard because I think it will be one of the most important seasons of my life in a way. During or after this one, of course, I will have to make some decisions, some adjustments," said Monfils.</p>
        
            <p>"So right now, I don't really think about it, to be honest, because I know it's going to be tough. But I'm ready. And I will see what life gives me."</p>
