            <p>China's table tennis player Wang Chuqin was overjoyed after securing his first Olympic gold medal alongside mixed doubles teammate Sun Yingsha.</p>
        
            <p>But his elation soon turned to disbelief, anger and frustration when he discovered that his paddle - crucial for his singles and team events - had been damaged by excited photographers rushing to capture the moment.</p>
        
            <p>Visibly upset, Wang tried to ask for an explanation. His coach tried to hug him in an effort to console him and ask him to stay calm.</p>
        
            <p>Wang soon regained his composure despite the setback.</p>
        
            <p>"At that moment, I lost control of my emotions a little. I couldn't understand why the photographers would do that," Wang said, still visibly affected by the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess they didn't mean it. I can't do anything now that it's already happened. I believe I'll still be able to play well with my backup bat. Maybe this is fate."</p>
        
            <p>Many fans expressed anger towards the photographers on China's social media Weibo.</p>
