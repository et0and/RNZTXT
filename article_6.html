            <p>Michael Cheika, who coached the Wallabies in 68 tests from 2014-19, met Rugby Australia chief executive Phil Waugh at a Sydney restaurant on Tuesday, Australian media has reported.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby Australia (RA) declined to comment on the meeting but Waugh said in a statement that the governing body had made a targeted shortlist and received a high level of interest from "quality candidates around the world".</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt will end his reign as Wallabies coach in October after this year's Rugby Championship, dashing local hopes the highly-regarded New Zealander would stay on until the 2027 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Cheika is currently coach of English club Leicester but will leave the club at the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The 57-year-old coached Australia to the 2015 World Cup final in England but left the post in acrimony after the Wallabies crashed out of the 2019 quarter-finals in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Cheika later took over as Argentina head coach and left the role after guiding the Pumas to the 2023 World Cup semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>RA hopes to confirm Schmidt's successor in coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The new Wallabies coach's first job will be preparing the squad for a season-ending northern hemisphere tour starting in Tokyo against Eddie Jones's Japan on October 25.</p>
