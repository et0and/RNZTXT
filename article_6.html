            <p>Former All Blacks winger Julian Savea scored his 61st Super Rugby try during Moana Pasifika's 23-29 defeat by the Melbourne Rebels in Hamilton last night to become the leading try-scorer in the competition's history.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old had shared the record on 60 with former New South Wales Waratahs fullback Israel Folau since scoring two tries for the Wellington Hurricanes against the Fijian Drua last May.</p>
        
            <p>Although now playing in the centres for Moana, World Cup winner Savea slid across the try line on the right wing in the 49th minute of the round-three clash to take the record outright.</p>
        
            <p>But it was not enough to inspire Moana to victory and Savea said their slow start cost them.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't turn up," Savea told Sky Sport. "Against a good team like the Rebels you can't start like that. Physically they beat us up early on and we showed our talent too late.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it [the record] means a lot. Individual accolades I like to celebrate privately. I just want to take the learnings with the boys. That's the most important part for me, making sure we turn up next week ready to go."</p>
        
            <p>Savea, who made his Super Rugby debut in 2011, scored the bulk of his tries in two spells at the Hurricanes which bookended a stint in France with Toulon. He joined Moana this year for their third Super Rugby Pacific campaign.</p>
        
            <p>He also scored 46 tries in 54 tests for New Zealand between 2012 and 2017.</p>
