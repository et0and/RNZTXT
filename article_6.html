        <p>

            <p>World Cup winning All Black coach Sir Graham Henry has said "we just need to keep building" under 85kg rugby, as the country's top club sides prepare to face off for a chance to play at Sky Stadium. The final of the Under 85kg Club Cup will be the curtain-raiser to the second Bledisloe Cup test on 28 September, a match Henry will be watching with interest.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on NZ Rugby's Around The Grounds podcast, Henry reaffirmed his commitment as patron of the grade and its positive benefits for grassroots rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"Community rugby's suffered since the game's gone professional. We just need to try and make it as attractive as possible for young people to play the game - and this is a grade that's bloody attractive. Not only are these guys filling the clubrooms…that's good financially. They're the future referees, future coaches and administrators. It keeps them in the game…we just have to keep on fostering it."</p>
        
            <p>The grade was started in the 1990s as an alternative to open weight senior rugby. At its height in the early 2000s, more than 60 teams competed in the Wellington and Auckland club competitions.</p>
        
            <p>There have been strong rumours of a New Zealand under 85kg representative side forming next season, with the likely opponents being a side from Asia. Henry said that any potential team will be "a pathway".</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to attract a lot more schoolboys to keep playing rugby after they leave school, because they've got a pathway to play for their country. Fantastic opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Henry's famously dry sense of humour meant he couldn't help make at least one selection suggestion regarding a current All Black that meets the weight criteria.</p>
        
            <p>"I hear DMac (Damian McKenzie)'s keen but Razor would need to release him."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the field of over 50 teams from around the country has been cut to four for this weekend's Club Cup semi-finals. Auckland's Pakuranga Black Panthers will host Karaka RFC from Counties-Manukau, after a thrilling quarterfinal match saw Pakuranga pip Poneke FC 28-27 with a last play penalty goal.</p>
