        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific: Blues looking like a shadow of the team that won last year</h2>
        <p>
Watch: The defending champions slumped to their third loss this season, coach says "we need to be better".
</p>
        
            <p>Four games, one win. It's not the sort of record the defending champion Blues or their fans would've even thought was possible before the season started, with many ready to start engraving their name on the trophy again before a ball had even been kicked. To make matters even more stark, that could've easily been four losses, had the Hurricanes managed to hold their nerve last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>But there was no hiding from the 21-20 score line on Friday night in front of a disbelieving Eden Park crowd, cemented when Brumbies replacement halfback Ryan Lonergan coolly booted home a penalty goal in the 79th minute. It came from an error at a lineout, which handed the Brumbies the ball, then a scrum that got dominated - which handed Lonergan the chance to call for the tee.</p>
        
            <p>It's all the Brumbies needed for a deserved victory. After all, they'd thoroughly dominated the second half and prevented the Blues from even looking like adding to their 20-10 halftime lead.</p>
        
            <p>"I think probably we didn't take the ball in the air as well as we should have," said Blues coach Vern Cotter post-match.</p>

            <p>"We turned over possession…all we needed to do in the end was get it down the other end and we couldn't manage to do it, couldn't get our lineouts to operate."</p>
        
            <p>That pretty much summed up the core issues the Blues were having, with the lineout a lottery at times and ultimately coughing up a crucial turnover.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be better than that, we need to be better…I thought we generated a lead. I saw some really good things out there. And I think if we just held onto the ball a couple more times and be more effective in the air, we would have got ourselves home."</p>
        
            <p>It was an ominous sign when the Eden Park lights were momentarily shut off after being only at half power for the first 15 minutes of the game, but that's the least of the Blues' worries right now. Beauden Barrett didn't return after halftime, having suffered a hand injury. Cotter confirmed the early prognosis wasn't good for the All Black first five.</p>
        
            <p>"It would need an x-ray; it doesn't look particularly good. But we'll wait for the results."</p>
        
            <p>While Barrett's first start in the 10 jersey was productive for the 40 minutes he was on the park, particularly his trademark burst of speed that saw him score the opening try, he will be rueing a couple of very gettable shots at goal that may well have been the difference between winning and losing.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham couldn't help but point out it was his side's first win in 12 years at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like the British and Irish Lions that comes around every 12 years. 2001, 2013 and now 2025," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that we were playing in the first half there, and we knew that the Blues are a little bit wounded coming into this game. And then, Beauden didn't come back out in the second half…and it was just the right time for us. We're very, very happy."</p>
        
            <p>Larkham singled out first five Declan Meredith for praise, who scored a try and kicked two penalties and a conversion.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got all the skills, he was kicking exceptionally well tonight. He's got a really good passing game and he's growing in confidence."</p>
        
            <p>The result continues the very good start the Australian sides have made to Super Rugby Pacific this season, with the Brumbies joining the Waratahs, Force and Reds in the top six.</p>
