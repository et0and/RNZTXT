            <p>White Ferns batter Lauren Down has been ruled out of the one-day series against Sri Lanka with a back injury, after joining the squad as an injury replacement herself last week.</p>
        
            <p>Down, who has played 35 one-dayers for New Zealand, injured her back on the morning of Tuesday's washed out game in Napier and has not recovered in time to play a part in the remaining two matches, scheduled for Nelson's Saxton Oval on Friday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Down came into the squad for Bella James, who picked up a quadricep strain that requires six weeks of rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury Magicians youngster Izzy Sharp will replace Down. Sharp was originally selected for the upcoming T20 series only, but the uncapped 20-year-old will now join the ODI squad in Nelson on the eve of game two.</p>
        
            <p>White Ferns coach coach Ben Sawyer said the team was feeling for Down.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all really disappointed for Lauren to be ruled out of the series," he said. "Unfortunately, injuries are part of the game and we wish her a speedy recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"It does provide an exciting opportunity for Izzy to join the group in Nelson for these last two matches and we're looking forward to welcoming her."</p>
        
            <p>Sawyer also confirmed Otago Sparks pace-bowler Emma Black would join the squad on Saturday, as cover for Hannah Rowe, who will miss the final game of the series to be maid-of-honour at the wedding of Central Hinds teammate Mikaela Greig.</p>
