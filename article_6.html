            <p>After a five-year break thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, New Zealand's Australian Rules men's national side, the Falcons, will finally be back in international action next month. Not only that, but they will be joined on the Sunshine Coast by the Kahu, the first women's national selection.</p>
        
            <p>The teams will represent New Zealand in the 2024 Pacific Cup, an international event that will see them in action against nations from across the Pacific region. The Pacific Cup is part of a broader AFL international program, alongside the Transatlantic and Asia Cups.</p>
        
            <p>Falcons captain Andy Howison, who has led the team since 2014, is looking forward to the challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"To be named captain again is pretty awesome. It's been a long time between drinks, the last International Cup was seven years ago so hopefully we can put in a good shift and bring the cup home."</p>
        
            <p>Australian Rules football is unique in that its international competition doesn't include players from the huge and powerful Australian Football League (AFL).</p>
        
            <p>"Essentially, it's targeted to the amateur players… so it gives the other countries around the world an opportunity to represent in a sport that's pretty exciting," said Howison.</p>
        
            <p>"Papua New Guinea are pretty strong, they beat us in the final of the last International Cup. We've had some good battles with Ireland… countries like the US, South Africa are coming through as well.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's growing, I guess it's just an awesome opportunity to meet other people around the world and learn their journey with the sport as well."</p>

            <p>Howison, who started playing started at high school in Christchurch thanks to the influence of an Australian PE teacher, said the presence of some Australian-based players will be a massive boost for the Falcons' campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking very strong, with a good base of players in NZ but also those who have made the step over to play in Australia as well. So that experience is super valuable not just for them, but for our programme as well. The lads have been training really well… we really want to put our best foot forward."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the first women's Kahu team will be captained by accomplished provincial rugby player Liv Waldron, who said that it was "a really proud moment for me and my family. I feel really honoured to be given the role to captain this first Kahu team."</p>
        
            <p>Waldron originally started playing after she was approached through her rugby province, and said that the inaugural Kahu side had quite a variation in experience.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some players who have been involved in youth training programmes and have actually moved to Australia and play regular high level footy."</p>
        
            <p>She said Australian Rules Football was an excellent choice for girls and women looking to give something new a go.</p>
        
            <p>"The game is more 360, so you find there's quite a bit more space to move. But the base skills from rugby are applicable and there's a lot of skills from other sports, for example netball with the height and jumping.</p>

            <p>"I think it's a really good option if you have a winter code, if you want to try something different instead of just continuing training. Things like fitness, finding space and obviously kicking if that's part of your game, and the contact is not as demanding."</p>
        
            <p>Another exciting part of the women's game was the pathway to the AFLW, which has been running since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>"We can really infiltrate that," said Waldron.</p>
        
            <p>"If you just keep practising the core skills, you can get quite a bit of improvement quite fast…so I think those pathways are starting to see some kiwis over there playing (in the AFLW)."</p>
        
            <p>For now though, the focus was on the upcoming Pacific Cup and making sure the Kahu story gets off to a winning start, as well as showcasing the sport to future players.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to show people that Aussie Rules is an option and getting the sport out there and the brand of the women's game out for the community to see."</p>
