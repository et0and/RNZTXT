            <p>Former Australia rugby captain Rocky Elsom has denied allegations of forgery and embezzlement while president of French club Narbonne after an international warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The 41-year-old was found guilty of forgery, use of forgery and misuse of corporate assets in 2014 and 2015 by a Narbonne court last week, French media outlets reported.</p>
        
            <p>Elsom said in a statement published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that he had not been informed of the court hearing or given an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations.</p>
        
            <p>"Not allowing me to defend the charges, is a clear perversion of justice," Elsom said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have little more information on the evidence that was presented in the hearing (other) than (what) is in the public domain. So, I can only address the allegations that have been raised publicly.</p>
        
            <p>"I have not been questioned in this matter and the lengthy process seems to have deliberately excluded me from giving evidence."</p>
        
            <p>The paper said Elsom had engaged a lawyer to appeal the court's decision.</p>
        
            <p>A powerful blindside flanker, Elsom played 75 tests for Australia and captained the Wallabies from 2009 until just before the 2011 Rugby World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>He also enjoyed a successful spell with Irish province Leinster and told Britain's Times newspaper in an interview last week that he was teaching in a Dublin school.</p>
