            <p>New Zealand Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson has announced his retirement.</p>
        
            <p>He has played for 14 seasons in the NRL and will retire at the end of this season.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson, who will turn 34 next month, informed his teammates of his decision earlier today before confirming it publicly tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a decision that I've sat with for a while now and one I'm probably still coming to terms with," Johnson said when speaking with his teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously still very raw but I'm so grateful to the club and to you boys who I get to come into work with every day with a smile on face. I have never taken any of it for granted.</p>
        
            <p>"The job (this season) is not over so, let's rip in and get back to doing what we do but I just wanted to let you all know first that at the end of the season, that will be me (done)."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson had been hampered by a chronic Achilles injury this season which was so bad at times that he struggled to walk around the house.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year he spoke candidly to friend and co-host Brook Ruscoe on his new podcast Play On Sports Show about questioning retirement.</p>
        
            <p>"The hardest part about it is I still love the sport so much. I still feel like if I'm healthy I can compete at the highest level… [but] I'm not the only one involved in this decision," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a team that are playing really well without me - so that's a factor. There is, damn, I am really enjoying being able to walk down my stairs at the moment. I'm enjoying getting out of bed and not hobbling. I feel like I can breathe again.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's also the part where, If I'm sitting at home next year and I'm watching the boys go to work… I don't know how that makes me feel."</p>
        
            <p>He later returned from a six-week layoff to make his 265th career appearance in Friday night's 20-30 loss to the Eels.</p>

            <p>"There's an entire generation of kids in this country who picked up a rugby league ball because of Shaun Johnson," One New Zealand Warriors chief executive Cameron George said.</p>
        
            <p>"His impact on not only this club but also rugby league is New Zealand is something that will be remembered here forever."</p>
        
            <p>George said as talented and amazing as Johnson had been as a player, as a person he had made just as big an impact at the Warriors through the years.</p>
        
            <p>"I know Shaun hasn't made this decision lightly and he will depart with the full support of the club and his peers.</p>
        
            <p>"Our last home game of the season against the Bulldogs, another sell-out, will be a fitting farewell for him here at Go Media Stadium."</p>
        
            <p>George said the Warriors appreciated all that Johnson had done for the club and wished him and his family all the best in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Andrew Webster said Johnson had been "exceptional" for both the club and the game for many years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a pleasure working with him at two different stages of his career here. He's a rare talent who will leave an unbelievable legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"But, as he says, it's not over yet and we want to do all we can to ensure he has the best send-off possible."</p>
        
            <p>As Warrior #168, Johnson made his NRL debut against the Sydney Roosters in 2011 in a season which ended with him playing in the grand final against Manly Warringah.</p>
        
            <p>He was the Warriors' record points scorer with 1197 points, while he was the club's second all-time try scorer with 78, one ahead of Jones and behind Manu Vatuvei's tally of 152.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson sits fourth on the list of all-time appearances for the Warriors behind Simon Mannering (301), Stacey Jones (261) and Manu Vatuvei (226).</p>
