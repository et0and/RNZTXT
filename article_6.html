            <p>NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster had some very good news for young centre Ali Leiataua, moments after his debut at the weekly Mt Smart media scrum.</p>
        
            <p>"Ali's here, because he's going to play round one and Rocco's not going to be there," Webster confirmed to virtually nobody's surprise, except perhaps Leiataua's.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you saw the way he played in the trials that he deserves it."</p>
        
            <p>Leiataua had played a starring role in the Warriors' 36-10 pre-season win over Melbourne Storm last weekend, scoring two tries and assisting on two others in a powerful performance that also left seven would-be tacklers grasping at thin air.</p>
        
            <p>His elevation to a starting role will hardly cause shockwaves through Warriors faithful, especially given the lingering injury concerns over teammate Rocco Berry heading into the new season. Leiataua's ability has been obvious for a couple of seasons now, but even in his first formal engagement with gathered reporters, he played the company line perfectly.</p>
        
            <p>"We've definitely got good centres at the club," he said. "It's good healthy competition at the club and we're all mates, so every day, we're pushing each other, trying to get the best out of each other.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, whoever Webby ends up choosing for those spots is the best man for the job on the day and that's fine by me. I'll just keep putting my hand up, doing the work and if I get picked, I get picked."</p>
        
            <p>Understandably, Leiataua, 22, is excited for the opportunity to play the season-opener against Canberra Raiders in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>"If I get picked to go," he added.</p>

            <p>Within 10 minutes, his selection became official.</p>
        
            <p>"He probably would have played more games, it if wasn't for injuries," the coach said. "In his debut, he did his hamstring… he played unbelievable and then missed 10 games.</p>
        
            <p>"The next year, he played his first game again and hurts himself, so Ali would have played way more games, Rocco's very good and Adam Pompey's unbelievable.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got good depth there and they actually support each other, and want each other to get better and the team to get better."</p>
        
            <p>Leiataua has amassed only seven appearances, since debuting in a win over the Raiders in 2023. That was his only outing during that campaign, but it was enough to earn a two-year extension to his Warriors contract.</p>
        
            <p>The return of Roger Tuivasa-Sheck from rugby further inhibited his chances last year, but again, he showed enough for an early extension to the end of 2027.</p>
        
            <p>With RTS seemingly relocated to the wing, the way into the starting line-up has become clearer for Leiataua, Berry and Pompey.</p>
        
            <p>"I think naturally everyone grows up," Webster reflects. "I'm more mature than last year and I'm in my 40s, so imagine being his age.</p>
        
            <p>"He's always been very respectful. He's one of the most competitive people I've met… he hates losing, but he's struggled to show that all the time, because he's got so much respect for the person he's training against, being younger.</p>

            <p>"This year, he's taken the shackles off and he does it with respect, but he makes sure, if he wants to win the battle, he goes after it.</p>
        
            <p>"You saw how damaging he can be."</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps the only doubt over his boarding pass to Vegas was his citing for a high tackle against the Storm, after he was fined $1000 for a similar offence at the end of last season. To everyone's relief, the threat of judicial backlash seems to have vanished into the ether.</p>
        
            <p>Leiataua began his career as a fullback and credits Webster for helping him adjust to a new position and a new attitude during his NRL apprenticeship.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I've definitely matured," he said. "My first experience with the NRL team was over at Redcliffe [during COVID], fresh out of school and 19, just a young kid, definitely excited to be among NRL players.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the years, Webby's helped me mature and focus a bit more… putting my craft first, footy first and team first, and getting better at that.</p>
        
            <p>"The intensity and the physicality… you're playing against men and some men are a bit bigger than you. It's a fast-paced game and only getting faster, so being fit and getting yourself in the best physical shape you can, that's the biggest change."</p>
        
            <p>Having proven veterans like Tuivasa-Sheck, fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad and winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak - all seasoned internationals with a combined 500 NRL games among them - around him has undoubtedly paid dividends too.</p>
        
            <p>"What I've learned is the little one-percenters," he said. "They're real consistent in their routines and have taught me not to walk past things… getting your prep right and doing the extras, all the little things that add up.</p>
        
            <p>"That's definitely helped. You can see it's helped them have these long careers."</p>
        
            <p>Like facing the media with a smile on your face and all the right answers at your fingertips.</p>
