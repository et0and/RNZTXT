            <p>A dream come true for Japan born Leo Takahashi who has joined the New Zealand team for the next SailGP season.</p>
        
            <p>The 25 year old, who was raised in New Zealand, has already had three seasons in the high-speed foiling catamarans.</p>
        
            <p>He spent season one and two with Japan SailGP as a flight controller/grinder and season four with USA as a flight controller.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a bit shocked actually," Takahashi said of finding out he made the Black Foils team. "And now I am just elated, it's a real honour. I'm excited at what we'll be able to achieve as a team over the next few seasons."</p>
        
            <p>Takahashi also competed at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in the 49er class, coming up against his new bosses Peter Burling and Blair Tuke.</p>
        
            <p>"It's every kid's dream to sail with their heroes, I think it's been really cool how they've taken me in and been so supportive," Takahashi said.</p>
        
            <p>He has been signed on a three season deal and Black Foils' co-chief executive Tuke is excited to have him on board.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a pleasure to see him grow as an athlete over the last few years and it's fantastic to have such a young talent join our team as we continue to push the Black Foils to the next level."</p>

            <p>Born in Japan but raised in Aotearoa, Takahashi's career began as an eight year old where he learnt to sail at Murrays Bay in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He quickly began competitive sailing, competing in three Optimist World Championships. As a teen, Takahashi joined the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron youth training programme and won national and international youth match racing championships.</p>
        
            <p>Takahashi was also part of the Live Ocean Racing team that competed in the ETF26 series in Europe in 2022 and 2024, alongside Black Foils team member Liv Mackay. Most recently, he sailed for Team New Zealand in the 2024 Youth America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Takahashi has a passion for the SailGP competition.</p>
        
            <p>"It's changing the sport and the format is really exciting to me. You can't really look past the boats. They're some of the fastest boats in the world, and it's going to be even more exciting with 12 boats on the line in Auckland this January."</p>
        
            <p>Takahashi's first season with the Black Foils will be in Dubai on 23-24 November, 2024 before returning to race in front of a home crowd for the New Zealand round in January.</p>
