            <p>New Zealand equestrian Tim Price riding Vitali has finished second at the Burgley Horse Trials in England.</p>
        
            <p>Price, who was second heading into the show jumping, dropped one rail to finish behind Briton Rosland Canter.</p>
        
            <p>Price, who pockets $130,000, felt it was the round of Vitali's life in the longer format competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I know he has the ability," said Tim. "I can't tell you how happy I am about that (round)."</p>
        
            <p>"He is a good horse and actually jumps a lot of good rounds but I have never produced it at an important occasion like Badminton or Burghley, so that was great. I couldn't be more pleased."</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't a fluke out there today . . . I know what I have done different and know we can do it again."</p>
        
            <p>Price won the Burghley title in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow New Zealander Monica Spencer was 11th onboard Artist.</p>
        
            <p>"He's turning into a pretty good horse isn't he," said a very pleased Spencer.</p>
        
            <p>"They all said he was a Burghley horse - they were right!"</p>
