            <p>Defending women's champion Nele Gilis-Coll has lasted just one match at the New Zealand Squash Open in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The world number ten from Belgium was beaten in the second round by Scotland's Georgia Adderley.</p>
        
            <p>Gillis-Coll, New Zealander Paul Coll's wife, had a first round bye.</p>
        
            <p>Adderley went into the match having never taken a game off Gilis-Coll, with the Belgian winning all three of their previous meetings in straight games.</p>
        
            <p>The World No.23 didn't let the record affect her, with the 24-year-old taking the match 3-0.</p>
        
            <p>"For sure it's the biggest result of my career," Adderley said afterwards. "I mean, she's top 10 in the world and I don't think I've ever beaten a top 20 player, certainly not in the PSA. So yeah, big result. Pretty happy!</p>
        
            <p>"I had a clear game plan and I played yesterday so I knew what the court was like whereas that's obviously her first time out on that court, so that definitely played to my advantage.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like I got the ball through a lot better than yesterday and I just went and played my game.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt I had a little mental blip in the second and I was lucky to win that game but it was a good performance all the way through."</p>

            <p>18-year-old Kiwi wild card Ollie Dunbar will also be in action, looking to continue his hot run of form as he plays Malaysia's Eain Yow Ng.</p>
