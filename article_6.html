            <p>A decisive blow right after half-time courtesy of the fleet footed Corey Toole has seen the Brumbies edge the Highlanders 27-21 in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>It was a frantic and high paced affair in the deep south, with the game not seeing its first scrum until the 37th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders Billy Harmon gave his side a chance with a barnstorming try under the posts, but the Brumbies kept their composure under the roof at Forsyth Bar, a trademark lineout drive ensuring the gutsy win.</p>
        
            <p>"It had a bit of everything," Harmon told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We had the pressure on but a little bit of inaccuracy and we couldn't quite nail it."</p>
        
            <p>Harmon cited Toole's try just after the break as a crucial moment.</p>
        
            <p>"One miss-read gave them an opportunity on the wing, one little detail that if you don't quite nail it, other teams can pressure you from that."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the close loss, Harmon said the lack of scrums illustrated a high quality game.</p>
        
            <p>"It was, back and forth, lots of phases, lots of skill."</p>
        
            <p>Toole concurred.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a tough old fight, the Highlanders stuck it to us, we had to man up physically and I think we did that and we came away with the win."</p>
        
            <p>After hitting the upright with his first attempt, the Brumbies conceded back to back penalties and Sam Gilbert making no such mistake with his second shot at goal to put first points on the board.</p>
        
            <p>The first try wasn't a exactly a lesson in execution, the Brumbies first taking an intercept before immediately turning it over, Nikora Broughton then kicked ahead and beat two of his teammates to the ball.</p>

            <p>All Black Ethan de Groot was forced from the field early after a failed HIA, as the Brumbies struck back following a period of sustained pressure, Tom Wright eventually muscling his way over.</p>
        
            <p>The blistering form of Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens continued at the back for the Highlanders, while Broughton and Max Hicks were industrious in the pack.</p>
        
            <p>Gilbert extended the lead shortly before the break with his second penalty, and after almost an entire half without one, the game's first scrum came after 37 minutes</p>
        
            <p>The ensuing collapse and resets saw time chewed up until the siren which saw the hosts take an 11-7 lead at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>After a strong first fourty, Hicks left the game with a wrist injury as Toole out the Brumbies back in front, using his searing speed to skin his opposite.</p>
        
            <p>Lolesio pushed the lead to six with his second penalty, but it wouldn't last long as Harmon bulldozed his way through two Brumbies defenders to power his way over the chalk.</p>
        
            <p>A scrum penalty in front of the sticks saw the Brumbies regain the advantage, before they reverted to their bread and butter, Darcy Swain scoring from a clinical lineout maul to make it 27-18 with less than five minutes remaining.</p>
        
            <p>As time ticked away, the result was out of reach for the Highlanders, but a deft chip from Ajay Faleafaga gave them a final shot at a consolidation bonus point.</p>
        
            <p>Earning a kickable penalty, the home side opted to take the points to end things 27-21 and leave with a losing bonus point.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies 27 (Wright, Toole, Swain tries, Lolesio 3 cons, 2 pens)</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders 21 ( Broughton, Harmon, tries, Gilbert 1 con, 3 pens)</p>
