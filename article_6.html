            <p>Spin twins Matthew Kuhnemann and Nathan Lyon combined to dismantle Sri Lanka and bowl Australia to a crushing victory by an innings and 242 runs in the opening test in Galle on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's biggest victory in Asia also ensured they will retain the Warne-Muralitharan Trophy, regardless of the outcome of the second and final test at the same venue next week.</p>
        
            <p>Having declared their first innings on a mammoth 654-6, Australia bundled out the hosts for a paltry 165 with Kuhnemann (5-63) leading the rout.</p>
        
            <p>A huge lead of 483 and the prospect of rain later in the day prompted Australia to enforce follow-on.</p>
        
            <p>Kuhnemann and Lyon claimed four wickets apiece to bowl Sri Lanka out for 247 to secure a victory inside four days.</p>
        
            <p>Left-arm spinner Kuhnemann finished with a nine-wicket match haul but Australia opener Usman Khawaja won player of the match for his career-best 232.</p>
        
            <p>"To get 650 allowed us an option to bowl twice," said Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith, who reached 10,000 test runs in Galle.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we batted exceptionally well and gave us a chance to press the game."</p>
        
            <p>Australia needed just 45 minutes to claim the last five Sri Lanka wickets in the hosts' first innings when the fourth day's play began.</p>
        
            <p>Kuhnemann wreaked havoc on a spin-friendly surface, while Lyon (3-57) chipped in from the other end, claiming the vital wicket of Dinesh Chandimal, who made 72.</p>

            <p>Chandimal attempted a reverse sweep against the off-spinner only to miss the ball, which thudded against his back pad.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka's top order fared no better in their second outing.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Starc, Australia's lone fast bowler, claimed two first innings wickets and hit his stride immediately when Sri Lanka came out to bat again after being made to follow on.</p>
        
            <p>The left-armer trapped Oshada Fernando lbw for six with an inswinging delivery.</p>
        
            <p>In the next over, off-spinner Todd Murphy pegged back Dimuth Karunaratne's off-stump after the batter shouldered arms.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon dismissed Chandimal (31) for the second time in one session, caught at short leg for 31 on the stroke of lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Chandimal was initially adjudged not out but an Australian review confirmed the ball had brushed his glove.</p>
        
            <p>Angelo Mathews (41), Kamindu Mendis (32), skipper Dhananjaya de Silva (39) and Kusal Mendis (34) all got starts but could not press on.</p>
        
            <p>Jeffrey Vandersay played an entertaining knock of 53 before being the last man out.</p>
        
            <p>Captain de Silva lamented Sri Lanka's dropped catches and sloppy use of reviews in what was their heaviest test defeat, but added:</p>
        
            <p>"Our batters have to put their hands up and get the big runs to put the opposition under pressure."</p>
        
            <p>The final test begins on Thursday.</p>
