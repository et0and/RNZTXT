            <p>The Warriors return to the NRLW this season after a five-year absence, and will play the majority of their home games in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Three stand-alone NRLW matches will be played at FMG Stadium Waikato late in the season. The Warriors have five home games.</p>
        
            <p>Their first game in the Waikato will be their round seven fixture against the Canberra Raiders on 16 August, followed a week later by their round eight contest against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks on 24 August, and the round 10 encounter with the powerful Brisbane Broncos on 7 September.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors NRLW head coach Ron Griffiths welcomed the opportunity to promote the team and the competition in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe the NRLW is a unique product, thus I applaud the decision by our club to work collaboratively with Hamilton council and take our stand-alone games to the region," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we are embarking on is unparalleled in the NRLW. Furthermore, playing in the mighty Waikato is pivotal for our female pathway and player development."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors' men's side played a pre-season fixture against the Melbourne Storm in Hamilton on Saturday in front of a crowd 23,344 - a record for a Warriors trial match.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors CEO Cameron George was thrilled to take the women's game there too.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge opportunity to put the spotlight on the NRLW side and the game as a whole at a time when women's playing numbers are booming in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"There's also tremendous value taking our team to the Waikato region and giving fans a great opportunity to get in behind the players, a number of whom come from the area."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors kick off their NRLW return against the Sydney Roosters on 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>The club has signed 22 of its top 24 players so far, including Black Ferns superstar Michaela Brake (née Blyde), Kiwi Ferns fullback Apii Nicholls and a host of players with international rugby league and rugby union experience.</p>
        
            <p>As a foundation club, the Warriors played in the NRLW in 2018, 2019 and 2020. They had one standalone home match in that time, hosting St George Illawarra at Go Media Stadium in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The 12 teams in the 2025 NRLW are: Brisbane Broncos, Canberra Raiders, Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs, Cronulla Sutherland Sharks, Gold Coast Titans, Newcastle Knights, North Queensland Cowboys, New Zealand Warriors, Parramatta Eels, St George Illawarra Dragons, Sydney Roosters and Wests Tigers.</p>
