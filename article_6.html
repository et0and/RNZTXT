            <p>The Blues women have suffered their first loss of the Super Rugby Aupiki season, upset 37-29 by Matatū in Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>It was a perfect 4-0 start to the campaign for the defending champions, but a superb second half performance will ensure Matatū a spot in the 2025 grand final alongside the Blues.</p>
        
            <p>It was a blistering start for the Blues as Portia Woodman-Wickliffe burst through a hole and skinned the cover to open proceedings after just two minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Powerful prop Ona Palu responded for the visitors with a close range strike before Lucy Jenkins put Matatū ahead on the back of a quick tap.</p>
        
            <p>Aldora Itunu muscled her way over to bring the Blues back and see the sides locked up at 12 apiece at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Taufa Bason put the Blues back in front after halftime with her first Aupiki try, managing to brush off the final defender to cross in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>However in attempting to run it out from deep, the Blues threw a wayward pass which was picked off by Fia Laikong who strolled over from just five metres out.</p>
        
            <p>Hannah King put Matatū in front with the extras and Jenkins extended the advantage with her second try.</p>
        
            <p>The points kept flowing with Bason bragging a brace to once again square things up at 24-all.</p>
        
            <p>A King penalty restored the lead with Kaea Nepia dotting down to make it a ten-point deficit for the Blues with 15 to play.</p>
        
            <p>Pouring on the pressure, Matatū finally cracked as Blues winger Katelyn Vaha'akolo found herself unmarked on the right flank.</p>
        
            <p>But it was too little too late as King put another penalty through the posts to seal a stunning upset for the southerners.</p>
        
            <p>The teams will play again in a fortnight to crown the 2025 Aupiki champions.</p>
