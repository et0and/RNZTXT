        <h2>'Validation’ - DMac’s decision says a lot about NZR’s eligibility policy</h2>
        <p>
Much has been made about eligibility rules lately, but this latest development shows just how strong the pull of the black jersey is.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - The test season is still months away but it's fair to say the All Blacks have already scored their first big victory of 2025. Damian McKenzie is locked in for another four years, giving us an idea of what Scott Robertson's plans are for the next World Cup and beyond. It also shows that NZ Rugby (NZR) has no desire at all to change their eligibility policy, which will see the All Blacks selected out of New Zealand-based team till the end of the decade at the very least.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a little bit of validation when you see someone like Damian commit long term," admitted NZR chief executive Mark Robinson, who has been part of plenty of discussions around the All Black eligibility policy. Staying on message was obviously a lot easier on the back of an announcement like this.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe, fairly and squarely that this is the right thing for the game in this country. And I've said it a lot of times, and in recent times that, the calendar we have coming up is something that I think players look at and are incredibly excited about. So if you want to be part of those opportunities, you have to be playing rugby here to be part of them."</p>

            <p>Robinson is talking about the World Cup and the 2029 British & Irish Lions tour, which is now coming into its own as a very handy bargaining chip for NZR when dealing with this current generation of players. If McKenzie can be a part of winning both, he and the rest of the future squad will have achieved something no other All Black team ever has before. But that's not the only carrot being dangled in front.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the things coming up, we are looking to consider more opportunities in the United States and places like Japan playing in absolutely iconic stadiums and iconic matches, which will be remembered for many, many years in the history of the game. Players are driven to be part of the best experiences seems to be coming through for us, which is great," said Robinson.</p>
        
            <p>For his part, McKenzie described the decision as "easy".</p>

            <p>"Obviously there were opportunities overseas… When I'm in New Zealand I only want to be at one cIub and it's here at the Chiefs. That was a pretty easy decision. And I mean, I guess for myself, there's no place like home."</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie's deal does include a year off Super Rugby Pacific, presumably in 2028 when he can cash in on a short term deal in Japan. He's already had one season up there with Suntory Sungoliath, defying expectations by coming back from the much softer Japanese league in 2022 in extremely good form for the All Blacks. Even giving him another stint is a very good bit of business for NZR, considering that by the time McKenzie does finish up, he would've spent 13 out of 15 seasons in New Zealand competitions.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson steered a wide path around questions as to how much offshore interest they'd had to compete with for McKenzie's signature, as it's not hard to think that with the right deal the 61-test utility could've been among the highest paid players in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just focusing on the fact he's staying here," said Robinson.</p>

            <p>"He talked also a little bit about how he's coming into those prime years, where you know, he's got that experience behind him. He's at that age where you can put it all into going forward."</p>
        
            <p>Of course, the thing that's putting the biggest smile on the faces of Robinson and his cohorts at NZR is the message it sends: McKenzie is staying an All Black and wants to be a part of the ongoing success of the team, no matter how much money's being offered to him elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>It's hard not to think that will be taken notice of by his team mates as the All Blacks enter a massive few season.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no doubt that securing some of the most-high profile, most experienced players is always incredibly positive for the wider rugby system," said Robinson.</p>
        
            <p>"And we'll just keep working on a case by case basis."</p>
