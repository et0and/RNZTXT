            <p>His support of initiatives such as the 'Best Foot Forward for Tonga' and the Blues community outreach during last season's extreme weather events in Auckland show his dedication to the club and the region's people.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud to have played so much rugby for one club and it's been cool to grow as a person and a player with the Blues."</p>
        
            <p>"I take a lot of pride in contributing not only to our Blues community but also to the development of our younger players. It's great to work with the new front-rowers and I'm committed to ensuring we build strength in that area," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Head of Blues Rugby, Murray Williams, lauded Tu'ungafasi's re-signing, emphasising his invaluable contribution to the team.</p>
        
            <p>"Ofa's work ethic is second to none and his prowess in the scrum is unmatched. He brings a positive vibe and good-natured spirit to our club, we're stoked to have him with us for another two seasons," said Williams.</p>
        
            <p>"Having Ofa on board for the next two seasons reinforces our aspirations to drive towards winning a Super Rugby Pacific Championship. His experience, coupled with his unwavering commitment to the Blues, will undoubtedly inspire our pursuit of silverware."</p>
