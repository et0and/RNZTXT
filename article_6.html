            <p>India's Virat Kohli has been fined 20 percent of his match fees following a clash of shoulders with debutant Australia opener Sam Konstas in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli was booed by the crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after bumping into the 19-year-old as Konstas walked down the pitch for a chat with opening partner Usman Khawaja at the end of the 10th over on the opening day of the fourth test.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli and Konstas turned to face each other and exchanged words, prompting umpire Michael Gough and Khawaja to step in to defuse the moment.</p>
        
            <p>Match referee Andy Pycroft found Kohli guilty of breaching the International cricket Council's (ICC) code of conduct relating to "inappropriate physical contact".</p>
        
            <p>"No formal hearing was needed as Kohli accepted the sanctions proposed by match referee Andy Pycroft," the ICC said in a statement.</p>

            <p>Kohli also incurred one demerit point but is free to play the fifth and final test in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who was covering the game for host broadcaster Seven Network, said veteran batsman Kohli was clearly the offender.</p>
        
            <p>"That man (Kohli) might have a few questions to answer," Ponting said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're out there batting, the batsman owns the wicket. The crease is his. Especially between overs like that."</p>
        
            <p>Former England captain Michael Vaughan also put the blame on 36-year-old Kohli.</p>
        
            <p>"Virat Kohli is such an experienced pro, being wound up by a 19 (year old)," the Fox Cricket pundit said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's Virat that walks into Sam."</p>
        
            <p>Konstas, who replaced the dropped Nathan McSweeney in the side, appeared unruffled by the clash, smashing Jasprit Bumrah for four on the next delivery and hitting a six over the Indian pace spearhead's head on the way to 18 runs from the over.</p>

            <p>Konstas downplayed the incident after Australia went to stumps at 311 for six.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he accidentally bumped me, but I think that's just cricket, just the tension," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar told reporters he had not seen the incident and that emotions were natural in a big game.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm pretty sure that it's not as big as it seems," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Batting maestro Kohli had shrugged off a dire run of form with a century in the series-opener in Perth but has managed just 21 runs in three innings since in the series.</p>
        
            <p>With the temperature surging past 30 degrees Celsius in the morning, his mood may not have been helped by Konstas surviving a nick off Bumrah that fell just short of him in the slips.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli had earlier laughed openly at Konstas when the teenager botched two attempts to scoop Bumrah behind the wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Konstas succeeded on his next three efforts with the T20-style shot, scoring boundaries on each.</p>
        
            <p>Konstas was eventually dismissed for 60 off 65 balls when trapped lbw by Ravindra Jadeja before lunch.</p>
