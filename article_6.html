            <p>The Paralympic team is riding after a fourth medal overnight Wednesday, but the chef de mission says they have a busy few days and "lots more potential medals" still to come.</p>
        
            <p>Will Stedman took out the silver medal in the Men's 400m T36 final, after earlier wins at the velodrome and from sprinter Danielle Aitchison.</p>
        
            <p>Paralympics chef de mission Raylene Bates told First Up everyone was performing "really really well".</p>
        
            <p>"When you see athletes doing PBs at a pinnacle event and winning medals... you can't do any more than doing a PB and gaining a medal.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots more competition to go, lots more potential medals but yeah, we're on a bit of a high at the moment."</p>

            <p>Bates said they were looking forward to the cycling individual time trial, equestrian, athletics heats and more swimming on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite exciting, pretty full packed programme for the next two or three days," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The support for the athletes, especially when some one French was competing, was overwhelming for some of the athletes, Bates said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing, not just the swimming, the cycling at the velodrome, the Stade de France, even in the table tennis yesterday - you can't hear yourself think."</p>
