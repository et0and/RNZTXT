        <h2>'I carry him everywhere': Garden-Bachop set for emotional debut after brother's death</h2>
        <p>
Jackson Garden-Bachop had hoped that he would play for Moana Pasifika alongside his late brother.

            <p>It was a dream for the Garden-Bachop brothers to one day play together for Moana Pasifika, and Jackson will carry the memory of Connor into his debut season for the franchise.</p>
        
            <p>In June 2024, Garden-Bachop's younger brother Connor, died aged 25 following a medical event in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"I try and carry the memory of him every time I wake up, every time I do anything, I try and carry him everywhere, not just the field."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said he and Connor spoke about one day making the move to Moana together.</p>
        
            <p>"He talked about how cool it would be if we could both get up here. Obviously our cousin Aaron [Mauger] was coaching at the time, so we talked about it, and I know he'll be happy that I'm here."</p>
        
            <p>Tragically, Garden-Bachop is no stranger to grief.</p>
        
            <p>"I lost my mum when I was very young, my step siblings lost their father as well when they were really young. We understand the process that's going to happen and is going to continue to happen for months and years and forever to come."</p>
        
            <p>Of Māori, Samoan, French Polynesian and Cook Island descent, the Wellington first five said it's been a special time connecting with his Pasifika roots.</p>
        
            <p>"I think whenever you go to a new team, it's kind of like first day of school vibes, but within half an hour, it was pretty easy to fit in here. Polynesian culture is very welcoming, so it's been easy. The boys have been awesome."</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off an NPC title victory with the Lions in his 100th appearance, Garden-Bachop said his Wellington teammates at Moana were still riding high from the win.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still trying to hold the energy of winners and bring that into the group. We are confident in what we can give this group."</p>

            <p>Finishing 11th in 2024, and 12th in 2023 and 2022, Garden-Bachop said Moana has their sights set much higher this season.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's realistic that we make the top six. I think we'd be disappointed if we didn't and that will put us in that position where if we play our best game, we will be hard to beat."</p>
        
            <p>As well as Garden-Bachop, Moana have also landed the marquee signing of Ardie Savea for the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the big thing that I've noticed is just the depth that's here now. We go live against each other at training 15 on 15 and it's even, there's no one site that's dominating the other. So I think that's a place where we've really grown as a team."</p>
        
            <p>With Albany acting as a more permanent home base for the side in 2025, Garden-Bachop said there was a sense things were on the rise at Moana.</p>
        
            <p>"With more financial security, finding a home out here on the [North] Shore, playing better and better rugby every year, I think the only way to go is up."</p>
        
            <p>It's been a difficult 12 months for Garden-Bachop, having not only lost his brother, but also battling injury after a tough stint in France.</p>
        
            <p>"[It was] A tough season for the club that I was at. A tough season for myself personally but it taught me a lot about resilience and how grateful I am to be back in New Zealand now."</p>
        
            <p>Late in the NPC season, Garden-Bachop suffered another setback, but fought on to feature in the final.</p>
        
            <p>"I tore my hamstring off the bone, so that's gone. The physios warned that maybe the rest of my body will start compensating to make up for it, but I haven't felt the repercussions of that yet, so hopefully it stays like that."</p>
        
            <p>As well as reconnecting with his heritage at Moana, Garden-Bachop is now under the tutelage of a childhood hero and close family friend in Tana Umaga.</p>
        
            <p>"I grew up idolising him and playing with his nephews, Peter and Tom. So it is a really special connection but once we get out on that field, it's very much coach-player and I respect him in that way and he respects me in that way too."</p>
