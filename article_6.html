            <p>"I'm honoured to be appointed CEO of my home provincial union. This role holds deep, personal significance as I return to where my rugby journey began after 15 years abroad.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm grateful for the international opportunities to contribute to the game at every level, globally, nationally and regionally and have gained insights and experiences from world-class people, organisations, competitions and teams.</p>
        
            <p>"Now it's a privilege to help future-proof rugby in my home province. I look forward to the opportunity to serve my community and family, especially my mother who needs me nearby, and build on the strong legacy that was led by Colin Jackson the past 20 years."</p>
        
            <p>NORFU board chair Warren Prescott said Naoupu's appointment came after a thorough recruitment process.</p>
        
            <p>"Sene has a broad range of entrepreneurial and management skills and her genuine passion for our rugby community made her the ideal candidate for the role.</p>
        
            <p>"She has made an immense contribution to rugby locally and globally. We are thrilled to have her onboard."</p>
