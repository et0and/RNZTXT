            <p>One team on the up, one holding up the bottom of the ladder. Before the season started, you'd be forgiven for thinking the Highlanders would be the latter side, but after four rounds Jamie Joseph's project is very much looking ahead of schedule. They're coming off a bye and a couple of good wins, plus have already thrown up a couple of narratives for the test season later in the year.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the 'Canes are officially on struggle street after crashing to three losses from four games. They welcome back some big names and will need all the help they can get to get their season back on track.</p>

            <p>Ethan de Groot and Saula Ma'u come back into the starting front row, while Nathan Hastie gets another start at halfback after his good showing against Moana Pasifika. Jona Nareki returns from injury to give the Highlanders a bit of extra firepower out wide, he pairs up with the in form Caleb Tangitau.</p>

            <p>Asafo Aumua and Tyrel Lomax are back from injury and will come off the bench, which might present the Highlanders with a few problems if the second half is a close run thing. Brayden Iose drops to the bench as Canes coach Clark Laidlaw has the luxury of rolling his loose forwards - Brad Shields, Du'Plessis Kirifi and Peter Lakai are a very strong starting unit. Jordi Viljoen backs up Cam Roigard on the bench in his first appearance of the season.</p>

            <p>The Canes have won their last four Super Rugby Pacific games at Forsyth Barr Stadium including a 47-12 win in their last game at the venue. They've not lost to the Highlanders there since Round 10 of the 2020 Super Rugby Aotearoa campaign.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders have won only two of their last 23 Super Rugby Pacific games against New Zealand opposition and will be looking to win back-to-back derbies for the first time since 2018 after beating the Blues 29-21 in Round 2 this season.</p>
        
            <p>Cam Roigard has made six try assists this Super Rugby Pacific season, two more than any other player in the competition. He has also scored one try in each of his last two games against the Highlanders.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make sure where there are opportunities to go that we do and we give players confidence to do that. We're looking forward to being back at home this weekend." - Highlanders assistant coach Ben Smith.</p>
        
            <p>"We're creating a lot. We just need to be better at recognising when we've done the job and execute." - Hurricanes assistant coach Bryn Evans.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 41 - 14 Highlanders</p>
        
            <p>Two tries to Du'Plessis Kirifi was enough to establish a big first half lead for the Canes, as they strolled to a comfortable win in Wellington. TJ Perenara also scored his 65th and final try in this match, a record that may not last much longer the way Sevu Reece is playing.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Canes did finish their last loss with a wet sail, running in three good tries in an ultimately fruitless comeback against Moana Pasifika. They'll definitely be keen to keep that attitude going under the roof in Dunedin, especially with the big running threat of Aumua coming off the bench. Timoci Tavatavanawai will once again be the focal point of everything the Highlanders try to do, but outside him Tanielu Tele'a is playing the best rugby of his career as well.</p>
