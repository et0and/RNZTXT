            <p>Champions Manchester City turned up the heat on their Premier League title rivals with a 5-1 home win over relegation-threatened Luton Town to move top of the table.</p>
        
            <p>With Arsenal and Liverpool both playing on Sunday, City marched above them with a rampant display to move to 73 points from 32 games. Arsenal (71) host fourth-placed Aston Villa while Liverpool (71) welcome Crystal Palace.</p>
        
            <p>It was a statement win by City in their chase for an unprecedented fourth successive English title, and more evidence that any team finishing above them will have to be near-perfect between now and the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Tottenham Hotspur's hopes of finishing fourth and ensuring a Champions League berth were dealt a blow as they were hammered 4-0 at Newcastle United who moved into sixth place to boost their own European hopes.</p>
        
            <p>At the bottom Brentford eased away from trouble with a 2-0 home win against Sheffield United for whom time is running out.</p>
        
            <p>Nottingham Forest missed the chance to do the same as they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Forest are in 17th place, one point above third-from bottom Luton Town and six ahead of 19th-placed Burnley who drew 1-1 at home to Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester United are away at Bournemouth later on Saturday, trying to reclaim sixth place from Newcastle.</p>
        
            <p>City needed only 65 seconds to go ahead against Luton with Erling Haaland's wayward volley smashing into the face of Luton's Daiki Hashioka and into the net.</p>
        
            <p>Luton hung in grimly but Mateo Kovacic's strike made it 2-0 in the 64th minute before Haaland made it 3-0 from the penalty spot for his 20th league goal of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Jeremy Doku and Josko Gvardiol were also on target for City, with Ross Barkley grabbing a consolation for Luton.</p>
        
            <p>Kicking off early, Tottenham had the chance to move three points above Villa in the scrap for fourth place but were blown away by a clinical Newcastle side.</p>
        
            <p>Newcastle struck twice in the space of two minutes in the first half with Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon punishing some poor defending by the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Isak made it 3-0 when he latched on to a long clearance early in the second half to take his league tally for the season to 17 and Fabian Schar added a fourth late on.</p>
        
            <p>Tottenham dropped down to fifth below Villa on goal difference and with a tough run-in to come will have to dust themselves down quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"Newcastle were good, credit to them, I thought they were really good today. We just didn't really get a grip of the game at all," Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said.</p>

            <p>Brentford moved up to 14th in the table as Thomas Frank's side ended a winless run of nine Premier League games.</p>
        
            <p>An own goal by Oliver Arblaster gave Brentford the lead in the 63rd minute and Frank Onyeka wrapped it up in stoppage time with his first goal for the club.</p>
        
            <p>Matheus Cunha scored twice for Wolverhampton Wanderers in his first start for two months to deny Forest a vital three points in their bid to stay up.</p>
        
            <p>Cunha gave Wolves a first-half lead with a superb solo goal, before the excellent Morgan Gibbs-White equalised on the stroke of halftime and Danilo put Forest in front before the hour-mark.</p>
        
            <p>But a mistake by goalkeeper Matz Sels allowed Cunha to score his second and earn his side a point.</p>
        
            <p>Burnley will also rue a missed opportunity as they were held by Brighton -- an embarrassing own-goal by goalkeeper Arijanet Muric costing them the three points.</p>
        
            <p>Substitute Josh Brownhill put the home side ahead in the 74th minute but Burnley's joy was short-lived as Muric allowed a Sander Berge back pass to roll under his foot.</p>
