            <p>The Black Sticks have opened their men's hockey Olympic qualifying tournament with a resounding 3-1 win over Chile in Oman.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand took control from the outset, leading 2-0 after the opening quarter and were never threatened by the defensive-minded South Americans in an ideal first-up match in Muscat.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Sticks require a top-two finish in their pool - which also includes Germany and Canada - to reach the reach the semi-finals, and then need to either reach the final or win the third-fourth playoff if they're to qualify for the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>With Chile adopting a defensive approach, New Zealand were able to dominate the tempo and they opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a sweeping goal to Jake Smith.</p>
        
            <p>The scorer and the provider - Joe Morrison - were both making their international return after suffering injuries at last year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The lead was doubled five minutes later when Scott Boyde scored his maiden goal by swiping home Kane Russell's delivery into the circle.</p>
        
            <p>The scores were unchanged until Sam Lane scored on the stroke of the third-quarter break while Chile bagged a goal in the dying minutes of the match when Franco Beccera unleashed a reverse shot from the top of the circle, capitalising on what the Black Sticks thought was a pause in play due to a second ball on the pitch.</p>
        
            <p>The match represented a notable milestone for three Black Sticks, with Hugo Inglis, and Blair Tarrant both playing their 250th match and Kane Russell his 200th.</p>
        
            <p>Their second match is on Wednesday morning against pool favourites Germany, who thumped Canada 9-0 in their opening match.</p>
