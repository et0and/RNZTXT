            <p>Blues captain Patrick Tuipulotu is a shock naming in their side for this Saturday's Super Rugby Pacific final against the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Originally thought to be out of action for up to seven weeks and missing the start of the All Black season, Tuipulotu's return is a timely boost to an already strong Blues side.</p>
        
            <p>He returns two weeks after he suffered a tear to his medial ligament in his right knee in the Blues' 36-5 quarter-final win over the Fijian Drua, but was cleared to play after testing the knee at training on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Vern Cotter said the decision to play Tuipulotu was made with careful medical consideration.</p>
        
            <p>"He tested the knee on Monday in the gym, then on the grass yesterday. He's pulled up well and has the all-clear from our medical team - he's a welcome addition to our pack, our talisman lock and leader," Cotter said.</p>
        
            <p>Blues team doctor James McGarvey said the injury was a known quantity.</p>
        
            <p>"Patty felt good on Monday and with strapping found he was able do everything rugby related with minimal symptoms. Given it's a final, he decided to try to work through the week and play," McGarvey said.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, Cotter has made minimal changes to his victorious semi-final side with Josh Beehre making way for Tuipulotu, meaning James Thompson drops out of the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Bryce Heem has also recovered from his calf injury to come onto the bench, with Corey Evans dropping out.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a deep desire in this group to go the whole way but to do that we need to be clear in our thinking, disciplined and not let the occasion get the better of us," Cotter said.</p>
        
            <p>The last time the Blues made a Super Rugby Pacific final they went in as favourites at Eden Park but lost to the Crusaders 21-7.</p>
