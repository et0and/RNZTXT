            <p>Former All White Sam Malcolmson has died, aged 77.</p>
        
            <p>Malcolmson was a member of the 1982 World Cup squad after making his international debut in 1976.</p>
        
            <p>A defender, Malcolmson also netted two goals in his 15 international cap career, having emigrated to Aotearoa from Scotland as a 27-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>Former team-mate Ricki Herbert said it was a sad day for New Zealand football.</p>
        
            <p>Herbert, who went to Spain with Malcolmson and the '82 All Whites, said Sam was an integral member of the team.</p>
        
            <p>"A great character, a super guy. I was just a young fella on the banks of Newmarket Park seeing players like Sam play in the National League and hoping one day I could step on the field and enjoy football at that level as well, so a real trailblazer of football right through to representing New Zealand at the highest level in the biggest competition in the world."</p>
        
            <p>Herbert said Malcolmson's passion for the game was unrivalled.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a super committed guy, he loved the game, was great around the team, heart on the sleeve, loved to wear the fern, loved to be a part of the national team and he brought the enthusiasm, passion and honour to that shirt."</p>
        
            <p>Herbert said Malcolmson was also very successful outside of football, in both business and horse racing.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a tremendous and iconic part of that team that will always be very dear to my heart and was a big part of Sam's life."</p>
        
            <p>Malcolmson was also a founding member of the group Friends of Football, a group dedicated to growing the game for all ages and abilities.</p>
        
            <p>He was also prevalent in media, as a respected voice of football.</p>
