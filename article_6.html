            <p>A rare Ferrari stolen 28 years ago from an ex-Formula One driver in London has been recovered by police.</p>
        
            <p>The red Ferrari F512M was shipped to Japan after it was taken from Gerhard Berger in 1995, the Metropolitan Police said.</p>
        
            <p>The car, worth $730,000, was one of two Ferraris that were stolen. The other remains missing.</p>
        
            <p>Officers said it worked with Ferrari and international car dealerships in a "painstaking" investigation.</p>
        
            <p>No arrests have been made.</p>
        
            <p>The sportscar had been stolen in April 1995 while Mr Berger was at the San Marino Grand Prix in Imola, Italy.</p>
        
            <p>The force's organised vehicle crime unit and the National Crime Agency discovered the car had been in Japan until it was brought back to the UK in late 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Ferrari alerted the force in January after it carried out checks on the model, which was bought by a buyer in the US.</p>
