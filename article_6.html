            <p>Diver Lizzie Roussel has been named for New Zealand team for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where she'll be cheered on her her biggest fan, 2-year-old daughter Athena Olympia Jean Roussel.</p>
        
            <p>Roussel (nee Cui) will compete in the women's 3 metre springboard diving event in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>She won bronze at the 2023 Oceania Championships in the 3m springboard and placed 14th in the same event at the 2023 World Championships.</p>
        
            <p>"Being named on the Paris 2024 team is something I never saw coming," Roussel said.</p>
        
            <p>"I qualified for the Tokyo Olympic Games in the best physical and mental position I had been in my career, but I found out I was pregnant the year of the Games and withdrew to have my daughter."</p>
        
            <p>Roussel wasn't sure whether she would continue diving after having her daughter, and thanks her partner for pushing her back into the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know how my body would respond to pregnancy and childbirth but my husband encouraged me to try again and so I began this journey.</p>
        
            <p>"Making the team feels like a fairytale ending to an unexpected story. Having my daughter alongside me has only made me stronger and appreciate each moment more."</p>
        
            <p>Roussel was the first New Zealand diver to compete at the Olympic Games in 24 years when she contested the 3m event in Rio on her 18th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>She also competed at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>Roussel began diving at the age of nine. She was awarded a diving scholarship to Louisiana State University as a teenager, and is now based in Louisiana with her partner and child.</p>
        
            <p>The women's 3m springboard event will begin on 7 August at the Paris Aquatics Centre.</p>
