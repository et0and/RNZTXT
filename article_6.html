            <p>Bangladesh have comfortably beaten the Black Caps by five wickets in the first Twenty20 international in Napier, chasing down their modest target of 135 with eight balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>The ninth-ranked tourists were on the front foot throughout the match at McLean Park after winning the toss and capturing the first three New Zealand wickets for just one run.</p>
        
            <p>They didn't take their foot off the throat, going on to post their first T20 win over the Black Caps on New Zealand soil, having lost the nine previous attempts.</p>
        
            <p>They achieved the same maiden feat in the one-day international format last week - also in Napier - even though they lost that series 2-1.</p>

            <p>Given their momentum, Bangladesh will fancy their chances of clinching the three-match T20 series, with the two remaining games staged in Mt Maunganui on Friday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>After restricting New Zealand to 134-9, Bangladesh looked in control throughout their response, with opener Litton Das finishing on 42 not out.</p>
        
            <p>He received lively support from several team-mates, most notably Soumya Sarkar, who scored 22 off 15 balls.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand threatened to apply the brakes at times, most notably during the four-over spell of left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, the captain taking 1-16 in a tight spell through the middle stages.</p>
        
            <p>A crucial moment came early in the 18th over when Das struck Ben Sears for six, with the shot having been caught in the outfield by Ish Sodhi before the Black Caps fielder stood on the boundary rope.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, allrounder Jimmy Neesham scored 48 off 29 balls for New Zealand, who spent their innings rebuilding from a horror start.</p>
        
            <p>Neesham struck four fours and three sixes but was the only Black Cap to go past 25 as the Bangladesh attack showed the sort of intent that carried to victory in the third and final ODI at the same venue last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists exploited lively early conditions to remove openers Finn Allen (one) and Tim Seifert (duck) while Glenn Phillips departed without scoring after being trapped LBW without offering a shot.</p>

            <p>As was the case in the ODI series, seamer Shoriful Islam was the most effective Bangladesh bowler, taking 3-26 off four overs, including Santner for 23 after the Black Caps captain put on 41 for the sixth wicket with Neesham.</p>
