            <p>The Rugby Football League says it is "exploring all options" after Samoa turned down its invite for a three-match series in England next autumn.</p>
        
            <p>It means England currently have no international fixtures scheduled for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa instead intend to compete in the 2024 edition of the Pacific Shield alongside the likes of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>RFL chair Simon Johnson said the decision was "disappointing".</p>
        
            <p>"We can't afford to dwell on it. They have made their decision," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We now owe it to Shaun Wane and the players, and to England supporters, to deliver meaningful international rugby league in 2024, and we are working with RL Commercial and [governing body] the IRL to make that happen.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll make further announcements as soon as there are any positive developments."</p>
        
            <p>England won their series 3-0 against Tonga, which was held in October and November in St Helens, Huddersfield and Leeds.</p>
        
            <p>Both England's men's and women's teams will tour Australia in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand and Australia have also agreed to visit England in consecutive years after the 2026 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>This story first appeared on the BBC.</p>
