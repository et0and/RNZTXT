            <p>England assistant coach Paul Collingwood admits they were undone by some magnificent hostile bowling on day two of the third and final test against New Zealand in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>England were dismissed for 143 in their first innings with the Black Caps reaching 136 for 3 in their second innings at stumps with a lead of 340 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Henry took four wickets and Will O'Rourke three, in spells that impressed Collingwood.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we witnessed a pretty special hostile spell of Test bowling," Coillingwood said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was great to watch, I'm glad I wasn't the one facing it.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you've got to take your hats off, you don't see those kind of spells every day and I thought that was a real standout one for them."</p>
        
            <p>Henry finished with four for 48, O'Rourke three for 33, while spinner Mitchell Santner took three for seven from three overs.</p>
        
            <p>The highest successful fourth innings run chase in Test history is the 419 the West Indies scored to beat Australia in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a rising target, Collingwood isn't giving up hope with still three days to play.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got world-class batters who still have the belief that we can go out and chase whatever they get.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course it's going to be pretty difficult from this position but you never say never."</p>
        
            <p>Day three will start with New Zealand on 136 for three with Kane Williamson on 50 and Rachin Ravindra on two.</p>
