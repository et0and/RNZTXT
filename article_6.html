            <p>New Zealand Rugby Commercial Limited (NZRC) boss Craig Fenton is leaving just over a year into the role after failing to agree over the future direction of the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Fenton's involvement began during the 2023 Rugby World Cup and he formally joined NZRC in January 2024 from his previous role leading strategy and operations for Google's UK and Ireland business.</p>
        
            <p>NZRC Chair Ian Narev said the company and Fenton had agreed to part ways.</p>
        
            <p>"Craig and NZRC have agreed that Craig's vision of change and approach to driving it are not fully aligned with the organisation. Accordingly, Craig and NZRC have mutually agreed that Craig will leave the Company," Narev said in a the statement.</p>
        
            <p>Fenton, who will vacate the role in January 2025, said he had enjoyed his time with NZRC but believed it was the right decision to step down.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a privilege to play my part in helping NZRC start down this path of deepening relationships with tens of millions of fans here and overseas. NZRC has a strong team, and I am proud of the tangible progress that team has made over the last year. I believe in the opportunity as much as I did when I moved back home from the UK to take this role.</p>
        
            <p>"But while we have strong shared aspirations within NZRC, we have differing views on the change needed to achieve those aspirations, and so the next phase of progress is best suited to a different leader," Fenton said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby declined to comment further.</p>
        
            <p>The NZRC Board will finalise its plans for appointing Craig's successor in coming months following the appointment of new independent NZR Board which is expected to be in place by the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby Commercial (NZRC) was formed as part of the Silver Lake deal, in which the American equity firm bought a stake in NZR.</p>
        
            <p>NZRC controls New Zealand Rugby's commercial assets such as gate revenue, broadcast rights revenue and sponsorship agreements.</p>
        
            <p>It manages merchandising and sponsorship for the sport.</p>
        
            <p>The NZRC board is made up of nine directors, including former All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, who is the New Zealand Rugby Players Association representative, media entrepreneur and NZR board deputy chair Bailey Mackey, NZR chief executive Mark Robinson and Silver Lake managing directors Stephen Evans and Simon Patterson and two independents, Rob Fyfe and Gina Brogi.</p>
        
            <p>Brogi, a past President of Global Content Distribution for 20th Century Fox, and Fyfe, best known as a former chief executive of Air New Zealand, were the final two directors appointed to the NZRC board, which is chaired by Ian Narev.</p>
