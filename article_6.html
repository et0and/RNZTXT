            <p>RNZ looks over the biggest moments, statement performances and all the water cooler chat from the weekend's rugby around the globe.</p>
        
            <p>37 Magic Minutes</p>
        
            <p>Scrum resets are the fastest way to frustrate a fan into switching channels, and not seeing one for almost an entire half in Dunedin allowed for some thrilling rugby between the Highlanders and Brumbies. Credit must also go to referee Ben O'Keeffe for policing the area well.</p>
        
            <p>Franks' Brain Fade </p>
        
            <p>Not exactly the impact Rob Penney was looking for from the 108-test prop from the pine. The former All Black's ugly cleanout of Justin Sangster was an unfortunate end to another unfortunate result for the now 0-4 defending champions.</p>
        
            <p>Italians Inspire, Wales Woeful</p>
        
            <p>Italy backed up its upset over Scotland last weekend with a less shocking 24-21 over a hapless Wales. The result sees Italy equal its record highest world ranking of eighth while Wales went without a win in their Six Nations campaign, slumping to their record low of 10th.</p>
        
            <p>Josh Adams presents Ange Capuozzo with his Player Of The Match Medal after Ange sets up the pivotal try for the Italians to seal the win in Cardiff ❤️#GuinnessM6N #WALvITA pic.twitter.com/q7bFogwrKa</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs out-Drua the Drua </p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie and the Chiefs took the razzle dazzle to the masters of ad-lib footy in Hamilton, running in six stunning tries in the 46-29 drubbing.</p>
        
            <p>Throwbacks to taps</p>
        
            <p>It was beautiful to see good old-fashioned tap moves come off for both Moana Pasifika and the Fijian Drua at the weekend.</p>

            <p>Circle 30 March on the calendars as the second meeting between Chiefs Manawa and the Blues is shaping as the Super Rugby Aupiki decider. The Blues sent a statement at the weekend with a 52-5 win over Poua, while Manawa remain unbeaten after edging Matatu 38-22.</p>
        
            <p>Japan Watch</p>
        
            <p>Lining up a penalty to put his side ahead with two minutes to play, Beauden Barrett pulled off an unlikely try-assist for Toyota Verblitz which appeared to have won the game only for Suntory to steal a 39-38 in the 82nd minute.</p>

            <p>Stock Drop</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders. Just how bad can it get for the former standard bearers of Super Rugby?</p>
        
            <p>Stock Rise</p>
        
            <p>Billy Harmon responded to his suspension for being late to a team meeting with a powerful performance in Dunedin, making 28 out of 28 tackles and scoring a blistering solo try, carrying half the Brumbies' defence over the line.</p>

            <p>Try of the Week</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Sevens star Niall Williams-Guthrie bagged this screamer for the Blues after a chipping ahead off her knee and outgunned the cover defence with ease.</p>
        
            <p>Quote of the Week</p>
        
            <p>"Your job is to bring the water" - Mathieu Raynal</p>
        
            <p>The water crews can be annoying at the best of times, but when Welsh assistant coach Neil Jenkins tried to well and truly overstep his mark, French referee put him firmly back in his place.</p>
