            <p>New Zealand golfer Steven Alker has won the latest PGA Champions Tour event in Arizona, after a remarkable final round.</p>
        
            <p>Alker started the day four shots back at the Cologuard Classic but shot 66 in the final round to climb six places, as did American Jason Caron.</p>
        
            <p>The pair headed to the clubhouse tied for first and had to watch and wait as others tried to close in on 12-under for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Australian golfers Greg Chalmers and Rod Pampling were in close pursuit before the latter fell one shot short to finish at 11-under. Ernie Els' putting game let him down with the South African finishing 10-under.</p>
        
            <p>Chalmers gave himself a chance to force a three way play-off when he went into the 18th hole needing a birdie but a missed putt cost him.</p>
        
            <p>On the 18th play-off hole, Alker had a chance to putt for birdie to win the tournament and the reigning Charles Schwab Cup Champion held his nerve.</p>
        
            <p>Alker has now jumped to second on the overall tour standings, with a second and a tie for fourth in his first two starts of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi was incredibly consistent in 2024 but said it was nice to win a tournament for the first time in a while.</p>
        
            <p>"You just grind away, I've been in a lot of top tens and top fives, been in the hunt so it's just being patient and working hard on the body in the pre-season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been 13-14 months since my last win so just to get over that little hurdle and get that win. The game has just been feeling good, just consistently week in week out so that's what I want, to give myself chances.</p>
        
            <p>"Moving forward, I've got a Charles Schwab Cup to defend so I've got to get it going ... the competition is just getting so good so you've got to keep getting better."</p>
        
            <p>Alker's win earned him $580,000.</p>
