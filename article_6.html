        <h2>'Kindness off-field, business on' - Kiwi Ferns' gentle wrecking ball</h2>
        <p>
Despite a cult hero status, Mele Hufanga still questions whether she belongs at the top of rugby league.

            <p>She is one of the most intimidating ball carriers in rugby league, but the toughest obstacle Kiwi Fern Mele Hufanga has had to run through has been self doubt.</p>
        
            <p>Despite her ability to dominate defences and a cult hero status, Hufanga still questions whether she belongs at the top of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Self doubt has always been with me. It's something that can kill me, literally a battle between me and myself. When it hits me, I remind myself why I do what I do, and surround myself with amazing people. If they believe in me, then I gotta believe in myself as well."</p>
        
            <p>Hufanga said her insecurity stems from what she describes as a humiliating incident with an Auckland rugby team when she was just 17.</p>
        
            <p>Rooming with a senior player, Hufanga awoke early one morning to see her teammate was also awake, and so Hufanga turned on the TV.</p>
        
            <p>No mention was made at the time, though later that day, Hufanga was informed a complaint had been laid for her "inappropriate behaviour," and she was forced to move rooms in front of the entire squad.</p>
        
            <p>Still affected by the feelings of inferiority she suffered that day, Hufanga has since vowed to ensure no young players experience the same.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'm in a team and there's new people coming on board, I make it a goal for me is to make that person welcome in the team, knowing what I had to go through in teams, feeling uncomfortable, thinking what other people might think about me.</p>
        
            <p>"I try my best to to help the young ones coming on board to be comfortable and to be themselves. If I make them feel safe in this environment, imagine what they can do on the field."</p>

            <p>The Ferns centre has also fought financial hardship throughout her early life, a struggle she kept quiet from teammates.</p>
        
            <p>With no car and unable to afford transport, she would often walk many kilometres to train, sometimes in pouring rain.</p>
        
            <p>"They weren't the easiest years. But I guess everyone has their own stories, their own walk in life. I'm glad that I went through what I had to go through, because where I am right now. I'm so grateful for it, and I feel like I'm blessed. I believe that behind every smile there's always going to be a story."</p>
        
            <p>Having been a coveted name for both Super Rugby Aupiki and the NRLW, Hufanga is slowly learning to have confidence in her game.</p>
        
            <p>She made her debut for the Blues women in 2022, before making the switch to rugby league and joining the Broncos in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"I love union, it was my first sport, but I feel like where I am right now is the path I want to be on, I'm still learning the game and getting myself comfortable with the code and being in the Broncs as well, they've helped me so much on and off the field."</p>
        
            <p>Making her test debut in 2020 for Tonga, Hufanga would switch to the Kiwi Ferns in 2022 with an eye on the world cup.</p>

            <p>However, she won't rule out a return to Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that in my heart there's going to be a day when I'm going to put that red jersey on, but I think right now, my heart's with the Kiwi Ferns. I know a lot of people are asking questions, but I feel I'm not done yet with the Kiwi Ferns."</p>
        
            <p>Hufanga looms as a key figure for the Kiwi Ferns as they meet Australia in the Pacific Championships final in Sydney on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Having been shut out by the Jillaroos in the regular round, Hufanga said they are not focusing too much on their more favoured opposition.</p>
        
            <p>"We just need to just play our game, play early and not worry about them."</p>
        
            <p>She said she gets particularly hyped when facing the best in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"I have faith and belief in my team that we can come on top, I know that there's people out there counting us out, so I guess we just got to turn up on Sunday and see what happens."</p>
        
            <p>With a plethora of online clips of her steamrolling helpless opposition, Hufanga credits her genetics for her power.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a Pacific Islander and we're just built different."</p>

            <p>Brutal with ball in hand, Hufanga's gentle nature belies her on-field style.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always lived my life wanting to be a better person. I value kindness and I feel like every day, if I spread a little kindness to others, hopefully that will make their day. I also want to be known as a good person."</p>
        
            <p>That is until the whistle blows.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it just comes down to business when it's on the field."</p>
