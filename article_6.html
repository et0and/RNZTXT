            <p>An irresistible late 11-point surge has landed the New Zealand Breakers a two-from-two record early in the Australian NBL season.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers came from behind to beat South East Melbourne Phoenix 81-79 at Spark Arena in Auckland on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix were leading 70-67 with seven minutes to go, but the Breakers then let loose, with Jonah Bolden's triple topping off their 11-point run.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix rallied, narrowing down the margin to a point with under six seconds left, but the Breakers held firm at the death.</p>
        
            <p>Imports for the Breakers made a strong impression, with Parker Jackson-Cartwright leading the scoring with 20 points, ably backed up new guard Matt Mooney with 15.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Mennenga chipped in with 11 points and nine rebounds, while Boden had eight points, including the vital triple.</p>
        
            <p>It has been an impressive start for the Breakers under new coach Petteri Koponen, while the result leaves the Phoenix 0 from 3.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers are now second on the NBL table, delighting Kopenen.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud of these guys. It wasn't always pretty today but sometimes basketball is like that and we found a way.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone who stepped on the court did their part and it's a nice feeling to take the win."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers now head to the US for exhibition games against NBA sides the Utah Jazz, Philadelphia 76ers and Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
