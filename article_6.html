            <p>The Wellington Phoenix are set to play in front of a sell-out crowd in Saturday night's A-League semi-final second leg against Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>Capacity at Sky Stadium is 34,500.</p>
        
            <p>The club's record attendance is almost 33,000 set when they hosted a semi-final in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend's nil-all draw in Melbourne has the match this weekend set up for a winner take all.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix captain Alex Rufer says playing in front of a capacity crowd means a lot.</p>
        
            <p>"We deserve it, Wellington deserves it and it would be awesome for the club," Rufer said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've really given it everything this year and hopefully we get a good crowd to show us that they support us too."</p>
        
            <p>Defender Sam Sutton said the biggest home crowd he's ever played in front of was 24,000 and that was something special.</p>
        
            <p>"That game I think I ran 12k and I felt like I could run another 12 because the fans - they just give you that adrenaline and that extra wind.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that we've got a full (hopefully) stadium now is going to be massive for us and one, I'm really excited and two, they're going to be the 12th man for us."</p>

            <p>The game has been described as the biggest in the club's history.</p>
        
            <p>The villain out to ruin the party is Melbourne Victory and their coach Tony Popovic said it was a great occasion for his side also.</p>
        
            <p>"Credit to Wellington to have a big crowd, they deserve it, they've had a wonderful season," Popovic told a media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"The stadium should be full to support them, we should embrace the hostility, enjoy every moment on the park and trust ourselves and know that we're good enough to go through."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix and Hurricanes Super Rugby side share the same training facilities in Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes coach Clarke Laidlaw said there was a lot of support for the Phoenix within their camp and a number of the staff and players will be at the game.</p>
        
            <p>The Yellow Fever supporters take their shirts off late in the game if they're winning... but Laidlaw wasn't so sure he'd be joining in.</p>
        
            <p>"Have you seen this rig.... not planning on it but if they win, stranger things have happened."</p>
        
            <p>While a big crowd means a lot for the home side, Victory midfielder Ryan Teague was playing down the significance.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if it's the fans that are going to affect us so much.</p>
        
            <p>"It always gives a bit more motivation but we as a team have got so much belief that if we go there and play the way we play, we can win."</p>

            <p>The Phoenix defended well in the first leg and would be satisfied with the away draw.</p>
        
            <p>However, captain Alex Rufer admitted they will need more on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are positive and happy with the result (first leg), I think in terms of a performance defensively we were solid but I think we can be a lot better and will show that this weekend."</p>
        
            <p>A possible penalty shootout is looming if the game finishes level after extra time.</p>
        
            <p>Defender Issac Hughes said while a shootout wasn't good for the blood pressure, they were ready if it happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been in a shootouts for the Academy team in games with much less importance than this and it is nerve-wracking but it's one of those things you've just got to do what you do and be confident, go up and if you miss you miss, but as long as you fully commit to what you're doing and don't change your mind halfway through," Hughes told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>As far as the local fans are concerned they'll be hoping the tie is well and truly wrapped up in regulation time.</p>
        
            <p>The winner of the game will meet either minor premiers Central Coast or Sydney FC in the Grand Final.... Central Coast lead that tie 2-1.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington semi kicks off at 6.30pm.</p>
