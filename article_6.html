            <p>There is a feeling of coming home for spinner Ajaz Patel now that the Black Caps are in Mumbai.</p>
        
            <p>Mumbai is where he was born and grew up and was also the place where he produced one of the greatest performances in test cricket.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps have arrived in Mumbai for the third and final test against India already on a high after wrapping up the series.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists thrashed India by eight wickets in the series opener in Bengaluru before winning the second match in Pune by 113 runs, ending their opponents' home streak of 18 successive series triumphs stretching back to 2012.</p>
        
            <p>The last time India were swept in a home series was in 2000 when they lost 2-0 to South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly emotional, being back in Mumbai is always special, it's a place I call home as well," Patel said on the eve of the third test.</p>
        
            <p>"After my ten-for I wasn't sure whether I would get another opportunity to play out here again."</p>
        
            <p>On 3 December, 2021 India won the toss and decided to bat first in the second test against New Zealand in Mumbai. They finished the day on 221 for four with Patel taking all the wickets.</p>
        
            <p>He returned the next day and in the space of 40 overs he helped dismiss India for 325, finishing with figures of 10 for 119 off 47.5 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Patel became the third player in the history of test cricket to take all ten wickets in an innings, following England's Jim Laker against Australia in Manchester in 1956 and India's Anil Kumble against Pakistan in Delhi in 1999.</p>
        
            <p>Patel took 14 wickets in the test (which New Zealand lost) and 19 in the two test series (which New Zealand lost 2-0).</p>

            <p>He's not expecting to have the same success against India this time.</p>
        
            <p>"They're certainly an opposition that are very skilled and so for us as a spin group especially it is about controlling what we can control and can apply pressure for long periods of time.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to be pretty happy, we know how tough a task it is to win against India at home let alone win a series."</p>
        
            <p>Patel admits they've played some very good cricket over the last couple of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"I suppose for this game it is important that we start again and forget about what has gone and put that to bed so that we can focus on what is in front of us."</p>
        
            <p>Patel is familiar with the Wankhede Stadium wicket.</p>
        
            <p>"You know that red soil is going to offer you a bit more pace and a bit more bounce and it will definitely turn, it is just a matter of when.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow spinner Mitchell Santner is the leading wicket taker in the series so far with 13 wickets, while Patel has bowled 41.2 overs in the two tests taking four wickets at an average of 49.</p>
        
            <p>The 36 year old appreciates the role he has had to play.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously Mitchell is bowling really well from the other end so for me while I'm still trying to take wickets, I'm performing the holding role and trying to restrict runs so that the pressure doesn't come back on us.</p>
        
            <p>"Going into a new game that (situation) could flip again.</p>
        
            <p>"For me it continues to be the same about keeping it simple and allowing the surface to do the work for you."</p>
        
            <p>The third and final test starts on Friday.</p>
