            <p>Spain fought back to beat France 2-1 in an entertaining Euro 2024 semi-final with a stunning Lamine Yamal strike and a Dani Olmo goal booking their spot in the final in Berlin.</p>

            <p>The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani's opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup tournament before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.</p>
        
            <p>The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, will now face the winners of Wednesday's match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.</p>
        
            <p>Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.</p>
        
            <p>France did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.</p>
        
            <p>But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.</p>
        
            <p>Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was turned in by France's Jules Kounde.</p>
        
            <p>France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.</p>
        
            <p>But the 2022 World Cup finalists could not carve out an equaliser.</p>
        
            <p>Both Spanish goal-scorers were ecstatic.</p>
        
            <p>Player-of-the-match Yamal, who turns 17 a day before the final, said: "I'm very happy to have made it to the final. Now the most important thing is to win it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were in a difficult moment, you wouldn't expect a goal so soon, I wanted to put it in where it went in, and I'm very happy. I try not to think too much, enjoy it and help the team and if it works out like this, I'm happy and content with the victory. I want to win, win and win."</p>

            <p>Olmo said Spain can't lose sight of what has carried them to the decider.</p>
        
            <p>"There is one step missing. It is unbelievable to be in the final," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It does not matter who scored my goal (which deflected into the net off Jules Kounde) it was important for the team. We deserve to be in this final. We're a step away from glory."</p>
        
            <p>France coach Didier Deschamps was gracious in defeat.</p>

            <p>"Spain proved tonight that they are a very good team. We were fortunate to open the scoring, but they caused us problems because they were superior in terms of control," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight they showed all their qualities. We were... perhaps a little less fresh, which led to some technical waste, particularly in the construction of the game. We didn't push forward often enough."</p>
