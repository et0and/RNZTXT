        <h2>Stevenson lifts lid on All Blacks snub, future plans</h2>
        <p>
Shaun Stevenson hinted at a potential test-switch, plus where he wants to head after his time at the Chiefs is over.

            <p>Blues v Chiefs</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm Saturday 15 March</p>
        
            <p>FMG Stadium Waikato</p>
        
            <p>Live blog coverage on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs fullback Shaun Stevenson revealed that "not knowing where I sit in the pecking order" in terms of All Black selection has played a big part in his future plans. Stevenson missed the first four rounds of Super Rugby Pacific playing for Japan Rugby League One side Kubota Spears on a short-term deal, and said he wants to return to the Tokyo-based side after his Chiefs contract is up.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess after last year it was pretty disappointing," said Stevenson at Chiefs training on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the disappointing thing was just the feedback in terms of where I was sitting and, you know, I can't help or change that. So, you know, I've got to do what's best for myself and for my family. That's just part of footy, right? So just got to keep moving forward"</p>
        
            <p>Stevenson didn't entirely close the door on a push for higher honours this season, however very much said his eyes were on what was going to happen in the next stage of his career.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, obviously I'm a one-test All Black, you can't take that away from myself. I guess being up in Japan, you kind of think about a lot of things around outside of footy, you open your eyes up to a lot more things when you're in New Zealand compared to when you're in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand rugby is not going to be the whole time. So, I have to look after my future and my family and stuff."</p>

            <p>By the next World Cup in 2027, Stevenson will be eligible for selection by Manu Samoa, something he was open to.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe, we'll see, we'll see. I'm not sure if they got the coaching staff sorted at the moment. So, I mean, that's not a no. So we'll see what happens. And obviously, World Cup in a couple of years, so, we'll see what happens here."</p>
        
            <p>He also didn't rule out a code switch to rugby league, after being very close to signing with the Dolphins in 2023 and being rumoured to being in talks with the Warriors last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll see. Yeah, I'm not too sure what's down the track but, could be. Never say never."</p>
        
            <p>Stevenson was the form fullback in Super Rugby Pacific in 2023 and seemed a shoo-in for the All Blacks' World Cup plans later that year. However he was overlooked for selection until the second dead rubber Bledisloe Cup test, in which he scored a try in what ended up being his only test appearance.</p>

            <p>He now returns to a Chiefs side desperate to finally add a Super Rugby title to the two they won in 2012-13, after walking away from the last two finals empty-handed. They face the Blues on Saturday night in Hamilton, a team Stevenson said will "be desperate".</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously they're a classy team that probably just haven't had the results go the way the last couple of games. They'll be hungry. The Battle of the Bombays always turns out to be a classic…they'll bounce back, we're looking forward to the challenge."</p>
        
            <p>Stevenson is starting at fullback after being ushered back into the side last week via the bench in the Chiefs' loss to the Drua. He now becomes part of an interesting narrative around the side's 10 and 15 jerseys, with Damian McKenzie getting his first start of the season at first five. Despite slotting back into the team late, Stevenson doesn't feel like he needs to prove a point.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not doing it for anyone else apart from these boys and the team and the coaching staff is, you know, at this club and the fans. I feel like there's no weight on my shoulder to do anything special. I'm just going to go out there and be Shaun Stevenson."</p>
