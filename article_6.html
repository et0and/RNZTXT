            <p>NZ Warriors will be without star winger Dallin Watene-Zalezniak for at least the first six weeks of the NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster confirmed Watene-Zalezniak could be sidelined for up to 12 weeks with an injury sustained in a pre-season clash with Cronulla Sharks, but was not exactly sure how long he would need to recuperate from surgery on his wrist.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to wait a bit longer, but it won't be before round six and could be round 12," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Webster said the winger will leave a void across the early rounds.</p>
        
            <p>"Dallin is a world-class player and when he gets an injury like that, we'll miss him. It's one of those weird things and that's part of footy."</p>
        
            <p>However, Webster said the injury opens the door to wider squad members.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we have a squad," he said. "Sometimes depth is our biggest threat.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got Rocco Berry, who should be back early rounds. We also have some other good kids coming through."</p>
        
            <p>In another change to the 2024 backline, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck appears to have made the permanent shift from centre to the wing.</p>
        
            <p>"Roger needs the ball and we want Charnze to be our fullback," Webster said. "To have him, Charnze and Dallin if he's fit, that's a pretty cool combination there - a triple threat.</p>
        
            <p>"Every forward in the NRL doesn't want to tackle Roger."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will play their final pre-season match against the Storm in Hamilton on Saturday, before kicking off their campaign against Canberra Raiders in Las Vegas on 2 March.</p>
