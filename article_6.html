            <p>The Professional Tennis Players' Association has filed a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.</p>
        
            <p>The PTPA, co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019, said on Tuesday that after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, it had been forced to take legal action.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, it said that along with more than a dozen players the PTPA had filed papers in a New York court against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation and the International Tennis Integrity Agency.</p>
        
            <p>"Tennis is broken," Ahmad Nassar, executive director of the PTPA, said in a statement. "Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.</p>
        
            <p>"We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.</p>
        
            <p>"Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come."</p>
        
            <p>Describing the various governing bodies as "a cartel", the PTPA accuses them of paying "artificially low compensation to professional tennis players" and imposing a "draconian" ranking system that forces them to compete in certain tournaments.</p>
        
            <p>It also calls the schedule unsustainable, says players are made to play in extreme heat and in the early hours of the morning and that tennis balls are causing chronic injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to filing the lawsuit, the PTPA said it met with more than 250 players across the tours, including the majority of the men's and women's top 20.</p>
        
            <p>"The overwhelmingly positive player feedback was a resounding confirmation - change is needed now, and players are united in their fight for reform," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>The ITF, ITIA, WTA and ATP have all been contacted by Reuters for comment.</p>
