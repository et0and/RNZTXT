            <p>A conversion attempt with time up on the clock to draw the game proved a hurdle too far for young Crusaders first five Rivez Reihana.</p>
        
            <p>The replacement kicker had a chance to square things up against European powerhouses Munster, after an 82nd minute try to Jamie Hannah to bring the score to 21-19.</p>
        
            <p>However, Reihana's shot sailed just wide of the uprights to end a pulsating clash in Cork.</p>
        
            <p>The fixture served as the first for the Crusaders without Scott Robertson and under new head coach Rob Penny.</p>
        
            <p>The Super Rugby Pacific champions were without all their World Cup All Blacks but typically still boasted a heap of experience across the park.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, 165-test caps of experience was lost after only fifteen minutes when Welsh recruit Leigh Halfpenny left the field with a shoulder injury.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts struck first after fifteen minutes as Gavin Coombes rumbled his way over the chalk, before the powerful prop went back to back again from close range to put Munster up 14-0.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders then clicked.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Macca Springer showcased his blistering speed, breaking out of his own half and linking with Dallas McLeod who in turn found the ever present Mitch Drummond looming on the inside for the try.</p>

            <p>McLeod, who made his All Blacks debut in 2023, then stormed his way past three Munster defenders to score his side's second, Reihana nailing the difficult sideline conversion.</p>
        
            <p>Munster regained a seven point advantage through hooker Scott Buckley with ten minutes remaining but the Crusaders were relentless in the final minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The defence eventually cracked as Hannah found his way to the try line but it would be the final points for the tourists, Munster claiming another famous win over a kiwi side.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in Japan, Vern Cotter's Blues were too strong for Sungoliath in their pre season opener.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues ran in seven tries in the Tokyo sun, with sevens star Caleb Tangitau dotting down twice in the 43-7 rout.</p>
        
            <p>Sungoliath were without its marquee signings Sam Cane and Cheslin Kolbe while the Blues also had several All Blacks on the sidelines.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues stormed to a 19-0 lead after just fifteen minutes through tries to Sam Darry, Kurt Eckland, and Tangitau.</p>
        
            <p>A slick backline move gave the healthy Japanese crowd something to cheer about when Kotaro Matsushima scored to halt the Blues onslaught.</p>
        
            <p>Their dominance continued after the break however, a superb grubber pass from Anton Segner setting up replacement halfback Taufa Funaki.</p>
        
            <p>Tangitau bagged his brace on the back of a deft offload from fullback Cole Forbes.</p>
        
            <p>Another heads up play by Blues loosie lead to a sixth try, Hoskins Sotutu chipping ahead for Kade Banks who had too much gas for the cover.</p>
        
            <p>The cake was iced with some superb handling by the Blues backs to send Forbes away to seal the one sided victory.</p>
        
            <p>Next weekend sees the Blues take on the Yokohama Eagles, the Chiefs play the Saitama Wild Knights and Crusaders meet the Bristol Bears.</p>
