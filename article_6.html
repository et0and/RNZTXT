            <p>New Zealand's Erin Routliffe will have two shots at Australian Open doubles glory after advancing to the women's and mixed semi-finals in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and compatriot Michael Venus can qualify an all-New Zealand team for a grand slam doubles final for the first time if victorious in Wednesday's semi against Australian duo John Peers and Olivia Gadecki.</p>
        
            <p>Rourtliffe, 29, will team up with Canadian women's doubles partner Gabby Dabrowski for their semi-final on Thursday or Friday as they seek to continue a remarkably consistent record at major tournaments.</p>
        
            <p>Her first focus is the mixed competition, where her growing status as a doubles player was appreciated by Venus after Tuesday's 6-7 6-1 10-5 win over Argentina's Andres Molteni and American Asia Muhammad.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old's set let the side down early on.</p>

            <p>"The first set wasn't ideal. There were a few double faults in that first game from me and I wasn't making many returns," Venus said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then Erin managed to cheer me up after the first set and that kind of changed my outlook and perspective and I started playing a lot better.</p>
        
            <p>"And Erin kept doing the things that she's been doing so it ended up quite well."</p>
        
            <p>Venus has pedigree in grand slam doubles, having won the men's title with American Ryan Harrison at the 2017 French Open.</p>
        
            <p>He has also reached mixed doubles finals three times, losing on each occasion: at the 2017 and 2019 US Opens - both with Chinese-Taipei's Chan Hao-ching - and the 2023 French Open, with Canadian Bianca Andreescu.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Routliffe said she and Dabrowski were finding their groove following the 6-3 6-2 quarter-final defeat of Japan's Miyu Kato and Mexico's Renata Zarazua.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander was relieved they won the first set for the first time at the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"That was our goal, we were happy to get on and off for our quickest match, it was really hot," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every match we've been a little bit better.</p>
        
            <p>"It was our cleanest match. We don't have many super-clean matches but that's because everyone is really good. We just try to fight in the big moments, stick together and be a team.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy to be in two semis, I'm ecstatic, that's all I can say about it."</p>
