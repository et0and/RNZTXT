            <p>A heartbroken Sam Gaze has spoken of how he tried to overcome a "horrendous" start and had nothing left, after climbing to sixth in a fast Olympic mountain biking medal final.</p>
        
            <p>Gaze told reporters after his gutsy race he had "emptied" himself in a fast and "attritional" race won by Britain's Tom Pidcock, who roared back after suffering a puncture to retain his title.</p>
        
            <p>Pidcock had needed all his skills to first claw back a 40-second deficit, and then hold off France's Victor Koretzkyin in a barnstorming last-lap battle through the trees and rocks of the 4.4km Elancourt Hill circuit.</p>
        
            <p>Gaze had worked tirelessly to pull himself back into contention after a poor start. After eight laps he was back in 16th, but gradually worked his way back into contention until Pidcock spread the field with his searing ride.</p>
        
            <p>"I emptied myself out there," Gaze said. "I can only be content that I had left everything out there."</p>
        
            <p>He described his start as "unfortunate" and "horrendous", but tried to stay calm and come back into contention.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously the result is not what I came here for. To be honest, I'm quite heartbroken. At one point, I believed a medal was still in reach after my horrible start, and then when I tried to follow back to [the lead group] I knew I didn't have it then."</p>
        
            <p>An advocate for mental health, Gaze had spoken openly about dark days after suffering injuries in a crash.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday (NZ time) he talked about trying to focus on the positives, despite coming to terms with a result not as good as he had hoped.</p>
        
            <p>"I like to think I am in a good place now mentally. Today it is a massive pill to swallow, then life goes on. When I was younger I thought my identity was tied up in what I did on the bike - not now. I am upset, but don't lose hope. I will feel sorry for a bit, it's not the ending I hoped for, it'll hurt."</p>

            <p>He said, though, he could be his own worst enemy, constantly striving for perfection.</p>
        
            <p>"I should be easier on myself - I've done a lot of things I never imagined when I was 12 years old."</p>
        
            <p>Gaze said he was proud to represent his country and knew he had the support of his family, who were proud of his achievements.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got to be happy - I am very fortunate to live the life I do, and be grateful representing your country at the world's biggest sporting event."</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Pidcock's race, he described him as "class" and born for mountain biking.</p>
        
            <p>"He's 55kg, explosive, especially good in the heat - he's class, kudos to him."</p>
        
            <p>He hopes to still be in contention for a place at the Los Angeles games in 2028, and has an ambition to be an Olympic champion - perhaps next time.</p>
