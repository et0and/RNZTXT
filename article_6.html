        <h2>Bledisloe Cup: What we need to see out of the All Blacks</h2>
        <p>
Coming off two tight losses in South Africa, Scott Robertson's side needs to put the Wallabies to the sword, writes Jamie Wall.

            <p>Analysis - We're seven tests into Scott Robertson's first year in charge of the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>The current record doesn't look that fantastic, with four wins and three losses, however the next two weeks can play a big role in turning that around.</p>
        
            <p>Despite suffering two losses in a row to the Springboks, the All Blacks head into the Bledisloe Cup series as overwhelming favourites. That does say just as much about their opposition as it does about them, however - the Wallabies have somehow plumbed a new depth after their shocking 2023 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>But really, this is an opportunity for Robertson to re-energise the All Blacks after their bruising experiences in Johannesburg and Cape Town. In the second test they were met with a ferocious and committed defensive effort that frustrated them into the first tryless All Black performance in six years, so the question now is how many adjustments on attack do they make?</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure - that the first choice back three includes Caleb Clarke, who was in great form at Ellis Park before being sidelined in the second test. Will Jordan's effort at fullback in Cape Town raised more questions than answers, so it's likely he heads back to the right wing and Beauden Barrett returns to the 15 jersey. These are the strike weapons that feel most calibrated to have an effect against a Wallaby defence that's coming off being shredded for 67 points against the Pumas.</p>

            <p>While Joe Schmidt would've obviously been working hard on that facet of the game since, it's equally hard to see the Wallabies putting in anywhere near the type of restrictions the Springboks did to the All Blacks. If they have any chance at all, it's going to be through scoring plenty of points of their own.</p>
        
            <p>One of the big success stories this season has been the emergence of Tupou Vaa'i as a genuine defensive force on his own, but it hasn't so much been through big hits. The Chiefs lock's ability to prowl around the tackle and effect turnovers was exactly what the All Blacks needed against the Springboks, most notably in the first test when perfectly timed bit of work off a kick-off immediately reversed a penalty goal deficit.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Tuipulotu is back in the mix after an injury layoff, so all of a sudden the depth at lock is looking a lot healthier. However, one thing that has escaped a bit of attention is the form of Scott Barrett, who hasn't exactly been his imposing self in the last couple of weeks. After being bumped off by Cheslin Kolbe in the first test, he bombed one of the very few chances the All Blacks got in the second with an uncharacteristic handling error. It was a jarring sight, given how consistent the new skipper's test career has been so far (obviously aside from his two red cards).</p>

            <p>Elsewhere, it would be good to see Wallace Sititi given another shot, as his carrying ability can kickstart the sort of momentum needed for the All Blacks to accelerate the pace of the game. It's a bit of a stretch to see him starting at number eight, therefore moving Ardie Savea back to openside, but then again it was a stretch to see him starting in Cape Town and he ended up being probably the All Blacks' best performer.</p>
        
            <p>Here's one to ponder, though: Harry Plummer has been in the camp now for the last four tests, with the conventional wisdom being that he'd get a run in these two tests. It would be a bit of a shame to see him used off the bench as a utility, because right now is a great chance to chuck him the 10 jersey and simply see what happens when this All Black side has a steady game manager calling the shots.</p>
