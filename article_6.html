            <p>Australian Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo is ignoring the criticism of his performances so far this season.</p>
        
            <p>Ricciardo has not picked up any points for RB in the three races to date, finishing 12th in the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>That has raised the suggestion again that New Zealander Liam Lawson could be in a line for a return to F1 in a permanant role. He is currently the Red Bull reserve driver.</p>
        
            <p>The other RB driver Yuki Tsunoda was seventh in Melbourne and has generally out driven Ricciardo in 2024.</p>

            <p>Lawson raced five times for the then named Alpha Tauri team in 2023 while Ricciardo was recovering from a broken hand suffered in a crash.</p>
        
            <p>The 34-year-old Australian feels a turnaround was not far away.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're just going to keep our eyes on the prize," Ricciado told F1.</p>
        
            <p>"It hasn't been the best three races this season and it's definitely not where I expected to be, but it's certainly not something that we're going to get rattled by, we just have to stay on course and we'll find it."</p>
        
            <p>It has been reported that Red Bull's head of driver development Dr Helmut Marko is putting pressure on Ricciardo to pertform with the suggestion that he could be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't say there is any panic," Ricciardo said after the Australian GP.</p>
        
            <p>Ricciardo returned to Red Bull's second team last year, replacing Nyck de Vries, who had made a poor start to that season.</p>
        
            <p>After the Australian Grand Prix Red Bull boss Christian Horner backed his former driver to get back on track.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a big boy, he'll pick himself up."</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's still very early in the year to even be thinking about next year."</p>
        
            <p>The next round is in Japan on 7 April.</p>
