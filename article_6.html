            <p>The returning Warrior says he's "proud of himself" for taking a year away from the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>It was tempting to think that two of the Warriors' prodigal sons returned to the spotlight this week, but that wouldn't really be an accurate assessment.</p>
        
            <p>While Roger Tuivasa-Sheck's switch back from a frustrating stint in union has been the main story, another player who went away to prove something has come back as well. Chanel Harris-Tavita didn't go and play anywhere, league or otherwise, rather taking a year off to reinvigorate his love for the game and career in the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't have known what that was like if I hadn't taken that step away from the game," he said at Mt Smart Stadium on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"To come back to it, it's made me appreciate what I have here and the opportunity I have as a rugby league player."</p>
        
            <p>Like Tuivasa-Sheck, the scene that Harris-Tavita has returned to is pretty different to the one he left. His 2022 season wasn't bad on a personal playing level, but he was part of some shocking Warriors performances and suffered a couple of injuries that would make anyone reconsider playing a contact sport anyway.</p>
        
            <p>He ruptured a testicle in the Anzac Day match against the Storm; to make matters worse it ended up being the heaviest defeat the team had ever suffered. Then, in Toa Samoa's appearance in the World Cup final against the Kangaroos, he was concussed and had to leave the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't have a very clear plan of what I wanted to do. I just wanted to take myself out of the environment and see where I ended up."</p>
        
            <p>From there, Harris-Tavita shifted to Samoa, working on his uncle's farm before embarking on a long trip overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very simple life [in Samoa]. It put life in perspective and made me appreciate what I have. I did a little bit of travelling in America, South America…I nearly didn't come back from Brazil," he joked.</p>
        
            <p>"But then I had to come back, get ready for pre-season, so now I'm here."</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita admitted to "a bit of FOMO" when watching the Warriors' successes this year.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in Samoa watching them play and the wifi was…not great. I was watching them on Facebook Live, it was cutting in and out. But I saw a lot of potential and I think we can go a step further next season."</p>

            <p>Harris-Tavita's immediate status in the team is a bit of a question, though. Coach Andrew Webster now has six halves on his books, with Shaun Johnson and Te Maire Martin the incumbents. Behind them are: Luke Metcalf, who didn't put a foot wrong when he was called upon, Dylan Walker and youngster Ronald Volkman.</p>
        
            <p>It would seem likely that Johnson and Martin will retain their starting spots in 2024, so does Harris-Tavita play the utility role on the bench, taking over from Walker so that the former Origin and Kangaroo rep can be more of a middle forward? If so, that somewhat nullifies the massive advantage Harris-Tavita possesses in his goal kicking, because that's something that he'd need to be on the park for 80 minutes a week to make full use of.</p>
        
            <p>"They've signed me as a half, but wherever Webby wants me to play, that's where I'm playing," he said. It's handy to remember that Harris-Tavita is still only 24, so there is plenty of time to potentially fill the role that Johnson will likely leave before long.</p>
        
            <p>For now though, he's just happy to be back at the Warriors, although he has no regrets about stepping away. It's something Harris-Tavita recommends to any other player going through a challenging period.</p>
        
            <p>"I just urge players to be honest with themselves," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Only you know deep down how you're feeling about the situation you're in. Even if it's going against the grain, just back yourself. Life's about making mistakes and learning from them…now that I'm back I'm happy, refreshed and relaxed…I'm proud of myself for that."</p>
