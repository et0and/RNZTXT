            <p>New Zealand golfer Danny Lee is sitting in 26th after the first round of the the first day of LIV Golf Mayakoba, LIV's season opener in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>Lee shot an even 71 and sits 12 shots behind the leader Chilean Joaquin Niemann who scored a 59 which included ten birdies and an Eagle.</p>
        
            <p>Niemann began his round on the second hole at El Camaleon Golf Course and quickly went on a birdie spree, making five straight at Nos. 3-7.</p>
        
            <p>At the par-4 11th, his second shot took one hop on the green and dunked into the hole for an eagle that brought him to 9 under par.</p>
        
            <p>He added the final three of his 10 birdies at Nos. 13, 15 and 17 to get to 12 under par with two holes to spare.</p>
        
            <p>His par-par finish secured the course record and the second sub-60 round in LIV's three-year history; Bryson DeChambeau shot a final-round 58 to win at Greenbrier last season.</p>
        
            <p>The sparkling performance put Niemann five shots clear of the field. Patrick Reed of 4Aces is second after a bogey-free, 7-under 64. Fireballs GC captain Sergio Garcia of Spain opened with a 6-under 65 to take third place.</p>
        
            <p>World No. 3 Jon Rahm of Spain made his LIV debut after switching allegiances from the PGA Tour in December.</p>
        
            <p>The captain of the all-new Legion XIII opened with five birdies in seven holes and was 7 under through 15, but a bogey-bogey finish set him back to a tie for fourth at 5-under 66 with Englishmen Laurie Canter and Richard Bland.</p>
        
            <p>Torque leads the group competition by five shots, as well, thanks to Niemann's 12-under round plus the scores of Colombia's Sebastian Munoz (3-under 68) and Chile's Mito Pereira (2-over 73).</p>
