            <p>Another week and the phrase 'must win game' is ringing true for Warriors fans - and it could not come at a more difficult time. After a devastating wet weather 14 - 8 loss against the Knights in Newcastle, making it three consecutive defeats and taking them down to 14th on the NRL ladder, Andrew Webster was not making any excuses for his team in what was another brutal and respectfully tight contest.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors remained over in Sydney this week on the back of a near month-long trip which shapes up to be the toughest stretch of their schedule this year that continues today against a dangerous Sydney Roosters outfit. They're most in form attacking team right now, having piled on 100 points the last two weekends. After that, The Warriors find themselves facing defending champions The Penrith Panthers at Magic Round in Brisbane for the second year in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Kolkstad 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Rocco Berry 17. Adam Pompey 22. Ed Kosi 6. Te Maire Martin 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Bunty Afoa 11. Jackson Ford 12. Mitchell Barnett 13. Tohu Harris</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Dylan Walker 15. Tom Ale 16. Jazz Tevaga 17. Freddy Lussick</p>
        
            <p>Roosters: 1. James Tedesco 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Joseph Suaalii 4. Joseph Manu 5. Dominic Young 6. Luke Keary 7. Sam Walker 8. Jared Weren-Hargraves 9. Brandon Smith 10. Lindsay Collins 11. Angus Crichton 12. Nat Butcher 13. Victor Radley</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Connor Watson 15. Naufahu Whyte 16. Spencer Leniu 17. Terrell May</p>

            <p>In a season that is starting to seriously feel the flow-on effects of the injury toll, the Warriors welcome back the much-needed experience and no-nonsense attitude of veteran middle Jazz Tevaga. Kurt Capewell is out again this time with a calf injury, so Mitch Barnett shifts back to the second row with Bunty Afoa taking the starting prop role. Also finally returning from a lengthy suspension is back-up hooker Freddy Lussick, but the massive news is that Roger Tuivasa-Sheck is out for the next four weeks, replaced by Adam Pompey at centre. Ed Kosi comes in for Marcelo Montoya on the wing.</p>

            <p>The Roosters welcome the return of four of their star players in Kiwis hooker Brandon Smith, veteran winger Daniel Tupou, enforcer Victor Radley and Spencer Leniu who has missed the majority of the season after his eight game suspension for racial abuse. The wholesale changes to The Roosters line-up is an interesting prospect and potentially a minor headache for the coach Trent Robinson, as they have been absolutely firing lately and he will not want to disturb their chemistry - potentially seeing Smith, Radley and Leniu returning to the bench instead of straight into the starting line-up although all apart from Leniu have been named in the starting side.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 12 - 20 Roosters</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 0 - 14 Roosters</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have traditionally struggled in the modern era against powerhouse club Sydney Roosters, who are known for its ability to grind out tight contests. Last year's results show that in two relatively low scoring affairs including the second time the clubs met last season with the Roosters shutting out the Warriors 14 - 0 was the only time they were held to nil for the entire season.</p>
        
            <p>Nothing short of a pre-winter miracle will be required for the Warriors to chalk up a much-needed victory, but as tough as the prospect might be, it would go such a long way to get them back on track. If not, there will be some serious questions being asked at Mt Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Don't expect the Warriors to go down without putting up a good fight, hopefully they can rediscover some of their rich away form they held last year. As always, both teams will need to focus on the basics of possession, solid first up contact and minimising handling errors and penalties.</p>
