            <p>Central Hinds and the Canterbury Kings won contrasting sudden death matches to book berths in the women's and men's Super Smash finals.</p>
        
            <p>Claudia Green took a hat-trick as her Central side beat the Northern Brave by 45 runs in Hamilton on Friday to book a place in the women's decider against the Wellington Blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the men's elimination final came down to the final ball, with Canterbury scoring 23 off the final over to beat Wellington Firebirds and set up a decider against Auckland Aces.</p>
        
            <p>Both finals will be played at Eden Park on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The Hinds never looked threatened after posting an impressive 151-5 at Seddon Park, built on a blazing knock of 78 off 50 balls from opener Hollie Armitage, who cracked 10 boundaries</p>
        
            <p>Caitlin Gurrey scored 52 off 43 for Northern but nobody could stay with her as the Brave capitulated for 106 in the 17th over.</p>
        
            <p>Green's hat-trick came in the fourth over, removing three top-order batters in successive deliveries to finish with figures of 4-24 off four overs.</p>
        
            <p>Dramatic men's elimination final</p>
        
            <p>It was a far closer affair in the men's clash, where Canterbury reached 177-6 off the final ball in response to Wellington's 173-7.</p>
        
            <p>Returning allrounder Michael Bracewell delivered a reminder of his power with an unbeaten 54 off just 24 balls after the Firebirds made a scratchy start.</p>

            <p>The Magicians were behind the required run rate for much of the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Despite bright knocks from Chad Bowes (46 off 33) and captain Cole McConchie (53 off 38), they still needed 23 runs to win going into the final over bowled by Dutch international Logan van Beek.</p>
        
            <p>Requiring two runs to tie off the final ball, Zak Foulkes struck a full toss for six, capping an influential game in which he earlier took 3-31 with the ball.</p>
