            <p>History beckons for Joseph Parker.</p>
        
            <p>Almost a decade since he was dethroned, Parker will again fight for a world title.</p>
        
            <p>Parker is set for the biggest bout of his boxing career when he meets Brit Daniel Dubois for the IBF Heavyweight title in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the biggest fight in my career. It's the opportunity to fight for the championship of the world again, but also because of the opponent that I have and the way that he's performed. That's why I say this is the toughest fight," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media ahead of the historic showdown, the Samoan-Kiwi said he has plenty of respect for his opponent, Daniel Dubois.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like Dubois has got this sense of unstableness with him because of the fights he's put on."</p>
        
            <p>However, that was earlier in the week, and while both are usually men of few words who don't get sucked into trash talk, tensions were simmering after the pair were asked for their fight predictions.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to be too smart, too fast. Movement's going to be on point. I'm going to be deliberate, precise. I'm going to bash you."</p>
        
            <p>"Enough acting mate," Dubois said.</p>
        
            <p>"Who's acting?" replied Parker.</p>
        
            <p>With 44 career knockouts between them, both men possess plenty of fight-ending power.</p>
        
            <p>Parker is riding a five fight winning streak after suffering just his third career loss, to Joe Joyce, back in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Dubois won the IBF heavyweight title after an upset knockout win over Anthony Joshua at Wembley back in September.</p>
        
            <p>But Parker is primed to steal the strap, feeling it's been a perfect camp, and the team have left no stone unturned in preparing for Dubois.</p>
        
            <p>"I've everything there is and you can't do anything more to prepare mentally. I'm ready to go in there. Leave it all out there and the result will take care of itself," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In the midst of his stunning resurgence, Parker still has plenty in the tank, but isn't looking past Sunday:</p>
        
            <p>"I know there are big fights out there, and I know there are other names and other bouts, but none of that matters unless we get this right, and I am going to get this right."</p>
        
            <p>However, Dubois has other ideas:</p>
        
            <p>"I'm leaving with my belt. That's my whole objective. My mindset. Putting a clinical performance, devastating performance, on Saturday."</p>
        
            <p>The fight is set to get underway at about 10am NZT on Sunday morning.</p>
