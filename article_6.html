            <p>New Zealand have beaten France at the U20 world rugby championship in thrilling, confusing circumstances, with the TMO called upon to confirm that Rico Simpson's last minute penalty attempt was indeed a goal.</p>
        
            <p>The Baby Blacks won the match 27-26 at Stellenbosch in South Africa, leaving them unbeaten at the top of their pool after two matches.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson, the New Zealand first five, calmly slotted his penalty in the 80th minute with his side trailing by two points. It was close to the right-hand upright and the uncertain assistant referees kept their flags down though Simpson raised an arm, clearly thinking he had nailed it.</p>
        
            <p>The referee agreed with him, saying to the TMO: "For me the kick was over. Can we confirm that please.''</p>
        
            <p>The reply confirmed that the kick was successful and fulltime was called to the delight of the New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>It was a Kiwi side's first victory over France at the U20 Championship since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>France started the stronger, and led 11-0 at halftime, with the New Zealanders managing to survive 10 minutes without loose forward Andrew Smith after he was sin-binned.</p>
        
            <p>The Baby Blacks upped their attacking effort in the second half and took the lead for a second time when hooker Manumaua Letiu charged over with 12 minutes to go.</p>
        
            <p>France looked to have won the match when Mathis Fert√© scored a try with six minutes left and the Baby Blacks suffered further with a yellow card for replacement prop Joshua Smith with just three minutes left on the clock.</p>
        
            <p>But it was France who were pinged for indiscipline in the last minute and Simpson stepped up to slot with eventually-rewarded goal.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are strongly placed to make the semi-finals as they lead Pool A with 10 points, ahead of Wales with seven points and France six. Wales beat Spain 21-10 today. New Zealand play pool minnows Spain on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In Pool C, Argentina surprisingly walloped hosts South Africa 31-12 and are now level on points with them, five points behind leaders England, who beat Fiji 48-11.</p>
        
            <p>In Pool B, Italy held on to beat Australia 17-12, while Ireland beat Georgia 22-16. Ireland lead that pool, four points ahead of Australia with Italy two points further back.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers: New Zealand 27 (Aki Tuivailala, Stanley Solomon, Dylan Pledger, Manumaua Letiu tries, Rico Simpson 2 cons, pen), France 26 (Joe Quere Karaba, Xan Mousques, Mathis Ferte tries, Hugo Reus con, 3 pen).</p>
