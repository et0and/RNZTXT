            <p>A Luke Reimer double at the death sealed a dramatic 36-32 win for the Brumbies over the Fijian Drua in Suva. In another wild game in the opening weekend of Super Rugby Pacific 2025, the lead changed hands multiple times as both sides sought to attack throughout the whole game.</p>
        
            <p>Two yellow cards in the first half proved costly for the home side, after both Isikeli Rabitu and Vuate Karawalevu were binned the Brumbies answered within a minute of each with tries to Ryan Lonergan and former All Blacks Sevens rep Ollie Sapsford.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Drua closed out the half with 13 unanswered points through a try to Ponepati Loganimasi and the reliable boot of Caleb Muntz.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides traded the lead through tries to Rhys van Nek and Karawalevu, who pounced on a loose pass from the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>However, despite the hot and humid conditions and thanks to some Drua indiscipline, the Brumbies forwards took control of the last 10 minutes. Reimer bashed his way over in the 70th and 75th minutes to pull off the win, which continues a bright opening weekend for the Australian sides.</p>
