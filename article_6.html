            <p>Former Formula One driver Ralf Schumacher has delivered a stinging assessment of demoted New Zealander Liam Lawson, saying he should have been dropped completely from the F1 grid.</p>
        
            <p>Schumacher, the younger brother of German F1 great Michael, told a German website Lawson will never become a top driver following the young Kiwi's downgrading by Red Bull to their sister team Racing Bulls.</p>

            <p>Lawson paid a heavy price for his lowly qualifying performances for Red Bull at the two opening Grands Prix of the season, in Melbourne and Shanghai.</p>
        
            <p>"He (Lawson) is replaced like a wet rag after two races. That's tough," Schumacher told Formel1.de.</p>
        
            <p>"I know I'll be hated for this by one or two spectators but I wouldn't have put Liam Lawson in a Formula One car at all.</p>
        
            <p>"Because one thing is also clear; Lawson will probably never become a top driver, and in a situation like this, you might as well go for the next one in line and try your luck."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson, 23, has received widespread support across the motor racing community since being replaced at Red Bull by Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ahead of this week's Japan Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was little empathy from 49-year-old Schumacher, a six-time Grand Prix winner across a decade-long Formua One career in which he drove for multiple teams.</p>
        
            <p>Schumacher's best overall finishes were fourth place when driving for Williams in 2001 and 2002.</p>
