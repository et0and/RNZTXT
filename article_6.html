            <p>George Beamish has picked up a surprise gold medal in the men's 1500 metres final at the World Indoor Athletics Championships in Glasgow to top off a golden final day for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day Hamish Kerr soared to gold in the men's high jump after setting a national record of 2.36 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Beamish, who has recently set national records over 3000m and 5000m, wasn't expected to contend for the medals in Glasgow.</p>
        
            <p>However, he bided his time and went into the final lap in seventh place, before surging home in the final straight to take the title in a personal best of 3:36.54.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old US based Kiwi has enjoyed a fantastic indoor campaign to start 2024, which included breaking the long-standing New Zealand national 5000m record in Boston in January.</p>
        
            <p>That result ensured a second Olympic entry standard mark for the 2024 Paris Olympics after the Havelock North-raised athlete achieved the feat in the steeplechase during a stellar 2023.</p>
        
            <p>American's Cole Hocker and Hobbs Kessler finished second and third respectively.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand finished the event with two gold medals and two silver medals, the best ever medal haul at the championship.</p>
        
            <p>Pole-vaulter Eliza McCartney and shot-putter Tom Walsh won silver medals earlier in the championship.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand debutant Maia Ramsden finished 10th in the women's 1500m final.</p>
