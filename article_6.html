            <p>The stadium which will host the opening match of the T20 World Cup in Dallas this weekend has been hit by severe weather, causing the cancellation of Tuesday's official warm-up match.</p>
        
            <p>The United States and Bangladesh were due to meet at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas but the match has been called off because of the "conditions of the facilities".</p>
        
            <p>Warnings for strong thunderstorms, flash flooding and tornados have been given for the area.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from the International Cricket Council said fencing and scaffolding at the venue had been affected but "nothing that materially impacts the staging" of the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Severe weather killed at least 23 people over the weekend in the US, injuring hundreds of others and leaving a path of destruction.</p>
        
            <p>Texas governor Greg Abbott said more than a third of counties were subject to a disaster declaration after extreme weather ploughed through the state.</p>
        
            <p>There was further heavy rain overnight and winds up to 129km/h (80m/ph) while storm sirens sounded in the city of Dallas.</p>
