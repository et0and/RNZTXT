            <p>Just months ahead of unveiling a brand-new East Stand, the more than two decades-long naming rights deal at Yarrow Stadium in New Plymouth is coming to an end.</p>
        
            <p>Manaia-based Yarrows the Bakers, which has held naming rights since 2002, has announced it will not be renewing the deal.</p>
        
            <p>From 8 March the venue will be known as Stadium Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>Yarrows executive director Philip Yarrow said it had been a difficult decision to end the arrangement.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a rewarding 20-year partnership with the NPDC [New Plymouth District Council], with many great memories along the way.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that Noel and Melva Yarrow would be particularly happy to know their great-grandchildren were able to be involved with events at the stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"From a commercial lens, the naming rights provided credibility to our brand and helped strengthen relationships both domestically and across the Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>"It was certainly a difficult decision to end the partnership, and we wish the New Plymouth District Council team all the best in the next chapter."</p>
        
            <p>Noel and Melva Yarrow also held naming rights to the stadium's West Stand from 2004 to 2022.</p>

            <p>The NPDC operated the stadium, which was owned by the Taranaki Regional Council. It is currently undergoing an $80 million earthquake strengthening and upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>NPDC manager venues and events Chade Julie said while sad it was the end of an era and an important working relationship, it opened the doors for an exciting future.</p>
        
            <p>"We've really enjoyed and appreciated working alongside the Yarrow team, so are obviously disappointed to see that come to an end, but this change comes as an exciting new chapter begins with the completion of the redevelopment project and the opening of the new East Stand this year."</p>
        
            <p>Julie said future naming rights opportunities for the stadium, including the stands and suites, would be available shortly.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth Mayor Neil Holdom paid tribute to the Yarrow family and its long-standing contribution to the stadium and other community facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"Their support has been unwavering for over 20 years. This is an unprecedented partnership with the city of Ngāmotu-New Plymouth and Taranaki."</p>
        
            <p>Holdom said private sector investment was increasingly vital to sustain the scope and quality of community assets.</p>
        
            <p>"The depth and quality of our public/private sector partnerships, modelled by the Yarrow-NPDC relationship, is what makes this possible."</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki Regional Council director of corporate services Mike Nield said as owner of the venue via the Taranaki Stadium Trust, the council was leading the stadium upgrade project with the aim of creating the "best regional stadium in New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>"The Yarrow family have championed the stadium for more than two decades and we would like to say a huge thank you for their support, particularly over the last five years during the redevelopment work."</p>
        
            <p>More than just a rugby ground, the venue is Taranaki's premier outdoor sporting arena, which has hosted a range of major events including Rugby World Cup games, All Blacks fixtures, FIFA U20 World Cup matches and Nitro Circus.</p>
        
            <p>The stadium was also the proud home ground for the Taranaki Bulls provincial rugby side.</p>
