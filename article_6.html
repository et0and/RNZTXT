            <p>New Zealand Rugby is investigating the Hurricanes women's team haka that criticised the coalition government, but is leaving the Super Rugby franchise to deal with the matter at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes Poua began their Super Rugby Aupiki season last Saturday with a defeat to the Chiefs Manawa and before the match they used an altered haka with the kaitātaki (leader) called out "karetao o te Kāwana kakiwhero" or "puppets of this redneck government".</p>

            <p>The haka also referred to Toitu te Tiriti, a political movement that has taken a stand against coalition government policies on te reo Māori and perceived breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and encouraged people to "never fold and never bend".</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Hurricanes Poua prop and haka leader Leilani Perese said she presented the new haka to the team's management "strategically".</p>
        
            <p>"I sent it to management at the last minute. They were like 'go for it. We back you 100 per cent,'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Hurricanes chief executive, Avan Lee, said he wasn't aware of the team's plans to use the haka.</p>
        
            <p>He said the franchise will apologise to the government.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly disappointed. There was no discussion, no consultation and some of the words that were used, were interpreted to be very strong.</p>
        
            <p>"The Hurricanes shouldn't be making any politcal statement. If they do it needs to be agreed across the organisation because we have got players and staff who are not comfortable with what is being said."</p>
        
            <p>"There are obviously players and staff who agree with it but that is missing the point...we were blindsided," Lee said.</p>

            <p>New Zealand Rugby is looking into the incident and said it's working with the Hurricanes and the players involved to understand more about the actions taken over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>However, it's understood NZR believes it's still a matter for the Hurricanes at this point.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand Rugby respects the right of our professional players to express their personal views on a range of issues.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we also expect our players to do so in a respectful and inclusive way, especially when they are in their professional environments," the governing body said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the Hurricanes will meet with the Poua team tomorrow, with New Zealand Rugby keeping abreast of what happens.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Rugby Players Association (NZRPA) are also set to meet with the players to find out the reasons behind the use of the haka.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands NZRPA are also concerned they weren't consulted and want to understand the reasons behind the decision to use the haka.</p>
        
            <p>It's believed NZRPA will seek to support and educate the Poua players about the implications of their actions.</p>
        
            <p>When questioned about how it feels about the haka and its message to the government, 2 Degrees, one of the Hurricanes major sponsors, told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are proud to sponsor all of the Super Rugby Aupiki teams - Blues Women, Matatū, Hurricanes Poua and Chiefs Manawa.</p>
        
            <p>"This is our third year and it is a really important sponsorship to us, we think it's fair and important to support women's sport and we want to do our bit.</p>
        
            <p>"We see our role as promoting visibility and reach of the games and helping grow participation in the game amongst young New Zealanders."</p>
