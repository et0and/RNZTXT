            <p>New Tall Blacks coach Judd Flavell wants an "assertive attacking style" from his roster but is wary of overwhelming them with too much change during a disrupted build-up to the latest FIBA Asia Cup qualifiers.</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks are unbeaten so far in the qualifying with wins against Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong under former coach Pero Cameron in February.</p>
        
            <p>If Flavell can guide the team to two more wins against the Philippines on Friday morning and Chinese Taipei on Monday in Christchurch, New Zealand can secure a place in next year's Asia Cup with two games to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Flavell selected a young roster that will be captained by veteran Corey Webster for the games but they have already faced a few hurdles.</p>
        
            <p>Missed flights and other travel complications getting players from New Zealand and Australia to Manila has limited the time Flavell has had with the players and delayed him making his mark on the team he played for 38 times between 1999 and 2002.</p>

            <p>"Trying to do everything completely new is challenging with only a couple of days of preparation," Flavell said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we are getting through this game where we're making a start on a style of play with a lot of ball movement, pressure attacking the paint and have great spacing that can stretch the defence.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to go into this game simplifying things as much as we can, that's the challenge for us is how much can we throw at our own team without it over complicating and being a detriment."</p>
        
            <p>Flavell also wanted to make the most of his roster's mobility.</p>
        
            <p>"The Philippines have a big line up that they can put out there and they're very structured in the half court so this works in our favour if we can get out and run.</p>
        
            <p>"But beyond running the floor we still want to be able to execute. The execution is really just keeping the actions simple so guys fully understand what they're suppose to be doing out there and how they play off each other."</p>
        
            <p>Webster is closing in on 100 appearances for the Tall Blacks and has played significantly more international basketball than his teammates.</p>
        
            <p>The next most capped player is Canterbury guard Taylor Britt who has played 27 times. Two players, teenager Oscar Goodman and Kaia Isaac, could make their debut in the Manila.</p>
        
            <p>Flavell felt he had made the right choice in handing Webster the captaincy for the first time.</p>

            <p>"Corey is one of those guys, the bigger the stage and the bigger the moment, the better he is.</p>
        
            <p>"He has been doing what Corey does and overall, the group has been great, they have bonded together - this is a strength of Tall Blacks squads anyway, but I am really looking forward to what this team can do on the floor."</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks have never lost to the Philippines but a sold-out Mall of Asia Arena would be a tough environment for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>"In talking to the guys individually they are excited and have embraced the chance to play a game like this in a country that is mad about their basketball and loves their hoops.</p>
        
            <p>"For us this is a way to enjoy this stage and fully embrace the challenge that is ahead of us and understand you don't get these moments every day."</p>
        
            <p>The Philippines are also unbeaten in the qualifiers and will put an established roster on the floor against the Tall Blacks including Justin Brownlee who became naturalised last year and starred during the first window of the qualifiers recording 21 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists.</p>
