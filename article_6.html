            <p>Matat큰 have continued their good start to Super Rugby Aupiki, beating the Hurricanes Poua 29-7 in Christchurch on Sunday. The win was built on a very strong first half, in which the home side scored four tries.</p>
        
            <p>Grace Brooker opened the scoring, before Kaea Nepia crossed for a double. Wing Winnie Palamo added another try to secure a commanding 24-0 lead.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes Poua hit back through a converted try to Ayesha Leti-I'iga just before the break.</p>
        
            <p>The second half was a far more contested affair. Both sides struggled to break through each other's defences, with the only scoring coming from a sweeping Matat큰 move finished off by Lucy Jenkins.</p>
        
            <p>Matat큰 face the Blues next weekend in Christchurch, while the Hurricanes Poua meet Chiefs Manawa in Hamilton.</p>
