            <p>Black Caps Test captain Tim Southee is unlikely to play all three Tests against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka next month, with coach Gary Stead keen to manage workloads in tough conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps will play a one-off match against Afghanistan in India in Noida from 9 September before travelling to Sri Lanka to take on the hosts in two World Test Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Southee took only six wickets in four home Tests last season and New Zealand have also included pace bowlers Matt Henry, Ben Spears and Will O'Rouke in the squad.</p>
        
            <p>"Test tours to the subcontinent can ask some really tough questions of pace bowlers due to the nature of the pitches and the heat and humidity," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"While we're going over with an open mind around conditions, there is an understanding that all our bowling options may be needed across the different tests.</p>
        
            <p>"Tim and I have discussed this, and the need during these overseas tours to balance the workloads of the pace bowlers, including himself, to ensure the team is best served."</p>
        
            <p>Former captain Kane Williamson has also been included in the party allrounder Michael Bracewell, who returns to the squad for the first time in more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are currently third in the World Test Championship standings and are due to travel to India again in October for a three-test series.</p>
        
            <p>They will then host England in November and December in an another three-test series.</p>
        
            <p>Squad: Tim Southee (capt), Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Devon Conway, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Kane Williamson, Will Young.</p>
