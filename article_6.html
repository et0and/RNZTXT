        <h2>What we learnt from the All Blacks' two losses</h2>
        <p>
Two tests, two losses but what else came of the trip to South Africa, asks Jamie Wall. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>It won't go down as a tour to remember in terms of success for the All Blacks, but there's more to be taken out of the trip to South Africa than just results. Scott Robertson's side went to take on the best side in the world right now on their own patch, so what went right and wrong?</p>
        
            <p>That's probably the most disappointing part of the trip, because in both tests, the All Blacks had put themselves in strong positions in the second halves. At Ellis Park they had a handy lead, while at DHL Stadium they were within a penalty goal when the games moved into their critical stages. The lack of killer instinct is something that needs to be reinstituted quickly.</p>

            <p>If it's any consolation, Ireland went down to South Africa and lost a test too, in remarkably similar circumstances. Andy Farrell's side also won one, but right now you'd have to say them and the All Blacks are the only sides capable of heading there and not getting absolutely demolished.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Taylor is playing arguably the best footy of his career right now, and that's exactly what the fulcrum the forward pack needs right now. Similarly, Vaa'i has had his role defined into a menace at the breakdown as well as a set piece stalwart. It's no coincidence that both were involved in a number of key turnovers.</p>

            <p>If you're judging DMac on the first test, he's a keeper for the rest of the season. If you're going off the second, there's some serious doubts. That's the way it feels like it'll be for the foreseeable future, however there is a steady option waiting in the wings. Harry Plummer was a significant part of the Blues' Super Rugby win due to his ordered and methodical play, somewhat of a magnetic opposite to what McKenzie stands for.</p>
        
            <p>Eyebrows were raised when Wallace Sititi was selected at blindside for the Cape Town test, but not among those who had followed the 22-year-old through Super Rugby Pacific. His strong ball carrying was exactly what the All Blacks needed and the second generation test player has firmly put a case forward to be in the top selection going forward - although the man he replaced, Ethan Blackadder, was immense in the test he played too.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks would never admit it themselves and it will be too much for some hardcore fans to do so as well, but there are clear signs that Robertson has the All Blacks in rebuild mode. It's more an incremental change rather than a blow-it-up-and-start-again job, as evidenced by the ushering in of new players like Sititi and Cortez Ratima through necessity rather than pinning a whole bunch of hopes on them with fresh starts. It certainly feels like a fairer way of bringing guys into test rugby than rolling out a whole new side and expecting everything to work.</p>

            <p>Cape Town was the first time in almost six years the All Blacks haven't scored a try in a test match, an unfortunate fact due to this seasons' struggles to make linebreaks and rack up scorelines. There's only one test this year where the All Blacks have ripped a team apart (the San Diego win doesn't count because the Fijians didn't look at all interested), and they can't afford to wait till the end of year tour to do it again.</p>
        
            <p>Rassie Erasmus's side didn't become back to back world champions by accident, and it's clear they have gotten even better thanks to the addition of Tony Brown to the coaching staff. Erasmus has effectively built two teams that can take the park and be favourites against any team in the world, so as hard as it is for All Black fans to admit it, getting within four and six points to the Boks on consecutive weekends would be seen as a net positive by any other team in the world.</p>
