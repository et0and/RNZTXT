        <h2>All Blacks end of year tour: another twist in the Hoskins Sotutu tale</h2>
        <p>
Scott Robertson says that the Blues loose forward would have been picked for the upcoming Japan test, however the now-England and Fiji eligible Hoskins Sotutu will miss it with injury.
</p>
        
            <p>What a difference a couple of injuries can make. The All Blacks' rich depth at loose forward is about to be tested over the next few weeks, with news that Ethan Blackadder (calf), Luke Jacobson (fractured thumb) and Dalton Papali'i (upper hamstring) will not be heading to Tokyo for the first end of year tour game against Japan.</p>
        
            <p>The fact that they have been ruled out would've meant that Hoskins Sotutu, controversially overlooked for the All Black season so far, was going to come back into the test reckoning according to coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"We were going to bring Hoskins in, but he's injured," said Robertson as he faced media as the squad prepared to fly out from Auckland.</p>

            <p>"We've been considering it over the last couple of days, but with his knee, after scans, he wont come. So we're going to make a call on the next loose forward to come up over the next week or two."</p>
        
            <p>That is despite Sotutu apparently playing through the knee injury for around four weeks for Counties-Manukau in the NPC.</p>
        
            <p>"He's looking at his options around whether he rests it or has surgery. He might need surgery," said Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>It's the latest twist in the tale of the blockbusting number eight's year, after an MVP shift for the Blues in their Super Rugby Pacific championship win, many presumed he would've been one of the first players Robertson originally picked. Instead, his season is finished and future unclear. Sotutu hasn't played test rugby since 2022 and so therefore is eligible to switch allegiance to either Fiji or England, options that would've evaporated had he taken the field against Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said he hadn't talked to Sotutu about just what colour jersey he might be wearing next season, simply saying: "I just know he's contracted with New Zealand until 2026 and if he was fit he would have come away."</p>

            <p>The injuries have meant that Peter Lakai joins the squad, which is no surprise to anyone even remotely familiar to the 21-year-old's ability. Lakai has been outstanding for the Hurricanes and Wellington this season, he joins fellow rookies Samipeni Finau and Wallace Sititi, and veterans Sam Cane and Ardie Savea. Robertson's ongoing selection of Cane, despite the former captain leaving at the end of the season, feels more like a masterstroke rather than a sentimental selection. Right now that group needs as much experience as it can get as it heads into s seriously difficult five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>But just what is the biggest challenge facing the All Blacks as they prepare to play England, Ireland and France on consecutive weekends? Unsurprisingly, Robertson declined to name an actual opponent, saying that it was "playing good footy and getting the energy right".</p>
        
            <p>"We've done a lot of work to get our structures right, it's getting exciting to start finishing the opportunities we're creating. There's lots of competitions in every position, some players and combinations fit what's in front of you."</p>
        
            <p>That fit will likely be an overhauled side to face Eddie Jones' Japan on Saturday week. Lakai may well find himself starting in his test debut on a weekend where he'd have been aiming to contest an NPC final with Wellington. Robertson also confirmed that a group of players will be sent straight on to London to get ready for a massive test at Twickenham, against an English side the All Blacks have already met twice this season.</p>
        
            <p>However, the most talked-about clash is happening in Dublin a week later. Robertson said he'd had a word with Rieko Ioane about the All Black centre's social media spat with retired Irish first five Johnny Sexton.</p>
        
            <p>"When people write books and bring up those moments, it's going to bring up chat and talk, and that's part of the game, but there's still a bit of respect we need to show."</p>
