            <p>With a place in the Finals Series on the line, the Mystics were pushed all the way before nailing a hard-fought 63-55 win over the Stars in Auckland on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, the Mystics nudged Magic out of third spot, the defending champions now getting the opportunity to play in next weekend's Elimination Final.</p>
        
            <p>In a shaky position after the first quarter, the Stars, with nothing to lose, came back in fine style to turn the next three-quarters into a riveting closely-fought contest.</p>
        
            <p>Needing all the powerful resources in their talented line-up helped the Mystics hold the edge against a gallant Stars team, who provided plenty in an exciting spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>With the teams' level-pegging through the early exchanges, the Mystics suddenly burst into life with a withering closing few minutes to the first stanza.</p>
        
            <p>Struggling to score off their own centre pass and with the pressure mounting, the Stars fell into a big hole as the Mystics went on a nine-goal unanswered scoring streak while punishing their opponents' lapses.</p>
        
            <p>With the Mystics breezing into the first break with a healthy 17-9 lead the signs looked ominous for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>The injection of Amorangi Malesala at goal attack for Monica Falkner and Khanye-Lii Munro-Nonoa taking over at wing defence, coincided with a fresh resolve from the Stars who stormed out of the blocks on the resumption.</p>
        
            <p>Handing the Mystics a taste of their own medicine, the Stars were full of fight and smart play when going on a seven-goal scoring run in the opening minutes, showing they were far from done.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics recovered to gain a semblance of control but the Stars refused to take a backward step.</p>
        
            <p>As they have done in recent weeks, Filda Vui was introduced in the second quarter, the Mystics having their lead trimmed to 31-28 at the main break.</p>
        
            <p>Making defensive changes for the third quarter when Phoenix Karaka went to goal defence and Catherine Hall was injected off the bench into goalkeeper, the Mystics held the slightest of edges through another tense 15 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The tightest of tussles continued unabated with the Mystics unable to completely shake the determined home side.</p>
        
            <p>A late turnover gave the Mystics some breathing space when they took a 47-42 lead into the last turn but still not in a position of comfort.</p>
        
            <p>A telling five-goal streak halfway through the last stanza put the Mystics in the box seat when they forged a seven-goal lead, which proved a bridge too far for the brave Stars challenge.</p>
