            <p>He is calling for players to set an example when it comes to respecting referees.</p>
        
            <p>NRL referee Kasey Badger has been subjected to sexist attacks online in the wake of her performance during last weekend's match between the Tigers and Bulldogs.</p>
        
            <p>Badger was trending on X, formerly Twitter, with the majority of the posts containing misogynistic insults.</p>
        
            <p>It has been reported Badger also received more than 50 direct messages to her account.</p>
        
            <p>During the match, she was aggressively confronted by Tigers second rower David Klemmer, who was seen screaming in her face as he stood over her.</p>
        
            <p>Badger will officiate the Warriors against the Roosters this Sunday and Webster said showing respect towards the officials begins on the field.</p>
        
            <p>"Kasey is a very capable referee, the NRL wouldn't have her there if they didn't think so, you've got to show the right level of respect to everyone, referees, touch judges, any official."</p>

            <p>Badger is one of two fulltime female referees in the NRL alongside Belinda Sharpe.</p>
        
            <p>She has refereed three NRLW finals and was the first woman to referee at a men's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>NRL referees boss Graeme Annesley believed that the treatment of Badger was not a gender issue.</p>
        
            <p>"Even when referees do make mistakes, they don't make mistakes because of their gender. Plenty of players have towered over male referees and attempted to exert some influence. It doesn't only happen to female referees."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said it was a good thing for the game seeing both males and females get an opportunity to referee, but respect must be shown to whoever holds the whistle.</p>
        
            <p>"There are emotions. It's not easy at times, and I can understand that. But you've got to address them and ask questions in the right way. Because you're allowed to approach the referee, whether they're male or female and ask questions about what they're seeing and why things are happening. But the players obviously have a duty of care to make sure they communicate in the right way with the referees."</p>
