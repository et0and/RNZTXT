            <p>Australian opener David Warner has made an impassioned appeal for the return of a rucksack containing his baggy green cap that went missing on a flight from Melbourne to Sydney for his final test match this week.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old will bring down the curtain on his 12-year career in the longest format of the game in the third test against Pakistan at his home Sydney Cricket Ground starting on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my last resort, but my backpack, which contained my Baggy Green, has been taken from my luggage, which was transported to Melbourne airport and flown ... to Sydney a few days ago," he said in a post on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sentimental to me, it's something that I would love to have back, in my hands, walking out there come this week.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's the backpack that you really wanted, I have a spare one here. You won't get into trouble, just get in touch with Cricket Australia or me. I'm happy to give this to you if you return my Baggy Green."</p>
        
            <p>Australian internationals receive the baggy green cap, usually from a former player, on the morning of their test debut and wear it with pride even as it deteriorates over the length of their career.</p>
        
            <p>The baggy green cap of Australian cricketing great Shane Warne sold for more than a million dollars at an auction in January 2020.</p>
