            <p>Logan Rogerson scored in the 100th minute for Auckland FC to steal a 2-2 draw with Adelaide United in their table-topping A-League match.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Knights remain second in the standings, one point behind Adelaide, following a thrilling contest which burst into life over the closing stages.</p>
        
            <p>Rogerson silenced the home crowd with his headed goal to complete a crazy finish to a match that was scoreless for more than an hour before Auckland's Neyder Moreno fired in the opener moments after entering the game.</p>
        
            <p>Reds striker Archie Goodwin struck back with a double, his first coming in controversial fashion after replays showed winger Yaya Dukuly may have committed a foul on Auckland defender Callan Elliott in the lead-up.</p>
        
            <p>Goodwin's 95th minute goal looked set to send Adelaide four points clear at the top of the ladder before substitute Rogerson found himself unmarked in the box to convert a Francis De Vries cross in the 10th and final minute of stoppage time.</p>

            <p>Auckland FC have made a habit of late heroics in their maiden season, a point not missed by delighted coach Steve Corica.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really proud of the boys," Corica told the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>"They've done it before in games, they just keep going these boys and (I'm) really proud of them.</p>
        
            <p>"Right to the death, it was a great ball in from Francis De Vries and a good header (there) was obviously a lot of pressure on that last kick of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we got what we deserved. At least a point."</p>
        
            <p>Adelaide coach Carl Veart questioned the length of time the game continued beyond 90 minutes, suggesting the full-time whistle should have been blown before Rogerson's goal.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah look, it was seven extra minutes and they scored in the ninth extra minute," Veart said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know where the other two extra minutes came from. So look, it's disappointing to concede goals that late but there's not much we can do about it now.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a high-pressure game, a lot of contests, a lot of fouls, a lot of direct balls - even from us, we didn't really play our football.</p>
        
            <p>"But Auckland don't allow you (to play) with the press, the pressure that they put on you so yeah, it was a tough night."</p>
        
            <p>Corica responded by questioning Adelaide's opening goal, believing VAR should have intervened.</p>

            <p>"Obviously I wasn't happy, Carl was happy. For me, I don't think Callan had any reason to go down - he was in front. For me, it's a foul," Corica said.</p>
        
            <p>"VAR have looked at it, made a decision. I didn't like it and obviously then they scored a second one which was a good goal by them, they're a good team.</p>
        
            <p>"They play good football, it's always entertaining here and we had to be good tonight to obviously get a point but we wanted three today."</p>
