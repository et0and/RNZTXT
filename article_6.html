            <p>Black Caps spin bowler Ish Sodhi believes there is plenty to learn from their hosts ahead of the second Test in Bangladesh starting on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand lost the opening test by 150 runs and need to win the next fixture to finish the series on level terms.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that Bangladesh played, they certainly outplayed us. But upon reflection, I think they gave us a blueprint on what's successful in these conditions, and hopefully we can apply that to this next Test match," Sodhi said.</p>
        
            <p>After winning the toss and deciding to bat first Bangladesh made 310 and 338, with New Zealand bowled out for just 181 on the last day as they chased a target of 332.</p>
        
            <p>Sodhi only bowled 33 overs in the match and finished with three wickets for 145 runs.</p>
        
            <p>"It is obviously tough to come out on the losing side in that first game in Sylhet, but I think as the Test progressed, we found a bit more rhythm. Obviously, I haven't played Test cricket in a while, so it's always going to be tough in these conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Sodhi expects the experience in the side to react in the second and final test in Mirpur.</p>
        
            <p>"The great success this team's had over the past decade has been being able to park these sort of things pretty quickly, whether it's success or loss.</p>
        
            <p>"That's going to be tested though. It is never anything to take for granted. It is always hard to come back off the back of a loss.</p>
        
            <p>"But with the experienced heads here, we've been there, we've done that. We know how to apply ourselves into the next games. Hopefully, that's something that we can commit to really well and apply to this next game."</p>
        
            <p>There are unlikely to be many changes to the Black Caps lineup although World Cup star Rachin Ravindra could make the eleven at the expense of Henry Nicholls who made 19 and 2 in Sylhet.</p>
