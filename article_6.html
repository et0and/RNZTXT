            <p>Star defenders Jo Weston and Courtney Bruce have returned to the triumphant Australian Diamonds squad, who next face New Zealand in the Constellation Cup series.</p>
        
            <p>The 15-player Australian squad was unveiled soon after the Australians wrapped up their three-match series against England, winning the last test in Bendigo 69-56.</p>
        
            <p>Goal attack Kiera Austin was named player of the match and series, the award coming on the back of a stellar display.</p>
        
            <p>Weston was court-side in country Victoria for the match but has overcome a leg injury to take her place as the Diamonds look to claim their third consecutive series win.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Stacey Marinkovich named fellow defenders Sunday Aryang, Rudi Ellis, Matilda Garrett and Sarah Klau to join Weston and Bruce.</p>

            <p>Rising star Ash Ervin, who was named against England but never debuted, did not make the cut while wing defence Amy Parmenter has also been left out.</p>
        
            <p>Young midcourter Georgie Horjus will get another chance to make her international debut against New Zealand after not playing any minutes against England.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a great opportunity to further explore our combinations with the inclusion of Jo and Courtney, and also the integration of players who have been evolving in both their individual performances and as a unit," Marinkovich said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We have versatility in the rotations that we can play, and we will continue to attack the opposition in a variety of different ways."</p>
        
            <p>Marinkovich said she wanted her team to embrace the challenge of winning the first two games in New Zealand before returning to play in front of home fans.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no greater challenge than playing the Silver Ferns in New Zealand, particularly based on our history," Marinkovich said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only are we trying to solidify the way we want to play, but we want to be able to do it away from home."</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 Constellation Cup begins with opening matches to be played in Wellington on 20 October and Auckland on 23 October.</p>
        
            <p>Match three will be at Perth Arena on Sunday, 27 October while the final Test will be at Melbourne's John Cain Arena on Wednesday, 30 October.</p>
