            <p>The All Whites have secured a semi-final spot in the Oceania FIFA World Cup qualifiers with an 8-1 win over Vanuatu in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Returning to the region where he played the majority of his youth football, All Whites captain Chris Wood showed on home soil a glimpse of what has made him the talk of England's Premier League of late.</p>
        
            <p>Wood's goal-scoring form at club level for Nottingham Forest continued at the international level where he scored a brace in front of a large crowd at Waikato Stadium but he could have had more goals if he had nailed all his chances.</p>
        
            <p>In a dominant first half, Matt Garbett opened the scoring in the 11th minute capitalising on a Vanuatu error and taking a long-range strike to bury the ball into the top left corner of the net.</p>
        
            <p>It was the fifth time Garbett, who plays club football for NAC Breda in the Netherlands, had scored goal in an All Whites shirt.</p>
        
            <p>Five minutes later, the visitors levelled the scores against the run of play with Jordy Tasip scoring his first goal for Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>A header from Wood gave the home side the lead in the 23rd minute and he doubled his personal tally less than a minute later calmly slotting home a goal off a pass from Garbett.</p>

            <p>Central defender Tyler Bindon extended the lead even further with his first goal for New Zealand just after the half hour mark and he played a significant role in the All Whites' fifth goal of the half when he forced the opposition captain Brian Kaltack to head in an own goal minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>After the half-time break, Vanuatu had the first shot on target and forced goalkeeper Max Crocombe to make a save on a night in which he had very little to do but he would remain reasonably untroubled for the remainder of the game.</p>
        
            <p>It took the All Whites a while to break down the Vanuatu defence in the second half with many unfinished opportunities in front of goal but Eli Just added a sixth goal in the 74th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Just after the hour mark, forward Sarpreet Singh came off the bench for his 15th cap for New Zealand after a tough few years where injury and a rollercoaster club football career has kept him out of the national side.</p>
        
            <p>Singh was able confidently score the All Whites' seventh goal, and just his second goal for New Zealand, six years after first getting on the score sheet.</p>
        
            <p>Substitute Callum McCowatt added to Vanuatu's pain by scoring the home side's eighth.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC's Liam Gillion got on the field to make his All Whites' debut with around 10 minutes of regular time left to play.</p>
        
            <p>Wood told the host broadcaster he was "happy with a couple of goals but I'm more happy with the win".</p>
        
            <p>"It got us through to the next round which is the main thing."</p>

            <p>The All Whites play their next Oceania Football World Cup qualifier in Group B against Samoa in Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand currently lead the group with two wins.</p>
        
            <p>The top two teams after the final rounds on Sunday (Group A) and Monday (Group B) will meet in the semifinals in March.</p>
        
            <p>The Oceania winner will qualify for the World Cup in 2026, while the runner-up will get the chance to qualify through an intercontinental playoff.</p>
