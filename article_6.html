            <p>New Zealand's Dame Lydia Ko shot a 68 to take the lead heading into the final round of the HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore.</p>
        
            <p>Ko mixed seven birdies with three bogeys on a steamy day in which the temperatures hit 31degC on the Tanjong course at Sentosa Golf Club. She finished the round at 10-under for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Charley Hull of England matched Ko's 68 to capture sole possession of second place, one shot back at nine-under.</p>
        
            <p>Jeeno Thitikul of Thailand moved into contention with a round of 66, carding seven birdies and a lone bogey on the par-4 ninth hole to take possession of third place at seven-under.</p>
        
            <p>And in fourth place, four shots back at six-under, are Minjee Lee of Australia (68), Thailand's Pajaree Anannarukarn (70) and second-round leader A Lim Kin of South Korea, who had four bogeys on the day on the way to a 73.</p>
        
            <p>Ko, who has 22 career wins, is making her 11th appearance at the Singapore tournament without a victory there.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to be in the final group tomorrow," Ko said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been in the final group a couple times at this event before and I haven't necessarily taken it over the finish line, and I hope tomorrow is the day to do it. ... Regardless of what happens tomorrow, I'm just really excited for the season ahead. I'm excited to be in contention and hopefully I can play some good golf and see where that puts me at the end of the day."</p>

            <p>Hull had four birdies and was one of just two players to post a bogey-free round. The way her day started didn't indicate she'd turn in a strong round.</p>
        
            <p>"I woke up this morning and I actually was sick. I threw up, and then I kind of got my head together," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then I actually did my personal best in my 5K run in 26 minutes, knocked another minute off. I was pretty happy about that. Thirty seconds off, actually. That kept me in a good space for the rest of the day. Just went out on the golf course and played golf."</p>
        
            <p>Thitikul has nine consecutive top-10 finishes, dating back to last season. Her 66 tied for the lowest round of the week, and she didn't anticipate the climb up the leaderboard.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels good," she said. "I thought I'm not going to be on top of the leaderboard that much this week. But like saw myself in, like, contention, which is more than I expected."</p>
        
            <p>With a victory on Sunday, Thitikul would be the first Thai player to win the HSBC Women's World Championship.</p>
