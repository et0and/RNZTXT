            <p>Australia has clinched a series win over England after defeating the Roses 69-56 in the third and final test in Bendigo.</p>
        
            <p>England had levelled the series with a come-from-behind win in the second test and arrived in Bendigo full of confidence.</p>
        
            <p>But the world champion Diamonds rebounded to lead at every break in the series-deciding contest.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are the next opponents for both teams.</p>
        
            <p>England visit a three-test series, with the first match in Auckland this Sunday, before the trans-Tasman Constellation Cup series.</p>
        
            <p>Australia were ahead 50-42 at three-quarter time and iced the result in the final term by outscoring the Roses 19-14.</p>
        
            <p>The result means they keep their record against the Roses at home intact, having never dropped a series to England on Australian soil.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Garbin led the scoring for the Diamonds with 43 goals from 47 attempts.</p>
        
            <p>But Kiera Austin was named player of the match and series after shooting 24 from 29, in addition to tallying 15 goal assists, 18 feeds and 12 centre-pass receives on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Her rare ability to also contribute defensively blew the crowd away, as she finished with a total of three gains on the stats sheet - more than any player - pinching valuable possession from the Roses left, right and centre.</p>
        
            <p>Australia captain Liz Watson was glowing in her assessment of the 27-year-old shooter, who played in the Super Netball grand final in August.</p>
        
            <p>"I think her whole season has built really nicely," Watson told Fox Netball.</p>
        
            <p>"To have such a great Super Netball season and then to transfer that over to the Diamonds environment â€¦ she's such a great defensive player for us as well, so to have a goal attack get intercepts and tips, it really helps us.</p>
        
            <p>"She's been incredible and I've seen all the hard work that she puts in."</p>
        
            <p>Although the final game was a great sign for the Diamonds, the visiting team will be left incredibly disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, England was filled with hope after recording just its third win in history over the Diamonds in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Alas, the Roses were unable to keep the pressure on to close out the series and ended up slumping to the same margin of 13 goals as they did in the first Test.</p>
        
            <p>However, England head coach Jess Thirlby said it did not feel as big of a loss.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels different at least to the first Test because I think at least we kept ourselves within a foothold going into half-time," Thirlby said.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew what to expect but we were a little bit reactive defensively, so I think we played to their strengths and were a bit slow to adjust.</p>
        
            <p>"We weren't quite as connected as we wanted to be or going after the ball that we'd set ourselves up for.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a challenging one for us to reflect on because we couldn't find enough ball and were also a bit sloppy with turnover.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some positives but it felt like we were soul-searching at the back end."</p>
        
            <p>Liv Tchine landed 39 goals from 40 attempts to be the Roses' top scorer.</p>
        
            <p>The Diamonds will now turn their attention to next month's Constellation Cup series against New Zealand.</p>
