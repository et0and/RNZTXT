            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have ended a run of four consecutive A-League losses with a 1-1 draw with Sydney FC in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Kosta Barbarouses scored the equaliser shortly before half-time with his 101st A-League goal after the Sky Blues had taken the lead inside 10 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano was "very happy" with the performance from his side.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no hiding the fact we've been going through a rough trot (and) group morale is down, (but) the boys gave me everything today," Italiano told media post-match.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm extremely proud. It was easy to give up after one-nil.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed in the end that we didn't win because we actually had some really good moments there to transition and capitalise.</p>
        
            <p>"But when teams are a little bit down in confidence sometimes execution technically isn't there, but I'm extremely proud."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano hopes the draw serves as a turning point and is looking forward to further galvanising the squad during the international break.</p>
        
            <p>"This result tonight will go a long way to getting us to where we need to.</p>
        
            <p>"My job now is to build believe in the group and to stick to being humble and hard-working and let the football sort itself out.</p>
        
            <p>"We can work on this new system that we're playing, consolidate and get ready for Wanderers.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to be at home. I want to get a home win for the fans. I think they deserve it despite all the things that have been said. It doesn't matter how we win."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix are 11th on the table and have an extra week to prepare for their next match against Western Sydney Wanderers at Sky Stadium on Saturday 29 March as the A-League breaks for international football next weekend.</p>
