            <p>Central Coast Mariners came from behind to beat Melbourne Victory 3-1 in the A-League grand final at Central Coast Stadium on Saturday, winning back-to-back titles and becoming the first Australian team to seal a historic treble.</p>
        
            <p>Mariners had won the league crown as well as the AFC Cup while their extra-time win on the back of Ryan Edmondson's late double also denied Victory a record-equalling fifth trophy.</p>
        
            <p>"I still think I'm dreaming, someone needs to wake me up because what's just gone on in the past 120 minutes - I can't comprehend," Edmondson said.</p>
        
            <p>"All season these boys have had a never-say-die attitude. It's gone from losing the first four games of the season to this. It goes to show the character of each and every one of us."</p>
        
            <p>It was a bitter pill to swallow for Victory coach Tony Popovic, who has now lost five times in the Grand Final with three different clubs, while his counterpart Mark Jackson wrapped up a trophy-laden debut season in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>After a goalless first half, Victory took the lead five minutes into the second when Jason Geria scored with a bolt from the blue, pulling the trigger from outside the box to find the top corner for his first goal of the season.</p>
        
            <p>But their attempts to hold on for a 1-0 win were foiled in injury time when Mariners equalised in the 91st minute after Joshua Nisbet set up Edmondson to score, forcing extra time with their first shot on target.</p>
        
            <p>Mariners completed the comeback seven minutes into the first period of extra time with a sweeping move which ended with Ronald Barcellos squaring the ball for Miguel Di Pizio, who turned it in to spark celebrations in the stands.</p>
        
            <p>As the Mariners fans began bouncing as one and prepared to rush on to the pitch at full time, Edmondson grabbed his second when he dribbled into the box and curled a shot past the keeper and in.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of it is the mindset, that's what it is. We've got a fantastic group of players," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Never write us off... Once we scored, I knew we'd get another one."</p>
