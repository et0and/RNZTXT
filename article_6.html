            <p>Team New Zealand are in discussions about defending the America's Cup on home waters once again.</p>
        
            <p>Returning to Auckland to host the 38th America's Cup would require both government and private funding according to Team New Zealand chief executive officer Grant Dalton but Auckland Council's events arm, Tātaki Auckland Unlimited, is keen to make it happen.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said Auckland Unlimited had been doing a lot of "background work and have been engaged with the team on a preliminary basis" to try and get the next America's Cup back in Auckland where the Team New Zealand successfully defended the Auld Mug in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"However they are not the only stakeholder required to pull an event of this magnitude together, obviously this needs central Government backing but we haven't had any direct contact or indication of interest yet on that level," Dalton said.</p>
        
            <p>"As has previously been said, there is a recognition by the team that a private funding element would also be required to make the economics of the event in Auckland work and discussions are ongoing in that respect."</p>
        
            <p>After last winning in Auckland, Team New Zealand made the controversial decision to host the last year's America's Cup in Barcelona.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to take the sailing to Spain was because the money offered to Team New Zealand by the Barcelona bid was better than what they could get from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>A study from the University of Barcelona and the Barcelona Capital Nàutica Foundation released on Wednesday showed hosting the America's Cup had brought a €1.034 billion (nearly $2 billion New Zealand dollars) positive economic benefit to the city.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 2 million visitors were counted over the 59 days including 460,819 that travelled to Barcelona specifically to be part of the America's Cup event.</p>
        
            <p>Hosting the event created the equivalent of 12,872 jobs in Barcelona and generated €208.5 million in tax revenue, according to the study.</p>
        
            <p>Tātaki Auckland Unlimited chief executive Nick Hill had taken notice of the benefits in Barcelona and wanted something similar in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The post-event economic impact report for the 37th America's Cup event held in Barcelona last year is extremely positive, illustrating strong return on investment," Hill said.</p>
        
            <p>"The benefits of hosting this mega-event go well beyond the obvious economic, trade, tourism, employment and social benefits for the region. As we know the whole country benefits from the opportunities to enhance and grow New Zealand's reputation in cutting-edge marine innovation and technology, advanced manufacturing and sustainability."</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand, with British Challenger of Record (COR) The Royal Yacht Squadron, are yet to confirm when and where the next America's Cup will be.</p>
        
            <p>The rules set out after Team New Zealand's win last year noted that the next America's Cup would be held within three years with a venue to be named by June this year.</p>
        
            <p>The 38th America's Cup will once again be sailed in AC75 yachts with Team New Zealand and the COR agreeing to investigate campaign cost reduction measures including a budget cap and carbon cap for teams and to work on a strategy to further commercialise the America's Cup.</p>
