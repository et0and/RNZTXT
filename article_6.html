            <p>The White Ferns have suffered a clean sweep defeat to end their home summer.</p>
        
            <p>Despite fighting half centuries by from Amelia Kerr and Maddy Green, New Zealand went down to Australia by eight runs in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Looking dead and buried at 54-4, the Ferns fought hard, led by Kerr and Green, but will rue several dropped catches which allowed the Aussies to post a total just out of reach.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Devine struck first for the Kiwis, dismissing Beth Mooney for 21.</p>
        
            <p>Jess Kerr had the chance to send Voll back to the sheds early, but put down the caught and bowled chance in the opening over.</p>
        
            <p>Voll was again dropped in consecutive deliveries from Jess Kerr when on 13 - first Maddy Green spilling a dolly and then Eden Carson grassing a tougher chance at point.</p>
        
            <p>Phoebe Litchfield joined Voll in the middle and Voll was dropped a fourth time off Devine, this time Rosemary Mair shelling a regulation chance, Voll bringing up her fifty in the process.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Kerr was unable to hide her frustration when a fifth chance to dismiss the opener went begging, Brooke Halliday this time the culprit, though the pain was alleviated somewhat when Kerr pouched a high one from Litchfield from her own bowling.</p>
        
            <p>Astonishingly, a sixth spill came from Kerr's bowling, before the Ferns struck again in quick succession, Voll's luck finally running out on 75 as Suzie Bates snuck one through the gate.</p>
        
            <p>However, Ellyse Perry kept Australia humming along with Talia McGrath, Perry finishing unbeaten on 32.</p>
        
            <p>Devine bowled the final over, hit for three boundaries as the Aussies piled on 180-4.</p>
        
            <p>Bates fell early in the chase, followed shortly by georgia Plimmer for four to have the Ferns 16-2 after just 15 balls.</p>
        
            <p>After a small consolidation, Bella James held out to square leg to bring Devine to the middle, though she added just a single run before heading back to the pavilion.</p>
        
            <p>Green and Kerr then combined for 99, Green hammering five sixes in her innings which eventually ended at 62 from just 35 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Her wicket was followed by another two in quick time, leaving Kerr short of support and she would also be out on the final ball for a brave 66.</p>
