        <h2>NZ trio exceed hopes with silver-medal performance</h2>
        <p>
Not many would have picked Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews to make the final, their coach says.

            <p>The New Zealand women's sprint cycling team overperformed on Tuesday by winning a silver medal at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The team - Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews - set a world record in the relatively new three-woman sprint relay on their way to the final. They were beaten by the British team, who broke the world record all three times they raced today.</p>
        
            <p>After winning silver, Andrews told Sky Sport: "It's just so special to have all of our friends and family here watching as well. We can really feel them in the crowd."</p>
        
            <p>"It's just absolutely amazing," Petch said. "The journey to here has been insane and to actually put it down on the day is just so special."</p>

            <p>Petch, 26, finished 12th racing in the BMX at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews, 24, is already an Olympic silver-medallist, world champion in the keirin and a triple Commonwealth Games gold medallist.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Jon Andrews, Ellesse's father, is the sprint team coach and was also surprised they had gone so well.</p>
        
            <p>"Not many would have picked New Zealand to make that final. When you look around here and see the great cycling nations competing, it's pretty amazing that we beat all but one of them," he told the New Zealand Olympic team website.</p>
        
            <p>"But they're a good team. They train hard, they have a nice bond and they're close. They're there for each other."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Britain's Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane made sure the track cycling programme began with a bang, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>Welsh rider Finucane, the individual world champion, made it a glorious Olympic debut as she led the team home.</p>
        
            <p>Britain had not even qualified a team for the team sprint since 2012 but came in with great expectations and did not disappoint as they dominated the opening event of the week.</p>
        
            <p>They clocked a world record 45.186 seconds in the final with New Zealand's trio finishing in 45.659. World champions Germany had to be content with the bronze medal after beating the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>Defending Olympic champions China were a poor sixth.</p>
