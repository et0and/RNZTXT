            <p>Is this the weekend the Crusaders turn things around? The odds say no as they head to Eden Park and face a strong Blues side that's sitting fourth on the ladder, in what will be the feature match of the round. That's a tight call on what's shaping up to be a super Saturday, the Chiefs and Highlanders clash down south has the potential to be a banger and the Tahs' visit to Lautoka should be a decent watch too.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 7:05pm, Friday 22 March</p>
        
            <p>Central Energy Stadium, Palmerston North</p>

            <p>The Canes are proudly top of the ladder right now and, barring a profound case of bad luck, will stay there for the time being. It's not that the Rebels are awful, they just shouldn't be much of a match for Clark Laidlaw's in form side in Palmy. Jordie Barrett's back after a spell in the naughty corner, while Ngane Punivai debuts and Salesi Rayasi gets a start on the wing</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: Pouri Rakete-Stones, James O'Reilly, Tyrel Lomax, Justin Sangster, Caleb Delany, Brad Shields (c), Du'Plessis Kirifi, Devan Flanders, TJ Perenara, Aidan Morgan, Salesi Rayasi, Jordie Barrett, Ngane Punivai, Daniel Sinkinson, Harry Godfrey</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Asafo Aumua, Tevita Mafileo, Pasilio Tosi, James Tucker, Brayden Iose, Richard Judd, Riley Higgins, Josh Moorby</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: Isaac Kailea, Jordan Uelese, Sam Talakai, Angelo Smith, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Tuaina Taii Tualima, Vaiolini Ekuasi, Rob Leota (c), Ryan Louwrens, Carter Gordon, Glen Vaihu, David Feliuai, Lukas Ripley, Lachie Anderson, Andrew Kellaway</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Alex Mafi, Cabous Eloff, Taniela Tupou, Josh Canham, Daniel Maiava, Jack Maunder, Mason Gordon, Nick Jooste</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9:35pm, Friday 22 March</p>

            <p>Moana are doing really well so far, two wins from four games and both losses by six and three points. But here's where it starts to get tough, a Canberra road trip against a Brumbies side that seem to have shaken off some early season rust. Tana Umaga's Moana needs to hang in there for the full 80, a quality they've been able to have consistently for the first time this season.</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies: Harry Vella, Billy Pollard, Sefo Kautai, Darcy Swain (c), Cadeyrn Neville, Rob Valetini, Jahrome Brown, Charlie Cale, Harrison Goddard, Noah Lolesio, Corey Toole, Tamati Tua, Hudson Creighton, Ollie Sapsford, Tom Wright</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Lachlan Lonergan, James Slipper, Rhys Van Nek, Nick Frost, Tom Hooper, Luke Reimer, Ryan Lonergan, Declan Meredith</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: Abraham Pole, Samiuela Moli, Sione Mafileo, Ola Tauelangi, Allan Craig, Jacob Norris, Sione Havili Talitui (c), Lotu Inisi, Ereatara Enari, Christian Lealiifano, Kyren Taumoefolau, D'Angelo Leuila, Pepesana Patafilo, Nigel Ah Wong, Danny Toala</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Tomasi Maka, Sateki Latu, Sekope Kepu, Michael Curry, Semisi Paea, Melani Matavao, William Havili, Fine Inisi</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 2:05pm, Saturday 23 March</p>

            <p>It's the Tahs' turn to head to what's quickly become the most iconic venue in Super Rugby Pacific. The forecast for Saturday in Lautoka is around 30 degrees and 80 percent humidity, then there's the Drua they have to contend with too. Both sides are coming off wildly contrasting losses, but you would have to favour the home side in front of their big fan base. Highly rated Max Jorgensen comes straight back into the Tahs' lineup at fullback, after missing the opening rounds with a hip injury</p>
        
            <p>Drua: Haereiti Hetet, Tevita Ikanivere, Mesake Doge, Mesake Vocevoce, Leone Rotuisolia, Etonia Waqa, Vilive Miramira, Meli Derenalagi (c), Simione Kuruvoli, Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, Taniela Rakuro, Apisalome Vota, Iosefo Masi, Selestino Ravutaumada, Ilaisa Droasese</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Zuriel Togiatama, Emosi Tuqiri, Samuela Tawake, Te Ahiwaru Cirikidaveta, Kitione Salawa, Peni Matawalu, Kemu Valetini, Epeli Momo</p>
        
            <p>Waratahs: Angus Bell, Mahe Vailanu, Harry Johnson-Holmes, Jed Holloway, Fergus Lee-Warner, Ned Hanigan, Charlie Gamble, Langi Gleeson, Jake Gordon (c), Tane Edmed, Dylan Pietsch, Joey Walton, Izaia Perese, Mark Nawaqanitawase, Max Jorgensen</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Julian Heaven, Hayden Thompson-Stringer, Tom Ross, Miles Amatosero, Hugh Sinclair, Lachlan Swinton, Jack Grant, Triston Reilly</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 4:35pm, Saturday 23 March</p>

            <p>These two sides have a history of putting on incredible matches at this venue, but there is a clear imbalance in talent this time around. Clayton McMillan has the luxury of a squad deeper than an Olympic diving pool, while Clarke Dermody's options are more like a puddle, so really the home team's chances could rest on how many of their starting lineup they can keep intact. They also rest heavily on the two excellent additions to the Highlanders this year, Rhys Patchell and Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: Ayden Johnstone, Henry Bell, Saula Ma'u, Fabian Holland, Pari Pari Parkinson, Sean Withy, Billy Harmon (c) Tom Sanders, Folau Fakatava, Rhys Patchell, Jona Nareki, Sam Gilbert, Tanielu Tele'a, Timoci Tavatavanawai, Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Jack Taylor, Daniel Lienert-Brown, Jermaine Ainsley, Oliver Haig, Nikora Broughton, James Arscott, Ajay Faleafaga, Connor Garden-Bachop</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: Jared Proffit, Bradley Slater, Reuben O'Neill, Josh Lord, Tupou Vaa'i, Samipeni Finau, Kaylum Boshier, Luke Jacobson (c), Cortez Ratima, Damian McKenzie, Etene Nanai-Seturo, Quinn Tupaea, Rameka Poihipi, Daniel Rona, Shaun Stevenson</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Tyrone Thompson, Aidan Ross, George Dyer, Naitoa Ah Kuoi, Wallace Sititi, Xavier Roe, Josh Ioane, Emoni Narawa</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 7:05pm, Saturday 23 March</p>

            <p>Vengeance will be on the mind of the Blues, who have had to trudge into the sheds after a losing effort 17 times out of the last 18 games against the Crusaders. One of those was 2022's final, something that will still be on the mind of returning skipper Patrick Tuipulotu. He will also play his 100th Super Rugby match in a very strong looking home side, in front of what should be a big crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders have managed to get through this week without suffering another major injury, which is a good start, but will be without the suspended Owen Franks. If they can pull off an upset here it'll certainly send a message that they're still very much the Crusaders of old, but it's going to take a huge effort.</p>
        
            <p>Blues: Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Ricky Riccitelli, Angus Ta'avao, Patrick Tuipulotu (c), Laghlan McWhannell, Akira Ioane, Dalton Papali'i, Hoskins Sotutu, Finlay Christie, Stephen Perofeta, Caleb Clarke, Bryce Heem, AJ Lam, Mark Tele'a, Zarn Sullivan</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Kurt Eklund, Joshua Fusitu'a, Marcel Renata, Josh Beehre, Adrian Choat, Taufa Funaki, Harry Plummer, Cole Forbes</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: George Bower, George Bell, Fletcher Newell, Quinten Strange, Jamie Hannah, Dominic Gardiner, Tom Christie, Cullen Grace, Willi Heinz, Riley Hohepa, Macca Springer, David Havili (c), Levi Aumua, Sevu Reece, Chay Fihaki</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Ioane Moananu, Joe Moody, Seb Calder, Tahlor Cahill, Corey Kellow, Noah Hotham, Ryan Crotty, Dallas McLeod</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9:35pm, Saturday 23 March</p>

            <p>The Reds are riding high after some deserved results and could mount a challenge to the Brumbies' status as the best Australian side. Meanwhile the Force are certainly deserving of their place on the ladder - dead last - after simply just not being very good.</p>
        
            <p>Force: Ryan Coxon, Tom Horton, Santiago Medrano, Thomas Franklin, Jeremy Williams (c), Tim Anstee, Carlo Tizzano, Will Harris, Nic White, Ben Donaldson, Chase Tiatia, Hamish Stewart, Sam Spink, Bayley Kuenzle, Harry Potter</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Ben Funnell, Josh Bartlett, Tiaan Tauakipulu, Lopeti Faifua, Reed Prinsep, Issak Fines-Leleiwasa, Max Burey, George Poolman</p>
        
            <p>Reds: Peni Ravai, Matt Faessler, Zane Nonggorr, Seru Uru, Ryan Smith, Liam Wright (co-c), Fraser McReight, Harry Wilson, Tate McDermott (co-c), Tom Lynagh, Mac Grealy, Hunter Paisami, Josh Flook, Suliasi Vunivalu, Jock Campbell</p>
        
            <p>Bench: Josh Nasser, George Blake, Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, Cormac Daly, John Bryant, Kalani Thomas, Harry McLaughlin-Phillips, Taj Annan</p>
