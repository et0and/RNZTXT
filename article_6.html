            <p>The directors of defunct Super Rugby Pacific team Melbourne Rebels have sued Rugby Australia for A$30 million in damages as part of a claim over the club's extinction.</p>
        
            <p>The Rebels went into voluntary administration in January with debts of over A$20 million and were shuttered at the end of the season in June after RA rejected a rescue deal presented by the club's directors.</p>
        
            <p>The directors lodged a claim with Australia's Federal Court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>They said in a statement they wanted to be "entitled to resume control of the Rebels" so the team could continue to play in Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"The Rebels are a member of Rugby Australia and had a legal expectation that they would not only be treated fairly but that they would be treated equally to other members," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Governing body RA said they needed time to inspect the Rebels directors' claim before commenting further.</p>
        
            <p>The Rebels directors had threatened RA with legal action in May when the governing body confirmed it rejected a rescue deal brought by a consortium.</p>
        
            <p>The consortium was led by businessman Leigh Clifford, whose daughter Georgia Widdup sat on the Rebels' board.</p>
        
            <p>RA can ill-afford a costly legal battle, having reported a loss of A$9 million in 2023 and spent more than A$6 million to ensure the Rebels could complete their 14th and final season of Super Rugby this year.</p>
        
            <p>RA said in April it had drawn down A$50 million of an A$80 million loan taken out in November from a private equity company.</p>
