            <p>Australia opener David Warner has decided to call time on his one-day international career as well as his test career to spend more time with his family.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old, a key member of the Australia team that won the 50-overs World Cup for the sixth time in India last year, will play his 112th and final test against Pakistan at his home Sydney Cricket Ground starting on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"I said at the World Cup that I wanted to get through that ... but I've decided to also announce my retirement from that format," Warner said. "It'll help the one-day team move along a bit ... but if they need me, they know where I am."</p>
        
            <p>Warner scored 22 centuries and 6,932 runs at an average of 45.30 over 161 one-day internationals after his debut in January 2009, winning two World Cups in the format.</p>
