            <p>White Ferns captain Sophie Devine will take a break from domestic cricket and return home immediately to prioritise her wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>The decision, made by Devine this week after receiving professional advice, will mean she misses both the remainder of her Super Smash season with Wellington, as well as her 2025 Women's Premier League commitments with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).</p>
        
            <p>Liz Green, NZ Cricket (NZC) head of women's high performance development, said Devine was departing for home with her full backing.</p>
        
            <p>"Player wellbeing is paramount to us - it takes precedence over everything else.</p>
        
            <p>"Sophie's had excellent support from the New Zealand Cricket Players' Association and from our own high performance unit staff, and everyone agrees this is the best option available.</p>
        
            <p>"The most important thing for NZC is that Sophie has a decent break, receives good support and care, and is fit and well before returning to professional cricket".</p>
        
            <p>Green said Devine's decision was supported by NZC, Cricket Wellington and RCB.</p>
        
            <p>A decision on Devine's playing future will be announced in due course.</p>
        
            <p>In five T20 games for Wellington this summer, Devine has scored 38 runs and taken eight wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Devine led New Zealand to victory in the T20 World Cup in the UAE last year.</p>
