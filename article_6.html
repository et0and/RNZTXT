            <p>Brisbane Broncos star Ezra Mam has been fined and disqualified from driving after a head-on crash while on a "cocktail" of drugs, including cocaine.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old five-eighth pleaded guilty in court in Brisbane to one count of driving while drugs present in blood, and driving without a licence.</p>
        
            <p>Mam was driving his ute when it collided with an Uber at Bardon, in Brisbane's west, on October 18.</p>
        
            <p>Two people in the car, a child and a woman, suffered minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Mam failed a roadside drug test at the crash site and a second later at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>He entered a rehabilitation facility shortly after for four weeks and is undertaking counselling for a year.</p>
        
            <p>He was fined $850 and had his licence disqualified for at least six months.</p>
