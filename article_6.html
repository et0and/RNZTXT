            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have suffered a major injury blow with striker Oskar Zawada sidelined for their A-League top of the table clash.</p>
        
            <p>The Pole who scored 15 goals for the club during his 2022/23 season had just returned from a six-week injury lay-off.</p>
        
            <p>Zawada, who is often hailed for his match-winning heroics, will now miss Wellington's home clash with the Central Coast Mariners on Waitangi Day with a groin strain.</p>
        
            <p>The troublesome injury may see the 28-year-old absent for at least a month.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately he felt the tweak early (in the recent draw with the Brisbane Roar) which limited his range of movement," Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'd know the extent I actually would have subbed him off. He's the ultimate professional, it's just more bad luck."</p>
        
            <p>Striker Kosta Barbarouses will get his chance to step up in Zawada's absence and extend his purple patch of eight goals for the season.</p>
        
            <p>In December, Zawada, who has found the back of the net five times this season, was impacted by a thigh injury.</p>
        
            <p>He returned to score an 87th minute winner for Wellington against the Newcastle Jets in his first game back last month.</p>
        
            <p>And in November a back injury suffered in training also threatened to derail his time on the pitch.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will take on the Mariners at 4pm at Wellington's Sky Stadium on Waitangi Day.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Alex Rufer returns from his suspension with veteran Tim Payne also available for selection.</p>
        
            <p>Mohamed Al-Taay is not ready to start according to the coach.</p>
