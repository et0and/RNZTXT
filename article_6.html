            <p>Richmond Tigers utility Mykelti Lefau has opened his account in the AFL, booting two goals in an 11.16 (82) to 11.11 (77) win over the Sydney Swans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Lefau, who moved to Melbourne initially to try and make the career in the NRL with the Storm, was playing in his second career AFL game.</p>
        
            <p>His debut last weekend ended in a 30-point loss to Port Adelaide, in which he was rushed into the starting side on the day of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Benefitting from a more relaxed build-up in his second match, Lefau was brought into the game from the interchange bench in the first quarter in front of a 45,000 strong crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old won a free kick in front of goal after being brought down by the Swans' defenders, which he converted with a curling set shot.</p>
        
            <p>Later, in the third quarter, Lefau took a mark from after running onto a Tim Taranto kick. It gave him an attempt from the edge of the 50-metre line, which he drilled to extend a lead the Tigers never relinquished despite a frantic finish.</p>
        
            <p>Tigers full forward Tom Lynch had a big third term, kicking three goals and taking six marks, while midfielder Taranto was impressive with 35 disposals.</p>
        
            <p>It was an upset win for the Tigers and their first of the season after three losses, improving their position to 13th on the AFL ladder.</p>
        
            <p>They also got the result despite missing star player Dustin Martin, who was ruled out with injury.</p>
        
            <p>The Swans suffered their first loss of 2024 but remain in fourth place.</p>
