        <h2>Blues vs Chiefs: Blues out to end 21 years of pain</h2>
        <p>
It's been 21 years since the Blues last won a full Super Rugby title and coach Vern Cotter believes it's time to get the monkey off the back.

            <p>It's been 21 years since the Blues last won a full Super Rugby title and coach Vern Cotter believes it's time to get the monkey off the back.</p>
        
            <p>The Super Rugby champions will be crowned tomorrow night at a sold out Eden Park, with the Blues seeking to beat the Chiefs and claim their first crown in more than two decades.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a long time between drinks so I think it's about time. It's about knuckling down for 80 minutes of tough rugby."</p>
        
            <p>The Blues are favourites having won 15 straight games at Eden Park, including a comfortable victory over the Chiefs in the final round of the regular season.</p>

            <p>However, the Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan believes playing at home isn't always an advantage - as his side found out when they were beaten by the Crusaders in last year's title decider in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes in a funny way it can be harder. There's all the comforts of home but it brings some additional pressure and we felt that last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to create our own legacy around being a team that can win away as well as at home on the big stage."</p>

            <p>He said the Chiefs are ready to mount a raid on the Blues' Auckland fortress.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no fear about going to Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"The last time we went up there we didn't have our strongest team out there and there were still elements of the game I was happy with. We fully understand what we're walking into, but we're not daunted by it either."</p>
        
            <p>Blues prop Angus Ta'avao, who played six season with the Chiefs, said the neighbouring teams have developed a fierce rivalry.</p>
        
            <p>"Battle of the Bombays. Owning State Highway One. We're an hour and 15 away, when the road works aren't playing up, we're a stones throw away so we know what the challenges are and we look forward to that rivalry."</p>

            <p>The Chiefs will be without injured All Blacks hooker Samisoni Taukei'aho for the final, but the Blues have welcomed back their skipper with All Black Patrick Tuipulotu making a remarkable return from injury to take his place in the side.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-test lock was originally thought to be out of action for up to seven weeks with a knee complaint, but is back in just two.</p>
        
            <p>Blues coach Vern Cotter says Tuipulotu is the team's talisman.</p>
        
            <p>"He bleeds blue blood. That's the key to this. He's been a big part of this season. It's confirmation of how far these boys are willing to push themselves for their team and their teammates."</p>

            <p>One of those teammates is loose forward Akira Ioane who will make an emotional farewell to the franchise he has spent more than a decade playing for.</p>
        
            <p>He says winning a title would be the perfect swansong to his Blues career, but he's at peace with his decision to depart for Japan.</p>
        
            <p>"I know the boys are in a good spot moving forward, that's all I could have done is pave the way for the younger players to come in and enjoy it and want to be part of the Blues."</p>

            <p>The final sold out just a few hours after tickets were released on Monday, with 47,000 fans expected to descend on Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Ta'avao is hoping not too many Chiefs fans managed to snare seats.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be interesting as the last time we played there were a few cowbells in the crowd. I'd say there might be a few Hamilton country people locked in there.</p>
        
            <p>"I was lucky, we had a pre-sale so I managed to get my family some tickets. A final at Eden Park for the Blues against the Chiefs, what more could you ask for."</p>
        
            <p>Blues fans will be asking for one more win and their first Super Rugby title since 2003.</p>
