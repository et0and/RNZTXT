        <h2>Boat setback forces France out of SailGP Auckland</h2>
        <p>
The French will have to settle for watching from the shore, as the fleet tries to break their official speed record on the Waitematā Harbour. Audio

            <p>France have failed to make the startline of SailGP Auckland, after further delays to their new F50 boat.</p>
        
            <p>The team that hold the official speed record for the professional sailing circuit at 99kph missed the 2024/25 season-opener at Dubai last November, but arrived in New Zealand hoping to begin their account on the Waitematā Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>While their rivals have been out on the water, coming to grips with the new T-foils added to each boat, the French have been shorebound, watching from afar.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big disappointment, but it is what it is," said driver Quentin Delapierre. "We just want to be focused on the next outings, especially Sydney, making sure we are ready to perform and win races, as we did two seasons ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, the team is ready, we are well organised and we will take this as an opportunity to ensure we are ready to race in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, there is a major issue on the wing connection, so the wing cannot be assembled. They just realised that one or two days ago.</p>
        
            <p>"It is frustrating, but not in a huge manner."</p>
        
            <p>France have never reached the SailGP championship final and also ended the 2023/24 season in disaster. After winning the opening race at San Francisco, then finishing third in the next two, they collided with Denmark in the fourth race and could not start the fifth.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a huge frustration in San Francisco, not making this final with a big crash," said Delapierre. "I just want to show that the team has a good maturity and the team is ready to win this season."</p>
        
            <p>The French will be assessed average points for the two missed events, keeping them competitive with their 11 rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, New Zealand suffered the same fate, after the wing on their boat collapsed in Saint-Tropez and they failed to complete the regatta and missed the next in Taranto, Italy.</p>

            <p>"It's definitely super tough when there's not enough components for everyone," said Black Foils driver Peter Burling. "It's good how organisers are giving them middle-ground points so they can stay competitive overall this season.</p>
        
            <p>"They'll be able to put their best foot forward to make the finals and we're looking forward to having them back on the startline, as soon as the tech team can get them there."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis recovered from their setback to finish atop the standings and third in the grand final at San Francisco.</p>
        
            <p>The French will likely see their speed record of 99.94kph, set on home waters in 2022, eclipsed in their absence, with the new foils propelling boats towards that mark in training, even before crews have learnt to use them effectively.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge disappointment not to have the French on the startline this weekend," said SailGP chief executive Sir Russell Coutts. "Our team worked incredibly hard to get their boat completed and it looks fabulous in the new colours.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be working hard to get them on the water as soon as possible."</p>
