            <p>During historic triumphant Lions tours to New Zealand in 1971 and 1974 in South Africa, Williams accumulated eight Test caps.</p>
        
            <p>A bloodied Williams was forced to leave the field while playing for Bridgend against the All Blacks in 1978 after being stamped on by New Zealand prop John Ashworth.</p>
        
            <p>Williams' passing was announced by Bridgend Ravens - formerly known as Bridgend - on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"Bridgend Ravens are devastated to announce the passing of JPR Williams," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of Bridgend's most decorated-players and an icon of world rugby, JPR served the club most recently as club president. Our thoughts are with JPR's family and friends at this sad time."</p>
