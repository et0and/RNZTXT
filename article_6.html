            <p>Two big derbies are the feature of the penultimate weekend of the Super Rugby Pacific round robin.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs and Hurricanes showdown in Hamilton is the more intriguing of the two, given what both sides are playing for, while in Christchurch the Blues can finally put the Crusaders out of their misery.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7.05pm Friday 24 May</p>
        
            <p>FMG Stadium Waikato, Hamilton</p>

            <p>As it stands, this result may well be the deciding factor in who finishes above who, and therefore who may well host a semi-final rematch. The Canes did a number on the Chiefs in Wellington the last time they met, in what was arguably their best performance of the season. However, the Chiefs are banking on a big crowd and a very strong looking line-up.</p>
        
            <p>Brett Cameron and Damian McKenzie are the key men in this one, both different styles of first five but ones that can unlock the potency of the players outside them. This should be a cracker, with a number of men pressing for All Black spots across the field.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Shaun Stevenson, 14 Emoni Narawa, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 12 Quinn Tupaea, 11 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Cortez Ratima, 8 Luke Jacobson (c), 7 Kaylum Boshier, 6 Simon Parker, 5 Tupou Vaa'i, 4 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 3 George Dyer, 2 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 1 Aidan Ross</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Tyrone Thompson, 17 Jared Proffit, 18 Sione Ahio, 19 Naitoa Ah Kuoi, 20 Wallace Sititi, 21 Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, 22 Josh Ioane, 23 Rameka Poihipi</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Ruben Love, 14 Josh Moorby, 13 Billy Proctor, 12 Jordie Barrett (c), 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Brett Cameron, 9 TJ Perenara, 8 Brayden Iose, 7 Peter Lakai, 6 Devan Flanders, 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 4 Justin Sangster, 3 Pasilio Tosi, 2 Raymond Tuputupu, 1 Xavier Numia</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 James O'Reilly, 17 Pouri Rakete-Stones, 18 Tevita Mafileo, 19 Caleb Delany, 20 Te Kamaka Howden, 21 Richard Judd, 22 Peter Umaga-Jensen, 23 Salesi Rayasi</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 9.35pm Friday 24 May</p>

            <p>No love lost between these two but it is hard to see the Brumbies dropping this one despite the Rebels putting up a really good fight against the Chiefs last weekend. The men from Canberra are gunning for a top three spot as well, and while they have not exactly been blowing teams off the park in their four-game win streak, there is enough experience and talent to get this done.</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies: 15 Tom Wright, 14 Andy Muirhead, 13 Len Ikitau, 12 Tamati Tua, 11 Corey Toole, 10 Noah Lolesio, 9 Ryan Lonergan, 8 Rob Valetini, 7 Jahrome Brown, 6 Nick Frost, 5 Tom Hooper, 4 Darcy Swain, 3 Allan Alaalatoa (c), 2 Billy Pollard, 1 James Slipper</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Liam Bowron, 17 Rhys van Nek, 18 Sosefo Kautai, 19 Cadeyrn Neville, 20 Luke Reimer, 21 Harrison Goddard, 22 Jack Debreczeni, 23 Ollie Sapsford</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Andrew Kellaway, 14 Darby Lancaster, 13 Filipo Daugunu, 12 Nick Jooste, 11 Glen Vaihu, 10 Jake Strachan, 9 Ryan Louwrens, 8 Vaiolini Ekuasi, 7 Brad Wilkin, 6 Rob Leota (c), 5 Josh Canham, 4 Angelo Smith, 3 Sam Talakai, 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 Isaac Kailea</p>

            <p>Moana are playing for pride now and there is plenty to be proud of in an otherwise rocky season. They come in with minimal disruption, which is in stark contrast to the Tahs, who fired coach Darren Coleman during the week and are dealing with captain Jake Gordon seeking an early contract release.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Fine Inisi, 13 Pepesana Patafilo, 12 Julian Savea, 11 Neria Fomai, 10 William Havili, 9 Aisea Halo, 8 Lotu Inisi, 7 Sione Havili Talitui (c), 6 Jacob Norris, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Tom Savage, 3 Sione Mafileo, 2 Samiuela Moli, 1 Abraham Pole</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Tomasi Maka, 17 Tevita Langi, 18 Sekope Kepu, 19 Ola Tauelangi, 20 Alamanda Motuga, 21 Siaosi Nginingini, 22 Christian Lealiifano, 23 Henry Taefu</p>
        
            <p>Waratahs: 15 Mark Nawaqanitawase, 14 Izaia Perese, 13 Joey Walton, 12 Lalakai Foketi, 11 Dylan Pietsch, 10 Tane Edmed, 9 Jake Gordon, 8 Langi Gleeson, 7 Charlie Gamble, 6 Ned Hanigan, 5 Hugh Sinclair, 4 Jed Holloway, 3 Brad Amituanai, 2 Jay Fonokalafi, 1 Harry Lloyd</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ben Sugars, 17 Lewis Ponini, 18 Michael Scott, 19 Miles Amatosero, 20 Fergus Lee-Warner, 21 Jack Grant, 22 Jack Bowen, 23 Vuate Karawalevu</p>

            <p>Fresh off media controversy this week, Rob Penney's got probably the toughest task of his very tough season. The Blues are coming in so confident they have rested Caleb Clarke and been upfront about getting Beauden Barrett back into the side, while the Crusaders are still missing Scott Barrett. Ethan Blackadder has been rushed back in at openside, which will be an interesting watch.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: 15 Johnny McNicholl, 14 Chay Fihaki, 13 Levi Aumua, 12 David Havili, 11 Sevu Reece, 10 Fergus Burke, 9 Noah Hotham, 8 Christian Lio-Willie, 7 Ethan Blackadder, 6 Cullen Grace, 5 Quinten Strange, 4 Antonio Shalfoon, 3 Fletcher Newell, 2 Codie Taylor (c), 1 Joe Moody</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 George Bell, 17 George Bower, 18 Tamaiti Williams, 19 Jamie Hannah, 20 Tom Christie, 21 Mitchell Drummond, 22 Taha Kemara, 23 Dallas McLeod</p>
        
            <p>Blues: 15 Stephen Perofeta, 14 Mark Tele'a, 13 Rieko Ioane, 12 Corey Evans, 11 AJ Lam, 10 Harry Plummer, 9 Taufa Funaki, 8 Hoskins Sotutu, 7 Adrian Choat, 6 Akira Ioane, 5 Sam Darry, 4 Patrick Tuipulotu (c), 3 Angus Ta'avao, 2 Kurt Eklund, 1 Ofa Tu'ungafasi</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ricky Riccitelli, 17 Joshua Fusitu'a, 18 PJ Sheck, 19 Josh Beehre, 20 Cameron Suafoa, 21 Sam Nock, 22 Cole Forbes, 23 Caleb Tangitau</p>

            <p>The Reds have been frustratingly inconsistent this year, so this one against the ninth-placed Force is no gimmee. This one probably is not going to alter their status at fifth anyway, given they cannot catch the fourth placed Chiefs and are unlikely to be overtaken by the sixth placed Rebels.</p>
        
            <p>Reds: 15 Jock Campbell, 14 Tim Ryan, 13 Josh Flook, 12 Hunter Paisami, 11 Mac Grealy, 10 Tom Lynagh, 9 Tate McDermott (cc), 8 John Bryant, 7 Fraser McReight, 6 Liam Wright (cc), 5 Ryan Smith, 4 Seru Uru, 3 Jeffrey Toomaga-Allen, 2 Matt Faessler, 1 Alex Hodgman</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Josh Nasser, 17 Sef Fa'agase, 18 Zane Nonggor, 19 Connor Vest, 20 Joe Brial, 21 Kalani Thomas, 22 James O'Connor, 23 Taj Annan</p>
        
            <p>Force: 15 Kurtley Beale, 14 George Poolman, 13 Bayley Kuenzle, 12 Hamish Stewart, 11 Ronan Leahy, 10 Ben Donaldson, 9 Nic White, 8 Reed Prinsep, 7 Carlo Tizzano, 6 Will Harris, 5 Izack Rodda, 4 Jeremy Williams (c), 3 Santiago Medrano, 2 Tom Horton, 1 Harry Hoopert</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Feleti Kaitu'u, 17 Marley Pearce, 18 Tiaan Tauakipulu, 19 Lopeti Faifua, 20 Michael Wells, 21 Issak Fines-Leleiwasa, 22 Sam Spink, 23 Chase Tiatia</p>

            <p>Amazingly, we not only have Sunday rugby but an afternoon kick-off. The Highlanders can leapfrog the Rebels into sixth with a bonus point win, which is likely given how poor the Drua have been away from home this season. The Drua have not won a game on the road, so while the Highlanders are coming off a tough loss last weekend, this very much should be seen as a straightforward assignment.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 15 Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, 14 Timoci Tavatavanawai, 13 Jake Te Hiwi, 12 Sam Gilbert, 11 Jona Nareki, 10 Ajay Faleafaga, 9 Folau Fakatava, 8 Billy Harmon (cc), 7 Sean Withy, 6 Oliver Haig, 5 Fabian Holland, 4 Mitch Dunshea, 3 Jermaine Ainsley, 2 Henry Bell, 1 Ethan de Groot (cc)</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Jack Taylor, 17 Daniel Lienert-Brown, 18 Saula Ma'u, 19 Max Hicks, 20 Nikora Broughton, 21 James Arscott, 22 Matt Whaanga, 23 Connor Garden-Bachop</p>
        
            <p>Drua: 15 Ilaisa Droasese, 14 Selestino Ravutaumada, 13 Iosefo Masi, 12 Kemu Valetini, 11 Epeli Momo, 10 Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 9 Simi Kuruvoli, 8 Elia Canakaivata, 7 Kitione Salawa, 6 Etonia Waqa, 5 Isoa Nasilasila, 4 Mesake Vocevoce, 3 Mesake Doge, 2 Tevita Ikanivere (c), 1 Jone Koroiduadua</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Zuriel Togiatama, 17 Emosi Tuqiri, 18 Samu Tawake, 19 Leone Rotuisolia, 20 Vilive Miramira, 21 Peni Matawalu, 22 Caleb Muntz, 23 Taniela Rakuro</p>
