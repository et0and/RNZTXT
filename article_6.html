            <p>Black Caps international Doug Bracewell unleashed a brutal 93 not out off just 33 balls as Central Stags crushed Northern Brave by 56 runs in their men's Super Smash Twenty20 match in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell smashed 11 fours and five sixes in a whirlwind knock which began in the 13th over of Central's innings, powering them to 206-5.</p>
        
            <p>Northern never threatened the target, dismissed for 150 with four balls remaining in the final over.</p>
        
            <p>Better known for his bowling exploits on the international stage, Bracewell was playing as a batsman only for the stags on Wednesday and justified that status with his highest-ever T20 score.</p>
        
            <p>He put on 79 for the fifth wicket with Dane Cleaver (42) off just 33 balls as Northern's attack were flayed - most notably test veteran Neil Wagner, who conceded 63 off his four overs.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Kuggeleign was comfortably Northern's best performer, taking 2-20 off his four overs before top-scoring with 36 off 16 when batting unusually high in the order at No.3.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the chase stuttered, aside from a late 36-run cameo from Wagner as the defending champion Brave suffered their first loss of the season, leaving them and Central with identical one win-one loss records.</p>
