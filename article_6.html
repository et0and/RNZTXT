            <p>It was an efficient and ruthless reply from the Black Ferns today against Australia, following their historic loss to Canada.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand almost racked up a half century in a scintillating first-half, before running away with the match 67-19.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Mererangi Paul scored a hat-trick in the rout with skipper Kennedy Simon bagging a brace.</p>
        
            <p>Simon told Sky Sport they wanted a statement performance and got it.</p>
        
            <p>"Few hairy moments but all a part of the game, we just need to harness this and make sure we keep building,</p>
        
            <p>She said they kept it simple, were able to produce phases and turn that into points.</p>
        
            <p>"If keep doing the groundwork and hopefully the results will follow."</p>
        
            <p>Australian captain Michaela Leonard admitted her side has a long way to go.</p>
        
            <p>"A tough day, not the campaign we wanted, we have shown how positives we can be when we execute well, but it was the little areas that let us down."</p>

            <p>The Ferns were on the board within five minutes of the kick-off as Kaipo Olsen-Baker powered over off the back of a scrum.</p>
        
            <p>The Aussies struck back quickly through first-five Arabella Mckenzie who glided through a gap and streaked away before converting her own try to lock things back up.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was as good as it got for this visitors in the first-half as the flood gates then opened.</p>

            <p>Midfielder Sylvia Brunt kicked off the scoring blitz, busting through the line courtesy of a dominant Ferns' scrum from close range.</p>
        
            <p>Paul was over next as Renee Holmes sent a deft kick ahead for her winger to pounce on.</p>
        
            <p>She bagged a second just moments later, cruising past the last defender as the Ferns' backs ran riot.</p>
        
            <p>Just as the Wallaroos were looking to get back in the contest, Iritana Hohaia made a half break and got an offload away to Mikaele-Tu'u who dashed 30 metres with no-one in front.</p>
        
            <p>The points kept coming, hooker Georgia Ponsonby finishing off some more slick play.</p>
        
            <p>Katelyn Vaha'akolo capped the half with an absolute stunner.</p>
        
            <p>With room to move on the left flank but 75 metres to the line, Vaha'akolo showed her incredible gas to skin her opposite before nailing a perfect chip and regather to saunter around under the posts and give her side a commanding 45-7 halftime advantage.</p>
        
            <p>It took just three minutes of the second for the Ferns to pick up where they left off in the first and post fifty, prop Chryss Viliko rumbling over for a debut try after Ponsonby again went close.</p>
        
            <p>Following confirmation from upstairs, Paul picked up her hat-trick in the right hand corner, deploying some serious strength to get it on the grass.</p>
        
            <p>Maya Stewart pulled one back for the Australians but a quick tap from Hohiah then sent skipper Kennedy Simon over with a nice dummy and step.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie and the Wallaroos kept fighting, the first five grassing it by a finger tip for her second and her side's third.</p>
        
            <p>Following a slight lull in scoring, Simon capped the dominant performance with her second, again showing brute force and determination to get over.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 67 (Paul 3, Simon 2, Brunt, Olsen-Baker, Ponsonby, Mikaele-Tu'u, Vaha'akolo, Viliko, tries, Holmes 6 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Australia 19 (McKenzie 2, Stewart, tries, McKenzie, 2 cons)</p>
