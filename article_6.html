            <p>A setback for the New Zealand track cycling team ahead of the Paris Olympics with Regan Gough announcing his retirement.</p>
        
            <p>Long-term injuries and illness has forced the two-time Olympian to confirm the end of his career after a decade at the pointy end of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>The 27 year old has been a longtime member of the endurance team winning a team pursuit World Championship gold medal in 2015 and silvers in 2017 and 2020.</p>
        
            <p>He was also a member of the puruit team that finished fourth at both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Gough, from a long line of outstanding riders from the Central Hawkes Bay, was the country's most successful junior rider, with six medals at the Junior World Track Championships including rainbow jerseys in the madison (with fellow Hawkes Bay rider, Luke Mudgway) and the points race.</p>
        
            <p>On the track, Gough's unique mix of speed and endurance leant him to a key role as team starter, critical in the recent development in team pursuit which has seen times plummet.</p>
        
            <p>Since the Tokyo games, Gough has battled illness and injury including long Covid, influenza, tonsillitis, bronchitis, sinus infection and appendicitis.</p>
        
            <p>In the end, it proved a bridge too far.</p>
        
            <p>Team-mate Aaron Gate is under no illusions about Gough's contribution.</p>
        
            <p>"Reggie's departure from the sport will leave a big hole in our men's endurance team," said Gate. "He is a phenomenal bloke to have as both a teammate and a mate, and his contribution to our sport cannot be taken lightly.</p>
        
            <p>"His ability to always go above-and-beyond with whatever he puts his mind to, will set him and the young Gough family up for more success in the years to come with whatever endeavours he chases, I am sure."</p>

            <p>While Gough prefers to let his riding do his talking, he said he holds the team pursuit and his Tokyo team with special regard.</p>
        
            <p>"I was motivated by the desire to win," Gough said. "The desire to see the hard work to fruition. I enjoyed the team I was with and we pushed each other day-in, day-out. Lining up with them on race day was pretty cool and motivating.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the team element of a team pursuit. There's no other sport like it. Five or six guys that all get on like brothers. When you line-up for a team pursuit, you are going out there to ride for one another. It is going to hurt like hell but no-one will shy away from that challenge. That motivated me every day. Take rugby for example, there are 15 guys which is a big team. We are much smaller, and tight-knit."</p>
        
            <p>There was also success for Gough on the road, riding for Bolton Equities Black Spoke team and enjoying European experience with An Post Chain Reaction and Avanti Isowhey teams.</p>
        
            <p>He earned podiums at the Tour of Southland, won the national championship time trial, and claimed victories in several stages of the NZ Cycle Classic along with the Green jersey in 2021 plus a stage of An Post Ras in Ireland.</p>
