            <p>Black Ferns 15s and Sevens star Sarah Hirini won't have a crack at another Rugby World Cup title.</p>
        
            <p>Hirini, who won two Rugby World Cups in 2017 and 2022 and is a two-time Olympic gold medallist in sevens, has decided not to make herself available for this year's campaign in England.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old will remain with the Black Ferns Sevens and it seems likely that's where she'll end her career.</p>
        
            <p>While the 17-test player has opted out of the Black Ferns several other Black Ferns Sevens stars have opted in.</p>
        
            <p>Stacey Waaka, Theresa Setefano, Alena Saili, Dhys Faleafaga and Kelsey Teneti, Risi Pouri-Lane and Jorja Miller have put their hands up for Black Ferns selection as they chase a place in the World Cup squad.</p>

            <p>Waaka, Setefano, Saili, Faleafaga and Teneti have all been capped before, with Pouri-Lane and Miller possible debutants.</p>
        
            <p>Saili, Faleafaga, Teneti, Setefano and Pouri-Lane will join the Black Ferns' first camp in April, ruling them out of selection for the final World Sevens Series event of the season in Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>Waaka and Miller will join the Black Ferns squad during the Pacific Four Series against Canada, the US and Australia, which starts in May.</p>

            <p>Black Ferns coach Allan Bunting believes the sevens players will boost the Black Ferns 15s.</p>
        
            <p>"Having the ability to add players into the mix that have a proven ability of winning pinnacle events under pressure is invaluable," Bunting said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to have our best female athletes driving internal competition and striving for selection for World Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns Sevens coach Sweeney said it's in the best interests of both teams to facilitate the switch.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to have the best XVs and Sevens programmes in the world and we can't do that independently," Sweeney said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen real success in the past two World Cup cycles with our players transitioning across to the Black Ferns environment. For the players remaining it will be an exciting opportunity for them to get more game time in Los Angeles and grow on the world stage."</p>
        
            <p>Not included in this list of Black Ferns Sevens players crossing over is Kelly Brazier, who has been released from sevens to play Super Rugby Aupiki and will be available for selection for the Black Ferns at the end of the competition.</p>
