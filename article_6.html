            <p>The White Ferns have snatched a last-gasp three-run T20 international win against England after a late batting collapse by the visitors at Saxton Oval in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>With the dramatic win, New Zealand have bounced back from two defeats to trail England 2-1 as the five-match series moves to Wellington's Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing New Zealand's target of 155 for 3, England were cruising to victory after a breakout innings from Maia Bouchier of 71 off 47 balls, which included 11 fours and one six.</p>
        
            <p>She took her side to 127-2 in the 16th over before hitting out off the bowling of Hannah Rowe.</p>
        
            <p>A game-changing run-out from New Zealand's Amelia Kerr saw the England skipper Heather Knight - the best batter of the series so far - head to the pavilion.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand pulled England back as the visitors lost 6-25 - and the match was set for a tense finish as England needed eight runs off the last over.</p>
        
            <p>White Ferns veteran Suzie Bates was the hero, claiming two wickets for four runs as England fell just shy at 152 for 8.</p>

            <p>Earlier, New Zealand captain Sophie Devine drove an improved New Zealand batting effort.</p>
        
            <p>Devine - captaining the team in T20 internationals for the 50th time - produced a powerful innings of 60 off 37 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Devine came in at 55 for 2 and left after hitting out to a wide full toss from Danielle Gibson off the second to last ball of the innings.</p>
        
            <p>Devine was supported with the bat by Amelia Kerr (44 off 35). Their third-wicket partnership of 99 runs was the second-highest stand by a New Zealand pair against England in a T20.</p>
        
            <p>Opener Bernadine Bezuidenhout scored 34 at the top of the innings to open proceedings for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>The fourth game of five-match series will be played in Wellington on Wednesday.</p>
