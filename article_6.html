            <p>Team New Zealand has scored two more wins in the round-robin phase of the challenger series for the America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>First up opponents Alinghi were disqualified in the day's opening race before the New Zealanders then beat American Magic by 29 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>In the feature race for the challengers, Luna Rossa beat Britannia to remain unbeaten among them after round robin one.</p>
        
            <p>After a few days of bottom end winds that have challenged the teams and the race schedule, winds of 9 to 12 knots were perfect for racing.</p>
        
            <p>The first race was handed to the Kiwis as Alinghi didn't make the start in time due to an equipment issue.</p>
        
            <p>An issue with the mainsail track and the mainsail's bolt-rope at the hoist before the start forced Alinghi to return to inside the harbour walls of Port Vell before towing fast out to the course but missing the start completely.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the Swiss not making it back in time, and being outside of the boundary by 100 metres, the Race Committee announced that they had been disqualified but Alinghi joined in the race against Team New Zealand nonetheless for a short while to test their speed.</p>
        
            <p>In the race against American Magic the start involved a split tack before the New Zealanders crossed in front.</p>
        
            <p>The Americans were in front by 10 seconds at the first mark and it wasn't until the second to last leg that the New Zealanders grabbed the lead and then sailed away to win by 29 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>For the challengers, it is a fight for points at the top of the table, and a battle for survival at the bottom. For Emirates Team New Zealand, every race is valuable.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we had finally figured out our first shift to get the lead, but it kept going left up that first beat. You don't want to be behind, but nice to get an overtake as well," skipper Peter Burling said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the boat was exactly like it had been before it was dropped and needed repairs.</p>
        
            <p>"We are all incredibly fortunate how little damage there actually was. We are just really lucky with where the impact was and that the cradle took a lot of the impact."</p>
        
            <p>There is now just one scheduled day off before the regatta rolls into Round Robin 2 and most teams will elect to take a maintenance day before racing is scheduled to start on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand will defend the America's Cup in October with the top four challengers going to a semi-final series.</p>
