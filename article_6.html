            <p>Auckland FC forward Liam Gillion is the only newcomer in an experienced All Whites squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers.</p>
        
            <p>Gillion, 22, has impressed in the new club's unbeaten start to the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Darren Bazeley has named a full-strength squad for their two home qualifiers against Vanuatu in Hamilton (15 November), and Samoa at Mount Smart in Auckland (18 November).</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-four players have been named with Joe Bell, Callum McCowatt, Sarpreet Singh, and Finn Surman back after not being part of the team that won both October fixtures against Tahiti and Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a return for Auckland FC defender Francis de Vries having not featured for the last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is the absolute priority for us, so we have named the strongest side we can for these games," Bazeley said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is always special to name a player for their debut, but Liam Gillion has earned his call-up after some really impressive performances for Auckland FC to start his professional career.</p>
        
            <p>"It is getting more and more challenging to select an All Whites squad with the amount of players around the world now pushing for selection, but these are the kinds of challenges you want as a coach."</p>
