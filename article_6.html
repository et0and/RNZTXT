            <p>Major clubs and leagues across Europe rejected the Super League in favour of the status quo following Friday's EU court verdict which said UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law by preventing the formation of a Super League.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester United were one of the first to say they remain committed to playing in competitions run by Europe's soccer governing body UEFA, as did German giants Bayern Munich.</p>
        
            <p>United were one of the 12 clubs involved in the formation of the breakaway Super League in April 2021 but pulled out due to pressure from fans, governments and players.</p>
        
            <p>"Our position has not changed. We remain fully committed to participation in UEFA competitions, and to positive cooperation with UEFA, the Premier League, and fellow clubs through the ECA on the continued development of the European game," the club said.</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal were the other five Premier League clubs involved before pulling out.</p>
        
            <p>Two months after the six English clubs pulled out of the project in 2021, they said they would offer a combined 22 million pounds ($27.78 million) as "a gesture of goodwill" to go towards the good of the game, including new investment to support fans, grassroots football and community programmes.</p>
        
            <p>The Premier League said they would face a 30-point deduction if they attempt a similar move in future and each would be fined 25 million pounds for any such breakaway attempt.</p>
        
            <p>"The ruling does not endorse the so-called "European Super League" and the Premier League continues to reject any such concept," the Premier League said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Supporters are of vital importance to the game and they have time and again made clear their opposition to a 'breakaway' competition that severs the link between domestic and European football."</p>
        
            <p>In its ruling the EU's top court said that FIFA and UEFA abused their dominant position by forbidding clubs to compete in a European Super League (ESL), although that project may still not be approved as the court did not rule on it specifically.</p>
        
            <p>Sports development company A22, which was formed to assist creating the ESL, had claimed UEFA and global soccer governing body FIFA held a monopoly position which was in breach of the European Union's Competition and Free Movement Law.</p>
        
            <p>"We have won the right to compete. The UEFA-monopoly is over. Football is free," said A22 CEO Bernd Reichart.</p>
        
            <p>"Clubs are now free from the threat of sanction and free to determine their own futures," Reichard added in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The ruling came as the International Skating Union lost its bid to overturn an EU antitrust order that it stop penalising speed skaters for taking part in new money-spinning events.</p>
        
            <p>Belgian soccer club Royal Antwerp had also challenged UEFA's rules on homegrown players, which the court said could be contrary to EU law.</p>
        
            <p>The court's ruling said FIFA and UEFA must "comply with the competition rules and respect the freedoms of movement".</p>
        
            <p>"Their rules on approval, control and sanctions must be held to be unjustified restrictions on the freedom to provide services," it added.</p>
        
            <p>"That does not mean that a competition such as the Super League project must necessarily be approved. The Court, having been asked generally about the FIFA and UEFA rules, does not rule on that specific project in its judgment," it concluded.</p>
        
            <p>DOOR CLOSED</p>
        
            <p>Bayern Munich said they were committed to UEFA competitions, saying the door for the Super League "remains closed" for the German champions.</p>
        
            <p>"The Bundesliga is the foundation of FC Bayern, just as all national leagues are the foundation of other European football clubs," Bayern CEO Jan Christian Dreesen said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is therefore our duty and our deep conviction to strengthen them, not to weaken them. We are also committed to the European club competitions under the umbrella of UEFA."</p>
        
            <p>The German Football League (DFL), which is in charge of the Bundesliga, said it "explicitly supports the European sports model and rejects competitions outside those competitions organised by the federations and the leagues".</p>
        
            <p>The European Club Association (ECA), which represents nearly 500 clubs across the continent, said the football world had "moved on from the Super League years ago".</p>
        
            <p>"Through ECA, clubs today are already at the heart of decision-making in relation to the competitions they participate in," the ECA said.</p>
        
            <p>"Most importantly, football is a social contract not a legal contract.</p>
        
            <p>"All the recognised stakeholders... spanning confederations, federations, clubs, leagues, players and fans stand more united than ever against the attempts by a few individuals pursuing personal agendas to undermine the very foundations and basic principles of European football."</p>
        
            <p>France's Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) said it "unequivocally supports" competitions organised by UEFA.</p>
