            <p>The Wellington Phoenix women's footballers have started 2025 in fine style, with a two-nil win over Perth in their A-League encounter in Porirua this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>After a tight first half which saw the teams go the half-time break locked up at nil, the Phoenix pounced just two minutes into the second half with a fine long-range solo goal from New Zealand international Grace Jale.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old's strike was from 25 metres, as she placed it expertly past the outstretched hand of Perth goalkeeper Casey Dumont.</p>
        
            <p>The goal was Jale's second of the season, following her first against Sydney just before Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix doubled their lead in the 69th minute, after Olivia Fergusson headed home a delightful cross from Lara Wall.</p>
        
            <p>It was a classy finish from the Phoenix striker, who has now scored in consecutive matches for the team.</p>
        
            <p>Perth were unlucky not to get one back near the end, with a spectacular long range strike from Miku Sunaga thundering into the crossbar.</p>
        
            <p>But it was to be the Phoenix's day as they closed out the victory, which was their fourth in their last six matches.</p>
        
            <p>The mid-season run has seen them surge into fifth place on the ladder, after starting the season with three straight losses.</p>
