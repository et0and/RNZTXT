            <p>Former Wales test halfback Rhys Webb has been banned for four years by the French Anti-Doping Agency.</p>
        
            <p>Webb was suspended soon after joining second tier French side Biarritz last summer after returning a positive test for human growth hormone (HGH) during a training session.</p>
        
            <p>Both A and B samples came back positive.</p>
        
            <p>Webb will now be ineligible to play until 2027, meaning he will be 38 by the time the ban runs it course.</p>
        
            <p>Biarritz have been asked to comment.</p>
        
            <p>Webb's international debut came in 2012 and he was selected for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, playing in two tests.</p>
        
            <p>Webb won 40 caps for Wales before announcing his international retirement in the build-up to the 2023 Rugby World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The move away from Wales saw him become the highest profile victim of the Welsh Rugby Union's previous 60-cap rule.</p>
        
            <p>Webb left his second season at Toulon early after agreeing to re-join Ospreys in December 2019 and went on to surpass 200 appearances for the Welsh region.</p>
