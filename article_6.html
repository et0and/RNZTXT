            <p>TJ Perenara has come out in support of the Hurricanes Poua following the controversy over the Aupiki's side's haka, saying he backs his female clubmates and their stance.</p>
        
            <p>"I share similar views to our women and what was said. I back our women, I stand with our women," Perenara said at the Hurricanes' NZCIS training base on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We use haka to express ourselves for whatever emotion we are feeling."</p>
        
            <p>The Poua's haka in round one of Super Rugby Aupiki against Chiefs Manawa made reference to "puppets of the redneck government".</p>
        
            <p>It caused widespread debate that reached all the way to Parliament, with deputy prime minister Winston Peters criticising the Poua's decision to make a statement through their haka. The following weekend in Wellington, the side performed another haka with references to the government and to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>

            <p>Poua head coach Ngatai Walker said "there may be misinterpretation of individual words".</p>
        
            <p>"The intent of the meaning is, 'Aotearoa unite, Hurutearangi (female god of the wind) has arrived; challenges may come and go, but we will endure'."</p>
        
            <p>In their next match in Auckland against the Blues Women, the Poua did not perform a haka at all, saying that the players had made a decision not to.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara, who has been kaea (leader) of the All Black haka for much of his 80-test career, has shown support for wider causes in the past, notably in 2019 when he wore a wristband with 'Ihumātao' written on it during a Bledisloe Cup test and visiting the site of the protest aimed at stopping a planned housing development.</p>
        
            <p>"Haka is something that us as Māori use as a way to express ourselves ... whether that's through celebration, frustration," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people who have spoken on haka only want to see one side of haka. They say I want this side but you can't do it for that reason, and that's not okay to me."</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old made his comeback in the Hurricanes' 29-21 win over the Blues in round three of Super Rugby Pacific, after a 17-month break due to a serious Achilles tendon injury picked up in the All Blacks' final test of the 2022 season against England.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara scored his 59th career Super Rugby try in the Hurricanes' win over the Rebels in Palmerston North on Friday, putting him in third on the competition's all-time leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes face the Highlanders this Saturday evening in Dunedin, while the Poua travel to Christchurch to play defending champions Matatū on Friday afternoon.</p>
