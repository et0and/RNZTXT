        <h2>Is the NRL too long?</h2>
        <p>
"It's quite a slog." Warriors and Kiwis fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad wants to see a shorter NRL season.

            <p>Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad's wishlist for 2025 is a short one: Fewer NRL games, more test matches.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors and Kiwis fullback is the latest voice to join a growing chorus calling for a restructured rugby league season.</p>
        
            <p>"The suggestion of bringing the games back a little bit would be nice, [the NRL is] quite a slog," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"But you look at it both ways, and being part of the NRL is a dream come true so you can't really look at it in too much of a bad light, because it's a blessing to put the Warriors jersey on and the Kiwis."</p>
        
            <p>Manly five-eighth Luke Brooks played the most NRL minutes this season at 2015, almost 34 hours. Conversely, the most time played in Super Rugby was Hoskins Sotutu's 1198 minutes (just under 20 hours) for the Blues.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will play just two tests this year, against Australia and Tonga, one fewer than in 2023. The All Blacks meanwhile will end 2024 having played 14 test matches.</p>
        
            <p>Nicoll-Klokstad said the season schedule as it stood took a toll on players' bodies, and he would like to see it shortened in favour of more tests.</p>
        
            <p>"How many byes do we get? I'd say closer to 20 to be honest, something less, it is too long."</p>

            <p>Kiwis coach Stacey Jones concurred, and said with the speed of collisions having significantly increased since he retired as a player in 2009, players need a longer break.</p>
        
            <p>"NRL seasons are very tough. I'd love to see a bigger international window, I know our players are crying out for it."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said there was already an option during the Origin period for more international rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"When the players see Origin happening, they are sitting in the background. We have the best players in the world sitting at home, it's an opportunity for us to play more."</p>

            <p>Nicoll-Klokstad wanted to see the ANZAC test resurrected.</p>
        
            <p>"That would bring us into camp again and allow us to bond in the middle of the year, and not just the end."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said it was disappointing to see a dearth of tests despite a rise in global competition, particularly from the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"With Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, the Cook Islands, there are a lot more players available now, those teams are growing so that gives an opportunity for more test matches."</p>
        
            <p>In a further blow to the Kiwis jersey, they were now also losing players to State of Origin on eligibility. Storm winger Jack Howarth, who has played for both the Kiwis A and MƒÅori All-Stars sides, has pledged his allegiance to New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously disappointing - we want every player that is eligible to be part of the Kiwis, but you have to remember that these players that choose Origin, that's where they grew up, so that's been their pathway, and we can't do anything about that.</p>
        
            <p>"All we can do is hope that they do want to be part of the Kiwis - the door will always be open, but it is a tough one for us."</p>
