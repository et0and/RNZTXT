            <p>An own goal by Jakub Kiwior and a thumping late strike by Luis Diaz sealed a 2-0 victory for Liverpool at Arsenal in the weekend's headline FA Cup third round tie as the hosts' dismal form extended into the New Year.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal wasted a sackful of chances in the first half and were made to pay as Liverpool skipper Trent Alexander-Arnold's free kick glanced off the head of Kiwior in the 80th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Diaz then made sure of eight-time winners Liverpool's place in the fourth round draw as he lashed home in stoppage time.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Sunday holders Manchester City romped to a 5-0 victory over second-tier Huddersfield Town with Phil Foden scoring twice and Belgian playmaker Kevin De Bruyne returning to action after a four-month injury layoff.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal have now lost three games in a row in all competitions and their wayward finishing was evident again as they squandered a flurry of first-half chances.</p>
        
            <p>Reiss Nelson latched on to a punt forward by Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale in the fourth minute but could only shoot into the side netting and captain Martin Odegaard then rattled the crossbar with a fierce drive after a mistake by Joe Gomez.</p>
        
            <p>Kai Havertz could not capitalise on two good chances as Arsenal failed to punish a lacklustre Liverpool, although Alexander-Arnold did hit the crossbar for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal continued to make chances in the second half with Bukayo Saka volleying clumsily over from Declan Rice's cross.</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool then woke up with Ramsdale saving from Diaz and Diogo Jota heading against the crossbar before the unfortunate Kiwior inadvertently glanced in Alexander-Arnold's free kick.</p>
        
            <p>Backed by 7,000 visiting fans, Liverpool then wrapped it up as Diaz slammed an unstoppable shot past Ramsdale.</p>
        
            <p>"We changed things around at halftime internally, and we came out and played football and created chances," Alexander-Arnold said. "There were times in the first half that we were a little bit naive ... We hit the woodwork a couple of times, so we've had our chances, and towards the end, we put them away."</p>
        
            <p>DE BRUYNE BACK</p>
        
            <p>City suffered a setback when they lost defender Manuel Akanji to injury early on and Huddersfield were proving stubborn until Foden fired them ahead and Julian Alvarez poked home a second before the interval.</p>
        
            <p>De Bruyne entered the fray in the 57th minute and City added their third a minute later as Norwegian winger Oscar Bobb tried to pick out the Belgian at the far post, only to see his deflected cross loop into the net to make it 3-0.</p>
        
            <p>Foden added his second with a precise shot and De Bruyne teed up fellow substitute Jeremy Doku to complete the rout.</p>
        
            <p>"We are incredibly delighted to have him back, because Kevin helps to win games. It is so important to have him back after a long injury," Guardiola told the BBC.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere Luton Town played out a scoreless draw at home against Bolton Wanderers, and Nottingham Forest were held to a 2-2 draw at the City Ground by Blackpool while West Ham United and Bristol City ended in a 1-1 stalemate.</p>
        
            <p>Leeds United had no such problems as striker Patrick Bamford netted a brilliant volley in a 3-0 hammering of Peterborough United, and West Bromwich Albion cruised to a 4-1 win at home to Aldershot Town.</p>
