            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have suffered a narrow loss to Australia in the final of the women's Dubai Sevens, while the All Blacks Sevens men's team have lost their playoff for third place.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were down 21-12 at the halftime break in the women's final, with Jorja Miller and Risi Pouri-Lane scoring tries, but a brilliant comeback featuring tries from Theresa Setefano and Manaia Nuku saw them holding a three point lead with two minutes go.</p>
        
            <p>However, their attempt to seal the victory went awry with Maddison Levi snatching an intercept for Australia and racing some 80 metres to put Australia back in front.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens threw everything in the dying minutes but conceded a late breakdown penalty and Australia started celebrating as they booted the ball into touch.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders had beaten Ireland 33-12 in the quarter-finals and France 28-14 in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji won the men's final, proving too strong for Spain 19-5.</p>
        
            <p>It was the Spaniards who knocked the All Blacks Sevens out of the final, with a 19-14 victory in the semis, after earlier beating them in pool play.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders were then outplayed by Argentina 14-0 in the play-off for third, leaving them fourth on the standings after the opening round of the series.</p>
