            <p>New Zealand weightlifter David Liti could be one step closer to qualifying for the Paris Olympics next year after winning gold at the Pacific Games in Solomon Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Competing in the +109Kg category the 26-year-old set two new Pacific Games records with 182 Kgs in the snatch and 223 Kgs in the clean and jerk for a total of 405Kgs.</p>
        
            <p>Liti won gold for the snatch, gold for the clean and jerk and gold for the overall lift.</p>
        
            <p>The result could go towards his qualification for the Olympics in Paris next year depending on how other competitors around the world are doing.</p>
        
            <p>Liti said he only needed to do one more qualifying event this year but may do two as he needs to be ranked in the top 10 in the world to go through.</p>
        
            <p>His main competitor from the Oceania region is Sanele Mao from Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>Liti was also the New Zealand team flagbearer at the Games.</p>
