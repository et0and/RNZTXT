            <p>The first T20 international between Pakistan and New Zealand in Rawalpindi has been abandoned due to rain.</p>
        
            <p>The match was delayed by more than two hours before officials decided to start a five-over game. However it lasted just two deliveries before the rain started to fall again.</p>
        
            <p>Debutant Tim Robinson was bowled by Shaheen Shah Afridi for a duck, and straight afterwards the players left the field for good.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Seifert was the other opener. New Zealand was 2/1 with two leg byes.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell won the toss at the scheduled time and decided to bat, but rain prevented them from starting on time.</p>
        
            <p>The eleven named were Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Jacob Duffy, Dean Foxcroft, Ben Lister, James Neesham, Tim Robinson, Ben Sears, Tim Seifert (wk) and Ish Sodhi.</p>
        
            <p>The second of five T20s is scheduled for Rawalpindi on Sunday morning (NZ time).</p>
