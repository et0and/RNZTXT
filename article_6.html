            <p>Stephen Curry became the first player in NBA history to make 4,000 career 3-pointers, as his Golden State Warriors extended their winning streak to a season-best six games.</p>
        
            <p>Curry nailed the historic shot in the third quarter of a 130-104 victory over the Sacramento Kings in San Francisco, a day before his 37th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Fans jumped to their feet and roared after Curry made the shot, and a tribute played on the big screen during a timeout shortly after, which included a congratulatory message from former Warriors big man Andris Biedrins of Latvia, who dished out the assist on Curry's very first 3-pointer 16 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Curry finished with 11 points for the Warriors, who led wire-to-wire and had eight players score in double figures.</p>
        
            <p>His longtime teammate Draymond Green made four 3-pointers and scored a season-high 23 points, as the Warriors won for the 13th time in their past 15 games, shooting 57.7 percent from the field, including 22 of 39 (56.4 percent) from 3-point range.</p>
        
            <p>The win has the Warriors lying sixth in the Western Conference standings with a 38-28 record.</p>
