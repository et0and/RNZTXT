            <p>The top eight teams in each series now head to a winner takes all "Grand Final" tournament in Madrid at the end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>In a thrilling conclusion to the tightest women's series in history, it all came down to the very last game, contested by the two sides locked on 106 points each at the top of the standings.</p>
        
            <p>However, a depleted Australia could not reply to a ferocious Black Ferns Sevens performance, including a hat-trick from Michaela Blyde, their fourth successive tournament gold confirming their place at the top of the regular season standings.</p>
        
            <p>Hattrick hero Blyde said: "It means a lot! The beginning of the season was a little bit rocky for us, so we didn't want to think too far ahead for this tournament but Singapore has just brought incredible vibes and to come away with the Singapore title and the league winners is really special.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just been taking it game by game, we wanted to make sure that we treated every game like it was our last and I think we did do that. There were some times when we were inconsistent and challenged but we were able to turn that around and gain the momentum back and to gain the six wins here. To sum it up, I'm really proud."</p>
        
            <p>The men's regular season also concluded in Singapore after seven highly competitive rounds as New Zealand edged Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina had to dig deep and find a way to win 14-10 over South Africa in the fifth-place play-off, coming back from 10-0 down at the break to secure their first-ever series win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been such a long time. So many moments, good and bad," reflected Argentina's Gast√≥n Revol, who debuted for his country back in 2009, on winning the title.</p>
        
            <p>"The journey was really difficult. We kept on trying, kept on training, kept on believing in this team and I think we have the prize that we deserve. It's incredible to be here at this moment. Here and in every other tournament at my age, I'm 37 years old and I'm still here with these guys, these great players."</p>
        
            <p>The men's Grand Final competition will involve Argentina, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, France, Fiji, South Africa and Great Britain, while the USA, Spain, Samoa and Canada will contest the promotion and relegation competition.</p>
        
            <p>The women's Grand Final teams are New Zealand, Australia, France, USA, Canada, Fiji, Ireland and Great Britain, as Japan, Brazil, South Africa and Spain head into the promotion and relegation competition.</p>
