            <p>The Silver Ferns have avoided a clean sweep by England in the Taini Jamison Trophy netball series, winning the final test 61-56.</p>
        
            <p>England claimed the trophy by virtue of their wins in Auckland and Porirua, but the Silver Ferns toughed out the third test, maintaining their unbeaten run against the English in Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>Faced with trying to avoid the first 3-0 home series at home since Australia beat them in 1998, the Silver Ferns buckled down, finally putting in a cohesive performance despite some jitters late in the third quarter.</p>
        
            <p>They led 18-16 at the first break, but were down 27-25 midway through the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Then came a decisive period of just over five minutes where they hit back, with Maddy Gordon setting the attack alight, firing in slick passes to shooters Grace Nweke and Ameliaranne Ekenasio, while down the other end of the court Kelly Jackson disrupted the England shooters to such an extent they did not score for just over five minutes.</p>
        
            <p>It was 32-28 to New Zealand at halftime, and at one stage in the third quarter they held a six-point advantage, but England surged back and only trailed by just one goal, 47-46, heading into the final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders regrouped for the start of the last stage, at one point establishing a seven-point break before the English fought back, but the Silver Ferns' nerves held.</p>
        
            <p>They were not going to lose this one and they won it with the starting seven finishing the job.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns wing defence Karin Burger was thrilled with the win after the side lost by one point in Auckland and then four in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been coming, it's been building the last couple of games," she told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really good to see we pulled our mana together and everybody just gelled really well. I felt we were really well connected and even our bench was really loud.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just glad it came together in the last game."</p>
        
            <p>England captain Fran Williams said it was special for ''us as a nation'' to win the series.</p>
        
            <p>"That was something we were really looking to achieve and I am just so proud of how the girls have handled themselves across after what has been a long tour for us and shown up at every test match, giving their all," she said on Sky.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said they were disappointed with the third test loss and paid credit to New Zealand. "They really came out and had a good game plan to be able to beat us today."</p>
