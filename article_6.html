            <p>Two late penalty corner goals helped New Zealand beat Italy 3-0 in their opening match the women's Olympic hockey qualifying tournament in Ranchi, India.</p>
        
            <p>Frances Davies scored a brace off penalty corners and either end of the game and Stephanie Dickins struck the third with a direct attempt off a short corner as New Zealand started their campaign on winning note.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand dominated possession and 15 shots on target compared to Italy's two but struggled with their finishing in general play against a resilient defence.</p>
        
            <p>Experienced defender Davies found the scoresheet in the seventh minute off a rebound but they failed to score again until their late double.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's second game on Monday morning is against hosts India before they round out group play against the United States.</p>
        
            <p>The top two teams from two groups of four advance to the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>From there, three teams will book their ticket to Paris - the two finalists and the winners of the third-fourth playoff.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Sticks men begin their equivalent campaign in Muscat, Oman against Chile on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Germany and Canada are their other opponents in the group stage.</p>
