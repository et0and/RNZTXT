            <p>World number one Jannik Sinner has accepted an immediate three-month doping ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said they had reached a settlement on his period of ineligibility, allowing him to return before the French Open in May.</p>
        
            <p>WADA had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear Sinner of wrongdoing after the three-times major winner failed drug tests.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner, who successfully defended his Australian Open crown last month, had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol which the 23-year-old said had entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner's ban began on 9 February and will end on 4 May, while he can return to training on 13 April. The French Open is scheduled to begin on 25 May.</p>
        
            <p>"WADA confirms that it has entered into a case resolution agreement in the case of Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner, with the player accepting a three-month period of ineligibility for an anti-doping rule violation," WADA said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"WADA accepts that Mr Sinner did not intend to cheat and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit and took place without his knowledge as the result of negligence of members of his entourage.</p>
        
            <p>"However, under the Code and by virtue of CAS precedent, an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage's negligence."</p>
        
            <p>The case was set to be heard by CAS in April and Sinner was in danger of being banned for up to two years.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner will miss Masters tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo and Madrid.</p>
        
            <p>WADA has formally withdrawn its appeal to CAS after they reached a settlement while they did not seek disqualification of his results.</p>
        
            <p>"This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year," Sinner said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise WADA's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love.</p>
        
            <p>"On that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3 month sanction."</p>
        
            <p>The ATP said it acknowledged the resolution of Sinner's case following his agreement with WADA.</p>
        
            <p>"This case is an important reminder of players' responsibility to carefully manage the products and treatments they or their entourages use," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner is the second high-ranked player to accept a doping ban in recent months after world number two Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension in November having tested positive for banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ).</p>
        
            <p>Swiatek had been provisionally suspended from September 12 until October 4, missing three tournaments as a result while she also forfeited prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner's lawyer Jamie Singer said WADA had confirmed the facts determined by the independent tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation," Singer said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the decision did not go down well with the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), an organisation established by Novak Djokovic.</p>
        
            <p>"The 'system' is not a system. It's a club. Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings," the PTPA said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just the different results for different players. It's the lack of transparency. The lack of process. The lack of consistency...</p>
        
            <p>"This bias is unacceptable for all athletes and shows a deep disrespect for every sport and its fans."</p>
        
            <p>Australian Nick Kyrgios, who had previously said the two doping incidents were 'disgusting' for the sport, said it was a "sad day for tennis" after several other players received longer bans for similar positive tests.</p>
        
            <p>Former world number one Simona Halep had questioned the "big difference" in how doping cases are treated after she was banned despite strongly denying knowingly taking the banned substance roxadustat.</p>
        
            <p>Halep was initially banned for four years, a period later reduced to nine months after an appeal.</p>
        
            <p>However, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation president Angelo Binaghi said Sinner would be welcomed with open arms at the Italian Open, which begins in Rome three days after his ban ends.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first time that a shameful injustice makes us happy because our first thought is for the boy who sees the end of a nightmare," Binaghi said.</p>
