            <p>New Zealand's favourite sports will be on offer this weekend in Auckland, with both rugby codes, cricket and a potential football blockbuster laying the platform for four days of thrills.</p>
        
            <p>Tāmaki Makaurau will first host an international cricket double-header at Eden Park, with the White Ferns kicking off proceedings at 2.45pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will host tourists Australia in their T20 series-opener, in the first match of three, fresh off of a 1-1 result with Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps will then look to wrap up their T20 series against Pakistan, after two comfortable wins in their previous two outings. The match gets underway at 7.15pm.</p>

            <p>Further south, Moana Pasifika will host their first game of the season in Pukekohe], when they tackle Super Rugby Pacific's top-of-the-table Chiefs at 7.05pm.</p>
        
            <p>Their task made even harder without talismanic captain Ardie Savea, who has been ruled out with a hamstring injury sustained in his side's win over the Hurricanes two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Just up the road, the Warriors will host NRL's round two surprise package - the Sydney Roosters - at Go Media Stadium at 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster has named an unchanged side, as the Warriors look to extend their winning streak at home against a team that is coming off a stunning victory over the Penrith Panthers.</p>
        
            <p>Moving to Saturday, Super Rugby's greatest showdown kicks off at Eden Park at 7.05pm, as the Blues take on rivals, the Crusaders.</p>

            <p>The reigning champion Blues have made a horror start to defending their crown, with just one win from their opening five matches.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Crusaders have enjoyed a much better 2025 season, having notched three wins from a possible four - just one fewer than they won all of last year.</p>
        
            <p>Switching to football, the All Whites could potentially wrap up four days of sporting festivities in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand need to beat Fiji in their FIFA World Cup Oceania playoff semi-final tonight to book their spot in Monday night's showdown at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Should they do so, they will play the winners of the other semi-final between New Caledonia and Tahiti.</p>

            <p>The victor will gain an automatic spot at the finals in North America next year, which would be New Zealand's first appearance at the tournament since 2010.</p>
        
            <p>If it couldn't get any better, the weekend's weather looks to be playing ball as well, with mostly sun expected to shine on Tāmaki Makaurau.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has forecast clear skies for both Friday and Saturday, with temperatures expected to reach a warm 25C.</p>
        
            <p>Monday should provide for a bit more cloud cover, but with only a chance of a shower, it isn't expected to rain on the All Whites' parade.</p>
