            <p>A forward, a midfielder and a goalkeeper have been called up to the Football Ferns for the first time as the side builds towards the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Perth Glory forward Kelli Brown, Melbourne Victory goalkeeper Geo Candy, and FFC Turbine Potsdam midfielder Maya Hahn, who recently committed to play for New Zealand at senior international level, have been included in the 23-player squad for matches against Costa Rica later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Football Ferns interim head coach Michael Mayne has worked with the trio previously when he was an assistant coach of the bronze medal-winning team at the 2018 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix's Manaia Elliott and Feyenoord's Emma Pijnenburg have also been named as uncapped players who have yet to take the field for the Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a thorough process since taking this role on after the Olympics and I have spent the time connecting with our wider squad of around 40 players to understand how we can start this cycle and make sure we have clarity on where we are at, and where we need to be, by the time the team hits Brazil in 2027," Mayne said.</p>
        
            <p>Players from the Olympics that Mayne has not called on for the upcoming games included captain Ali Riley who was still working back to full fitness after missing the Olympics, Ally Green who has just joined Canadian club Calgary Wild and goalkeeper Anna Leat who has left English club Aston Villa by mutual consent to be closer to family in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"As this is the start of a new cycle it is an opportunity to test some new and more inexperienced players, and there is a great opportunity for those selected for this tour to show me where their strengths lie and how that will support the team getting success on the pitch," Mayne said.</p>
        
            <p>"The priority remains to put us in the best place to win games and get out of the group at the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027, and this is a great opportunity to begin creating some competition for positions.</p>
        
            <p>"The team will be playing regularly in the build-up to the next World Cup so there are ample opportunities for a range of players to be involved early in the cycle.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make sure that come the next major tournament we have tested a number of options and systems that allow us to be more threatening on the pitch, more exciting on the ball, and be a team that looks and feels different in the way we win games."</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns play Costa Rica (FIFA rank 43) on Sunday 23 February at 1pm and Wednesday 26 February at 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Both games will be played at Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto in Alajuela, Costa Rica.</p>
