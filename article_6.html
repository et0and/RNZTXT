            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson spun his car but managed to record a respectable time on the first day of Formula 1 pre-season testing in Bahrain.</p>
        
            <p>Involved in the morning session, Lawson spun his new RB21, but was second fastest in the session, behind Mercede's Andrea Kimi Antonelli.</p>

            <p>Lawson completed 58 laps and finished eighth fastest overall at the end of the day.</p>
        
            <p>"I had so much fun out there today and it was so good to finally drive the new car properly and do some laps," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels okay but obviously it is very early days, so it's very much about learning at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, there is a lot more to come because I need to learn a lot moving teams. But from a team side we are just trying to learn about the new car, and optimise these testing days. We had a plan of test items, and we managed to go through the whole plan, which is always good.</p>
        
            <p>"We go into tomorrow with a lot more running and a better idea of where to improve the car. It's hard to tell where we are in terms of pace but the car feels good to drive and comfortable."</p>
        
            <p>The afternoon session was interrupted by a power cut, but the session was extended with McLaren's Lando Norris going fastest, more than a second quicker than Lawson managed earlier in the day.</p>
        
            <p>Mercede's George Russell was second fastest with Lawson's Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen third and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Briton Lewis Hamilton was 13th fastest on the day in his new Ferrari.</p>
        
            <p>Teams have three days of testing in Bahrain before the 24-race season starts in Australia on 16 March.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson is scheduled to test all day on Friday with Verstappen taking over on the third and final day.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen is aiming for a fifth consecutive drivers' title, while McLaren will defend its constructors title.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the FIA has confirmed that the Monaco Grand Prix will include a mandatory two stops in an attempt to promote better racing at the principality.</p>
