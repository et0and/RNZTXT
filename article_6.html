        <h2>All Blacks coach pays tribute to departing veterans Cane and Perenara</h2>

            <p>Two long-serving All Blacks, one a soon-to-be centurion, will play their final tests on New Zealand soil this weekend - and coach Scott Robertson believes they'll both leave a lasting legacy.</p>
        
            <p>Former captain Sam Cane will start at openside in his 100th test, while halfback TJ Perenara takes over from Cortez Ratima in the run on side to take on the Wallabies in Saturday night's second Bledisloe Cup test in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Cane, who will retire from international rugby at the end of the season, has worked his way back into the side after injury initially kept last year's World Cup skipper out of the All Blacks. He has started the last three tests after taking his opportunity when Dalton Papali'i was injured.</p>

            <p>Robertson said Cane has been a great leader, a great player and a great servant of New Zealand rugby and said he's been a positive if stern influence in the All Blacks camp.</p>
        
            <p>"He'll say things others won't. He's a bit of a sheriff, he's got it in the holster and he'll bang, he'll fire and say 'this is how it is and I'm going to call you out, this is the All Blacks standard'," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"His ability to [play] week after week in a tough position. He's broken his neck, he's bounced back. He's consistent on the field. But the leadership part for me is something I really respect. He's been great for us in our environment and he's performed more importantly.</p>
        
            <p>"He knows his way around the field. He's got a good GPS on him, he turns up in the right positions, you saw him get that hard ball on the ground last week against Aussie. He anticipates the game really well and he reads it and that's what we need around that leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great we can give him 100 [tests] off the back of playing well and over his 10-odd year career."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the week, Cane, who debuted in 2012, revealed that he didn't think he would make it to 100 tests.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to put into words - you need a bit of luck along the way to get to 100," Cane said.</p>
        
            <p>"The first 50 [tests] sort of came reasonably quickly without too much trouble. This next 50 I've had to be patient. It's tested me a little more. A few road bumps, but it will be really nice to look back on in time and join that club.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really grateful for the opportunities that rugby has given me on the field, but also the opportunity to grow up as a man from the 20-year-old making his debut and not knowing much about anything to now being 32 and constantly learning and evolving. It's been awesome."</p>

            <p>Perenara is heading to Japan at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on an All Blacks career that has spanned a decade since his debut in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said the Porirua and Mana College product, of Ngāti Rangitihi and Te Arawa, means a lot to the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"TJ is a character. He has a hell of a personality. Hugely proud and proud of his culture. He's someone that speaks what he thinks and he's been a great All Black. He's performed over a long period of time, he's come back from injuries and the fortitude he's shown, you've got to give it to him, he fights back and he's All Black tough.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a competitor and a winner and it's great to have been part of his career and see how much it means to him as an All Black and how much he's given to this team."</p>
        
            <p>A born and bred Wellingtonian, Perenara knows it will be an emotional experience on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>"Means a lot. Home is always going to be home. Every opportunity we get to put on the black jersey we're grateful for but to be able to do it at home in front of your friends and family and the fans that I've played for for my whole career is pretty special."</p>
