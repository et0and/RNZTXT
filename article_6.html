            <p>Analysis: NZ Warriors head into a bye week in ideal fashion, stringing together their third straight victory with a 26-24 comeback over resurgent Wests Tigers at Campbelltown.</p>
        
            <p>After dispatching two perennial premiership contenders in Manly Sea Eagles and Sydney Roosters, they had to pull out all stops to overcome the perennial wooden-spoon contenders, who look a very different proposition with Kiwis legend Benji Marshall at the helm.</p>
        
            <p>Played in heavy rain, the contest again tested the Warriors resolve, but they showed they had the ability - and durability - to come over the top of their opponents late.</p>
        
            <p>Here's some lessons from the encounter:</p>
        
            <p>After beating the Roosters, coach Andrew Webster explained how the Warriors' overwhelming territory advantage did not produced immediate points, but had the affect of wearing down the opposition to pay dividends late in the contest.</p>
        
            <p>On that occasion, they trailled 6-4 until the 65th minute, before back-to-back tries put them clear.</p>
        
            <p>This was a duplicate of that recipe, as the Warriors fell six points behind midway through the second half, but came over the top in the final 10 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"There were moments that were our best performance of the year and there were moments which were our worst," Webster reflected. "Super proud we found a way and we are finding a way at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"We found a way to lose the tight ones last year and, so far, we're finding a way to win them."</p>
        
            <p>Before kickoff, Wests were rocked by the loss of centre Adam Doueihi, whose promising career has been hampered by injury and took another setback with a groin tweak in warm-ups. Luckily, they carried Jack Bird on the bench - a versatile player more than capable of filling the void.</p>
        
            <p>They were thrown into further disarray, when forward Sione Fainu (knee) and winger Sunia Turuva (HIA) left the field within seconds of each other, as Warriors second-rower Marata Niukore scored in the confusion.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors probably should have taken better advantage of that situation, but with forwards filling the Tigers backline, the home side were able to score again to draw level before halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Turuva passed his head check and returned, but co-captain Jarome Luai also seemed to suffer an arm injury that hampered him over the final stages, so he may well pop up in the casualty ward this week.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Ed Kosi was called up as a late replacement, after centre Rocco Berry was ruled out 24 hours before kickoff, running 19 times for 207 metres - 61 off kick returns and 65 after tackles.</p>
        
            <p>He briefly left the field for a head check, leaving the Warriors with the same alignment that filled in, when Roger Tuivasa-Sheck suffered his hamstring injury last week - Adam Pompey to the wing and Kurt Capewell to centre.</p>
        
            <p>Berry earned his call-up with outstanding form in NSW Cup and has a chance to return against Melbourne Storm in two weeks, but Kosi certainly let no-one down with his performance and Webster would feel comfortable with him as an option during Tuivasa-Sheck's two-month absence.</p>

            <p>When the Warriors announced the departure of utility Dylan Walker during the week, Webster indicated his absence would provide opportunities for the squad's younger players to step into more prominent roles.</p>
        
            <p>Halasima seems like the immediate beneficiary and again proved a handful for tiring opponents over the final half hour of a contest.</p>
        
            <p>He emerged as the unlikely hero, when he received the ball on his own 30 with an open sideline in front of him, showing the speed to evade one despairing tackle and strength to bump off fullback Jahream Bula on his way to the tryline.</p>
        
            <p>As he celebrated, he probably could have scored closer to the posts, but luckily halfback Luke Metcalf was able to convert in tricky conditions to level the scores.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a special kid and he'll have a long career, if he wants to," said co-captain Mitch Barnett. "Some of the things he can do on the footy field, I wish I could do."</p>
        
            <p>Both teams had tries disallowed, but none seemed overly contentious.</p>
        
            <p>Tigers prop Terell May seemed to have grounded the ball over the line, but replays showed he lost possession before he could force it.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad dived on a loose ball over the tryline, after winger Taine Tuaupiki threw a speculator pass infield that was kicked ahead by centre Ali Leiataua, but the bunker ruled CNK offside from the kick.</p>
        
            <p>Tigers fullback Jahream Bula crossed untouched out wide, but only because the Warriors defence was obstructed by a teammate.</p>
        
            <p>The Tigers entered the fourth round with the competition's best - and perhaps most flattering - defensive record, conceding just 34 points in their previous three outings.</p>
        
            <p>Their previous wins were achieved against two teams - Parramatta Eels and the Dolphins - who are a combined 0-8 and currently fill the bottom two positions on the table. This was a bit of a reality check for them.</p>
        
            <p>By halftime, the Warriors had already exceeded their 11.3 points average and Wests (15.0) now have the second-best defensive record, behind unbeaten tabletoppers Canterbury Bulldogs (14.5).</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors remain atop the set-completion stats, still managing 81% in the wet conditions, but Wests weren't far behind (80%), which should still be good enough for second in the rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Individually, Warriors hooker Wayde Egan leads the competition in dummy-half runs, with 32 in total and one special one to create Metcalf's second-half try against Wests.</p>
        
            <p>Much has been made of the void left by Shaun Johnson's retirement, but maybe we need to stop highighting the Warriors halves as a potential weakness and celebrate Metcalf's continuing emergence in the No.7 jersey.</p>
        
            <p>He had another perfect goalkicking night, including the tricky conversion to Halasima's try and the winning penalty from 40 metres out. Metcalf was also on hand to finish off Egan's linebreak soon after halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The penalty was into a stiff wind that had seemingly held up Warriors kickoffs during the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"I was, like, if he wants it, let's take it," Webster said. "Straight away, he wanted it, which was awesome.</p>
        
            <p>"I was nervous of the distance, but he smashed it. I loved how he stood up - everyone talks about how goalkickers want that moment."</p>
        
            <p>Dylan Walker's sudden exit this week saw Bunty Afoa promoted to the interchange for this game and he also responded with an impactful showing off the bench.</p>
        
            <p>While Webster insisted local players would get their chance to fill Walker's role, the rumour mill has the Warriors approaching English second-rower Morgan Gannon with a three-year offer.</p>
        
            <p>Gannon, 21, made his debut for Leeds Rhinos as a 17-year-old and he has amassed 50 games for the Super League club, despite missing the 2024 season to recover from concussion symptoms.</p>
        
            <p>Another social media report suggests Te Maire Martin and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad will both look offshore next season, so watch this space.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors now have a week off, which will give some of their players a chance to rest up.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, Egan has played every minute of every game so far, leading the competition in dummy-half runs and second in tackles (185), behind Kiwis No.9 Jeremy Marshall-King (192).</p>
        
            <p>He traditionally absorbs quite a bit of wear and tear as the season progresses, so this break is perfectly timed for him to freshen up.</p>
