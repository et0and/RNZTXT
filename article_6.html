            <p>Warriors v Sea Eagles</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 8pm, Friday 14 March</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Stadium, Auckland</p>

            <p>Of the 17 teams currently contesting the NRL first-grade, the Warriors have fared worst against Melbourne Storm (30.8) in terms of head-to-head winning percentage. Manly Sea Eagles have been only marginally more accommodating (30.9).</p>
        
            <p>Surprisingly, Manly's record in Warriors home games has been an impressive 13-6, including 11-5 at Mt Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Last time the two rivals met at the Auckland venue, the encounter ended in a rare Golden Point draw, when Shaun Johnson was taken out attempting a two-point field goal in the dying seconds and subsequently slotted the penalty from 40 metres out to send the contest into overtime.</p>
        
            <p>Neither team could break the deadlock in added 10 minutes and had to share the points.</p>

            <p>Before the Warriors were founded in 1995, Manly - and perhaps Canberra Raiders - were the NRL team most supported on this side of the Tasman, due mainly to their strong Kiwi connections. Fullback/centre Darrell Williams become the first NZ player to win a Sydney Grand Final there, while Graham Lowe coached the Sea Eagles from 1990-92.</p>
        
            <p>Among Lowe's charges at Brookvale was former All Black and future Warriors star Matthew Ridge.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors kicked off their season with an underwhelming 30-8 loss to Canberra a the Las Vegas showpiece two weeks ago. The Raiders shredded them with their offload game (17-9), while the Warriors missed twice as many tackles (44-21) as their opponents.</p>
        
            <p>The defining moment of the game came in the 31st minute, with the Warriors trailling 10-0, but threatening to score. As the ball shifted left towards Roger Tuivasa-Sheck on the wing, halfback Luke Metcalf had his final pass intercepted by Raiders wing Xavier Savage, who sprinted the length of the park for a try.</p>
        
            <p>Instead of potentially pulling within four points before halftime, the Warriors deficit became 16 and they were never able to recover.</p>
        
            <p>On the other hand, Manly could not have been more impressive in their season-opening 42-12 win over North Queensland Cowboys, holding their opponents scoreless until the final eight minutes.</p>

            <p>Led by the NRL's oldest player - half Daly Cherry-Evans - they were in mid-season form, running in seven tries, six of them converted by centre Reuben Garrick.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1 Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, 2 Taine Tuaupiki, 3 Ali Leiataua, 4 Adam Pompey, 5 Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, 6 Chanel Harris-Tavita, 7 Luke Metcalf, 8 James Fisher-Harris (cc), 9 Wayde Egan, 10 Mitch Barnett, 11 Kurt Capewell, 12 Marata Niukore, 13 Erin Clark</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14 Dylan Walker, 15 Jackson Ford, 16 Demitiric Vaimauga, 17 Leka Halasima</p>
        
            <p>Sea Eagles: 1 Tom Trbojevic, 2 Jason Saab, 18 Clayton Faulalo, 4 Reuben Garrick, 5 Lehi Hopoate, 6 Luke Brooks, 7 Daly Cherry-Evans, 8 Taniela Paseka, 9 Jazz Tevaga, 10 Josh Aloiai, 11 Haumole Olakau'atu, 12 Ben Trbojevic, 13 Jake Trbojevic</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14 Jake Simpkin, 15 Corey Waddell, 16 Ethan Bullemor, 17 Tof Sipley</p>
        
            <p>True to his word, coach Andrew Webster has resisted the temptation to make changes, giving his team an opportunity to "right the wrongs" from Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>He has opted for the same starters named against the Raiders, but remember, he shuffled the pack before kickoff, moving Jackson Ford off the bench and into the front row, shifting co-captain Mitch Barnett to lock and dropping Erin Clark to the interchange.</p>
        
            <p>This week's selection means Tuivasa-Sheck will remain on the wing, despite renewed calls to move him to fullback, where he won the Dally M Medal in 2018. Metcalf retains his unaccustomed No.7 jersey, as he tries to fill the void left by Johnson's retirement, while Chanel Harris-Tavita will line up outside him.</p>
        
            <p>Manly coach Anthony Seibold initially stuck with the same players that delivered against the Cowboys - with one exception.</p>
        
            <p>Former Kiwi international and one-game Warrior Siosuia Taukeiaho picked up a knee injury and has been replaced by Josh Aloiai in the front row.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, he was forced into another change, when centre Tolu Koula could not bounce back from a corked thigh and was replaced by Clayton Faulalo in the starting line-up.</p>
        
            <p>The Sea Eagles have firepower across the park, with Tom Trbojevic at fullback, Cherry-Evans and Luke Brooks in the halves, and power and pace among the forwards, with Jake Trbojevic and Haumole Olakau'atu.</p>
        
            <p>Named at hooker, former Warriors Jazz Tevaga makes his first return to his old club, while interchange forward Tof Sipley is another who starred for the Warriors juniors, before heading across the ditch.</p>
        
            <p>Another close encounter will come down to a late exchange of field goal attempts, with Cherry-Evans slotting the winner.</p>
        
            <p>Sea Eagles $1.38, Warriors $3.05</p>
