            <p>Late strikes have handed England the ascendancy in the first cricket test against the Black Caps in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Looking set for another test ton, Kane Williamson lost his wicket late on day one on 93, the tail now exposed to the English attack.</p>
        
            <p>At stumps, with Glen Phillips, 41*, and Tim Southee 10*, in the middle, New Zealand was 319/8 after 83 overs.</p>
        
            <p>England won the toss on day one of the opener in Christchurch, sending the Kiwis into bat at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>After all the anticipation, it did not take long for action as Devon Conway was out in the second over, hitting one hard back at bowler Gus Aitkinson who threw a mitt out as the ball stuck.</p>
        
            <p>His opening partner and skipper Tom Latham fared better, making a quick-fire 47, before he was caught behind.</p>
        
            <p>Cue a trademark Williamson innings, the country's premier batter back after he sat out the India tour with injury.</p>

            <p>It took him a while to warm up, needing 14 balls for his first run and then another 47 for his first boundary, but once into his work the runs flowed seamlessly.</p>
        
            <p>He brought up his 36th test 50 before lunch, with Ravindra offering sound support at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra enjoyed a lucky reprieve early on, after he nicked one behind, but no one noticed, appealed or reviewed.</p>
        
            <p>However, he was out not long after for 34 to Shoaib Bashir, while Daryl Mitchell came and went for 19.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson continued to accumulate but just as his century was in sight, he held out to Aitkinson.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell did little to trouble the scoresheet as he was sent packing for 17, debutant Nathan Smith next to go for just three, followed by Henry who fell for a fighting 17.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips was dropped by Ben Stokes on one, surviving to stumps with Southee with an unbroken 21-run stand.</p>
        
            <p>Bashir finished the day with figures of 4/69.</p>
        
            <p>The series will have the first ever Crowe-Thorpe trophy on the line, in memory of two cricket greats Martin Crowe and Graham Thorpe.</p>
        
            <p>In a pre-game tribute, the trophy was brought out by Crowe's sister Deb and grandson Tim, and Thorpe's former teammate and skipper Michael Atherton.</p>
        
            <p>Day two will resume at 11am.</p>
