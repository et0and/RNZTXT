            <p>When Ajaz Patel became the third player in the history of test cricket to take all 10 wickets in an innings against India in 2021, it didn't result in a Black Caps win.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday night at the same ground in Mumbai, Patel claimed 6-57 to help the Black Caps clean sweep the home side 3-0 in a test series - the first team in history to achieve that feat on Indian soil.</p>
        
            <p>It was Patel's second five-wicket haul in the Test, as New Zealand dismissed India for 121 in their second innings to win by 25 runs and stun the cricketing world.</p>
        
            <p>Patel took 14 wickets in that 2021 Test, and 19 across the two-Test series, but New Zealand lost 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>This time Patel's efforts were a key reason for the Black Caps' win and he told First Up's Nathan Rarere it was incredibly special doing it in Mumbai - the city of his birth.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it's like another home for me as well so it's been pretty cool to come back here and be able to relive some memories but also create some new ones," Patel said.</p>
        
            <p>The player-of-the-match couldn't really explain why he's had to much success at the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"But I always enjoy coming to Mumbai, every time I'm back in the city I kind of feel at peace and quite comfortable so maybe that has something to do with it as well but certainly the wicket helps. On both occasions they've been turning wickets so that's always a bonus."</p>
        
            <p>Patel said the gravity of what the side had achieved was sinking in.</p>

            <p>"We were sitting down having some conversations amongst ourselves and I guess if you look through the series everyone's put their hand up at different times when the team's needed it.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's really taken a whole team performance at different times from guys stepping up with the bat to the ball, and the field. So I think it's quite amazing because it's so unique and doing it over here is so difficult and we all know that and it certainly has taken a full team effort to be able to achieve what we've achieved."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps had already ticked off a first when they got a 2-nil unassailable lead over India but Patel said their approach to the final Test was about starting again.</p>
        
            <p>"Every Test match is quite special, every time you get on to the field for a Test match for New Zealand it's always a privilege. No one ever really takes that lightly and every game we treat it with a lot of respect</p>
        
            <p>"So we prepared the same way that we had for the other two Tests, we made sure we did our homework. We'd played in Mumbai before so we kind of knew somewhat what to expect of the surface, then guys went away and created their own game plans and how to tackle the opposition.</p>
        
            <p>"It was phenomenal the way our batters went out there and put pressure on their bowlers but at the same time as a bowling group we also fired shots back at them as well."</p>

            <p>Patel said he loved being in the thick of it when the match came down to the wire.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really fun, as a bowler you cherish those moments where you know it's somewhat in your control in terms of how this kind of pans out and you want to be the group that gets you over the line.</p>
        
            <p>"As a spinner when you come to the subcontinent you are bowling in the last innings and I guess that expectation that you have to bring the team across the line, or as a collective we need to bring the team across the line, that's always a nice feeling.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something that I really cherish and quite frankly I love that feeling and that responsibility as well so yes it did get a lot tighter than we probably would have liked but at the same time those kind of high pressure situations are quite exciting to be in because they are quite thrilling games and you know that when you do get across the line it is a very very special feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Indian batsman Rishabh Pant was starting to turn the tide for the home side, making a sublime 64 before Patel dismissed him following a New Zealand review.</p>
        
            <p>"He's batted phenomenally this whole series and he's really put us under a lot of pressure, especially the spinners but at the same time we knew that the other guys that were coming in were still capable enough of getting the Indians across the line.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was really important we kept patient ...we had to make sure we got the job done. And Glenn Phillips picking up those two wickets in two balls, that was just phenomenal and that took a lot of pressure off us.</p>
        
            <p>"So I guess it's a great script when you look at the game of cricket and the way that it plays out sometimes. Watching this game would have been quite exciting but it certainly was quite exciting being a part of it as well."</p>
