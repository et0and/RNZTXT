            <p>New Zealand tennis star Lulu Sun's 2025 losing streak's continued at the Australian Open, with defeat in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>Sun was beaten by Danka Kovinic of Montenegro 6-3 7-5 on a windy and noisy court six at Melbourne Park.</p>
        
            <p>The loss followed opening round defeats at the ASB Classic in Auckland and then the Hobart WTA event, following an injury disrupted end to 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest it was a pretty bad match from my part," Sun said.</p>
        
            <p>"But props to her, she's coming back as well and she played decently and she was the better player today.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty disappointing, as I haven't felt that well in my matches," said 23-year-old Sun.</p>

            <p>"I feel like these past three matches the score was close, but it's not where I want to be on a consistent level and where I want to be," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In the first set Sun struggled to get any rhythm and feature in any rallies.</p>
        
            <p>She was broken in the eighth game and the set went quickly from there.</p>
        
            <p>In the second, there was a break each before both players held their serve until 5-5, however the New Zealander was then broken and Kovinic held her own serve for the match.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Sun made 44 unforced errors compared to her opponent's 16, although she did hit nearly twice as many winners at 21 to 12.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand interest in the Australian Open is not over just yet despite the loss.</p>
        
            <p>Sun and the Netherlands' Fanny Stollar take on top seeds Czechia's Katerina Siniakova and American Taylor Townsend in their first round doubles match later today, while Erin Routliffe and Canadian partner Gaby Dabrowski, the second seeds, play Americans Danielle Collins and Desirae Krawczyk.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Venus will open his campaign in the mens doubles Thursday.</p>
