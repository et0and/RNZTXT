            <p>Nelly Korda carded a 3-under 68 on Sunday to remain atop the leaderboard after three rounds of action at the LPGA Drive on Championship in Bradenton, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Korda entered the day with a two-stroke lead before recording three birdies, an eagle and two bogeys at Bradenton Country Club to move to 13-under 200.</p>
        
            <p>She now holds a four-shot edge over Megan Khang (66 on Saturday), Japan's Ayaka Furue (69) and Lydia Ko of New Zealand (69), who are all tied for second at 9-under 204.</p>
        
            <p>It was rough in the early going for Korda, who posted back-to-back bogeys at the par-3 seventh and the par-5 eighth.</p>
        
            <p>But those ended up being Korda's only blemishes, and she surged late, going eagle-birdie at Nos. 17-18 to close her round.</p>
        
            <p>"I birdied the par-5 (sixth) and then unfortunately snap hooked my next two tee shots, which ended up both of them being bogeys," Korda said. "And then just had a fresh attitude coming into the back nine. I mean, it's not how you start it's how you finish. Hopefully I can lead that into (Monday)."</p>
        
            <p>Korda, a Bradenton native, gave caddie Jason McDede credit for keeping her composed during the rough patch on the front nine.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to have a really positive teammate like I do in Jason," Korda said. "He always makes sure I keep my head up and never doubt myself pretty much, to tell myself that I can make any hole an opportunity for birdie."</p>
        
            <p>With Sunday's performance, the 25-year-old Korda is 18 holes away from her first victory on the LPGA Tour since November of 2022, when she won the Pelican Women's Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Just one stroke behind Khang, Furue and Ko are China's Xiyu Lin (70), South Korean Sei Young Kim (69), Robyn Choi of Australia (66) and Auston Kim, who secured low-round honors on Sunday with a 7-under 64 to skyrocket 35 spots on the leaderboard.</p>
        
            <p>Kim collected three birdies and an eagle over her final five holes. She finished with six birdies for her round, logging just one bogey - at the par-3 ninth.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a blur. I was just playing golf. I honestly can't remember what my scorecard looks like," Kim said. "I made bogey on 9 unfortunately, I was an unfortunate three-putt; missed a really short one. But that helped me lock in a little bit more, provide a little bit extra focus.</p>
        
            <p>"Once I made the turn, I felt like I was moving at really good pace, really good tempo."</p>
        
            <p>South Korea's So Mi Lee, who was in second after the second round on Saturday, limped to a 5-over 76 on Sunday to drop into a tie for 22nd.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's winner, Celine Boutier of France, is also in a tie for 22nd following a 1-over 72.</p>
