            <p>The Chiefs Manawa have guaranteed themselves a shot at redemption.</p>
        
            <p>After a heartbreaking two point loss in last year's Super Rugby Aupiki final, the Chiefs have again booked their spot in the decider after a dominant 43-12 win over Hurricanes Poua.</p>
        
            <p>It's a perfect four from four for Manawa, the star-studded outfit led by outstanding performances from Ruby Tui and Chelsea Semple.</p>
        
            <p>Leading by just 12-5 at halftime, Manawa ran in five second half tries to blow Poua away in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Kennedy Simon told Sky Sport they were anticipating a physical clash and that's what they got.</p>
        
            <p>"Very proud of the effort, we knew in the Hurricanes hometown, it was going to be brutal, the collisions were big, they are an athletic side."</p>
        
            <p>Simon said after giving the coaches a "bit of a fright" in the first half, they were able to trust their attack would "keep coming in waves".</p>
        
            <p>"With a good result like that we just keep pushing and you never know what's going to happen."</p>
        
            <p>There was one blight for the brilliant Manawa, Charmaine Smith leaving the field late with a serious injury.</p>
        
            <p>Manawa put first points on the board as debutante Seina Saito crashed over on the back of a powerful burst by Grace Steinmetz.</p>
        
            <p>Poua struck straight back following some beautiful interplay from the backs, Monica Tagoai finishing off the slick movement.</p>
        
            <p>The extra point went begging as a determined Ruby Tui charged down Isabella Waterman's conversion attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Tui then had the chance to go coast to coast when Apii Nicholls-Pualau scooped on a Poua spill inside her own 22, however looking for the speedster out-wide, Tui fumbled the inside pass.</p>
        
            <p>She made immediate amends, nailing a 50:22 but another error meant Manawa was unable to cash in on the prime field position.</p>
        
            <p>A blistering break by Poua halfback Iritana Hohaia set her side on a promising attack, but another dropped ball again quashed it.</p>
        
            <p>Despite some brilliant attack, the handling was letting both sides down, particularly the Poua who let several scoring opportunities slip.</p>
        
            <p>Having defended for most of the half, Manawa opted to have a crack from a scrum inside their own half just as the siren sounded.</p>
        
            <p>Shifting it smartly to Tui's wing, she would chip ahead with Mererangi Paul showing a clean pair of heels to outgun the cover defence, and give her side a 12-5 lead as they went to the sheds.</p>
        
            <p>Saito extended the lead right after the break with her second try as the Matatu maul put the Poua in reverse.</p>
        
            <p>Again it was a Poua rapid reply from Poua, Semple snaffling a turnover in her own 22 only for Elinor-Plum King to rip it right back and streak down the blind-side to score.</p>
        
            <p>Semple then gave her side some breathing room, with a classy show and go to break the line and stroll over.</p>
        
            <p>The result was essentially put to bed as Tui showcased her class, nonchalantly stepping inside two Poua defenders and streaking away for her side's fifth.</p>
        
            <p>Following repeated Poua infringements, King was sent to the bin, and the Chiefs took advantage of the extra woman, replacement Victoria Edmonds scoring in the left corner.</p>
        
            <p>Chyna Hohepa then iced the cake with Manawa's seventh, Vici-Rose Green bouncing up after not being held in a tackle and linking with her number eight who went in under the sticks.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Manawa 43 (Saito 2, Paul, Semple, Tui, Edmonds, Hohepa tries, Semple 2 cons, Bayler 2 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Poua 12 (Tagoai, King, tries, Waterman 1 con)</p>
