            <p>New Zealand boxer David Nyika will take on Australian Jai Opetaia on the Gold Coast Wednesday night in the biggest bout of his professional career.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika was a late replacement for the 12-round fight with Opetaia putting his IBF and The Ring cruiserweight titles on the line.</p>
        
            <p>29-year-old Opetaia has a 26-0 record with 20 wins via knockout, while unbeaten Nyika has won nine of his 10 fights with knockouts.</p>
        
            <p>The two have sparred together before and Nyika, an Olympic bronze medalist, told the DAZN face off that he knows what he is in for.</p>
        
            <p>"We've shared very competitive rounds but I think sparring is very different," Nyika said.</p>
        
            <p>"But come fight night it's going to be whatever happens happens, but I truly believe the fans are going to get a really good show."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika, who is known as a very good technical fighter said he is ready for whatever Opetaia throws at him.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not the kind of sport where you can just go in with one game plan.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not tiddlywinks, it is not checkers, it is chess.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't predict this fight because I know how tough you (Opetaia) are and what you are prepared to go through to get the win... and I'm prepared to do the same."</p>
        
            <p>Opetaia is currently ranked the world's best active cruiserweight by a number of organisations.</p>
        
            <p>The former world junior champion has ambitions of moving up to the heavyweight division to fight the biggest names in the game.</p>
        
            <p>He is not concerned about Nyika's knockout power.</p>
        
            <p>"I know I can knock him out, I know I can hurt him," Opetaia said.</p>
        
            <p>"You want to have a gun fight, let's have a gun fight.</p>
        
            <p>"But I know it's not going to be a gunfight, you're going to box you don't want to get hit.</p>
        
            <p>"Twelve rounds of war, I'm ready for it."</p>
