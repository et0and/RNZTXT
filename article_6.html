            <p>Phoenix captain Annalie Longo concedes the season remains a challenging one as her side tries to stamp their mark in the women's A-League.</p>
        
            <p>Longo came back from a serious knee injury to play for the Football Ferns in last year's World Cup and then joined the Phoenix for their third season in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Just a few weeks into the new season the club then faced questions about team culture, vice-captain Chloe Knott abruptly quit.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'm honest it's been a real challenge this season. It hasn't been the easiest as there's been a lot of injury and a lot of change in personnel and management," Longo said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've also had a few challenges around mental well-being and so there have been a lot of things around the outside the team.</p>
        
            <p>"I think my focus is around how can I get the best out of the players and how can I lead that group," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The relationship between the staff and the players is very good, we're very open, we're very honest and we communicate really well."</p>
        
            <p>Longo, 32, first played professional football 10 years ago and has made 127 appearances for the Football Ferns since her debut in 2006 and at this stage of her career is feeling a strong sense of responsibility for those around her.</p>
        
            <p>" I care a lot about how players are feeling and trying to make the environment the best I can.</p>
        
            <p>"So that does put a bit of weight on my shoulders, but saying that I feel like I have good support staff around me.</p>

            <p>"For a lot of players this is the first time they've ever been in a professional environment and so there is a lot of learning for all of us.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully as the season goes on players become more equipped and comfortable in the environment and therefore I think it will become easier to manage the squad."</p>
        
            <p>American defender Hailey Davidson is one of the those in her first season with the team.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson, 22, said Longo is heavily involved in the leadership and well-being of the group.</p>
        
            <p>"She does take on a lot on her own, the responsibility of many things that people do and don't see, but she handles it very well.</p>
        
            <p>"She's very good at representing the team and who we are and what we want as a culture so she's a very good representation of what we should be."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix play Central Coast in Australia on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>They're experiencing their best season so far with five wins from eleven games putting them in fourth place on the table.</p>
        
            <p>Longo says the way they're performing certainly helps with all the other issues.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really enjoying the way we're playing and now it's about progressing.</p>
