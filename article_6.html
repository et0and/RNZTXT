            <p>New Zealand tennis player Erin Routliffe is set to move up to No 2 in the world doubles rankings after victory in Britain.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Canadian partner Gabby Dabrowski won the final of the WTA 250 tournament in Nottingham.</p>
        
            <p>It was a hectic final day at the Wimbledon lead-in tournament for Routliffe and Dabrowski.</p>
        
            <p>Due to poor weather all week, they had to play their semifinal match in the morning, defeating Ashlyn Krueger from America and China's Zhang Shuai 6-0 6-4.</p>
        
            <p>Then after having a rest, the 2023 US Open champions took on Britain's Harriet Dart and Diane Parry from France in the final.</p>
        
            <p>It was Routliffe and Dabrowski's toughest match of the week, but they came through, winning 5-7 6-4 11-9, saving a championship point in the third-set super tiebreak.</p>
        
            <p>With the points from this win, Routliffe is expected to overtake Hsieh Su-Wei in the world rankings when they are updated this week.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe said earlier this year that her goal for 2024 was to get to No 1 in the world rankings and she now has only Belgium's Elise Mertens ahead of her.</p>
        
            <p>This was Routliffe and Dabrowski's first tournament together since the Canadian's injury at the Miami Open in March and it sets them up well for Wimbledon, which begins on 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>It is Routliffe and Dabrowski's third career title together and their first on grass.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Dabrowski are scheduled to play at the WTA 250 tournament in Birmingham this week.</p>
        
            <p>They are the No 2 seeds and have been drawn against Greet Minnen from Belgium and Britain's Heather Watson in the opening round.</p>
