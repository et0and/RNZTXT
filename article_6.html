            <p>The signs are all pointing to the fact that the Crusaders are back in business, as they come into this game after thrashing the Blues last weekend. Meanwhile, Moana had a crazy game against the Chiefs where they found themselves 36-7 down at halftime, only to rally and get within eight points of the lead and ultimately lose 50-35.</p>

            <p>Kyle Preston gets a rest this weekend, so Noah Hotham is elevated back to starting halfback and Mitch Drummond comes onto the bench. Tamaiti Williams swaps out with George Bower, while Ethan Blackadder comes back in after missing last weekend's win in Auckland. Dallas McLwod retains his spot at centre.</p>

            <p>Ardie Savea comes straight back in as captain and number eight, with last weekend's skipper Tom Savage rotated to the bench. Sam Slade and Allan Craig start in the second row, with Semisi Paea in at openside. The impressive Tuna Tuitama retains his spot on the bench, the Samoan Sevens star scoring a try on debut against the Chiefs.</p>

            <p>The Crusaders have won all four of their four Super Rugby Pacific games against Moana Pasifika, scoring an average of 38.8 points per game; they have also held Pasifika to one try in each of their last two games in that span.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders have won 14 of their last 16 Super Rugby Pacific games at Apollo Projects Stadium, including their last five in a row; in fact, they've scored an average of seven tries per game across their last four games at the venue.</p>
        
            <p>Sevu Reece (11) and Kyren Taumoefolau (10) are two of just three players to have made 10 or more line breaks this Super Rugby Pacific campaign (Caleb Tangitau,10), with Reece (25) also ranking joint-second for tackle breaks this campaign.</p>

            <p>"They've been champions for so many years and they've got quality players, coaches and that's kind of their fortress. So for us it's a huge task but something that we can go there and try and test ourselves and test them as well." - Moana Pasifika captain Ardie Savea.</p>
        
            <p>"They should be higher up the ladder, given their performances. But sometimes performances aren't reflected by where you are on the table. It's due to the success and abilities of Moana Pasifika that we've selected a strong team." - Crusaders coach Rob Penney.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders 43 - 10 Moana Pasifika</p>
        
            <p>One of the few positives out of last season for the Crusaders, this was a very complete performance at home against a Moana team that would've come in quietly confident. Noah Hotham scored a very good try and furthered his case for an eventual All Black call-up, but the game was won by a very dominant Crusaders set-piece.</p>
        
            <p>If Moana are going to be any chance, they can't wait until halftime to start playing. Really, they need to improve their defence as even in the game they won they still are conceding far too many points. The Crusaders will be looking to simply keep the ball rolling, again they have a big, experienced pack and will be keen for Sevu Reece to break the all-time Super Rugby try-scoring record in this game.</p>
