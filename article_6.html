            <p>The Australian women's cricket side has been the White Ferns' nemesis for some time and New Zealand is once again struggling against their trans-Tasman neighbours as it stares down the barrel of a series whitewash in their current T20 series.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns play Australia in the third and final T20 international this afternoon in Wellington with the home side trailing 2-nil.</p>
        
            <p>Australia have outclassed the current T20 world champions in the first two games - winning game one by eight wickets and the second by 82 runs.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have lost their last eight T20 games against Australia, their last win being four years ago while over the past five years the two sides have met 14 times with the White Ferns winning just three games.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand allrounder Jess Kerr said Australia undoubtedly felt they had a point to prove after they failed to get past the semi-final stage of last year's T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"They've come out fighting.....(and) we've just got to be a bit better really," Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was all about intent if they were to avoid a series whitewash.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't be safe. To win games against them we can't play with fear ...(we need) to play that aggressive brand and that's what the coaches are encouraging so playing shots, taking the game on and try to bowl our best ball for as long as possible and make them hit off our good balls."</p>

            <p>And while the series is lost Kerr was adamant the were not lacking motivation or resting on their laurels post the T20 World Cup victory.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hungry to fight for this last game and there is still a lot on the line....we want to show that we are a world class team and to put a bit of heat on the Australians and we know we can do that if we are playing our best cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"We've not stopped after the World Cup, we want to keep being a world class side and there is a (One Day) World Cup in a year and we want to keep striving towards that."</p>
