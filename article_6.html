            <p>Former Silver Ferns captain Gina Crampton has joined the Sydney based Giants as a training partner for the 2024 Super Netball season in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>It makes her the third former Silver Fern to sign with an Australian franchise for this season, along with Sam Winders and Elle Temu.</p>
        
            <p>Winders is a full member of the Giants, coached by Julie Fitzgerald, who had a three-year coaching stint in New Zealand at the Magic between 2013 and 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Crampton announced in June last year that she would be taking a break from the Silver Ferns and the ANZ Premiership competition in 2024 to be with her partner in New York, who plays professional rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Following a relocation to Sydney, the 32-year-old reached out to the Giants to see what opportunities there were for her to join the squad.</p>
        
            <p>The livewire midcourter has 70 international caps to her name and will add a wealth of experience to the Giants environment.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Defender Elle Temu, who has four test caps for New Zealand, has been named as a training partner for the New South Wales Swifts.</p>
        
            <p>Temu moved to Australia to join her partner, Wests Tigers NRL star Isaiah Papali'i, in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>The Sydney based Swifts are coached by Briony Akle, who has just finished a specialist coaching stint with the Silver Ferns for their series in England.</p>
        
            <p>Underpinning the main rostered squad of 10, training partners train most days with the senior team and can be called into the main playing group as injury replacements.</p>
        
            <p>Under Netball NZ policy Winders, Temu, and Crampton won't be eligible for selection in the Silver Ferns this year as players must be signed with an ANZ Premiership team.</p>
        
            <p>Just a handful of New Zealand players have played in the Super Netball competition since its inception in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>The last was Silver Fern legend Laura Langman, who retired at the end of her final season with the Sunshine Coast Lightning in 2020.</p>
