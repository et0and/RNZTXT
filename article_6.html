            <p>FIFA has started disciplinary proceedings over the crowd disturbances that caused a delay in the World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina at the Maracana Stadium, soccer's world governing body said on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Brazil and Argentina fans started fighting behind one of the goals during the national anthems at Thursday's game, prompting police to charge at the travelling contingent with batons drawn.</p>
        
            <p>The visiting world champions, led by captain Lionel Messi, went over to the terraces to try and calm the situation before leaving the pitch for more than 10 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"FIFA can confirm that its Disciplinary Committee has opened proceedings against the Brazilian Football Association (CBF) and the Argentinian Football Association (AFA)," FIFA said in a statement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina face disciplinary action for potential breaches of 'Articles 17.2 and 14.5' of the FIFA disciplinary code related to crowd disturbance and delayed kick-off respectively.</p>
        
            <p>FIFA added that Brazil are under investigation for potential violations of 'Article 17', which relates to maintaining order and security during matches.</p>
        
            <p>The game started after the long delay and Argentina won 1-0 with a 63rd-minute header from defender Nicolas Otamendi.</p>
