            <p>The Highlanders have announced that former All Black and Japan coach Jamie Joseph will coach the Super Rugby Pacific side next year.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph, the current head of rugby accepted the role of head coach, while the man he's replacing Clarke Dermody, will remain with the Highlanders as assistant coach.</p>
        
            <p>Dermody said he was proud of what the team achieved this year and understood the change.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a change that Jamie discussed with me and while I am very proud of what we achieved this season, I accept the view that it will be of benefit to the club to have his coaching influence on the team next year. From that perspective I believe it's a positive step and I'm happy to support the move in the best interests of the club," Dermody said.</p>
        
            <p>Dermody was announced as the Highlander's head coach from 2023. The Highlanders finished ninth last year and sixth this year.</p>
        
            <p>Dermody was confident the team could develop further in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"I know there is plenty of growth left in this team. They are all still mostly young and relatively inexperienced players at Super Rugby level. We all learned a lot this year and the benefits of that experience will pay dividends for us next year. Personally, I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with Jamie in unleashing the potential within the team next season."</p>
        
            <p>Joseph said he was delighted to be back coaching the Highlanders again.</p>
        
            <p>"I am keen to get stuck in with Clarke and the rest of my coaching team next season. My goal is to take this team as far as it can go and to build a record of success that we can all be proud of," Joseph said.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders chairperson, Peter Kean, said the changes announced today were another positive step forward for the Highlanders.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe these changes will take advantage of the unique skill sets that both Jamie and Clarke possess. Jamie has a proven track record as a coach at international level and that experience and knowledge will be hugely beneficial to the Highlanders. As a board we are delighted Clarke will remain with the Highlanders and he will have an enormous contribution to make as Jamie's assistant," Kean said.</p>
