        <h2>Che Clark finds new home in 15's</h2>
        <p>
After having the door closed on his Olympic dream, Che Clark has only been motivated to dream even bigger.

            <p>New Blues signing Che Clark is not short of ambition.</p>
        
            <p>After having the door closed on his Olympic dream, Clark has only been motivated to dream even bigger - an All Black jersey, an Olympic gold medal, and representing his island heritage for Mate Ma'a Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was an omission for the All Black sevens squad for Paris, and has since shifted his sights to another black jersey, this time in the 15-man code.</p>
        
            <p>Not only that, the part Tongan wants to run out in front of the 'red sea' in Auckland, and earn a recall for another shot at Olympic glory.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to get the other black jersey, then hopefully play some league, and an Olympic gold, can't forget about that."</p>
        
            <p>But before he can tick off his lofty list, Clark will be chasing a Super Rugby debut in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>A new face on the roster for the defending champions, Clark's selection marks a childhood dream realised.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the team I wanted to play for, I grew up watching these guys back in the day. So being here is pretty surreal for me. Now I just need to get that blue jersey and hopefully get a crack."</p>
        
            <p>The jersey in question is the very one All Black Jerome Kaino occupied for several seasons, a man Clark idolised growing up.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully I can follow his pathway and do what he was doing when he was here. To get that number six jersey, it would be amazing just to know who's come before me."</p>

            <p>The former Kings College student said his time on the sevens circuit has prepared him well for the rigours of Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"Travelling around the world with some of your best mates playing footy, there's not much more you could ask for. But there's a lot of hard work. Sevens teaches you resilience, how to push through tough times because when you're out on the field, you're bloody in the trenches, and you just have to keep going."</p>
        
            <p>However, the increased physicality was a bit of a shock to the system.</p>
        
            <p>"The legs were all good. I was just getting banged around everywhere. Coming back, everyone in my position was ten kilograms heavier than me. So hopefully get a bit bigger and hopefully be able to bang these boys around."</p>
        
            <p>Clark still keeps a close eye on the sevens side, and admits its been a hard watch seeing them crash out of Dubai and Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a couple of injuries which I think took a toll. We had a slow start last year, and then we ended up doing good at the end of the season. It might take a few tournaments for the boys to get ready. There are some new faces and they're only going to get better."</p>
