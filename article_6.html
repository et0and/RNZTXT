            <p>A Hall of Fame recognising the country's top cricketers will be launched ahead of the second test against England in Wellington next week.</p>
        
            <p>A joint venture between New Zealand Cricket, the New Zealand Cricket Players Association and the New Zealand Cricket Museum the Hall of Fame will be launched with an inaugural induction of 11 former internationals dubbed the "First Eleven", with additional members to be recognised annually.</p>
        
            <p>A Hall of Fame exhibit, featuring near life-size photographs of each inductee along with video and biographical content displayed on a digital touch-screen, will be formally opened at the Cricket Museum at the Basin Reserve on Thursday, 5 December.</p>
        
            <p>Chosen by a panel of historians and statisticians, the foundation inductees were selected on the basis of their international playing records, leadership, and influence.</p>
        
            <p>The player must have been retired for at least five years to be recognised.</p>
        
            <p>The members of the "First Eleven" span a time from the Second World War to the current era.</p>
        
            <p>NZC chief executive Scott Weenink said the Hall of Fame initiative would keep alive the stories and heroics of the country's most famous players.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm expecting some lively debate on who should be there and who shouldn't," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The beauty of this is that it's subjective, no-one's right or wrong - the ongoing discussions and kōrero are just as important."</p>
