            <p>Golfer Lydia Ko has finished the year on a winning note with victory in an invitational mixed teams event in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Ko teamed up with Australian Jason Day to win the inaugural three round tournament by one shot, from Canadians Brooke Henderson and Corey Conners.</p>
        
            <p>The pair carded a final round 6-under 66 to finish at 26-under overall.</p>
        
            <p>They pocket a share of the $US1 million winners' purse.</p>
        
            <p>Ko managed just two top ten finishes on the LPGA Tour this year with her best result a third at the BMW Championship in October.</p>
        
            <p>"I learned a lot, whether it was short-sided chips or just how to commit and hit bombs down there," Ko said of playing alongside the men.</p>
        
            <p>"I think this has just been a great start for the two tours coming together and having a mixed event, and I really hope this is something that continues for a long time."</p>

            <p>"It felt like the most stress-free win because I just knew (Ko) was going to step up in the end, which was fantastic," Day said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a fun week. I think having the two tours join this week was a fun way to finish the year out."</p>
        
            <p>he tournament featured 16 mixed teams with one male and one female player.</p>
        
            <p>The teams played a scramble format on the first day and foursomes (alternate shot) on the second.</p>
        
            <p>The final round was a modified four-ball, in which both teammates teed off, then switched balls for their second shots and played that ball the rest of the hole.</p>
