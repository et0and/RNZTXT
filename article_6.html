            <p>US ski great Mikaela Shiffrin won a record-equalling 15th career world championships medal when she and downhill champion Breezy Johnson struck gold in the new women's team combined event.</p>
        
            <p>The gold was the eighth at a world championships for Shiffrin, the most successful World Cup skier of all time, and Johnson's second after winning last Saturday's speed race on Saalbach's Ulli Maier piste.</p>
        
            <p>Shiffrin, who was skiing her first event at the Austrian resort after making a comeback from an injury sustained in November, has now taken gold at the last seven world championships.</p>
        
            <p>German skier Christl Cranz won 15 medals, all of them individual, between 1934-39 when the championships were held annually but Shiffrin stands alone in the modern era.</p>
        
            <p>"If we keep adding team events maybe we can get, I don't know, 32 for her or something," joked Johnson, who had set the fourth fastest downhill time before Shiffrin was third quickest in the slalom.</p>
        
            <p>"She's such a legend. It's super-cool to be hitting my stride and she's just obviously been on hers for a decade or more.</p>
        
            <p>"She said it was nerve-racking but it's super nerve-racking being Mikaela's team-mate. Nobody thinks she's going to be one that lets the team down."</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland's Lara Gut-Behrami and Wendy Holdener took silver, 0.39 of a second slower, with Austria's Stephanie Venier and Katharina Truppe the bronze medallists.</p>
        
            <p>The team combined, with each nation able to enter up to four pairs, was being held at a world championships for the first time and will feature at next year's Milan-Cortina Olympics. The men's event is on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Super-G bronze medallist Lauren Macuga had set the pace in the downhill for the USA 2 team but Paula Moltzan lost a swathe of time in the decisive slalom run and they finished fourth.</p>
        
            <p>None of the top three from the downhill managed to stay in the medal positions, with Germany 1 plunging from second to 17th while Austria 1 went from third to fifth.</p>
        
            <p>American Lindsey Vonn's hopes of a comeback medal at the age of 40 disappeared when she was 21st of 26 in the downhill, leaving USA 3 partner AJ Hurt an impossible task.</p>
        
            <p>They finished 16th in what was Vonn's final race at Saalbach.</p>
        
            <p>Vonn had hoped to team up with Shiffrin in a pairing that would have united the two most successful female World Cup skiers, but US team officials made the selection on the season's performances.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson and Shiffrin had been competing together since youngsters and the victory brought their friendship full circle.</p>
        
            <p>"I think if you would have told us when we met that we would team up to win a world championship medal, I don't think either of us would have believed it," Johnson said.</p>
