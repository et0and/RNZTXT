        <h2>Gold again! Black Ferns Sevens beat Canada to defend Olympic title</h2>
        <p>
The Black Ferns Sevens have fought back to beat Canada 19-12 to defend their Olympic gold.

            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have fought back to beat Canada 19-12 to defend their Olympic gold and hand New Zealand a first medal of the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>Trailing 12-7 at halftime, the Tokyo champions responded by scoring unanswered tries to veterans Michaela Blyde and Stacey Waaka to secure victory.</p>
        
            <p>In scenes reminiscent of three years ago, the players leapt with delight at the full-time whistle while the Canadians were disappointed at the end of a highly-competitive campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Risi Pouri-Lane opened the scoring after New Zealand dominated the early stages.</p>
        
            <p>Momentum turned on a yellow card shown to Black Ferns Sevens winger Portia Woodman-Wickliffe for a high tackle on Charity Williams</p>
        
            <p>Canada responded with tries to Chloe Daniels and Alysha Corrigan - the latter off an intercept pass thrown by Sarah Hirini - to take a 12-7 lead into the interval.</p>

            <p>New Zealand regained the initiative when veteran Blyde used footwork and acceleration to, score with Tyla King's conversion putting them two points in front.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens struck a key blow when Waaka finished a long-range try with just two minutes remaining.</p>
        
            <p>It was a far tighter contest than when the teams met in pool play on Monday, when New Zealand romped to a 33-7 win.</p>
        
            <p>It was the last match for New Zealand rugby great Woodman-Wickliffe, who said she would retire from the international game after the Paris tournament.</p>
        
            <p>It was also the last sevens international for long-serving playmaker King who, like Woodman-Wickliffe, was part of the silver medal at the Rio games and the gold medal winning Olympic triumph in Tokyo three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealand staved off the United States 24-12 in the semi-finals - helped by two tries to Waaka - before Canada pulled off a major upset by beating leading Rio champions and leading medal contenders Australia 21-12.</p>
        
            <p>Australia finished medal-less after being shocked for a second time, going down 14-12 to the US.</p>
