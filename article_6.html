            <p>Japanese international Hiroki Sakai has been named as the first captain of Auckland FC for the upcoming A-League season.</p>
        
            <p>The 34-year-old defender has represented his country in three FIFA World Cups, two Olympic Games and played at the highest level of European football.</p>
        
            <p>Sakai will be supported by two vice-captains - All White Tommy Smith and Australian Jake Brimmer.</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer joined the team from Melbourne Victory, where he won the Johnny Warren Medal for the 2021-22 season. Smith has played more than 53 games for New Zealand as well as 247 for English Premier League club Ipswich Town.</p>
        
            <p>Sakai said he was "surprised" to be appointed captain and would be relying on his leadership group.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand the responsibility and pride that comes with being captain of this team.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to lead Auckland FC and work with such a talented and committed squad, including Jake and Tommy, who will play crucial roles in guiding us through the season. Together, we're ready to take on the challenges ahead and make our supporters proud."</p>
