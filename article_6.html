            <p>The world champion White Ferns have been soundly beaten by Sri Lanka in the first T20I in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Looking far from the conquerers of 2024, the Ferns slumped to a seven-wicket defeat, after posting just 101 with the bat.</p>
        
            <p>Anushka Sanjeewani would take three stumpings in an innings that never got off the ground, Emma McLeod top scoring with 44.</p>
        
            <p>Losing three quick wickets at the top of the order put the Ferns firmly on the back foot, regular dismissals ensuring a shoddy and subpar total.</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Plimmer was out in the second over for two to bring McLeod to the crease early.</p>
        
            <p>Suzie Bates and Brooke Halliday both fell cheaply, while Izzy Sharp went for a two-ball duck to have the hosts in serious strife at 57 for 4.</p>
        
            <p>Just as she and Jess Kerr were looking to consolidate, Kerr was stumped to the bowling of Inoshi Priyadharshani.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Chamari Athapaththu then had Polly Inglis caught out of her crease on four, Sanjeewani with her third stumping.</p>
        
            <p>As the Ferns meandered towards a hundred, they lost their eighth, Rosemary Mair holding out to Sugandika Kumari.</p>
        
            <p>They would bring up the century but not much more, Eden Carson coming and going for seven, with McLeod the last to go for a fighting 44, Malki Madara mopping things up with her third scalp of the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka cruised to 46 after six, driven by captain Chamari Athapaththu until Kerr finally broke through and sent Vishmi Gunaratne back to the sheds for seven.</p>
        
            <p>They would post 50 in the eighth over, leaving them requiring just 51 from 72 balls.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Ferns were up for a fight as Kerr removed Harshitha Samarawickrama while Carson forced a run out soon after to give the hosts hope.</p>
        
            <p>Athapaththu brought up her half century with a six off Illing, taking 17 from the over to bring the required runs down to just 11.</p>
        
            <p>She finished unbeaten on 64 as Sri Lanka waltzed home with 35 balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Game two is on Sunday.</p>
