            <p>Analysis - Even though the Warriors fell just one game short of the big dance last year, the 2023 season was definitely one of the club's most successful - growth, development, winning back the affection of the adoring New Zealand public who have been starved of any real success dating back to the early 2010s and, for a change, just winning in general.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster enters his second season with no feelings of the infamous NRL second-year curse lingering around at all. If anything, it's the complete opposite. After a summer of talking what-ifs around BBQs nationwide, with chants of "Up the Wahs" ringing up and down the country and a serious genuine feeling that this might indeed actually be "their year" - the club is closer than ever in their 29-year history to realising the dreams of winning a maiden NRL Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>Here's the main talking points as the Warriors 2024 season gets underway.</p>
        
            <p>Starting off with the man on everyone's mind, rugby league icon Roger Tuivasa-Sheck finally returns home back to Mt Smart after two long years in the rival code - and it looks like he hasn't missed a beat.</p>
        
            <p>Hungrier than ever, RTS has already fronted up in the trial matches with the raw speed and power that he has always been known for, showing any talk about him struggling to return to a more demanding game in the world's toughest competition was just that: all talk. He looked right at home when the Warriors opted to play him at fullback during the second half of the Dolphins trial match, so the option is still there if injuries strike.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have a rich history of securing Australian imports to help bolster their forward pack. We only have to reflect back to the likes of former club captain and all-round legend Steve Price, Queensland's ultimate hard man Michael Luck, New South Wales and Melbourne Storm hero Ryan Hoffman.</p>
        
            <p>Transitioning to what just might be the modern day alternative to Warriors stalwart Kevin Campion, enter Kurt Capewell.</p>
        
            <p>After working together with coach Webster in their time at Penrith, premiership winning second rower Capewell's situation at the Brisbane Broncos with one year left on his contract was a perfect situation for the Warriors. With Ezra Mam keen to be locked in on a long term deal, they needed the cap space that freed up the Warriors to make an offer. It's the first time since 2017 the Warriors have had a State of Origin forward on their books with Capewell boasting nine games and two series victories for Queensland.</p>

            <p>Surrounded by other talent across the entire paddock, the return to form of these three players was really the catalyst that saw the Warriors catapult from finishing second last in the 2022 season to making it to the final four last year. If these three players can play as they did last season for the Warriors this year the club will be in with a serious chance of making it all the way to the big dance in October and maybe even going one better than they ever have before in winning the NRL Premiership.</p>

            <p>Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad's hamstring injury will mean he misses the first few games of the NRL season. CNK is arguably one of the most underrated fullbacks in the world over the last decade and a man in red hot form, but his injury gives a chance for fullback Taine Tuaupiki to fill his boots as showed during the clubs recent trial matches with his electric footwork and sharp pace.</p>
        
            <p>But that's not all when it comes to depth, in a line-up that already boasts the likes of Shaun Johnson and Luke Metcalf in the halves, Toa Samoa international standoff Chanel Harris-Tavita and former Kiwi halfback Te Maire Martin are waiting for their chance. Club stalwart Jazz Tevaga, Mangere East's favourite son Edward Kosi and MƒÅori All-Star Adam Pompey are also currently on the fringes. For a club chronically plagued by injuries in important positions at crucial times in the past, this season presents more than capable talent itching for the call up to first grade.</p>
