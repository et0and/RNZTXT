            <p>The Black Caps are facing their first ever Test series loss to Bangladesh and go into Wednesday's second Test with plenty to work on.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh won the first match by 150 runs in Sylhet last week, just their second ever Test victory over New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Tim Southee said they have to trust their methods are good enough on the local wickets.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the guys that haven't played in this part of the world will have learnt from that (first test)," Southee said on the eve of the match.</p>
        
            <p>He admits they do need the batters to put on partnerships.</p>
        
            <p>"All the guys have different ways of going about it and it's just about trusting that and doing it for longer."</p>
        
            <p>Southee said the bowlers also have to be better on what is expected to be another spin-friendly surface.</p>
        
            <p>"We talked about it after the last game that we have to be more consistent for longer as a bowling group."</p>
        
            <p>Batting all-rounder Daryl Mitchell said patience will be key if they are to square the series in what will again be incredibly challenging conditions in Dhaka.</p>
        
            <p>"Just doing things for longer, I think we did it really well for patches in the (first) test.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what test cricket is all about it's five days of grind and that is something that we love.</p>
        
            <p>"Just being really consistent with bat and ball and applying pressure and hoping if you apply enough pressure for long periods then the other team will crumble."</p>
        
            <p>Spin bowlers Ish Sodhi and Ajaz Patel were both expensive at times in the first test, while Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls failed with the bat.</p>
        
            <p>However, changes are unlikely, with Rachin Ravindra and Mitchell Santner possibly being considered for selection.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh have already won three tests in 2023 which matches their best for results in a calendar year in 2014 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Some rain is forecast for the second day of the test.</p>
