            <p>The White Ferns are looking for a reversal of fortunes ahead of a change of formats against Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns lost the T20 series 2-1 but showed glimpses of a return to form in the final outing in Queenstown on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Stand in skipper Amelia Kerr bagged three wickets and made 35 runs while Suzie Bates guided the side home with an unbeaten 52.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Devine, who sat out the final T20 with a knee injury, returns to the squad for the opening game on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"It was obviously disappointing to miss that third game, they obviously didn't miss me too much taking a win but really excited to be back."</p>
        
            <p>After two comprehensive defeats to begin the tour, Devine said they will look to bounce back by playing aggressive, attacking 50-over cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about going back to our strengths and knowing what we do well, particularly playing in New Zealand conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Devine said with rankings points up for grabs, it's imperative the senior players step up.</p>
        
            <p>"As a collective, we had some really hard conversations amongst ourselves and with management around where we need to be better and where our expectations lie. It probably took a little bit too long to get there but nice to see that I guess there was a bit of change amongst a group."</p>
        
            <p>She admits the side has been below par during recent tours to Sri Lanka and South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that we haven't been playing our best cricket but we were slowly piecing it together in that third game. It's really important for us heading into this ODI series and that we are performing to the standards that we know that we're capable of."</p>
        
            <p>Sitting six spots ahead of Pakistan on the world ODI rankings, the White Ferns go into game one as favourites despite the T20 series loss.</p>
        
            <p>"We always knew that Pakistan were going to be incredibly strong and they've proven that, I think they've really come out here to make a point, they've been outstanding we could probably learn a thing or two from them in terms of the way that they've thrown themselves around the outfield in particular."</p>
        
            <p>Devine said she is fit and firing after a long campaign in the women's Big Bash League where she finished fifth in the run scoring charts.</p>
        
            <p>"The knee is feeling really good. It was planned out in advance to have it done straight after the the second T20 to give me ample opportunity to be fit and ready for the ODI series."</p>
        
            <p>First ball is at 11am.</p>
