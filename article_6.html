            <p>Seven times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton is set for a shock switch from Mercedes to Ferrari in 2025 as replacement for Spanish driver Carlos Sainz, according to multiple media reports.</p>
        
            <p>Mercedes and Ferrari declined to comment on speculation that would be by far the most sensational driver move of the so-called 'silly season'.</p>
        
            <p>Sky Sports television said it understood Mercedes principal Toto Wolff would brief the team before a formal announcement later today.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton, 39, has been with Mercedes since 2013 and won his first title with McLaren in 2008. His current contract is due to expire at the end of next year and a move to Ferrari would surely extend that into the sport's new engine era in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>The Briton has been linked with Maranello repeatedly during his career, particularly when his contract has been up for renewal, but he signed a new two year deal with Mercedes last August.</p>
        
            <p>Despite his loyalty to Mercedes, Hamilton has remained close to Ferrari boss Fred Vasseur after winning Formula Three and GP2 (now Formula Two) championships with the Frenchman's ART team as a junior in 2005 and 2006.</p>
        
            <p>Vasseur said last August that he talked to Hamilton at every race weekend.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, Wolff said Hamilton and Mercedes had discussed the possibility of the driver one day racing for Ferrari and such a move would be no drama.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to simply acknowledge that probably it's in every driver's head to drive at Ferrari one day," the Austrian said then.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the most iconic, historic Formula One brand out there and I totally respect if a driver has the desire to drive at Ferrari.</p>
        
            <p>"Even within the team we have discussed it and with Lewis we have discussed it and we have agreed on the topic."</p>
        
            <p>The most successful Formula One driver of all time, with a record 103 wins and 104 pole positions in a career that started in 2007, Hamilton has not won a race since December 2021 as Mercedes struggled to match Red Bull and Max Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen has won the last three titles and starts 2024 as favourite for a fourth. The Dutch 26-year-old has a contract to the end of 2028.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton would join Charles Leclerc at Ferrari, with the Italian team announcing a week ago that the Monegasque had signed on for several more seasons.</p>
        
            <p>McLaren also ensured Lando Norris, who had been seen by some as a possible future replacement for Hamilton, was off the market by announcing a new deal on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>A move to Ferrari would likely be Hamilton's Formula One swansong and a calculated risk, with the 2026 rule changes leaving everyone entering new territory.</p>
        
            <p>The possibility of a record eighth title, if not with Mercedes this season, with a third team would also be a sensational step.</p>
