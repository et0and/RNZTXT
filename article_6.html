            <p>New Zealand's rugby union is seeking more information from global governing body World Rugby following France's unilateral decision to exclude some national squad players from next year's test series against the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>The French rugby union said this week that players who compete for teams in Top 14 finals will not be selected for July internationals in 2025 and 2026 as part of an agreement with the domestic league on player availability.</p>
        
            <p>The decision is in defiance of World Rugby's Regulation 9, which specifies that players must be available for selection during international windows.</p>
        
            <p>It all but ensures France will bring a weakened squad to New Zealand for the July tour next year given the prevalence of its leading players in Top 14 which finishes with June playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby said it was aware of the French rugby union's plans to manage player welfare but was "surprised" by the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeking further information and clarification from both World Rugby and the French union to better understand the situation," NZR said.</p>
        
            <p>A World Rugby spokesperson said Regulation 9 and its test selection window were "clear" but declined to comment further.</p>
        
            <p>France has previously toured Southern Hemisphere nations with under-strength squads for mid-year tests without openly stating its selection priorities in advance.</p>
        
            <p>The French rugby union's agreement with Top 14 organisers also included provisions on player availability for the Six Nations.</p>
        
            <p>However, the policy prioritises test selection over Top 14 club duties during the Northern Hemisphere tournament.</p>
