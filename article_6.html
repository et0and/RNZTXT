            <p>A former West Australian bikie gang member has won the New Zealand Golf Open at Queenstown's Millbrook resort.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Peake carded a final round of five-under par to finish the tournament 23-under, one shot clear of his closest rivals.</p>
        
            <p>The win gave Peake automatic qualification for the Open Championship at Royal Portrush, UK, later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Peake was very emotional after claiming the victory. Ten years ago he was sentenced to five years in prison for a serious assault while a member of an illegal bikie gang, the Rebels, putting a halt to his promising golf career.</p>
        
            <p>"It's life-changing. From this morning when I woke up to being four shots behind and try and chase down a win, never been in a final group of a tour event to now being a member of the Asian tour, tour winner, you know, second on the Australian order of merit chasing down a European tour card as well? It's lots of change."</p>

            <p>The New Zealand Open tournament also doubled as a pro-am, mixing teams of professionals hunting the Open trophy with amateur golfers like sporting stars, businesspeople and Hollywood actors.</p>
        
            <p>One of them was Michael Peña, an American actor known for films such as Ant-Man, The Martian, Shooter and Crash.</p>
        
            <p>His first impressions of Queenstown and New Zealand were that it was "better than the postcards".</p>
        
            <p>"It's so beautiful here in the mountains, the golf courses, the ambiance, the people… if I get the invite, I'd like to come back."</p>
        
            <p>He found out about the New Zealand Open from fellow golfer Austin Bautista.</p>
        
            <p>"I play with him a lot in Tampa, and he just, you know, out of the blue says, 'Hey, man, like, would you want to come into the New Zealand Open? Within a week, he was like the fifth person to tell me that this is one of the best pro-ams worldwide… I wasn't working, so I was like, I made sure to make it out this time."</p>
        
            <p>Peña and Bautista finished several shots back from the winners.</p>
        
            <p>He planned to come back for more than a week next time to check out some of New Zealand's other golf courses - and perhaps some skiing spots if he's shooting a movie in the snow.</p>
