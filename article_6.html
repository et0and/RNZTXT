            <p>Black Caps opener Finn Allen thumped 137 from 62 balls to help the home side post a formidable total of 224 for seven against Pakistan this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The Universal Oval's dimensions proved little hurdle for the opener. He flayed a T20 international record equalling 16 sixes.</p>
        
            <p>Read that again. Sixteen sixes.</p>

            <p>And some of them were in the air for an awful long time.</p>
        
            <p>And some of them disappeared out of the ground.</p>
        
            <p>The spare box of balls was called on regularly.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket ought to invoice him.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Seifert played a nice cameo of 31. He fed the strike to Allen and combined in a partnership of 125 for the second wicket.</p>

            <p>Allen got a standing ovation when he finally dragged a delivery on and was dismissed.</p>
        
            <p>His total of 137 is the highest for New Zealand, eclipsing the 123 Brendon McCullum whacked against Bangladesh in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>He certainly treated the sell-out crowd to a wonderful display of power hitting.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's total was the highest T20 innings at the venue, so Pakistan will need to break the record to keep the five-game series alive. They trail 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps are undefeated at the University Oval across all three formats.</p>
        
            <p>The game is sold out. Capacity is 4000.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand XI: Finn Allen, Devon Conway, Tim Seifert (wk), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner (c), Matthew Henry, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan XI: Mohammad Rizwan (vc), Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi (c), Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Haris Rauf, Zaman Khan.</p>
