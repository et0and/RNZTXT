            <p>Things are ramping up in June - we've got the business end of Super Rugby Pacific closely followed by an All Black squad announcement. The Warriors enter a crucial period for their season, while international football and the NBA finals take centre stage.</p>
        
            <p>Here's all you need to know.</p>

            <p>For everyone complaining about the overly generous playoff system, good news. This almost certainly will be the last time it happens, given the news of the Melbourne Rebels being wound up at the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Ironically, they'll feature in this year's quarterfinals, but we're looking at a trip to either Eden Park or Sky Stadium for the final on 22 June.</p>

            <p>All eyes will then turn to Sumner rugby club on 24 June, when Scott Robertson unveils his first-ever All Black side. Will he stick with his Crusaders players after their awful season, or ring the changes and give the side a fresh new look?</p>

            <p>The Wahs head to Townsville before returning to two sold-out Mt Smart crowds for a huge match against the Storm and Broncos. Sandwiched in between those is a chance for revenge against the Titans on the GC, in what is generally regarded as a home game anyway. Meanwhile, New South Wales and Queensland go into battle in Sydney next Wednesday in what will be another big Origin series.</p>

            <p>Football's coming home... and by home, we mean to the country that's won the most combined World Cup and Euro Championships. Germany is the destination for the best of Europe, and the hosts are coming in with a point to prove after getting bounced out of the pool stage in Qatar. All eyes will be on Gareth Southgate's England, can they go one better than their dramatic final loss in 2021? The championship starts on 15 June.</p>

            <p>The Tactix and Pulse currently sit atop the table but there's still plenty of the netball season to go. The real question is at the other end of the table, where the Stars somehow have not won a game so far. If they can break their duck early in June there is a chance they can salvage something from what's turning into a nightmare campaign.</p>

            <p>The UFC Lightweight Championship is on the line between current champion Islam Makhachev and former interim champion Dustin Poirier on 2 June. They headline the event alongside Sean Strickland and Paulo Costa for the middleweight title.</p>

            <p>Can cricket take over America? That's the big question, alongside whether the Black Caps can continue their impressive run at tournaments and go deep in the smash and bash format. They certainly should make it through their group, which includes Papua New Guinea and Uganda, so we might see a few records getting broken along the way. The tournament starts on 2 June.</p>

            <p>The Boston Celtics are seemingly unstoppable this season and made short work of their Eastern Conference play-off series against the Indiana Pacers, winning in a 4-0 sweep. They will head into the best-of-seven finals series as favourites against the Dallas Mavericks. The finals start on 7 June.</p>
