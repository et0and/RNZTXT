            <p>Black Cap Henry Nicholls' comfort at the crease in Nelson continued as New Zealand beat Bangladesh by seven wickets in the second ODI on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Set 292 for victory, Nicholls brought up his highest score in four years as he toiled for 95 runs off 99 balls at Saxton Oval.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls had only passed three figures in an ODI once in his career, in 2019 against Sri Lanka, in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday Nicholls, batting at number three, and opener Will Young provided the backbone for the series win.</p>
        
            <p>Young scored his 8th ODI 50 as he survived a couple of chances before being caught and bowled for 89.</p>
        
            <p>Rachin Ravindra was the first of the Black Caps to be dismissed as headed back to the shed with 45 off 33 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Latham (34) and Tom Blundell (24) got New Zealand home in the 47th over.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Bangladesh opener Soumya Sarkar had scored a record 169 runs as he watched his batting partners struggle to deal with the Black Caps bowlers.</p>
        
            <p>Not only was that Soumya Sarkar's highest ODI score it was the also the highest score in an ODI by a Bangladeshi player against New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Number six batter Mushfiqur Rahim contributed 45 as no other batter scored above 19 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Will O'Rouke and Jacob Duffy both recorded their best ODI bowling figures as they took 3-47 and 3-51 respectively.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand lead the three match series 2-0 with the final game on Saturday in Napier.</p>
