            <p>Black Ferns assistant coach Mike Delany has resigned after a mixed season of results with the side.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Delany said he believed it was the right decision "for himself and the team to make the change ahead of next year's Rugby World Cup in England."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns played eight tests this year winning, winning only four of them.</p>
        
            <p>They had wins over the USA, Australia and France but lost to England twice, along with Ireland and Canada.</p>
        
            <p>"The 2024 season was challenging for the group with mixed performances on the field, but also for myself personally juggling family. A world cup year needs total commitment to give the team the best chance to defend their title, with that in mind, I've made a pretty tough call to step aside," Delany said.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns director of rugby Allan Bunting acknowledged Delany's contribution to the team.</p>
        
            <p>"Mike's a quality coach and person and the passion and care he's brought to the environment over the past two seasons has been significant. He has a breadth of knowledge and his honesty and input to the group will be valuable as we look toward 2025.</p>
