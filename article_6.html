            <p>Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel said he is thinking about a Formula 1 comeback and talking to Mercedes boss Toto Wolff and others.</p>
        
            <p>The retired German driver, 36, told Sky Sports television he was "potentially" in the market for a 2025 seat.</p>
        
            <p>"Potentially I am because I haven't got a drive, but the question is, am I looking for one? I think it depends on the package," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I retired from Formula 1 not to come back, but I also did say that you never know. So I think it still stands."</p>
        
            <p>Vettel won his four titles with Red Bull and retired at the end of 2022 after a final season with Aston Martin, following a six-year stint at Ferrari.</p>

            <p>Mercedes have a vacancy for 2025, with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, now 39 but still younger than 42-year-old Fernando Alonso, departing for Ferrari at the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The German manufacturer last had a German driver with Nico Rosberg, who retired suddenly after winning the 2016 world championship.</p>
        
            <p>"You never know where life is taking you, so maybe it takes me back behind the wheel, maybe it doesn't," said Vettel, who recently tested a Porsche Penske Le Mans hypercar and could debut in the 24-hour race.</p>
        
            <p>Vettel was asked by Sky whether he would be able to resist an opportunity with Mercedes, should it be offered.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had conversations with [Wolff], not really about the seat. We did speak about the whole situation in short as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I did speak to others as well because I'm still keeping in touch every now and then. I have some projects and ideas together with F1. We'll see if they will turn out or not.</p>
        
            <p>"So I am staying in touch. I don't know. It has to be a couple more phone calls and conversations, I guess, to really find out a little bit more. But for sure it's one of the best seats on the grid."</p>
