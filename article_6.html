        <p>
After a wobbly start, Chanel Harris-Tavita was back in form with the boot.

            <p>The smile said it all as Chanel Harris-Tavita watched his conversion sail through the sticks to rapturous applause at Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors halfback endured a week of harsh criticism after his missed shots at goal cost the Warriors the game against the Raiders in Canberra.</p>
        
            <p>However, Harris-Tavita redeemed himself in Auckland on Friday night with three from five with the boot.</p>
        
            <p>It was a shaky start with two corner conversions going wayward, but when the Warriors struck just before halftime, Harris-Tavita ensured he iced it with two points.</p>
        
            <p>A Damian McKenzie-esque smile came across his face as he lined up the third shot, one he said was his last chance before delegating the duties, but his radar returned to a thundering ovation.</p>
        
            <p>"I needed that, if i missed that I was giving the tee away, but once that went over I was pretty confident to take the next couple."</p>
        
            <p>He said the smile helped him relax after the sitter he shanked against the Raiders left him feeling unsure about himself.</p>
        
            <p>"Since that kick I felt a bit nervous and uptight heading into the game so I did a lot of reps this week and felt more confident especially after that one went over."</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita said he blocked out the noise surrounding him this week.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't hear it too much, I've got a good circle of mates around me, so that helped me focus on what was important this week."</p>
        
            <p>After being thrust into the goalkicking role following the injury to Adam Pompey during the clash in Canberra, Harris-Tavita conceded it was simply a lack of practice that cost him.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't do any reps last week, so that was the learning for me."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster said he always had faith in his halfback.</p>
        
            <p>"I just thought it was pretty cool the way the whole crowd gave him a cheer and got behind him, sometimes footy can be a bit too serious can't it? When he got that one I think the whole of New Zealand was pretty happy for him."</p>
