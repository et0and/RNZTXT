            <p>It's going from bad to worse for the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Super Rugby Pacific defending champions have suffered a fourth straight loss for the first time in the franchise's illustrious history.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Hurricanes remain undefeated at the top of the table following the dramatic 14-10 win in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement lock Justin Sangster scored the match-winner in the 77th minute and with the Crusaders given one final shot at victory, former All Black Owen Franks put a shoulder onto a Hurricane's player's head to see the collapse of the once formidable franchise continue.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper David Havili admitted it's a frustrating time.</p>
        
            <p>"We are trying really hard, it's just not sticking. We gave ourselves a chance in the contest tonight and couldn't really finish it off, the boys have got to stick tight, we are up for another big battle next weekend."</p>
        
            <p>It's a daunting prospect awaiting the side, who meet the Blues at Eden Park next Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"They are trying their guts out, it's a tough one to take, but we have got a young group willing to turn up each day and get better and that's what we are going to do," Havili told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes halfback TJ Perenara was relishing in what is just the seventh win for his side in Christchurch.</p>

            <p>"It's a tough place to win, I know they haven't started the season the way they wanted to, but they are still a force to be reckoned with and getting a win over them down here is important for our season."</p>
        
            <p>Neither Jordie nor Scott Barrett were available for their sides on what was a drizzly evening in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes scored the opening try after 15 minutes, as Cam Roigard popped it up for a storming Tyrel Lomax to crash over from short range.</p>
        
            <p>Both Brett Cameron and Riley Hohepa pushed penalty attempts wide to keep the score at 7-0 at halftime, though it didn't reflect the dominance the Hurricanes had over the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>A huge reprieve came for the Crusaders five minutes after the break.</p>
        
            <p>Roigard appeared to have scored a second for the Canes after he streaked 70 metres up field, however replays showed he had knocked the ball forward out of Willie Heinz's hands, and the Crusaders dodged a bullet.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders were finally able to string some phases together and started to ask questions of the Hurricane's.</p>
        
            <p>The relentless pressure would prove too much, Cullen Grace finally cracking the Hurricane's desperate defence to lock the scores at 7-all.</p>
        
            <p>With ten minutes to play, Hohepa put the home side in front for the first time 10-7.</p>
        
            <p>Cameron had the chance to even the honours, but once again his attempt went wide of the upright.</p>
        
            <p>Jamie Hannah was then sent to the sin bin for repeated infringements as his side was camped on their try line with time ticking away.</p>
        
            <p>A Hurricane's attacking scrum saw the Crusaders penalised, with replacement Du'Plessis Kirifi opting for a quick tap.</p>
        
            <p>Sangster picked and went from the following phase, doing just enough to get the ball on the grass.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders recovered the kick off to give themselves a final shot at the win, before Franks' brain-fade ended any hopes of a late miracle.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 14 (Lomax, Sangster, tries, Cameron 2 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders 10 (Grace, tries, Hohepa 1 con, 1 pen)</p>
