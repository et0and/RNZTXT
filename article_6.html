            <p>American Madison Keys produced an inspired display to beat defending champion Aryna Sabalenka 6-3 2-6 7-5 in the Australian Open final on Saturday and capture her maiden Grand Slam title.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old, who became the fourth-oldest first-time Grand Slam champion in the professional era, ended top seed Sabalenka's bid for a third straight Melbourne Park crown.</p>
        
            <p>"Okay bear with me I'm absolutely going to cry," Keys said as she cradled the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no way I get through this in tears ... Congrats Aryna, unbelievable playing, I'm glad I finally got you back.</p>
        
            <p>"I always feel so at home here. I made my very first Grand Slam semi-final in Melbourne, to now have won my first final in the same place means the absolute world to me."</p>
        
            <p>Belarusian Sabalenka made a couple of double faults to drop serve in the opening game and looked off colour in the early exchanges as Keys heaped pressure on the top seed with a dipping crosscourt winner en route to a double break.</p>
        
            <p>The 19th seed rode her luck after a net cord winner and went up 5-1 in 20 minutes before conceding a break with a wayward backhand before Sabalenka gifted her set point with a fourth double fault.</p>
        
            <p>Keys, who was hitting much harder than her opponent on both flanks, fired her 11th winner with a backhand down the line to clinch the opening set but Sabalenka began to mix up her game in the next set and sliced her way through to level the match.</p>
        
            <p>Both players relied on their powerful serves and shot-making to remain level until 5-5 in the decider but there was one final momentum shift as Keys produced blistering winners to claim the next two games and the biggest triumph of her career.</p>
        
            <p>She was overcome by emotion and shed tears with her team in the stands, while Sabalenka smashed her racket and covered her face with a towel.</p>
        
            <p>Keys is the first player to claim the trophy by defeating the world number one and two at a major since Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 French Open and the first at Melbourne Park since compatriot Serena Williams 20 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The American was beaten by compatriot Sloane Stephens in the 2017 U.S. Open final and has since struggled to go past the quarter-finals and semi-finals at major tournaments.</p>
        
            <p>"I have wanted this for so long I have been in one other Grand Slam final and it didn't go my way," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know if I was going to get to this position every again. But my team believed in me so much... they believed in me when I didn't believe in myself."</p>
        
            <p>Sabalenka's smile returned later but she was left to digest a rare defeat in the Grand Slam that has defined her career.</p>
        
            <p>"Madison, wow, what a tournament," said Sabalenka.</p>
        
            <p>"You've been fighting really hard to get this trophy... Congrats to you and your team really well deserved. Enjoy the celebration, enjoy the fun part.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though I didn't get it this year, I'll come back stronger and do my best next year."</p>
        
            <p>Showing the charisma that has endeared her to fans around the world, Sabalenka jokingly blamed the loss on her team in the stands.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to see you for the next week, I really hate you," she added to laughter from the crowd. "No really, thank you very much for all you're doing for me, blah blah blah."</p>
        
            <p>Keys became the second oldest woman to capture her first Australian Open singles title in the professional era after China's Li Na, who was 31 when she won the title in Melbourne 11 years ago.</p>
