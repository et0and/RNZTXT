            <p>A masterclass from Damian McKenzie has seen the Chiefs dispatch the Fijian Drua 46-29 in Hamilton tonight.</p>
        
            <p>The All Black playmaker was in irresistible form with the ball in hand as the Chiefs ran in six stunning tries to pick up their third win of their Super Rugby Pacific campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Anton Lienert Brown gave fans a scare as he was seen prone on the ground after a head clash and required a stretcher from the field, causing a long delay.</p>
        
            <p>However, in a relieving sight the midfielder was back on his feet after the game.</p>
        
            <p>The win put the Chiefs hot on the heels of the unbeaten Hurricanes, Chiefs skipper Luke Jacobson telling Sky Sport it was a predictably physical battle.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew Fiji were going to be tough, once they get that ball in hand, a few offloads, they are a hard team to stop."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was pleasing to implement some razzle dazzle against the masters of ad-lib footy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice when it comes off but there were a few stages there where we were a bit loose with ball in hand but its pretty awesome when those play come off."</p>
        
            <p>The Drua would strike first at FMG, McKenzie spilling a high ball which was pounced on by Iosefo Masi, the Drua centre streaking 50 metres away untouched.</p>
        
            <p>The response from the Chiefs was swift, a slick linoeut move sending Daniel Rona through a hole, linking with Lachlan Boshier to go in under the horns.</p>
        
            <p>The tries kept coming, Rameka Poihipi scything through a gaping hole and finding his halfback Cortez Ratima backing up on the inside.</p>

            <p>A quick tap signalled the Drua's clear attacking intentions inside the 22, Masi scoring a second as he waltzed through some poor Chiefs defence to square the ledger.</p>
        
            <p>A McKenzie penalty pushed his side ahead before the All Black rocketed to the right of the ruck, sending a beautiful pass wide to send Rona over.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs looked to have bagged a fourth on the stroke of half-time, but Samipeni Finau's effort was scrubbed with the ball touching the sideline as he attempted to ground it.</p>
        
            <p>A strong surge from Lienert-Brown put his side back in the red zone, Etene Nanai-Seturo the beneficiary of some crisp Chief's handling.</p>

            <p>The Drua enjoyed a wealth of possession and territory but couldn't breach the Chiefs' line, Samisoni Taukei'aho coming up with a crucial turnover as the visitors looked sure to score.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs dug the knife in further as Boshier found himself unmarked on the wing and strolled over for his second.</p>
        
            <p>The action was halted as Lienert-Brown was attended to, but Te Ahiwaru Cirikidaveta then pulled one back for the Drua after the resumption on the back of a sharp lineout move but the result was well out of reach.</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Stevenson ensured that with a brilliant piece of individual brilliance, regathering a pinpoint chip and chase to score the Chief's sixth.</p>
        
            <p>The spirited Drua effort was rewarded with a consolation try through Kemu Valetini, but the visitors had been well and truly out-classed by a rampant Chiefs outfit.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs will meet the Highlanders next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 46 (Boshier 2, Ratima, Rona, Nanai-Seturo, Stevenson, tries, McKenzie 5 cons, 1 pen)</p>
        
            <p>Drua 29 (Masi 2, Cirikidaveta, Valetini tries, Armstrong-Ravula 3 cons, 1 pen)</p>
