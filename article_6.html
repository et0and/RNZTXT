            <p>The way in which it happened was spectacular, but that doesn't make losing any easier to stomach for Warriors coach Andrew Webster.</p>
        
            <p>His side is winless after two rounds of the NRL, and are looking to bounce back against the Raiders in Christchurch this Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>"It hurts more. We shouldn't have been in that situation, it was a freakish try but it's hard to feel happy for them and appreciate how amazing that try was," Webster said, referring to Melbourne Storm wing Xavier Coates' incredible last-play finish to hand the Warriors a 30-26 loss on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to getting rid of that yuck feeling from the weekend. I just feel for the boys, they put so much effort in and didn't get the result. I genuinely think our footy is some of the best footy in the NRL right now."</p>
        
            <p>There was plenty to like in the Warriors' performance, which is why Webster has resisted the urge to change his initial squad. The Raiders come in having won both their opening matches comfortably, which Webster puts down to their accurate kicking game.</p>
        
            <p>"They've just competed for everything. The way they've scored their tries off kicks, firstly it's a good kick and then they're just competing for the ball and coming up with it.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they're the best in the NRL and completions, so they're good at playing early round football. Canberra have been very good in the early rounds at a big, long kick.</p>
        
            <p>"They love their kick-chase… against Newcastle in round one they just strangled their opposition. So that's what we want to be as well, we pride ourselves on our kick-chase."</p>
        
            <p>The last time the sides met also featured a crazy finish - in round 21 last year the Warriors seemed to be cruising to a workmanlike 20-8 win before the Raiders ran in two tries in the final two minutes. A subsequent Shaun Johnson golden point field saw the Warriors take the win, and a valuable lesson.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't assume it's done, on the weekend something similar happened, didn't it?" said Webster.</p>
        
            <p>"One thing I did learn that night is if you gather yourself and concentrate and get back on task, you can win a game of footy. We had no momentum going into golden point that night, but we found a way to get it done."</p>
        
            <p>Hooker Wayde Egan has been named to start, but will be given until Friday to prove his fitness, after missing the Melbourne game with an arm injury picked up in round one.</p>
        
            <p>"It's better than it was, he trained today so that's good. We'll know more later, he's a step closer than last week," said Webster.</p>
        
            <p>Webster is looking forward to a sold-out Apollo Projects Stadium, in what will be his first NRL regular season match in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously we've had a couple of trials there… full house, great atmosphere, looking forward to it."</p>
