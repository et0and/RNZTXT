            <p>France delivered a 100th victory for manager Didier Deschamps as they beat a tenacious and well organised Austria side 1-0 in their opening Group D match at Euro 2024 but talisman Kylian Mbappe suffered a worrying injury.</p>
        
            <p>It was by no means a vintage performance though and France required an own goal by Austria defender Max Wober shortly before halftime to secure the three points.</p>
        
            <p>But, three years after bowing out of Euro 2020 in the last 16 to Switzerland, France offered enough evidence to suggest they will be go much deeper in Germany.</p>
        
            <p>It proved a very mixed night for France's captain Mbappe though as he was left still searching for his first goal in a European Championship and went off bloodied late on with a suspected broken nose.</p>
        
            <p>On his 80th appearance for Les Bleus the 25-year-old's wing wizardry broke Austria's resistance in the 38th minute when his dribble past three defenders and cross caused the unfortunate Wober to head past his goalkeeper Patrick Pentz.</p>
        
            <p>But Mbappe also wasted a glorious chance to make things more comfortable for his side in the 54th minute, surprising virtually everyone in the stadium as he shot wide of the post after bursting through on goal.</p>
        
            <p>He ended up bloodied and bruised after taking a shoulder to the face in the closing minutes before being shown a yellow card having sat down on the pitch shortly after coming back on after receiving treatment.</p>
        
            <p>France join the Netherlands, who they face next, on three points after the Dutch beat Poland 2-1 on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Slovakia delivered the first major shock result of the tournament, snatching an early goal and defending furiously to hold on for a 1-0 victory over Belgium in Group E.</p>
        
            <p>Belgium were wasteful in front of goal and created enough opportunities to win comfortably but a mixture of poor finishing and some excellent Slovakia defending kept them at bay.</p>
        
            <p>Belgium had two Romelu Lukaku goals ruled out by VAR - one for offside and, more controversially, for a handball by Lois Openda in the build-up.</p>
        
            <p>Slovakia joined Romania at the top of the group standings after their 3-0 win over Ukraine.</p>
