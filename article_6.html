            <p>Kiwi boxer David Nyika is feeling more dangerous than ever as he gets set for a career defining fight and his chance to break into the top 15 rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika will fight undefeated German Michael Seitz in Riyadh on 19 May on the undercard of the heavyweight clash between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk.</p>
        
            <p>The bout will be sanctioned with both the WBO and the IBF.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my my opportunity to break into the big leagues, get into the top 15 and from there we just start hacking away at whoever is on that list," Nyika said.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old said he is in the best condition of his career ahead of his biggest fight thus far.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been my best camp to date and I'm getting the results. I think it's just come down to my discipline around training, push my body to its limits, but also just really stripping it back to the fundamentals of eating well, sleeping well, recovery. I really feel like I've nailed it this time."</p>
        
            <p>With the card already being postponed after Fury suffered a cut in training, Nyika is wary of suffering a similar fate.</p>
        
            <p>"If I were to push any harder I'd only risk damage. I just don't want to slip at the last hurdle, it's just a matter of getting to the dance now."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika said he has been sparring with heavyweights in order to sharpen his punching power.</p>

            <p>"The majority of my sparring has been with world renowned heavyweights, I can rip into the big boys a bit as opposed to if you're sparring smaller guys, so I feel supremely confident that I'll be able to deal with Michael Seitz."</p>
        
            <p>He is not anticipating a long night at the office in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        
            <p>"If this fight goes past six or seven rounds, I'll be impressed. I don't see Michael Seitz being able to deal with my adaptability. I'll be able to adapt to whatever he throws at me and if I have to weather an early storm, it will just make the collapse that much more magnificent."</p>
        
            <p>While he does acknowledge that Seitz is a step up in competition, Nyika said he considers himself the best cruiserweight in the world, so his undefeated record is not under threat.</p>
        
            <p>"Against a guy that's 12 and zero with ten knockouts he doesn't know how to lose. I often find that the best fights are when you have two willing and able contenders go against each other because you'll bring the best out of each other. I'm hoping that he's going to come to tango."</p>
        
            <p>The main event will mark the first time the heavyweight title has been unified since Mike Tyson, which brings with it a substantial audience but Nyika remains relaxed.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always performed under pressure and this will be no different."</p>
        
            <p>As well as a career breakout performance, Nyika is also looking to help combat a disease close to his heart, using the fight to raise funds to fight Malaria in Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika has raised more than $30,000 so far, and intends to pledge $10 for every punch he lands against Seitz.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel inspired to do more than just win a fight. It's bigger than me. It's bigger than sport, it's about giving life and it's about creating opportunities for people that wouldn't exist otherwise."</p>
