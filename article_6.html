            <p>Liam Lawson can't wait for Sunday when his first permanent job in Formula 1 - with Red Bull Racing - begins properly.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old has 11 Formula 1 races to his name with VCARB - Red Bull's sister team - over the past two seasons.</p>
        
            <p>But both times he came in as a replacement for Australian Daniel Ricciardo - first after Ricciardo broke his hand, and the second when Ricciardo was dropped in favour of the more promising Lawson.</p>
        
            <p>Those performances did enough to convince Red Bull bosses he was the best choice to partner four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, but it will be a huge step up from a midfield fight, to the expectation of securing regular points.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing at a Red Bull fan event in central Melbourne, Lawson said he was excited for the season to finally begin, and thankful he has had an actual pre-season with a team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a cool process," Lawson said of working with his race engineers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the first time I've experienced an off-season and a pre-season and actually spent the time preparing with everybody.</p>
        
            <p>"My experience has been a bit more rushed, so it's been beneficial."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson is still leaping in the deep end.</p>
        
            <p>He has never driven the Albert Park circuit in Melbourne in a Formula 1 car, so to prepare he has spent plenty of time racing in a simulator.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably more than normal," he said of his use of the simulator.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the start of the season, a big event and a new track for me so I'm excited to get going.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm well aware it will be very tough, but we're all pushing in the same direction to try and be the best."</p>
        
            <p>The Red Bull fan zone was buzzing when Lawson appeared alongside Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>A Red Bull F1 car was parked in the zone, overlooking the Yarra River.</p>
        
            <p>A modified Red Bull new mini was also parked nearby, with F1 simulators installed in the front two seats, allowing fans to try their hand around the Melbourne track.</p>
        
            <p>A street artist was completing a canvas painting, combining the helmets of Lawson and Verstappen. Had it been a painting for Melbourne local and McLaren hopeful Oscar Piastri, you suspect it would have been a full on, building-sized mural.</p>
        
            <p>Piastri and fellow Australian Jack Doohan, the Alpine rookie and son of MotoGP legend Mick Doohan, are everywhere in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Every second billboard sports their faces. Their merchandise flies off the shelves. There is a genuine belief among locals that Piastri could be the first Australian to win the Australian Grand Prix since Alan Jones in 1980.</p>
        
            <p>And while some are touting this as being as close to a home race as Lawson will get, some Australians will be giving him a frosty reception.</p>
        
            <p>Ricciardo is still immensely popular, and despite his plummeting form over recent years, many in Melbourne are angry that he was dropped, and Lawson was promoted.</p>
        
            <p>Those sentiments were not shared in the Red Bull fan zone. Lawson was a hero there, wildly popular with the largely female crowd in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>He will be hoping that translates into success come Sunday.</p>
