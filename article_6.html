            <p>Simone Biles won a record-extending ninth all-around title at the US championships in Fort Worth, Texas today as the four-time Olympic gold medalist continues to impress in the run-up to the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>After soaring into the lead on Saturday, Biles picked up right where she left off on the final night of the competition, shaking off a misstep at the beginning of her balance beam routine to finish with a solid performance.</p>
        
            <p>Her high-flying floor routine earned a 15.10 from the judges and an emotional response from her mother in the stands as the 27-year-old added to her lead.</p>
        
            <p>Biles fell backwards while attempting to land a difficult vault in the third rotation but closed the night with a solid outing on the uneven bars to seize the title with a wire-to-wire victory. She also swept the titles for the individual events.</p>
        
            <p>"Today it was just about getting out here, getting comfortable and confident in my gymnastics and hopefully going to Olympic trials and taking that next step towards Paris," Biles said.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't be more proud of how I'm doing at this time of the year and gaining confidence in front of a crowd."</p>
        
            <p>Biles finished with 119.750 points ahead of Skye Blakely, who was 5.900 behind. Kayla DiCello was third, 8.950 back of the winner.</p>
        
            <p>Tokyo all-around champion Sunisa Lee finished fourth with 110.650 points.</p>
        
            <p>Biles missed much of the Tokyo Games due to the "twisties" - a mental block where gymnasts are disoriented in midair - and then stepped away from competition for two years, but looked sharper and more resilient than ever this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a little bit older so I know exactly how to reboot, collect myself and move on to the next event even if I feel like something wasn't how it was supposed to go," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know exactly how to switch my mindset and keep going.</p>
        
            <p>"It's years of therapy ... as well as having good team mates."</p>
        
            <p>Not in action at the championships was Shilese Jones, who is considered the most likely gymnast after Biles to make the five-member Paris team.</p>
        
            <p>She withdrew ahead of the competition to rest a sore shoulder to ensure she is at full strength for the Olympic trials later this month in Minneapolis, where the squad will be named.</p>
        
            <p>"It's feeling a little bit better today than it has this whole week," Jones told NBC Sports.</p>
