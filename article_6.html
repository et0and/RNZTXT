            <p>New Zealand motor racing driver Scott McLaughlin will start from pole in next week's Indy 500.</p>
        
            <p>"Was it? Hell yeah, you guys got to see it too. Welcome to the party," McLaughlin exclaimed when told of his record setting speed.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch-born former Australian Supercars champion was thrilled to take pole for the race.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of pride. Hello to my mum and dad back home in New Zealand and there's one person I know that is watching that has helped me all week, you know who you are brother. Thank you so much. There's a couple of people in my corner that I'm thankful for."</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin conceded he hadn't had a lot of past success at the Indy 500 and was pleased to show he could perform at the "Brickyard".</p>
        
            <p>"Indy hasn't been kind to me and a lot of that was my doing. I need to work on things and this is the first step."</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin set the fastest time in the 108-year history of the race, posting an average speed of just over 234 mph or nearly 377km/h over his four laps.</p>
        
            <p>It's McLaughlin's second pole start in an oval race having secured pole at the Indycar race at Gateway in Madison, Illnois, last year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a lot of hard work, a lot of visualising, mental game, trying to figure out what the best execution for me looks like.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's get this yellow submarine back in victory lane."</p>
        
            <p>In his three Indy 500 races so far McLaughlin's best finish is 14th.</p>
        
            <p>Will Power qualified second for the Indy 500 with defending champion Josef Newgarden third, with Team Penske taking the top three positions.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow New Zealanders Marcus Armstrong will start from 16th on the grid while Scott Dixon, who won the event in 2008, is at 21st.</p>
