            <p>Three-times Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz landed in Wimbledon as the title favourite following his French Open triumph last month but few expected Djokovic to go far after his Roland Garros run was cut short by a knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>However, the 37-year-old, who underwent surgery only five weeks ago, has defied the odds in his bid for a 25th Grand Slam, taking sole ownership of the all-time record he currently shares with Margaret Court.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic's steady return to top form in an otherwise shaky season has left fans at the All England Club and the world over salivating at the prospect of another thriller like the one the duo dished out 12 months ago, when Alcaraz won in five sets.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't sure until three-four days before the tournament whether I'm going to take part in it. I made an extra effort to recover as quickly as possible just because it was Wimbledon," Djokovic said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really, really happy to make the final because I wasn't thinking about, particularly in the first couple of matches, the eventual title match.</p>
        
            <p>"I was thinking about moving well, not injuring myself and feeling more free so to say in my movement... In the third and particularly fourth round. I felt, 'Okay, I'm actually playing close to my best and I can have a shot at the title'."</p>

            <p>Last year's defeat by Alcaraz ended Djokovic's quest for a fifth straight title that would have left him level with Roger Federer on eight Wimbledon trophies and the Serb will head to the clash on Monday seeking revenge.</p>
        
            <p>However, he will have his task cut out against an opponent who has never lost a Grand Slam final and is the youngest player in the professional era to win a major on all three surfaces.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure if I'm going to break his heart," Djokovic said of his 21-year-old opponent. "I'm not intending to do that. I think he's so young, but he already has three Grand Slams under his belt and going for his fourth.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a very all-around player, complete player. Impressive what he's done at such a young age. He's going to win many slams in his career. I hope he's going to give me this one, and let's see. After that I'll cheer for him."</p>

            <p>Alcaraz has not been at his convincing best at Wimbledon this year but can still finish the tournament in elite company as a successful defence will make him only the second player in the professional era after Federer to win his first four major finals.</p>
        
            <p>He can also become only the sixth man since 1968 to claim the Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles in the same year after Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Rafa Nadal, Federer and Djokovic.</p>
        
            <p>Alcaraz, however, is not taking anything for granted.</p>
        
            <p>"I know how it's going to feel playing against Djokovic," said Alcaraz, who is now 2-3 in their head-to-head record having lost the last two meetings - at the Cincinnati Masters and the ATP Finals last year.</p>
        
            <p>"I've played few times in Grand Slams, finals of Masters 1000 multiple times against him. I know what I have to do. I'm sure he knows what he has to do to beat me.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a really interesting one."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile a rain-hit tournament meant the mixed doubles final was moved to Monday and the pair of Santiago Gonzalez and Giuliana Olmos, who became the first Mexican duo to reach the title clash, will look to cap off a successful week with a trophy. They face the seventh-seeded team of Pole Jan Zielinski and Taiwanese Hsieh Su-wei.</p>
