        <h2>'I love the battle': Kosta Barbarouses on goal scoring</h2>
        <p>
Wellington Phoenix striker Kosta Barbarouses is a goal scorer and he has the swagger to go with it.

            <p>Wellington Phoenix striker Kosta Barbarouses is a goal scorer and he has the swagger to go with it.</p>
        
            <p>The club has been relying heavily on him this season as his seven goals have helped them to mid-table position halfway through the A-League season.</p>
        
            <p>The 34-year-old notched up his 100th A-League goal in Wellington's 2-1 win over Macarthur FC last week.</p>
        
            <p>While the Phoenix could do with another marksman up front, Barbarouses enjoys being the centre of attention for opposition defences.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the battle, I wouldn't say it feeds my ego, but it makes me feel like I'm doing something right," Barbarouses said.</p>
        
            <p>He's happy with the responsibility of being the sole striker.</p>
        
            <p>"I have an individual battle, two verses one every game, which I relish and I take it as a compliment."</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses started his A-League career with the Phoenix in their foundation season in 2007. He has also played for Brisbane, Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC.</p>
        
            <p>It was a relief for him to finally reach three figures on the goal scoring charts last week. The idea of hitting a tonne had been on his mind since his career tally got into the seventies.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as I hit 99 I was wanting to score, but it took four games, and so it was a relief to move past it.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew it was going to be a great moment at the time, but I never want the attention fully on me either, so I just wanted to get it done.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if I'll be around for 200, but 110 is the next target and I'll go in tens from there."</p>

            <p>Barbarouses scored his first A-League goal as an 18-year-old in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>However for much of his early career he tended to play wide rather than as a striker, so goal scoring landmarks weren't something he thought about.</p>
        
            <p>"I always loved scoring goals as a kid, but it wasn't my primary role in the team.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing striker the last few years has sparked that scoring hunger that I had as a kid."</p>
        
            <p>Now in his second stint with the Phoenix, Barbarouses is happy to shoulder the goal scorer responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>"At times, chances have been at a premium for us this season, but I have that confidence that if I get one or two (chances), I'll put one away."</p>
        
            <p>A goal against defending champions Central Coast Mariners in Christchurch on Saturday will help as the Phoenix as they push for a play-off position, something Barbarouses said is their minimum goal this season.</p>
