            <p>Jon Jones pulled off a stunning knock-out of Stipe Miocic at UFC 309 on Saturday night, folding his opponent with a spinning back-kick to the body to cement his stats as arguably the greatest fighter of all time as he retained his heavyweight belt.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old American looked fully in control throughout the main event at Madison Square Garden, preventing his opponent from leveraging his boxing skills and finishing with a brutal heel to the body that left Miocic on the canvas clutching his ribs.</p>
