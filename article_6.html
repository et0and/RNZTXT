            <p>The Breakers have been beaten in their final game of the Australian NBL season, going down to the table topping Illawarra Hawks 96-82 in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers struggled to contain Hawks sharpshooter Tyler Harvey, who led all scorers with 29 points, including six three-pointers.</p>
        
            <p>Tacko Fall led the Breakers with 16 points, five rebounds and three blocks in just over 21 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The win for the Hawks secured top spot on the ladder with one game still to play in the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers head coach Petteri Koponen said it was tough to contain Illawarra's firepower.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely not happy - it wasn't our best shooting day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their press got us out of rhythm a bit and we couldn't organise our offence quick enough. We ended up playing a lot of freelance basketball and we weren't really good at that.</p>
        
            <p>"We were able to give some other guys opportunities, we wanted to see some things from other guys who didn't play too much during the year.</p>
        
            <p>"We finished well, and had a lot of open shots but it wasn't our day."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers finishing the season in ninth place with 10 wins and 19 losses.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, centre Dane Pineau has announced his retirement from the NBL after eight seasons.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old made his return from a meniscus tear in last night's final game of the season, marking his 165th NBL appearance.</p>
