            <p>The All Whites goal scoring frustrations have continued as they were beaten by Tunisia at the FIFA series tournament in Egypt.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders missed the opportunity to topple the highly ranked Africans as they were beaten 4-2 in a penalty shoot-out after the game in Cairo ended 0-0.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites started strongly in the play-off for third and fourth, they dominated possession and goal scoring opportunities, but failed to capitalise and victory eluded them again.</p>
        
            <p>To rub salt into the wound they also had captain Liberato Cacace sent off at the final whistle after he was involved in a scuffle with an opposition player who was also red-carded.</p>
        
            <p>Coming off their 1-0 loss to Egypt in the opening game, New Zealand should have scored in the first half if it was not for Tunisian goalkeeper Bechir Ben Said who pulled off some spectacular saves.</p>
        
            <p>Kosta Barbarouses put the ball in the back of the net in the ninth minute but it was ruled out for off-side.</p>
        
            <p>There was another great chance five minutes later when a Tommy Smith header from a corner was tipped away by the Tunisian stopper.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites best chance was in the 30th minute when Barbarouses was brought down in the box and after a VAR review New Zealand was awarded a penalty, but Sarpreet Singh's spot kick was saved by Ben Said.</p>

            <p>The second half was even with both teams struggling to get into strong scoring positions, although there was an obvious momentum shift in favour of the Tunisians.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Garbett did have a chance midway through the second spell but he was unable to get enough power on an outstretched shot and again Ben Said was able to keep it out of his net.</p>
        
            <p>The goal scoring woes continued in the penalty shootout as Ben Waine and Elijah Just were both off target, while Tunisia converted all four of their shots.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time New Zealand and Tunisia had met in international football with the North Africans ranked 41 in the world, 62 places above New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Darren Bazeley made a couple of changes from the side that started against Egypt at the weekend with Bararouses up front, while his Wellington Phoenix team-mate and captain Alex Rufer also started after not originally being a part of the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Tommy Smith went into the defensive line.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's last win was a 2-1 victory over China in March 2023.</p>
        
            <p>In their last 14 games they've managed just six goals.</p>
