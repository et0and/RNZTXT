            <p>The New Zealand Breakers' inability to close out matches continues to plague them, after being edged 93-87 by the Brisbane Bullets in Christchurch on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers created opportunities to win, led by Matt Mooney's impressive scoring performance with 24 points.</p>
        
            <p>But the hosts were unable to capitalise on key moments down the stretch, and it wasn't helped by the loss of co-captain Parker Jackson-Cartwright four minutes into the fourth quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright sparked the offence with 19 points and nine assists, before being sidelined with an injury to the mid section.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers centre Tacko Fall was 5-of-5 from the field, for 12 points and five rebounds, while Jonah Bolden chipped in six points, eight boards and two steals.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers opened the game strongly, establishing a 10-point lead at one stage, but the Bullets were able to shift the dial. Bullets guard Keandre Cook (26 points, six assists) and Casey Prather (22 points, eight rebounds) played decisive roles for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand outscored the Bullets 46-28 in the paint, but Brisbane's three-point shooting (14-of-37, 37 percent) and free throw shooting (72 percent) ultimately made the difference.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Petteri Koponen lamented his side's inability to close out matches on a regular basis.</p>
        
            <p>"In the second half we competed and that was a big topic at half-time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We created some good shots but missed so many free throws, and it wasn't our best shooting night. In these tight games we've had these issues. We don't take the prize from the line and that's something we need to work on and get better.</p>
        
            <p>"This group deserves to finish the season the right way. We will go out there and play for each other in these last three games."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers travel across the Tasman to go head-to-head with Adelaide 36ers at 6.30pm (NZT) on Sunday.</p>
