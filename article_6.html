            <p>Matt Henry has brought the Black Caps back into the second test against Australia with a stunning spell of bowling at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>Henry took 7/67 to dismiss the tourists after lunch on day two, conceding a 94 run lead.</p>
        
            <p>Ending day one at 124/4 after the Black Caps capitulated to 162 all out, Nathan Lyon was first out this morning, Henry claiming his fourth scalp.</p>
        
            <p>Henry had Mitch Marsh trapped in front for a duck shortly after, Southee opting to successfully review the original decision of not out.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips got in on the action, sending Alex Carey back to the pavilion for 14 before Southee claimed the crucial wicket of Labuschagne for 90.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Starc and Pat Cummins eked out some runs from the tail before Henry finished off the innings to claim seven wickets as Australia took a 94 run lead.</p>
