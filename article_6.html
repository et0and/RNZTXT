            <p>Football Ferns captain Ali Riley won't play at a fifth Olympic Games after being withdrawn on medical grounds on the eve of the team's first match against Canada.</p>
        
            <p>Riley will be replaced in the squad by Michaela Foster.</p>
        
            <p>Already dealing with the fall out from a drone being caught spying on them as they prepared for the Canada match the Football Ferns will now be without one of their most experienced players.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Michael Mayne said it was not an easy decision to rule Riley out of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"She has done everything in her control to get herself ready to compete. She is a veteran of this team, and someone that holds a lot of mana in the group, so we are hurting for her but also want her to get back to her best.</p>
        
            <p>"After many conversations leading to making this decision, and with time against us, I have had to replace her in order to utilise the small window I have to bring another player into the squad for the three group games.</p>
        
            <p>"Using the information I have, after playing out a number of scenarios that could impact the team once the bubble closes and looking after Ali's well-being, I have made the decision to withdraw her.</p>
        
            <p>"This was definitely not a situation where it has been clear-cut on the best course of action, but this is the decision I have taken which I believe will be best for the team and to allow Ali to start her recovery."</p>
        
            <p>Foster's promotion from alternate player to full squad member sees defender Grace Neville, a non-travelling reserve for the tournament, called up to join the team in France.</p>
