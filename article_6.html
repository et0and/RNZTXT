            <p>New Zealand runner Maia Ramsden has become the first woman in 20 years to defend her NCAA Division One 1500m title after a dominant victory in Oregon.</p>
        
            <p>Harvard University's Ramsden powered home to win a tactical 12-woman final in Eugene, seeing off Providence College's Kimberley May in a Kiwi one-two.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden won in four minutes 6.62 seconds, 1.45sec clear of 21-year-old Aucklander May, who was just 1.07sec shy of her personal best, set in Kentucky two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden, 22, was even more dominant than in her victory in Austin Texas, when she became just the second New Zealander to win an outdoor NCAA track championships title.</p>
        
            <p>She stationed herself near the tail through the first 300m and moved close to the lead by the midway point.</p>
        
            <p>She powered clear at the front by the bell and held her advantage comfortably over the final lap.</p>
        
            <p>Because of the cagey nature of the start of the race, she was well outside the Olympic qualifying time she is pursuing.</p>
        
            <p>"The best case scenario would have been for it to have gone out quick - you feel smoother and the gear changes happen more naturally. But after the first lap I thought I'm going to have to go to plan B. I had to practising trusting myself and not worry too much what was going on behind me,'' she said in an interview with FloTrack.</p>
        
            <p>"I came here feeling I had nothing to prove but that was the same as last year. I think this year I had more concrete expectations for what I was capable of. Last year I knew NCAA Champs would be the last race of my season, and I was ready to be done but this year was about finding more patience because I am hoping to be racing until the end of August.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a great time. My family is here, and my little sister is here watching me race for the first time since I was 16, so it's been cool."</p>
        
            <p>Three weeks ago Ramsden shaved almost four seconds from her personal best time to set a New Zealand women's 1500m record of 4:02.58 at Grand Prix meet in Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>It was just eight-hundredths of a second outside the Paris Olympic qualifying mark, leaving her confident she can go under the Games mark before the cutoff date.</p>
        
            <p>She will now look to make the New Zealand team for Paris when she competes in the Harry Jerome Classic in Vancouver next Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>May, who has enjoyed a huge breakthrough season, dashed from seventh to second over the final lap.</p>
        
            <p>She was delighted a change of tactics reaped rewards, telling FloTrack: "We decided to do something new. I've been doing a lot of leading, and it hasn't been working, so today we wanted to have a bit more in the tank so I could finish strongly over the last 400m.</p>
        
            <p>"It felt really good on that last lap, it was a bit chaotic, I got spiked but I was patient. With 300m to go I got a bit lucky on the inside and with 200m to go I felt good so I just coming down that home straight as fast as I could."</p>
