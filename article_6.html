            <p>'We are not the champions, yet.'</p>
        
            <p>Freddie Mercury's immortal words have been amended by Aotearoa's newest sporting sensation as Auckland FC strive to remain grounded amid their dream inaugural A-League run.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC have surpassed even the boldest predictions across their first six appearances, sitting unbeaten at the top of the table.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Hiroki Sakai said despite a dominant introduction to the competition, they are not getting ahead of themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to keep great attitude. We are not that strong. We are not champions yet. We have to stay humble."</p>
        
            <p>The Japanese star said taking it week by week will be imperative.</p>
        
            <p>"We have 26 games. We understand that for the city is very special, but for for us, it's a long road ahead."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC meet Melbourne City across the ditch this Sunday and coach Steve Corica said it's another fresh challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been scoring a lot of goals at the moment, but we will stick to what we do best and have a real crack at them."</p>

            <p>Picking up their second win in their rivalry against the Wellington Phoenix last Saturday, Auckland had their net breached for the first time this season in their 2-1 victory.</p>
        
            <p>"We were so close to going six games without a goal, but we made a mistake and we got punished for it. So these are little things that we have to actually make sure that we don't do in the next game, reset and go again."</p>
        
            <p>Like his skipper, Corica is reiterating to his squad that it's still early days.</p>
        
            <p>"It's six games into the season. We're enjoying it, winning builds momentum, builds confidence. You can see that with the boys but we are definitely not getting carried away."</p>
        
            <p>While the side's ascent has stunned many fans, it hasn't shocked the man at the helm.</p>
        
            <p>"We were ambitious from the start about trophies and that's our plan. We've already broken some records with the defensive side of things, so that's something special. It doesn't come along very easily because that record was held for 35-40 years. I just want to continue the winning. We might drop a point here or there, but it's how we respond after that."</p>
        
            <p>Their streak has also come as no surprise to Australian import Jake Brimmer.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a winner. I want to win trophies. It's not a surprise to me, because it was in my mind before the season started. I want to win games. I hate losing. I'm a big winner and I'm a sore loser."</p>
