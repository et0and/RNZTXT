            <p>Black Ferns Director of Rugby Allan Bunting said it will be a great test for the team to play at the iconic Twickenham Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"Our wāhine have been working diligently for this game for some time now. We want them to play with freedom, but most importantly, enjoy the occasion and embrace the opportunity to play," Bunting said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are privileged to be able to select a strong 23. We welcome back some special players from injury; Ayesha, Kennedy, Kate and Maama. Ayesha's energy is contagious, she is lethal both sides of the ball, and has worked hard to be here, it will be awesome seeing her back out there. We will also value having Kennedy back, her leadership, experience and physicality is invaluable. It's great we have Kate and Maama coming off the bench, they will both play an important role when injected into the game."</p>
