            <p>The Wellington Phoenix will look to ban a group of fans who started fights against Melbourne Victory supporters during the A-League football match at Sky Stadium in Wellington on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The spectators entered the Melbourne Victory supporters' bay during the top of the table A-League match, starting multiple fights and throwing cans during the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix general manager David Dome said the club has "zero tolerance for anti-social behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>"These individuals are not welcome at Phoenix games and we will seek sanctions against them, including potentially banning them from the A-League if charges are proven," Dome said.</p>
        
            <p>"This would be an unprecedented step for the club. There currently aren't any Phoenix fans who are on the league's banned list.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with the police to identify the culprits."</p>
        
            <p>The club will also work with management Sky Stadium, who are responsible for venue security.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to apologise to all of the Victory supporters...unfortunately the behaviour of a small number of people took away from what was a great occasion on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The match ended in a one-all draw.</p>
        
            <p>"It was unquestionably one of the most dramatic games of the season...so it is very disappointing to have a small group of idiots engage in behaviour that no one else in the crowd wanted.</p>
        
            <p>Dome said Victory and Phoenix fans mixed freely after the game "so we know this was an isolated incident and not representative of our fans."</p>
