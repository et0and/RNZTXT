            <p>The third and final ODI between Sri Lanka and New Zealand was abandoned because of rain.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps won the toss and decided to bat first in Pallekele and got to 112 for one from 21 overs when the rain started to fall.</p>
        
            <p>It was their best start of the series with Will Young unbeaten on 56 and Henry Nicholls 46, while Tim Robinson had been dismissed for nine.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka had won the first two games to take the series 2-0. It is their fifth ODI series win this year.</p>
        
            <p>It was unfortunate that the game wasn't completed as bowler Zak Foulkes was making his debut.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement Adam Milne was also set to play his first game on tour.</p>
        
            <p>The T20 series between the two sides was shared.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps' next outing is a three test series against England started in Christchurch on 28 November.</p>
