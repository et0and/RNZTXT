        <p>
The A-League is underway, with professional football back in Auckland and drawing plenty of eyeballs. Mathew Nash has a look at the weekend's action.

            <p>Auckland FC have made the perfect start to professional football, after a debut 2-0 win over the Brisbane Roar this weekend. There was a lot to admire from the fledgling franchise, with an own goal and Logan Rogerson's composed finish enough for victory.</p>
        
            <p>However, perhaps the most impressive aspect of Auckland's victory is not that they managed to score twice, but that they didn't concede.</p>
        
            <p>This was, after all, the first time this group of players had played a competitive game together but Steve Corica is no novice, and neither is director of football Terry McFlynn.</p>

            <p>Because while the urge to go and sign big name attacking talent would have been present, instead the two most eye-catching recruits are in the defensive unit.</p>
        
            <p>Hiroki Sakai looked evergreen at right-back and was the catalyst for the opening goal. Alex Paulsen, formerly of the Wellington Phoenix, had little to do but did it well. Then there's Dan Hall, a two-time A-League champion with the Central Coast Mariners and Nando Pijnaker, a current All Whites starter who has been in good form in Ireland's top-flight. Meanwhile, Francis de Vries is demonstrating why he has professional experience, providing a delightful assist for Rogerson's finish.</p>
        
            <p>But all four are strong, physical and smart defenders first. Both De Vries and Sakai can operate centrally and were not afraid to leave a mark on a Brisbane winger or two. With the talented Callan Elliot and experienced Tommy Smith and Scott Galloway in reserve, Auckland FC have built the foundations for a successful debut season.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Knights' failure as a franchise was attributed to many reasons including its location. North Harbour certainly did not work out as a mecca of football for New Zealand's biggest city. But playing at Mount Smart is a massive bonus for the Black Knights.</p>
        
            <p>As Warriors fans will tell you, when the vibes are right, the Go Media stadium can be a fantastic place to be a home team. The Port, Auckland's new fan group, were loud in voice - with blue flares and tifos abounding. For a first time team it was amazing how swiftly they became the 12th man.</p>

            <p>Compare it to the atmosphere at Sky Stadium as the Wellington Phoenix opened their campaign with a withering 1-1 draw against Western United. Just over 7000 fans watched a fairly pedestrian fixture and it made for a nervy and tense atmosphere in a Cake Tin which has clearly been plundered - a stark contrast to the party atmosphere in Penrose.</p>
        
            <p>Of course, time will tell if the novelty wears off in Tāmaki Makaurau. They host Sydney FC next, a far stiffer challenge than the Brisbane Roar, and they will need that 12th man again to keep the good vibes rolling.</p>
        
            <p>Jurgen who? Liverpool's brilliant start to the Premier League season continued under new manager Arne Slot with a win over Chelsea in their biggest challenge yet. Curtis Jones was the hero, demonstrating the strength in depth at Anfield.</p>

            <p>Manchester City are keeping pace after a late John Stones goal saved the day v Wolves but Arsenal have dropped off after another red card finally proved costly in a loss to Bournemouth. William Saliba was the culprit this time and the Gunners will need to sort their discipline to maintain any title tilt this season.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Aston Villa remain fourth after their best start to a season in a generation and Manchester United beat Brentford to relieve some pressure on head coach Erik ten Hag.</p>
