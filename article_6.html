            <p>Greymouth squash player Paul Coll turned in a superman effort to come back from two sets down to beat world number one Ali Farag of Egypt at the latest PSA tournament in London.</p>
        
            <p>World number two Coll, nicknamed 'Superman' for his athleticism on court, lost the first two games 11-8, 11-2 before winning the next three 12-10, 12-10, 11-9.</p>
        
            <p>World Champion Farag went 5-2 and then 7-4 up in the third game leaving Coll struggling for answers.</p>
        
            <p>However the Egyptian, who was fasting during the month of Ramadan, started to make some mistakes and Coll's sprits rose and he went on to win the third 12-10.</p>
        
            <p>Farag had a game ball in the fourth, but Coll saved that and went on to win 12-10.</p>
        
            <p>Farag was allowed allotted times to take on fluids and he went ahead in the fifth before Coll tied it up at 9-9 before going on to take it 11-9 and claim the Optasia title.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a massive battle out there tonight," said Coll.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to say I've got the utmost respect for Ali. Not just for the athlete he is, but for the person he is. I think that's why he's so dominant this season. Thank you for all the battles.</p>
        
            <p>"I put lot of work in the off-season to get back to my fighting best. I didn't feel like I had that last season. I was doing all my breathing techniques, all my mental things because it was a real battle.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to come back several times. I had my coach come down today which really helped me. Seeing my childhood friends in the front row was something special, and hearing my girlfriend who had a tough loss come and support me. All these people around me really got me up today.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud of the fight I put in. Another just really enjoyable battle with Ali out there. I've enjoyed every match this season and I'm happy to get another win."</p>
        
            <p>Coll has now taken a 3-2 lead over Farag in head to head battles this season.</p>
        
            <p>Coll's girlfriend Nele Gilis of Belgium was beaten in the women's final by Satomi Watanabe of Japan.</p>
        
            <p>There is another PSA Gold event in London at the end of the month.</p>
