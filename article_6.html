            <p>Chris Rodesch and Alex Knaff have put Luxembourg on the verge of a Davis Cup World Group II victory against New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors took control in the opening day's play in Palmerston North to forge a 2-nil lead, winning both singles matches against the home side.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis are on the back foot and must win all their remaining matches on Sunday starting with the doubles at midday.</p>
        
            <p>Big serving top Luxembourg player Chris Rodesch brushed aside New Zealand No.2 Ajeet Rai 6-2 6-4 in the second reverse singles.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand No. 1 KP Pannu was in with a chance in a seesaw match against Luxembourg No. 2 Alex Knaff in the opener.</p>
        
            <p>Knaff dominated the first set before Pannu found another gear to take the gripping second set tiebreak.</p>
        
            <p>The players were on serve deep in the third set before Knaff handled the added pressure of playing for his country to edge out Pannu 6-1 6-7(8) 7-5.</p>

            <p>In a match that lasted nine minutes shy of three hours, the New Zealander continually battled back from being in tough positions, saving two match points in the second set.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand team captain and retired New Zealand ATP doubles professional Artem Sitak said his team had a large mountain to climb on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"Now that we are 2-nil down that's the situation I was hoping not to be in after day one.</p>

            <p>'It's not ideal but we've seen a lot of Davis Cup ties ending with a 3-2 win when the team was down 2-0, so hopefully that is going to be us."</p>
        
            <p>Finn Reynolds and Rubin Statham were expected to be the New Zealand doubles team for the first match on Sunday but Sitak was considering a substitution.</p>
        
            <p>With the result of the tie hanging on the doubles, and two remaining singles, Sitak said he would look at all available options.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll need to think it through tonight and come out with the best possible plan to win the next three matches," Artem Sitak said.</p>
        
            <p>"The deadline to change is 11am, so by then it will be official, but right now I need to think about it."</p>
        
            <p>Palmerston North tennis fans who packed the stadium on Saturday will be hoping the tie will last the distance.</p>
        
            <p>With ManawatÅ« hosting its first serve of international tennis action, Fly Palmy Arena has been transformed into a tennis venue, with about 1500 seats and more than 30 corporate tables.</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill and New Plymouth have hosted Davis Cup ties, and Tennis NZ's tournament and events manager Mark Atkins said the organisation loved taking the sport to the regions.</p>
