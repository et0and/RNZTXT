            <p>The All Blacks have been watching the Netflix series Six Nations Full Contact as they seek to end their year on a high against Italy this weekend in Turin.</p>
        
            <p>The series goes behind the scenes into the England, Ireland, France, Scotland, Wales and Italy camps during the Six Nations tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks, including lock Tupou Vaa'i, have been paying close attention to the episodes involving the Azzurri.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been pretty interesting because we watched that doco on Netflix. So, we get a bit of an insight into what happens in their camp," Vaa'i said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're just a big physical pack. We played them in the World Cup last year and we know they've got a high skill set, especially their backs."</p>

            <p>Though the part of the series that stood out for Vaa'i won't necessarily help him prepare for this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest I just heard Neil Barnes (head coach of Taranaki and an assistant with Italy during the last Six Nations) swearing all the time eh," Vaa'i joked.</p>
        
            <p>"I know Neil really well and he's a coach I've been coached by and I understand where he's come from (and how he works) so yeah."</p>
        
            <p>Vaa'i has played most of the All Blacks 13 tests this year and started in the recent wins over England and Ireland and last weekend's narrow defeat to France.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a long year for the team and with the All Blacks heavy favourites to win this Sunday in Turin, players could be forgiven for letting their minds wander to a well earned summer break.</p>
        
            <p>Vaa'i insists his motivation levels remain high.</p>
        
            <p>"My body's good. Mind's good as well. It's the last test before I can go back home and fill the tank up with my friends and family. So it's the last test, but I've still got a job to do."</p>

            <p>Vaa'i has stepped up in 2024, going from an able replacement to a regular starter. He's pleased with his progress, but he said he still considers himself behind others in the squad.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just enjoying being involved, on and off the field. I've been just sitting at the back and just waiting for my opportunity and I feel like I've taken it with two hands this year," Vaa'i said.</p>
        
            <p>"This team is real special and something that I want to be a part of for a really long time. I've got two quality locks in front of me and that's Patty (Tuipulotu) and Scott (Barrett).</p>
        
            <p>"They have both been unreal this year and I'm pretty much learning off them."</p>
        
            <p>With one test to go, Vaa'i concedes it's been an up and down year for the All Blacks, but he believes they're starting to show glimpses of what they can achieve when they get things right.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's been a a roller coaster ride of emotions. We've had a couple losses in South Africa. But it's been good. I really feel that our group is gelling well together and we're slowly figuring out how how we want to play and how we want to defend. It's been a big year, but we've had some good learnings (sic) along the way."</p>
