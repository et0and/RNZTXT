        <h2>Watch: Kiwi's death-defying victory at Red Bull Rampage</h2>
        <p>
Downhill mountain biker Robin Goomes flipped her way to winning the inaugural event.
</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua's Robin Goomes has made history today in Utah, winning the first ever women's edition of the Red Bull Rampage downhill mountain bike event. The 24-year-old headed off the challenge of the seven-strong field, totally 85 points from the judges. Fellow Kiwi Vero Sandler finished fifth.</p>
        
            <p>"It hasn't yet sunk in," Goomes says reflecting on the win. "It's been such a process, so I'm trying to take it all in and enjoy it. I'm so stoked for my crew, they've gone so hard. If anything, I've done it for them, the sport, and all the other riders," Goomes said after lifting the first place trophy.</p>

            <p>The event featured no shortage of mind-bending tricks on the harrowing Virgin, Utah terrain, with Goomes wowing the judges with two big backflips. The flips also earned her the Utah Sports Commission Best Trick Award.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to her tricks, Goomes stomped her 41-foot drop, and cleanly weaved down her top technical chute. Her line was a nod to the old school Red Bull Rampage runs, gnarly and technical, which she felt embodied the spirit of freeride.</p>

            <p>Winning the Best Trick Award was a surprise bonus for the Kiwi, and she was equally excited that all her competitors put on a show.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so special," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think for the sport, whoever won today was going to make history no matter what. It'll inspire new riders and push the scene forward further."</p>
        
            <p>Goomes' journey to the Rampage podium has been an unusual one, after growing up on the Chathams and spending a stint in the army that saw her based in Antarctica for a time. It was not her first time in Utah, having competed in Red Bull Formation 2022. Like most other riders, she has suffered her fair share of injuries, most recently a concussion that kept her off the bike.</p>
        
            <p>However, now it was time to enjoy the win in an event that she had originally targeted to simply learn from the other riders and high pressure environment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lot to get to this moment so to win is just the icing on the top."</p>
