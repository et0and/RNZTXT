            <p>The Southern Steel have been dealt a major blow with former Silver Fern midcourter Shannon Saunders ruled out of the remainder of the ANZ Premiership through injury.</p>
        
            <p>Saunders suffered the injury pre-season and had been managing it during the competition, but recent tests have revealed further damage to her cartilage.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a bit of a weird one. My knee just puffed up after training one day and we've been managing it since," Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had more scans done recently and now I have a tear in my cartilage which, unfortunately, is going to take some time to heal," she explained.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely taken a while for the news to sink in, especially because it's been quite a strange injury in terms of its presentation and I wasn't expecting my latest scan results to give the diagnosis that it has. On the flip side, it's nice to now have some answers and more of a direction in terms of rehab and steps forward."</p>
        
            <p>The most capped player in the competition, Saunders' return after the birth of her first child last year was highly anticipated by the Steel.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm extremely gutted. I was having so much fun being back out there on court. It has been awesome seeing the improvement from the team each week and I'm devastated I won't be able to help contribute to that out on court now," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have absolutely loved my time back with Steel. Even just being in the team environment has been awesome. I love the pressure and the competitiveness that comes with playing and the challenge to be better, learn and adapt each week.</p>
        
            <p>"The team has been improving each week and I'm excited to see them continue to grow and watch all the different combinations develop."</p>
        
            <p>Saunders won't be lost to the Steel as she will continue her mentoring work with the team.</p>
        
            <p>The Southern Steel sit at the bottom of the premiership ladder with just one win in five games.</p>
        
            <p>That sole victory, a 63-61 win over the Northern Stars in extra time broke a nearly two year streak without a win.</p>
