            <p>Novak Djokovic has said he will avoid doing interviews on court at the Australian Open until he receives an apology from the Nine Network, after reporter Tony Jones's "mockery of Serbian fans".</p>
        
            <p>An irate Djokovic refused to do the customary on-court interview for the broadcast, this time with two-time Australian Open winner Jim Courier, instead delivering a curt statement to the crowd and walking off the court to scattered boos from the stunned crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic opened his press conference with a statement before taking questions, explaining that his protest was against host broadcaster, Nine Network, after reporter Tony Jones's "mockery of Serbian fans".</p>
        
            <p>"A couple of days ago, a famous sports journalist who works for the official broadcaster, Channel Nine, here in Australia made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments towards me," he told reporters at Melbourne Park.</p>
        
            <p>"Since then, he chose not to issue any public apology, neither did Channel Nine. Since they are the official broadcaster, I chose not to give interviews to Channel Nine.</p>
        
            <p>"I have nothing against Jim Courier and the Australian public, and it was a very awkward situation for me to face on the court today.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unfortunate, I chose to say something to the crowd, but obviously it wasn't the time and space for me to explain what I'm doing right now.</p>
        
            <p>"I leave it to Channel Nine to handle this the way they see fit, and that's all."</p>
        
            <p>Jones drew criticism last week for a live broadcast where he said the 24-time grand slam champion was a "has been".</p>
        
            <p>"Welcome back to Melbourne Park, where you can see the Novak Djokovic fans, they're in full voice. The chants are quite extraordinary," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones then turned around and began singing to the crowd, live on air.</p>
        
            <p>"Novak, he's overrated," Jones sang.</p>
        
            <p>"Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out.</p>
        
            <p>"Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me. Anyway, let's get onto the tennis."</p>
        
            <p>That interaction did not sit well with Djokovic, who won a gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Eurosport, Courier, who has been a part of Nine's coverage of the Australian Open since it received the TV rights to the major in 2019, said he had "no idea" Djokovic would refuse to talk.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic said his frustration was not with fans, despite receiving some boos during his fourth round victory over Jiří Lehečka.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason I wasn't giving an interview isn't because of the crowd," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after walking off the court, a visibly demonstrative Djokovic was captured speaking to Australian Open boss Craig Tiley in the bowels of Melbourne Park.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a really nice relationship with Craig and I think he's a phenomenal guy that always tries to understand the players' needs and demands," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I just wanted to make sure that he understands where I stand and the reasons behind it.</p>
        
            <p>"I told him, 'If you guys want to fine me for not giving an on-court interview that's OK, I'll accept that, because I feel like this is something that needs to be done'."</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic will face number three seed Carlos Alcaraz in a blockbuster quarterfinal next.</p>
