            <p>Asafo Aumua is adamant he is ready for arguably the biggest test of his career as he prepares to start for the All Blacks against world number one Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>With first choice hooker Codie Taylor out with concussion, Aumua is set to take over for this Saturday morning's (NZT) clash in Dublin when the All Blacks team is named at 5am (NZT) on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>George Bell is likely to come onto the bench, while Brodie McAlister has been called into the squad as cover.</p>

            <p>Hurricanes star Aumua played most of last week's win over England after Taylor went off and he said that has given him confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a real honour to be starting. I'm really excited. I got a good taste of it last week. I didn't start but got quite a few minutes. I can still feel that today, but it will get better as the week goes on," Aumua said.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks made a few mistakes in the lineouts in the second half against England with some throw-ins not going to hand, but Aumua said that was within his power to fix.</p>
        
            <p>"It was more on me. I just had to execute at the time. There were a few clarity issues, but it's just about executing in the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Aumua, who was unavailable for selection for last year's World Cup due to injury, has played 17 tests, but will be making just his fifth start in this weekend's clash with Ireland. He said neither his approach nor mindset would change.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably the same whether I'm starting or on the bench. Never take it easy. Make sure my prep is on point.</p>
        
            <p>"At home it's a bit harder trying to find that balance of kids, family, family time, and stuff. But, here, I've got no excuse to not get that prep done. I've got my roommate (All Blacks prop Pasilio Tosi) and we walk through lineouts and stuff. Nothing really changes for me."</p>
        
            <p>Asafo said Tosi was a willing participant in the rugby discussions.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously a pretty loud guy. So he's pretty happy for for a bit of lineout chat. Just quizzing each other on some homework."</p>

            <p>Aumua believed it was important to step away from rugby when you get the chance and he said gaming was an escape some players turned to.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortnite on PlayStation. Yeah we've got a good crew of us. They like to play when we have some free time. It's a good way to just get away from the game (rugby) for a little bit before we get back into it the next day."</p>
        
            <p>Aumua said the growing rivalry and recent tension between the All Blacks and Ireland would add some extra spice to this weekend's test in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>Ireland won their first ever test on New Zealand soil in 2022 before going on to claim a maiden series victory over the All Blacks, while the All Blacks upset Ireland in last year's World Cup quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Former Ireland star Johnny Sexton recently added fuel to the fire after revealing he and All Blacks midfielder Rieko Ioane engaged in war of words after the World Cup clash.</p>
        
            <p>Aumua said that makes for a special test.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah. 100 percent. Even before the Johnny Sexton stuff [it was going to be a big match]. The crowd will be fizzing. But I don't think the boys will be worried about that stuff too much."</p>
        
            <p>Aumua said Ioane had not been copping any more grief than usual from his teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"No. It's not not too big. It's all just banter. Whatever happens on the field stays on the field. Yeah just a little bit of extra motivation."</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi was also bracing for a big Irish crowd in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Ireland is up there. I remember last time we played here, they did sing along to the haka. Obviously every country is different, but Ireland's definitely up there in terms of atmosphere and and fans."</p>
