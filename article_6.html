            <p>Wanaka freeskier Luca Harrington has backed up his maiden World Cup victory with a second win a week later.</p>
        
            <p>It was another dominant performance as he finished almost ten points clear of his closest competitor.</p>
        
            <p>Last week's win also helped Harrington make history as the first New Zealander to stand atop a big air World Cup podium and just the second to earn a World Cup big air top-3.</p>
        
            <p>He now tops the Big Air standings.</p>
        
            <p>The 20 year old admits to being surprised with his Big Air win in Krieschberg, Austria.</p>
        
            <p>"This is absolutely incredible, I did not expect this to happen, it's been such an honour to be here and to put down two runs again and walk away with the win is incredible" said Harrington.</p>
        
            <p>Harrington again went with a highly technical approach and was again impressive with his landings.</p>
        
            <p>He dominated from the first of three runs, posting the highest single jump score putting down a flawless switch right triple corked 1620 esco grab and was awarded an impressive 95.75 for his efforts.</p>
        
            <p>He immediately backed that up with the third highest score of the day (a 92.00) on his second run, stomping a right triple corked 1800 safety grab for a combined winning score of 187.75, nine points clear of his nearest competitor.</p>
        
            <p>"I switched up my game plan today so I was a little unsure coming in, but I am glad I did it."</p>
        
            <p>Harrington was joined on the podium by local hero Matej Svancer of Austria in second and Norway's Leo Landroe in third. Cheered on by the rest of the NZ Team, it was a truly special moment as the New Zealand national anthem echoed through the venue as Harrington topped the podium.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been so much training and so much competition experience that has come into this, and you start to get into a comfortability and I think that's starting to click for me now and I am feeling comfortable, I am really stoked on where I am right now."</p>
        
            <p>Harrington's next outing is the LAAX Open Freeski Slopestyle World Cup in Switzerland next week.</p>
