            <p>Twelve days after lifting the T20 World Cup in Dubai the White Ferns will kick off their celebrations on home soil with a trophy tour.</p>
        
            <p>The nine-day tour will stop in 10 different cities and will begin on Saturday in Suzie Bates and Eden Carson's hometown of Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Straight after the T20 World Cup the White Ferns played an ODI series in India, which delayed their return to New Zealand, but they will be greeted by fans at a special celebration in Christchurch on Friday to mark their achievement.</p>
        
            <p>The T20 World Cup trophy will then embark on a whistlestop tour of the country from south to north, with members of the team and support staff appearing at fan events in their regions.</p>

            <p>The free-entry public events will be mixed with visits to cricket clubs and schools as the White Ferns look to share the World Cup with as many New Zealanders as possible.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket general manager of marketing communications Stacey Geraghty said the trophy tour was an opportunity for the team and the public to connect and celebrate.</p>
        
            <p>"The World Cup win is without a doubt a watershed moment for women's cricket in this country and we're determined to make the most of it," Geraghty said.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on the amount of excitement back here in New Zealand following the win, we're expecting the public to get out in force to celebrate with the team, in the same way Kiwis supported the Black Caps during their ICC World Test Championship Mace tour in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"The public events will allow fans to get up close and personal with their heroes, get photos and signatures, and of course get a snap with the trophy."</p>
        
            <p>The trophy will also be on display at all White Ferns matches throughout the summer.</p>
