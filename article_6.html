            <p>Former Paralympian Stef Reid has questioned Nike's commitment to diversity over their refusal to sell single shoes to amputee runners, even though they use amputee mannequins and runners in promotions.</p>
        
            <p>Reid, a three-times Paralympic medallist in long jump and 200 metres, said she was unable to purchase a single Vaporfly, Nike's top-of-the-line training shoe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really expensive and I'm going to buy this [pair] and I'm going to throw half away. This just seems a little bit silly," Reid, who lost her right foot in a boating accident when she was 16, said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>"I would never have gone down this route but when a company is using the image [of amputee runners in promotional material], they're making a statement that they want to be diverse and inclusive."</p>

            <p>In a statement to Reuters Nike, who offered her a 15 percent discount to buy a pair, thanked Reid for sharing her concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"At Nike, we stand for all athletes, and sponsor a number of Para athletes and federations around the world and work with them across all forms of movement," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>The company added that their American program One Shoe Bank offers a select inventory of single shoes out of their Memphis distribution centre.</p>
        
            <p>"Taking the learnings from the program, we are hoping to expand it to more geographies in the future," Nike said.</p>
        
            <p>The 39-year-old Reid, who competed for Canada before switching to Team GB, has taken up distance running with the ultimate goal of racing in the Boston Marathon.</p>
        
            <p>She would like to honour Boston's groundbreaking decision this year to add several Para categories, with prize money.</p>
        
            <p>Reid, who lives with her Canadian husband, 11-time Paralympic medallist Brent Lakatos, in Loughborough, England, was a quarter-finalist in Dancing on Ice in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, she became the first amputee athlete to compete in the British adult figure skating championships, and won silver in her age category.</p>
