            <p>Dally M Medal-winning halfback Jahrome Hughes has been ruled out of the Kiwis' tests against Australia and Tonga in the Pacific Championship campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes was named in the 21-strong New Zealand squad on Tuesday fewer than 48 hours after playing in Melbourne's 6-14 NRL grand final loss to Penrith.</p>
        
            <p>When naming the team, Kiwis coach Stacey Jones indicated Hughes had been troubled by a neck injury, but it was hoped he would recover to be involved in time for the tests against the Kangaroos and Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>However, after further medical assessment Hughes has been told he will not be fit to play.</p>
        
            <p>"Jahrome is understandably shattered and we really feel for him," said Jones.</p>
        
            <p>"He has had an outstanding year and he was going to play a key role for the Kiwis again. He was desperate to play and we thought, with some time on our side, he would come right with treatment - but he has since received medical advice that he won't be ready to play."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will now name a replacement for Hughes, with the opening test against Australia in Christchurch on 27 October.</p>
