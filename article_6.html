            <p>It's O-Week in Dunedin and the party will be under the roof at Forsyth Barr, where the defending champion Blues are looking to make up for a loss at home last weekend to the Chiefs. The Highlanders are coming off a thrilling loss of their own, but one where they managed to get their attack flowing relatively well. There will be a big crowd in as the new crop of students get settled into their new life in Dunedin, hopefully the visitors can keep their mind on the job to avoid another upset result.</p>

            <p>Jamie Joseph has made a change in the loose forwards, with Sean Withy shifting to blindside and the impressive Veveni Lasaqa getting his first start at openside. Folau Fakatava returns at halfback and pairs up with Taine Robinson, while Sam Gilbert moves to the wing to accommodate Finn Hurley. Southland hooker Jack Taylor is set for his Super Rugby debut off the bench.</p>

            <p>Last season's wrecking ball Hoskins Sotutu is back to play his key role in the Blues' gameplan, which means Cam Suafoa moves to blindside. Harry Plummer once again starts at 10 with Beauden Barrett at 15, and Cole Forbes can cover centre outwards off the bench. James Mullan will make his first appearance for the Blues after moving north from the Crusaders.</p>

            <p>The Blues have won 11 of their last 12 Super Rugby Pacific games against the Highlanders - dropping only a 29-35 result in April 2021 - including their last eight meetings in a row, across which they've conceded an average of just 17.1 points per game.</p>
        
            <p>Blues midfielder AJ Lam is on a three-game try scoring streak, the longest of his Super Rugby Pacific career, and has made 10+ carries in each of his last three games.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders co-captain Timoci Tavatavanawai has scored a try in each of his last three Super Rugby Pacific games against the Blues, including one in each of his two games against them.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a physical match, the Blues are very prescribed and use their forwards very well. If we can match them up front we've got an opportunity and if not, it's going to be a long night." - Jamie Joseph</p>
        
            <p>"We've been keeping an eye on them because we know that Jamie's down there, we know how he operates. They've had more time with their players … not as many players out because of All Black selection. We think there's a bit of pressure on them to put in a good performance." - Vern Cotter</p>
        
            <p>Blues 47 - 13 Highlanders</p>
        
            <p>Despite a brave first half effort by the Highlanders, who did well to only trail by eight at the break, the Blues turned on the afterburners in the second half on their way to a big win. By that stage of the season, it was clear that the title would be decided at Eden Park, whereas the Highlanders were simply trying to avoid missing the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders may well be in for a Blues backlash tonight if they can't contain what should be a renewed sense of ferocity in the visitors. The best way to do that is to strike early, and Joseph's young team have no excuse not to at least try in the perfect conditions at Forsyth Barr. The Blues may well opt to be a bit more subdued and use Plummer and Barrett's boots a bit more, however it is likely that Caleb Clarke and Mark Tele'a will end up on the scoresheet before long. Off the field, it is even more likely that a lot of first year students will have a sore head tomorrow morning, after a big night at the footy.</p>
