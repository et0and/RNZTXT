            <p>Former Wallabies player Jordan Petaia has signed with the Los Angeles Chargers as part of the NFL's International Player Pathway (IPP) training programme.</p>
        
            <p>Petaia, who played 31 tests and at two Rugby World Cups for the Wallabies, joins the Chargers as a tight end after training at the IMG Academy in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Petaia, 25, became Australia's youngest player at a Rugby World Cup when he made his debut as a 19-year-old against Uruguay in Japan in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He played seven seasons for the Brisbane-based Queensland Reds in Super Rugby before confirming in December he would join the IPP programme to have a tilt at the NFL.</p>
        
            <p>He has previously said it was a dream he shared with his father, who died in 2020 after a heart attack.</p>
        
            <p>"He'd be looking down and shouting at me to take the opportunity. I think I probably would have regretted it if I didn't," Petaia said last year.</p>
        
            <p>Earning a long-term spot on the Chargers roster would be a monumental achievement for Melbourne-born Petaia, who has had to learn the game from scratch.</p>
        
            <p>Australia has produced a string of NFL punters but few athletes able to cement a spot in other positions.</p>
        
            <p>Philadelphia Eagles lineman Jordan Mailata, a former rugby league player, is one of the rare success stories, becoming the nation's first NFL player to feature on a winning Super Bowl team with victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in February.</p>
        
            <p>Jarryd Hayne, another rugby league convert, signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 2015 and made the team's 53-man roster but was waived early in the season and quit the following year.</p>
