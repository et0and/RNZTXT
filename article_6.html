            <p>Australia pulled off a monster chase against England in the Champions Trophy after Josh Inglis's incendiary hundred helped them to prevail in a high-scoring Group B thriller by five wickets in Lahore.</p>
        
            <p>Opener Ben Duckett smashed 165 to propel England to 351-8, a record total in the tournament's history until Australia overwhelmed it, after they were put into bat.</p>
        
            <p>Inglis, born in Leeds to English parents, hammered 120 not out off 86 balls while Alex Carey (69) and Matthew Short (63) chipped in with half-centuries as Australia reached the target with 15 balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought around 350 was going to be chaseable for a moment," Australia captain Steve Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>"For a moment, it looked like they were probably going to get over 400, so we're pleased by that [bowling] effort.</p>
        
            <p>"And yeah, we were confident we could chase this down."</p>
        
            <p>The way Australia completed the highest chase in a men's event in an ICC tournament was in stark contrast to their wobbly start.</p>
        
            <p>Jofra Archer took a return catch to dismiss the dangerous Travis Head and Mark Wood removed Steve Smith with an 150km/h rocket.</p>
        
            <p>Short and Marnus Labuschagne (47) propped up Australia before England struck back with their spin duo of Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone.</p>
        
            <p>Inglis raised 146 runs with Carey, who was dropped on 49 by Archer, as Australia reclaimed control of the see-saw contest and never let it go.</p>
        
            <p>Brydon Carse removed Carey in the 42nd over but Inglis raced to a 77-ball hundred reaching the mark with a six off Archer.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Maxwell produced an unbeaten cameo of 32 off 15 balls to ease any pressure on Inglis, who sealed Australia's victory with his sixth six.</p>
        
            <p>Australia had arrived with a second-string pace attack and their missing frontline quicks included skipper Pat Cummins.</p>
        
            <p>Stand-in skipper Smith elected to field and they did not have to wait long for a breakthrough thanks to Carey's spectacular athleticism at mid-on.</p>
        
            <p>Phil Salt had flicked a Ben Dwarshuis (3-66) delivery and Carey moved to his right, leapt and plucked a one-handed stunner on the edge of the 30-yard circle.</p>
        
            <p>The bowler-fielder duo combined again to remove Jamie Smith, whose promotion to number three did not pay off.</p>
        
            <p>Duckett combined in a stand of 158 with Joe Root (68) to lay the foundation for England's big total.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Zampa dismissed Root and Jos Buttler fell for 23 but Duckett went on to eclipse New Zealander Nathan Astle's record for the highest individual score in the Champions Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>Duckett struck 17 fours and three sixes before falling lbw to Labuschagne after a 143-ball knock.</p>
        
            <p>Buttler said England had put up a "pretty good score".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little bit wet and there was always the worry, if the dew does come in, it may play a bit better and skid on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, all being said, whatever happens with the conditions, to chase down 350 is a fantastic effort."</p>
