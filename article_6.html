            <p>She is known as the godmother of New Zealand netball and was at the forefront of the sport's rise in profile in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lois Muir was in charge of the Silver Ferns from 1974 to 1988 and the formidable coach became synonymous with netball.</p>
        
            <p>She coached the 1987 team to a world title and finished her career with the remarkable record of 102 games, 87 wins, five draws and just 10 losses.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lois excelled on the sports field, and in a rarity for the day, represented New Zealand at both basketball (1952-62) and netball.</p>
        
            <p>The 89-year-old, who is based in Dunedin, reflects as Netball New Zealand today becomes the first national association in the world to reach 100 years.</p>
        
            <p>"No, I can't and it's so exciting for me to have been part of that 100 years. Looking back has been fun but looking forward to what the next 100 are going to be is going to be more fun but I don't think I'll be around for too many more but I've had more than my share and I'm not trying to be too greedy."</p>
        
            <p>"It's very satisfying but you know over the 100 years we've had strong administrators who have been forward thinking and that's the story really."</p>
        
            <p>"The people started to know the players. No one got paid, we were all volunteers but it was fun and it just worked and you got the team unity going. I think what captured the imagination of the public was we were a mixture of all sorts of New Zealanders. You know the Australians were all lean and long but we were just everybody and the skills were there. And we worked as a team and that's what did it really."</p>

            <p>"It did - no doubt about it. But that team was driven and knew where it wanted to be and that makes it so easy to coach. But they were a team that were really united and covered each other's back."</p>
        
            <p>"Just working and seeing young people improve. It was exciting, I was addicted to coaching and coaching is great. But it's hard for people today, harder to find coaches today because of their other commitments. Back then there were 48 associations around the country and everyone felt they had a piece of the game. That united feeling went right through to the top to Netball New Zealand, they incorporated those people."</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, I'd never miss a game. I still watch and sort of mutter to myself about some of the strategies and some of the opportunities they could take that they're not taking. So I'm still the armchair critic."</p>
        
            <p>"It hasn't really changed, netball is an interesting game because it's a game of equal chance. There are not many other sports that you're given half the ball to play with. If you use your strategies well with that half of the possession you're going to do really well and be successful but what is success, is it improving every game or is it only winning? But the game has got more competitive. It's tougher on the players, life's tougher out there, they've got to be fitter. And that's the way life is these days."</p>

            <p>"They were strong young women and I would never name anyone because it's the moment and it's the time. You can't ever go back and compare the old days with today, the whole structure is different. I used to say 'if you think you can do it better prove it to me and I'll listen to you' but they have to own it out there, the coach is only the master of tweak."</p>
        
            <p>"I do feel we lack the ability to change the opportunity. You know using your brain - people should not be allowed to do the same thing the whole game and be successful with it if you're the opposition. But it takes more than one person and I do feel it's hard perhaps for the franchises to put units together.</p>
        
            <p>"The fun I had in coaching is where units put strategies together and if Plan A didn't work they had back up plans. I didn't want them walking over to me at the quarter and looking long in the face that they're losing. It's their job out there to react and change and they have got a box of skills, they just need to lift the lid and bring out some of those extra skills, and they'd be surprised."</p>

            <p>"Yes always, because of what we were selling. When you believe in what you're doing that feeling spreads. And because we had all those associations around the country who sort of owned those players - they felt it too and we kept them in touch with us.</p>
        
            <p>"In the early years of my Silver Ferns coaching tenure I had to go apply for my coaching job every year at New Zealand Council meeting. Council voted every year and that was all the associations, so somebody could lobby and everything.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to have times when I was growing players, and I probably was not going to be successful at that point but I thought I've got to do it. If I want to be there tomorrow, you've got to do more work today. And that philosophy I think is what has kept netball top of the rank really, and that's what I used to enjoy."</p>
