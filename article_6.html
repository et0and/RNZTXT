            <p>World champion Aaron Gate sprinted to the UCI 2.2 New Zealand Cycle Classic title entering the tour's history books.</p>
        
            <p>The powerful race favourite rode a dominant tour winning four of five stages including victory in the criterium around the streets of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Gate did the "black jersey proud" in Wellington in the final stage in what he described as a very hectic race.</p>
        
            <p>Riding for the New Zealand National team, the 33-year-old bided his time in the circuit race held around the inner-city streets, overcoming challenging gusty winds and spurred on by a large raucous crowd, to win the fifth and final stage in a sprint finish.</p>
        
            <p>It was his fourth stage win in this year's tour, racing in the black and white colours of the New Zealand National team, while his teammate Kiaan Watts won stage two, in Martinborough.</p>
        
            <p>"The guys did an awesome job controlling the race today and setting me up for that final dash for the line," Gate said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty special feeling and I always want to come here and give it my best shot.</p>
        
            <p>"To walk away with four stages is pretty cool and is hopefully a good omen for the year ahead."</p>

            <p>Gate, a multiple Commonwealth Games gold medallist and current World Track Champion who earlier this week was named as Halberg Award finalist, said the win sets up his season with the Paris Olympics looming large on the horizon.</p>
        
            <p>Race director Jorge Sandoval said Gate becomes the fourth person in the tour's history to win it twice after he lifted the silverware in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The decorated New Zealand rider joined the select trio of Brian Fowler, Ric Reid and Hayden Roulston to achieve the same feat.</p>
        
            <p>Fowler won the Tour from 1989 - 1992, Ric Reid won it in 1994 and 1996, and Hayden Roulston lifted the title consecutively in 2006 and 2007.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the New Zealand National team's consistency this tour, the Classification Jersey went to Australian Team BridgeLane who performed consistently within the General Classification.</p>
        
            <p>Whanganui rider Finnegan Murphy riding for Southern Cross remained in control today to retain the U23 Jersey.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Liam White won King of the Mountain.</p>
        
            <p>Craig Oliver for team MitoQ New Zealand Cycle Project, who constantly went off the front in today's circuit race, was presented the Most Aggressive Jersey.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey O'Donnell, who won two out of the three sprint stages in today's stage and placed second in the other, to retain the the Sprint Ace Jersey.</p>
