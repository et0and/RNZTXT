            <p>The Breakers were outclassed 83-64 by the Tasmania Jackjumpers in Hobart on Saturday night to slip from first to third in the NBL standings.</p>
        
            <p>Coming into the match on a three-game winning streak, the Auckland-based club dominated the opening exchanges to lead 27-20 at quarter-time before their offence stalled badly in the face of full-court pressure all game.</p>
        
            <p>Trailing 45-41 at halftime, the low point came in the third quarter when the Breakers could only generate three points to fall behind by 20 entering the final stanza.</p>
        
            <p>It was the best win of the season for the Jackjumpers while the Breakers' remain near the top with a 6-3 record heading into Saturday's game away to the last-place Taipans in Cairns.</p>
        
            <p>Guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright led the Breakers scoring with 15 points, complemeneted by 13 to centre Sam Mennenga, who also pulled down seven rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>Four Tasmania players reached double figures, including a game-high 19 from guard Jordan Crawford.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers coach Petteri Koponen said the JackJumpers were able to play an aggressive style that stopped his side generating any flow.</p>
        
            <p>"They're a great team playing much better than where they are on the ladder," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They make you play a different way and we had trouble getting to the rim. We couldn't bring it today.</p>
        
            <p>"When they tried to take Parker out there's an advantage somewhere else but we couldn't find that today. We had 19 turnovers and they had 17 offensive rebounds so that's basically the game right there.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not time to put our heads downs. We have to learn, get better and focus on the next game."</p>
