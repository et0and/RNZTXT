        <h2>Chiefs hammer Crusaders after second-half blitz</h2>
        <p>
The injection of fresh players off the bench by Clayton McMillan was a masterstroke for a second week in a row.

            <p>A stunning two-try blitz after 50 minutes was the turning point in the Chiefs' 49-24 over the Crusaders at FMG Stadium Waikato on Friday night. Leroy Carter and Samipeni Finau both crossed in quick succession, pushing the Chiefs' lead out to an insurmountable one, after the game had been locked up at 17-all just after halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Emoni Narawa took advantage of early pressure and the Crusaders switching off, taking a quick tap and scoring in the sixth minute. Damian McKenzie tacked on a penalty shortly after and the home side established a 10-0 lead before the Crusaders had even really touched the ball.</p>
        
            <p>However, the visitors burst into life off a counterattack, Taha Kemara gliding through a gap and putting Cullen Grace into space. He found Kyle Preston on the inside, sending the rookie halfback in to score his fourth try in two games. Ethan Blackadder then scored after Sevu Reece emulated Narawa and took a quick tap of his own.</p>
        
            <p>James O'Connor locked the scores up and the game looked to be heading towards a tense finish, however Carter and Finau's efforts after Clayton McMillan brought on four subs left the Crusaders seemingly punch drunk for the rest of the game. The Chiefs completely took control from that point onwards, with Josh Jacomb going over after some great footwork by McKenzie on the hour mark.</p>
        
            <p>However, the sweetest moment was saved for Quinn Tupaea, who had come off the bench for his 50th match. The midfielder finished off two excellent tries to close out the win, the second set up by an extremely impressive Simon Parker.</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't without cost though, with skipper Luke Jacobson forced from the field with a badly broken nose early. Rameka Poihipi came off with a knee injury and Narawa left late with a leg complaint of his own.</p>
        
            <p>It's definitely a reality check for the Crusaders, who came in very confident after their good win last weekend against the Hurricanes. They get a week off to lick their wounds, while the Chiefs host the Brumbies back in Hamilton.</p>
