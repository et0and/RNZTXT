            <p>Kiwi cruiserweight David Nyika says this Saturday's fight will be a stepping stone to greatness.</p>
        
            <p>It is a new body in front of him, but the plan remains the same for Nyika - finish the fight, and do it in style.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi cruiserweight will headline a card stacked with homegrown talent in Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika meets American Tommy Karpency, a late notice replacement after Nykia's original opponent, Blake Caparello, was forced to withdraw after failing a pre-fight drug test.</p>
        
            <p>However, Nyika thinks his new opponent will make for a more fan friendly fight.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very similar to Blake, however, he's probably a more attractive fighter to compete against. He's not as negative. He'll actually make the fight happen. I was a little bit worried with Blake that he was going to make the fight really boring and messy."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika, an Olympic bronze medallist and with a 9-0 pro record, said he is ready for a war.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Tommy's gonna stand bang with me. So best case scenario, we put on a hell of a show, and worst case scenario, I deck him early, and we all have a have a great night."</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old said he was disappointed by Carparello's failed test, but not surprised.</p>
        
            <p>"He's going and taking steroids so it would have looked awesome if I could really smash him. It would have been that would have been a good look. But it is what it is. He's doing what he feels he has to do to succeed against ... me. So it's kind of flattering."</p>
        
            <p>He has not ruled out rebooking the fight, but for now his focus shifts to and he is not underestimating Karpency, a three-time world title challenger.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think he's stronger than me. I don't think he's more athletic than me. I've got the age advantage. This is very much my time. But I can't overlook his experience. He's fought three world champions and beaten one of them."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika has been blasting thorough the cruiserweight division of late, racking up six consecutive knockouts since July 2022.</p>
        
            <p>However, he last fought in Aotearoa in February 2021, also his professional debut, and concedes he will have to contend with different elements in his own backyard.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably more of a test of my own maturity, because obviously I'm wanting to put on a show in front of the home crowd, and put on an amazing show. There's a lot of mistakes I can make, so I just need, keep my head screwed on, and, not focus too much on all the advice that I'm getting from all my mates out on the nosebleeds."</p>
        
            <p>He said it has been a quality camp regardless of the late opponent change.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a bit of sinusitis and a lot of nosebleeds, so it's been a tough camp, there is nothing more humbling than choking on your own blood in sparring, but it's been very productive. I've come out the other side with no niggles whatsoever, best shape of my life. So it's a perfect time. Perfect opportunity to step back into the ring."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika has no doubt about the outcome.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll have my hand raised by any means necessary. I think I'll be too much for Tommy. I know I've got a plan A right through Z. So it's really in his court to see what kind of shape he turns up on. Because I can deal with anyone and in the big scheme of things, he will be a stepping stone in my greater, greater narrative.
