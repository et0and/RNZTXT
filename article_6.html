            <p>The Mystics newest defender Catherine Hall says she's in a good place to be learning on and off the court as she juggles a fledgling netball career with a degree in medicine.</p>
        
            <p>The promising young defender received her first full contract with the ANZ Premiership defending champions this year after impressing as a training partner and member of the Northern Marvels last season.</p>
        
            <p>Able to play both in-circle defensive positions, Hall's tall 1.91m frame is an asset and her long reach stands out.</p>
        
            <p>"I have had my arm span measured, I think it's about the same as my height. I've always been told that my long arms are an asset of mine so I try to throw them around as much as possible and see what ball I can get," Hall said.</p>
        
            <p>Like many girls Hall was introduced to netball at primary school. Hall played a few other sports growing up, including touch when she was younger and volleyball in high school.</p>
        
            <p>She gets her height from both parents.</p>
        
            <p>"My dad is six foot five and my Mum she says she's 5'11" and three quarters. My mum played representative level netball when she was growing up."</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old said getting her first full-time contract happened sooner than she thought it might.</p>
        
            <p>"When I finished school, the NNL (National Netball League) coach asked me to trial for the Northern Marvels, so I was like 'okay, I'll give that a go'.</p>
        
            <p>"And then I got a call up to be an apprentice training partner the following year. I guess I've always thought about potentially playing professionally but it probably is faster than I expected."</p>
        
            <p>An injury to captain Sulu Fitzpatrick last season opened the door for Hall to be included in several Mystics match-day squads, and she got a few minutes on court.</p>
        
            <p>Hall has come into a well-established team and very strong defensive end, which includes Silver Ferns' Michaela Sokolich-Beatson and Phoenix Karaka.</p>

            <p>Carys Stythe, also 20, was another promising youngster, who got her first full-time contract last year. Hall and Stythe could potentially anchor the Mystics defensive circle for several years to come.</p>
        
            <p>Hall has been able to learn from some of the best about the demands of elite level netball.</p>
        
            <p>Last year she soaked up as much as she could from Fitzpatrick, before the former Silver Fern retired.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been so cool. Phoenix and Mickey [Sokolich-Beatson] and Sulu last year, and Carys have all got so much to offer, they're amazing players so it's really cool to play alongside them and I'm definitely learning a lot.</p>
        
            <p>"There's so much for me still to learn and I think I'm in a good place to be learning at the moment with the players around me. I think some of the tactical stuff, seeing opportunity to hunt for ball and getting my angles and positioning right, it's something I want to develop."</p>
        
            <p>Mystics assistant coach Rob Wright focusses on the defensive end and brings a point of difference as an Australian.</p>
        
            <p>"He's really good, he's got a unique coaching style. He can be very direct and to the point, but also he's got a fun personality so it's a really nice balance. And he looks at the game quite differently than any other coaches that I've had before. I feel like I'm learning a lot from him."</p>
        
            <p>Hall has started in two out of three games so far this season and has already played 101 minutes.</p>

            <p>Remarkably, she was also studying for a degree in medicine.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, her final year at Auckland's Baradene College, Hall was named Dux - the school's top academic student. She was first in biology, chemistry, physics, and statistics. She also earned Academic Achievement in English, as well as the Senior Literary Cup.</p>
        
            <p>She was in her third year at the University of Auckland, studying medicine, which was normally a six year degree.</p>
        
            <p>"I've started to think about specialising in sports medicine, maybe mixing the two interests. Otherwise general practice, but I'm not sure, I've got a bit of time to think about it."</p>
        
            <p>How was she managing to hold down full-time study with a netball career?</p>
        
            <p>"I am busy but I've actually found it a lot better than I expected and I've got really great support from both ends, so it's actually going really well."</p>
        
            <p>Hall was offered a scholarship for Otago University in her final year at high school but decided to stay in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I figured staying at home was the best option because I've got lots more support around me and I guess I already had netball set up here as well so I decided to try for Auckland University."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday the Mystics host the unbeaten Pulse in Auckland, looking to bounce back from their first loss of the season against the Tactix earlier this week.</p>
