            <p>Shot putter Tom Walsh admits his build-up to the Olympics hasn't been ideal, but he's not panicking.</p>
        
            <p>The two-time Olympic bronze medallist, 32, is back at his North American base in Georgia putting in the hard yards seven weeks out from his event in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Since leaving New Zealand in May, Walsh has competed in four international meetings in the US and Europe, making the podium just once and having a best throw of 21.33 metres.</p>
        
            <p>That was well below his best of 22.90m set in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely not as good as I would have liked to have thrown," Walsh told RNZ</p>
        
            <p>"There's not anything massively wrong, just a few tweaks here and there."</p>
        
            <p>The former World Champion and Commonwealth Games winner said he was not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about having faith, I can sure as hell dig myself a massive hole mentally and physically, but it's just about playing around with one or two things.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not my first rodeo, everyone is obviously excited about Olympics and wanting to throw well but if I beat myself up too much over the next month then I won't be in a good place to put my hand up for a medal, hopefully gold, when the time comes."</p>
        
            <p>Walsh's last throw over 22 metres when he finished second at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow in March.</p>

            <p>However he said things were going well in the gym and in training in the circle, which was encouraging.</p>
        
            <p>"The numbers in the gym are really good.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of my speed numbers are good too, like my ten metre sprint is down under two seconds which is really good, so it's not all bad.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though I get judged on results in competition, it's one part of the puzzle and the rest of the puzzle is going pretty well."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Crouser continues to dominate the sport and Walsh has his work cut out to challenge him and fellow American Joe Kovacs.</p>
        
            <p>Crouser won in Tokyo with a throw of 23.30m and since then he's claimed the 2022 and 2023 World Championship titles.</p>
        
            <p>The men's shot put qualifying is on 2 August with the final on the 3 August.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh heads back to Europe in early July and will compete at three meetings before the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Jacko Gill was the other New Zealand male competing in Paris, while Maddi Wesche will compete in the women's event.</p>
