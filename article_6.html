            <p>New Zealand skier Alice Robinson's consistency has produced a second World Cup giant slalom medal in as many days, clinching bronze in Sestriere, Italy to follow silver a day earlier.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old from Queenstown led after the opening run but had to settle for third in foggy conditions, beaten on overall time by Italian winner Federica Brignone and second-placed Swiss Lara Gut-Behrami.</p>
        
            <p>It was a bittersweet result for Robinson, who highlighted an error early in her second run which ultimately resulted in her dropping from first to third.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted a bit more today. I just tried to push a little bit too hard out of the gate and made that mistake. It probably happened at the worst place because I had no speed for the flats," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought I skied the bottom part well. I'm really happy with how far the consistency's come, so I'm glad."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson felt better after her first run, although her lead was only a narrow one in a tigthly packed field as she carried momentum off her silver medal on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"It was quite a different feeling to yesterday, yesterday it felt so easy - the snow was smooth, the light was perfect and the courses were really rhythmical," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today it was fast, bumpy and dark so it was quite different, but I am happy I was able to charge and put down a good run."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson had been on the podium in six of the last seven World Cup giant slalom races to remain on top of the standings.</p>
        
            <p>Her best result during her purple patch of form was victory at the world championships in Austria two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson will switch her focus to the Super G, her second favoured discipline which she will contest at a World Cup event in Norway next week.</p>
