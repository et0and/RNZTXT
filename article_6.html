        <h2>Savea wants All Blacks to ‘show the country that we can bounce back’</h2>
        <p>
Vice-captain Ardie Savea says this weekend's Bledisloe Cup test in Sydney is a great opportunity for the team after two recent losses.

            <p>All Blacks vice-captain Ardie Savea says this weekend's Bledisloe Cup test in Sydney is a great opportunity for the team after two defeats in a row to the world champion Springboks.</p>
        
            <p>"To show New Zealand that … you can take two steps backwards and propel a couple ahead," Savea said at the team's hotel in Double Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"That's just like life, sometimes you get knocked down but it's how you can get back up after. What a way for this team to be a vessel for that and show the country that we can bounce back."</p>
        
            <p>Savea has been named to start at number eight against the Wallabies at Accor Stadium, with coach Scott Robertson resisting the urge to shift him to openside flanker to accommodate Wallace Sititi at the back of the scrum.</p>
        
            <p>Sititi remains on the blindside due to Ethan Blackadder's unavailability, with Sam Cane wearing the seven jersey in his 99th test.</p>
        
            <p>"Wallace has been inspiring," Savea said of the young Chiefs player, who was arguably the All Blacks' best player in the 18-12 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town a fortnight ago.</p>

            <p>"We can perceive him as a young fella but he's come into this team with so much calmness, even wisdom. He's inspiring me in the way he walks and the way he plays."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, prop Pasilio Tosi is looking forward to getting on the field for his second test appearance. The Hurricanes prop has been named on the bench after an injury ruled Fletcher Newell out.</p>
        
            <p>"It means heaps," Tosi said of the call-up.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting the opportunity this Saturday is a huge privilege to have the jersey that a lot of people would die to wear. (Getting named) was pretty cool, I tried to keep the nerves under control. But then I got on the bus and got the handshakes and taps on the knee, that was pretty cool."</p>

            <p>Savea said the team had spent a session this week learning of the history of the iconic Bledisloe Cup, a trophy the All Blacks have kept in their possession for the last 21 years.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to understand the history of the Bledisloe, the history between the two countries. We learned about how we lost it, all those years ago and about how those players felt. That creates that feeling in your gut that you don't want to be part of that team (that loses the Bledisloe Cup)."</p>
        
            <p>One of those players is coach Scott Robertson. He never won the Bledisloe Cup in his 23-test All Black career, being on a losing side in his test debut at Lancaster Park in 1998. The famous trophy was handed over that season to the Wallabies and not regained until 2003, the longest ever period it has resided in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Savea said the change in scenery to bustling Sydney had meant the All Blacks had a different approach this week.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of preparation, it's not been the same. It's a lot of edge, energy like we have to … we can't dwell, we're trying to just release the shackles and play. When you see great All Blacks teams play, it looks like it's just there in the flow state."</p>
        
            <p>However, Savea once again reiterated the pressure the All Blacks were feeling after three losses this season was all relative.</p>
        
            <p>"Pressure for me is people at home not being able to eat, not having homes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a privilege, for us, rugby's a game that we love. We understand people care deeply about it, so that's the perceived pressure. For us it's about going out and having fun, being excited and hopefully that nullifies the perceived pressure people put on us. It comes back to enjoying yourself and working hard."</p>
