            <p>American Lexi Thompson, a former major champion and two-time Olympian, will retire from full-time competitive golf following the 2024 season, the LPGA announced on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old Thompson is an 11-time winner on the LPGA Tour and will be making her 18th consecutive start in a US Women's Open when she tees off at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"While it is never easy to say goodbye, it is indeed time. At the end of 2024, I will be stepping away from a full professional golf schedule," Thompson wrote on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish. I'm looking forward to the next chapter of my life."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson burst on to the scene in 2007 when, at age 12, she became the youngest player to qualify for the US Women's Open, a record since broken by Lucy Li who was 11 when she qualified for the 2014 edition of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The American went on to set a then-record as the youngest winner of an LPGA event when she won the 2011 Navistar Classic at the age of 16.</p>
        
            <p>In 2014, Thompson became the second youngest woman to win an LPGA major with a three-shot triumph at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson, who has more than US$14 million (NZ$23m) in career earnings and captured the most recent of her LPGA Tour wins in 2019, is also a six-time Solheim Cup participant and was a member of the US Olympic teams in 2016 and 2021.</p>
