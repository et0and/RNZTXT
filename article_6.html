            <p>England's dominant first half sealed an impressive 24-12 victory over world champions New Zealand in their women's international at Twickenham to extend their unbeaten run to 17 matches and make it four wins in five against the Black Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>England have not lost since a heart-breaking 34-31 defeat by New Zealand in the final of the last World Cup in November 2022 and have made a statement with this deserved victory ahead of the global finals they will host next year.</p>
        
            <p>Coach John Mitchell's side scored tries through captain Marlie Packer, wing Abby Dow, fullback Ellie Kildunne and halfback Natasha Hunt as they took a 24-0 lead before withstanding a comeback from the visitors in the last half-hour.</p>

            <p>Wing Katelyn Vaha'akolo crossed twice for the Black Ferns to breathe life into the contest but England saw out the remainder of the game in front of 41,523 fans in London.</p>
        
            <p>"It is never a friendly in test match rugby. We want to keep building to the World Cup next year and concentrate on our own performances," England forward Alex Matthews told BBC.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a great leadership group, communication is amazing and we have a clear voice on what we want to do. We have momentum, but we will keep working on where we can grow."</p>
        
            <p>The hosts scored the opening points midway through the first half when they turned down a kickable penalty to set up an attacking lineout and from the driving maul, Packer crossed for the unconverted try.</p>

            <p>Dow scored a second when she blazed past opposite number Vahaakolo to race clear, before Kildunne added a third just before halftime as the hosts led 17-0 at the break.</p>
        
            <p>England made a bright start to the second period and Hunt crossed the tryline under the posts, before New Zealand responded with two scores through Vahaakolo.</p>
        
            <p>The teams meet again in the WXV 1 tournament in Canada on 6 October.</p>
