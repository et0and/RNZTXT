            <p>A full strength Black Caps are set to take on a wounded Pakistan side in the opening T20 International at Eden Park on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan are fresh off a 3-0 test series drubbing at the hands of Australia, but are confident that a change in format will bring about a change in fortune.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Black Caps will welcome the return of its front-line players as they build towards the T20 World Cup in June.</p>
        
            <p>Senior seamer Tim Southee said they are all too aware of the threat the familiar foe poses.</p>
        
            <p>"Pakistan is a great side, obviously played them in a semi final against at the last T20 World Cup and we've played a lot against them since in their conditions in particular so it will be great to see them in these conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Southee could make history on Friday as he is just three scalps shy from becoming the first player to take 150 T20I wickets.</p>
        
            <p>However, he is not getting caught up in the potential milestone.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously when they come about they get recognised from your teammates and coach and what not, it's always nice, but I guess those are the things you probably look back on when you're finished at what you've been able to achieve."</p>
        
            <p>Southee said they will need to be on song in all departments against the number four ranked Pakistanis.</p>
        
            <p>"They are an exciting side with with some great bowlers and some in some very destructive batters."</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry will all be back in action after sitting out the Bangladesh series.</p>
        
            <p>Batsman Fakhar Zaman said Pakistan want the Kiwis at their best.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand side are one of the best cricket teams in the world. In recent years you can see in last two World Cups they played the semifinals in ODI's and T20."</p>
        
            <p>Having performed poorly across the ditch, Zaman said the side will need to adapt quickly to New Zealand conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"The challenge for us is that we only have two to three days of training in proper nets. So I think in New Zealand, you need more days like 10 to 15 days to get familiar with the wickets because there's a difference in the bounce if you compare to Pakistan."</p>

            <p>New Zealand will welcome a new bowling coach for the series in former Black Caps allrounder Andre Adams after Shane Jurgensen stepped down after last year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Adams played 47 internationals across three formats for New Zealand from 2001-2007.</p>
        
            <p>The 48-year-old has worked closely with Australian superstar Mitchell Starc and most recently mentored the White Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't been here for a while, I'm very grateful to be back in the mix, very different vibe, a lot more grown up."</p>
        
            <p>He said he will look to impart the knowledge gained from playing around the world throughout a storied career.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think this group needs too much coaching. My job is probably to challenge thinking and maybe introduce a couple of concepts which they may or may not have come across."</p>
        
            <p>Adams said he was excited about the prospect of working with young pace bowlers such as Ben Sears while also having the experience of Southee and Henry.</p>
        
            <p>"Once you get to this level, you have a skill threshold, it's not your skill, it's your ability to apply your skill and make sense of the situation you're in."</p>
        
            <p>Adams said he hoped the temporary role becomes full time.</p>
        
            <p>"You'd be crazy if you don't want to work with the Black Caps."</p>
        
            <p>Friday night marks a full circle for Adams, who played in the inaugural T20 International against Australia in Auckland in 2005.</p>
        
            <p>"It was kind of like a carnival, but it was very serious, I didn't think it would get to the point where it would take over so drastically. I think the game is more exciting now."</p>
