            <p>The Warriors say they will investigate a claim that assistant coach Richard Agar assaulted an English journalist at half-time of the club's NRL season-opening loss to Canberra.</p>
        
            <p>Englishman Agar allegedly grabbed the journalist, who asked not to be named, by the throat at the back of the Allegiant Stadium press box.</p>
        
            <p>The journalist from The Guardian also claimed he was verbally abused by Agar in the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The NRL said in a statement it is aware of the alleged incident and will launch an investigation in coming days.</p>
        
            <p>It is likely CCTV footage will be checked.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors boss Cameron George is also aware of the alleged altercation and told NewsCorp the club will launch its own investigation when the team returns to Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't had a chance to speak with Richard, but I will," George said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are enough cameras in this building, so I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of it. Once I have all the information, we'll deal with it."</p>
        
            <p>Australian reports say there was bad blood between Agar and the journalist stemming back to 2022.</p>
        
            <p>It related to media report in which the journalist wrote Agar deserved to be sacked as coach of Leeds in the UK Super League.</p>
