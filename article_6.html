            <p>The Wellington Phoenix and Auckland FC both enter the new A-League men's season with plenty to prove.</p>
        
            <p>The league enters its 20th season this weekend with New Zealand's involvement doubling with the inclusion of new club from Auckland.</p>

            <p>Last season the Wellington Phoenix had one of their best results of the 17 seasons they've been involved.</p>
        
            <p>While this season there is a lot of interest in the the arrival of expansion club Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix finished second during the 23-24 regular season and were knocked out in the semi-finals of the play-offs. Central Coast won their third title and second in a row.</p>
        
            <p>We can expect all the big clubs to be contenders again and Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano believes the majority of the teams are capable of success.</p>
        
            <p>Into his second season in charge in Wellington, Italiano said the $2.8m salary cap has played a big part in that.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw Mariners last year, very similar to us, they ended up winning the league with a small budget, a lot of young players, a good coaching staff and some good ideas," Italiano told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"That just shows that the league is very very close and I think if you have a bad day in the league you'll get punished and I think that's very god, very healthy."</p>
        
            <p>The trans-tasman competition has been a breeding ground for talent, with a long list of players moving onto bigger leagues overseas.</p>

            <p>Phoenix captain Alex Rufer believes that has also played a part in producing an even competition.</p>
        
            <p>"A big difference in the last few years is that there is probably more youth playing, but that doesn't mean the quality has dropped at all.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the players have been very good, I think the standard is very good, the competitiveness is there."</p>
        
            <p>Inaugural Auckland FC coach Steve Corica has had A-League success as both a player and a manager with Sydney FC.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a tough start for Corica who has only had his overseas players for the last couple of weeks, but he is happy with the squad he's put together.</p>
        
            <p>One of Corica's signings was defender Dan Hall, who was with the Mariners... Hall admits it will be a process for them to become competitive in the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>"Not getting too far ahead of ourselves and just focussing on the process of what Steve and the coaching staff want us to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I think building moment each week and hopefully by the end of the season we'll be flying."</p>
        
            <p>While they did well last season Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano wants to present a new team this term.</p>
        
            <p>He is concerned that everyone was satisfied with their performance last season.</p>

            <p>"Like most things, everything needs to evolve to have success.</p>
        
            <p>"Teams will get smarter when they play us, give us more respect, so we also need to evolve in terms of our ideas.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year is last year, we'll build on the good things but it's only a memory now."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Football CEO Andrew Pragnell said having two professional men's teams now will help with player development in the country and is a major boost for the fans.</p>
        
            <p>He said the game here is probably in the best place it has ever been.</p>
        
            <p>"2010 (World Cup) was critical for us, I feel in 2010 we shrugged off our inferiority complex around football.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a milestone moment, we have the chance to go to the 2026 World Cup, our third men's World Cup and we've just hosted a women's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>With another professional side coming on I only see incredible times ahead."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC open their season at home on Saturday against Brisbane Roar and the Phoenix are at home on Sunday against Western United.</p>
        
            <p>The two New Zealand clubs will meet each other in round three in Wellington on 2 November.</p>
        
            <p>The women's A-League starts in a fortnight with Auckland FC scheduled to have their women's team competing next season.</p>
