            <p>The unavailability of a spectator facility has seen Auckland withdraw from hosting SailGP in March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>TƒÅtaki Auckland Unlimited Chief Executive Nick Hill said they worked with SailGP to explore all possible options to stage the event.</p>
        
            <p>Wynyard Point land as a spectator facility was part of SailGP's original vision for the sailing competition.</p>
        
            <p>However, its unavailability proved to be a barrier to holding the event, leaving SailGP needing a new venue.</p>
        
            <p>"SailGP continues to work with its partners, including relevant local and central government agencies, to progress planning for its season four New Zealand event 23-24 March 2024," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The SailGP event is the second in a four-year deal to host alternative regattas Lyttelton and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of spectators turned out earlier this year to watch the racing at Christchurch's Lyttelton Harbour.</p>
