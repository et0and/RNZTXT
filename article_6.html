            <p>Men's world golf number two Rory McIlroy and J.J. Spaun will have to return on Monday (US time) to play off for the The Players Championship in Florida after they both ended a weather-delayed final round level at 12-under-par 276.</p>
        
            <p>It is the ninth time The Players has spilled over into a fifth day, and the first since 2022 when Australian Cameron Smith claimed the title.</p>
        
            <p>McIlroy and Spaun will play a three-hole aggregate playoff on holes 16,17 and 18.</p>
        
            <p>Northern Irishman McIlroy, who had been three ahead with six holes to play at TPC Sawgrass, closed with a four-under 68 while Spaun rebounded from a sketchy first 11 holes with a strong finish to return a 72.</p>
        
            <p>McIlroy, in pursuit of his second Players Championship title, was boosted by a sizzling birdie-eagle start but he squandered good birdie opportunities on holes 15 and 16 that would have given him much-needed breathing room, and Spaun closed in with birdies of his own on holes 14 and 16.</p>
        
            <p>Spaun, who earned his first and only PGA Tour win at the 2022 Valero Texas Open after 147 career starts, came desperately close to sealing victory on the 18th green but his birdie putt from 30 feet came up three inches short.</p>

            <p>Final-round play was suspended for four hours as a storm system slowly tracked across the course.</p>
        
            <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler's quest for an unprecedented third successive Players victory ended in disappointing fashion as he closed with 73 for a four-under total and a 10-way tie for 20th, which included New Zealand's Ryan Fox.</p>
        
            <p>Fox carded a final round two under 70, including four birdies and two bogeys.</p>
