        <h2>Warriors season opener: What you need to know</h2>
        <p>
All you need to know about tonight's Warriors season opener at a sold-out Go Media Mt Smart Stadium.
</p>
        
            <p>Warriors v Sharks</p>
        
            <p>If you were thinking about heading to the Warriors game tonight, bad news: tickets are sold out at Mt Smart.</p>
        
            <p>The hype is real. This will be the first time the ground has been full for a Warriors season opener since their first ever game back in 1995. That night was a memorable one, but the result saw the Warriors on the wrong end of a 25-22 score against the Brisbane Broncos.</p>
        
            <p>Tonight, they welcome the Sharks to town, with the Craig Fitzgibbon-coached side in a similar state of expectation around their premiership hopes in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1. Taine Tuaupiki 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Rocco Berry 4. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Luke Metcalf 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Mitchell Barnett 11. Jackson Ford 12. Kurt Capewell 13. Tohu Harris</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Freddy Lussick 15. Tom Ale 16. Bunty Afoa 17. Dylan Walker</p>
        
            <p>Sharks: 1. William Kennedy 2. Sione Katoa 3. Jesse Ramien 4. Siosifa Talakai 5. Ronaldo Mulitalo 6. Braydon Trindall 7. Nicho Hynes 8. Oregon Kaufusi 9. Blayke Brailey 10. Royce Hunt 11. Briton Nikora 12. Teig Wilton 13. Cameron McInnes</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Dale Finucane 15. Jack Williams 16. Toby Rudolf 17. Thomas Hazelton</p>

            <p>The main talking points from Andrew Webster's first selection are the Warriors' halves and bench, with Luke Metcalf getting the nod to partner Shaun Johnson. It's a real show of faith in the impressive Metcalf, who certainly did nothing wrong in the opportunities he was given last season and has shot himself to the top of the depth chart this preseason.</p>
        
            <p>The bench does look a little light, due to the absence of the injured Marata Niukore, but Dylan Walker's adaptability can make up for that. The former NSW Origin rep is handy enough in every role from second row out to the centres, so if there is some sort of injury crisis the Warriors do have the ability to change the gameplan on the fly.</p>
        
            <p>The big news is that Nicho Hynes passed a mid-week injury scare, he is absolutely vital the Sharks' campaign and they will head into tonight a lot more confident with him on the park. Braydon Trindall joins him in the halves, while a lot of work will be done on the edge by Kiwi second rower Briton Nikora.</p>

            <p>Sione Katoa and Ronaldo Mulitalo are a powerful wing combo, with Mulitalo coming off being 2023's leading try scorer and then playing a huge role in the Kiwis' demolition of the Kangaroos in November. Inside them Jesse Ramien and Siosifa Talakai are a handful enough on their own for Rocco Berry and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck to take care of.</p>
        
            <p>Round five: Warriors 32 - 30 Sharks</p>
        
            <p>Round 20: Warriors 44 - 12 Sharks</p>
        
            <p>There is a fair bit between these sides and that's only relating to last year. Their match at Shark Park was so good it won the Warriors a Halberg Award, but it also featured a memorable trash talk battle between Mulitalo and Ed Kosi, one that Kosi got the last laugh in thanks to his side's stunning comeback.</p>
        
            <p>Later on in round 20, the banged-up Sharks ran into a Warriors side nearing their high-water mark of the season and were blown away thanks to a stunning four tries in 12 minutes burst that effectively ended the game as a contest before halftime.</p>
        
            <p>This will not be an easy task for the Warriors but they should get the job done by a two try margin. The big crowd at Mt Smart will make their presence felt and expect new man Kurt Capewell to endear himself to them with a big performance.</p>
