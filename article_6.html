            <p>It's been a long grind back to the top for Adi Ashok.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Cap's spinner was sidelined for almost a year with a back injury throwing his international future in doubt.</p>
        
            <p>Ashok last played for his country in December 2023, before the 22-year-old had surgery on his back followed by a 10-month rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>He would make his return for Auckland in November last year and his impressive form has earned him a recall to the Black Caps for their ODI series against Pakistan starting in Napier tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the setback, Ashok does not look back on his time away in a negative light.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to be back and thoroughly happy to top off the summer with being back in this crew.</p>
        
            <p>"It was definitely an eye-opening experience, in terms of trying to manage my body a little bit better and understand what it really needs.</p>
        
            <p>"As a whole I've really grown as a person and so it's been a really cool experience that in a funny way I wouldn't really trade for anything else."</p>
        
            <p>The Aces bowler said he's thriving in the Black Caps environment.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't help but feel a different vibe, a different energy, which is world-class. It's such an infectious and contagious place to be in terms of everyone's got an awesome attitude.</p>

            <p>"Everyone's got an awesome wealth of knowledge and experience and you can't help but learn really."</p>
        
            <p>Ashok's recall was aided by the unavailability of several Black Caps playing in the IPL.</p>
        
            <p>"Any opportunity to get to play for New Zealand is one that you cherish, with the quality of players in the side, you see a lot of guys that have played for a period and a couple of new faces as well and to play against a pretty competitive Pakistan side, I think it's going to be awesome."</p>
        
            <p>He is relishing the thought of taking on some of the best batters in the world such as Barba Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.</p>
        
            <p>"These are guys that you see floating around in the big leagues and the big ICC events.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be awesome to go toe to toe with them and really ask yourself: How do you match up against them? And pick up little tricks along the way."</p>
