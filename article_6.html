            <p>The Commonwealth Games Federation's president has endorsed Australia's offer of a multimillion-dollar to support Scottish city Glasgow's bid to host the games in 2026 after Australia's state of Victoria pulled out last year over cost concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The quadrennial multi-sport event has struggled to find hosts, with Malaysia rejecting an offer to host the 2026 edition and Canada's Alberta withdrawing from hosting the event in 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Glasgow, which also hosted the 2014 edition, stepped up as a back-up venue in April with Commonwealth Games Scotland (CGS) proposing a concept that slashed the event's budget to NZ$275-$320 million.</p>
        
            <p>The scaled-down model will use existing sporting infrastructure for a core sport programme of 10-13 sports and will not ask for significant public funds, the CGS said.</p>
        
            <p>"We commend Commonwealth Games Australia for making this generous offer," CGF President Chris Jenkins said in a statement, adding that the Glasgow model was different but innovative.</p>
        
            <p>BBC Scotland reported a source close to the talks said: "In recent weeks, the Scottish government has probed and tested what it would look like for Scotland to host a scaled back Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>"That has seen real progress. If we remain satisfied that the public purse won't have to be opened to pay for these games, the confidence is rising."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the UK government assured the Scottish government that no public money would be required to stage the games.</p>
