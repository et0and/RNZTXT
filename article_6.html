            <p>Rangitāne sisters Jackie Gowler and Kerri Williams have not always rowed together - but in 2024 they worked together 24/7 to prepare for the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The sisters from Whanganui were part of the bronze medal winning women's four at the Olympics with Davina Waddy and Phoebe Spoors.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said it had been a whirlwind year, she rejoined the squad at the end of 2023 after a year away.</p>
        
            <p>It was a race against time to get a crew together for the games, but to come away with a bronze medal was very special, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Gowler said the team was lucky to grab the last qualification spot in Serbia - after that they knew there was a lot of work to do to secure a podium in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"We're super proud and looking back it's almost a bit surreal that we managed to do that over the time frame we had," she said.</p>

            <p>The sisters did not cross over too much at the start of their careers - even in Tokyo where they were both part of the women's eight Williams was also competing (and winning) in the women's pair.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just really fortunate to have been coming through at the same time to be able to bounce off each other and have the opportunity to row in some boats together as well," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Gowler said they knew each other pretty well - and it showed in how they pushed each other in training.</p>
        
            <p>"We both know how to push ourselves and we both know that we are going to have each other's back and then obviously there's the sister dynamic that is pretty unfiltered and pretty raw at times but it's a good way to be in terms of getting the job done at the end of the day."</p>
        
            <p>That competitive nature is something that has been instilled by their whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever we do catch up as a family we all get stuck into a bit of some sort of activity and we're competitive in nature," Gowler said.</p>
        
            <p>Gowler said the entire Olympic team embraced Māori culture at the 2024 games.</p>
        
            <p>"I reckon it makes us stand out as a nation to the other countries and I think that was something we were really proud of because it's so different and it connects us as a wider team as much as it does for just our rowing team."</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the world felt the New Zealand team's presence through Māori culture, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's becoming more and more in sport something to be proud of," Williams said. "On tour this year we would all get together and have waiata practice and that's something that I've never been a part of in the Rowing New Zealand team in particular so it's really special for us to have a piece of us [that] is actually part of that and knowing that's where we are from as well was really special."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the demands of professional rowing and despite growing up in Whanganui outside the rohe (region) of their iwi around Dannevirke, Williams said the sisters had remained as connected to their iwi as possible.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were really proud of their background and the support they had received through it.</p>
        
            <p>"To be able to represent our iwi on the world stage has been really special and I hope they are as proud of us."</p>

            <p>In November Williams announced her retirement, bowing out as one of Aotearoa's most successful rowers with five world championships and a full set of Olympic medals to her name.</p>
        
            <p>Williams formed a formidable partnership with Grace Prendergast in the Women's Pair - taking home a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said she was stepping away from rowing on her own terms. She is satisfied with what she has achieved in her career and looking forward to what the future holds.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always going to be tough, rowing has been my whole life, but I was really content with my career and I'm really excited to get stuck in to something else, what that is I'm unsure but I just feel it was the right time to step away," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"On reflection I have been blessed to have a really successful career but I think it's just a testament to the time that I've come through and the people that I've been around. Rowing has always one of our most successful Olympic sports and I feel honoured to have been a part of that."</p>
