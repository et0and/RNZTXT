            <p>With three weeks remaining in the regular season, Moana Pasifika are not only playing for a spot in the finals, but quite possibly their future in Super Rugby Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a rough introduction for Moana, finishing last in their first two seasons and playing without a home base in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>From Auckland, to Hamilton, to Tonga, the side has played at six different venues for their seven home games this year.</p>
        
            <p>They have yet to play at their allocated homeground of North Harbour Stadium due to safety concerns about the surface.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Tana Umaga said there has been talk surrounding the stability of Moana since its inception, but its survival was imperative for both Samoa and Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a great need for it, but there's a lot of moving parts within that, there's a lot of people who need to be in on that discussion and come up with the way forward for us and World Rugby plays a big part in that."</p>
        
            <p>He said the islands remain a key cog in the global game.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make sure that we're not lost in the growth, because we feel we are a big part of it."</p>
        
            <p>Umaga remains hopeful of taking more games to the Islands.</p>

            <p>The former All Black captain said it showcased the passion and support that exists in the Pacific, and wants to see both Tonga and Samoa regularly hosting fixtures.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just amazing to see the crowd, the school kids come in their uniforms and the torrential rain that turned up from nowhere, yet they still turned up. That was probably our best crowd that we've had, for a home game in the last couple of years."</p>
        
            <p>Umaga said the experience reinforced what the side means to the people of the Pacific and they won't lose sight of that.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes us determined to keep pushing through that door to make sure it stays open for our Pacific Island people."</p>
        
            <p>He cites the Fijian Drua as the template for success in the islands.</p>

            <p>"They have those structures in place, the high performance unit. We all want to be there but at the moment, it's just not in place. So we have to adapt and adjust to what suits us at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the off field distractions, Umaga and his side remains focussed on their bid for a first ever top eight finish.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't worry about what's happening in the future. We're here now and we have got three games for the rest of the season and we are planning like we're part of the future and I believe we will be."</p>
        
            <p>Umaga will return to the city where has made his rugby career this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>His side will meet the high flying Hurricanes at Sky Stadium on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>"We've left our run a little bit late but we're still in the race and that's that's all we can ask at the minute. The great thing is that it's all under our control. It's a big task going down to Wellington but we want to have a crack down there."</p>
        
            <p>Umaga said he saw signs of his famous Hurricane's side's style reflected in the 2024 team.</p>
        
            <p>"They are playing with a lot of confidence and they attack from everything, but it's also very controlled. Maybe in the old days we were pretty unpredictable but they know where they where they need to play from. They and the Blues are playing the best rugby I've seen for a long time and it's great to watch."</p>
