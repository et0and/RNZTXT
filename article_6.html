            <p>Black Caps batters Devon Conway and Finn Allen have joined the growing number of players opting out of New Zealand Cricket's (NZC) central contract system.</p>
        
            <p>Conway has been offered a casual playing contract and confirmed his availability for all international fixtures for the next year except the three T20s and three One Day International (ODI) matches against Sri Lanka in December and January.</p>
        
            <p>It means Conway, 33, will be available for all nine upcoming tests as well as the ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan in February, and the tri-series against Pakistan and South Africa ahead of it.</p>
        
            <p>Conway said a contract offer to play in South Africa's T20 competition in January prompted him to give up his NZC central contract.</p>
        
            <p>Having played for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and their US based franchise the Texas Super Kings, it is likely he will play for the Johannesburg Super Kings.</p>

            <p>Players offered NZC central contracts must commit to being available for international play and the domestic T20 competition.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to move away from a central playing contract isn't one I've taken lightly, but I believe it is the best for me and my family at this present time," Conway said.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing for the Black Caps is still the pinnacle for me and I'm hugely passionate about representing New Zealand and winning games of international cricket."</p>
        
            <p>A growing number of players are giving up central contracts to take up more lucrative overseas T20 contracts.</p>
        
            <p>In June, former Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson turned down a central contract preferring a casual one so he could play in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Fast bowlers Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne have also opted out of central contracts.</p>

            <p>While Conway has been offered a casual contract big hitting white ball specialist, Finn Allen has not, although Allen will remain available for New Zealand with his selection for upcoming squads being on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        
            <p>NZC chief executive Scott Weenink said casual playing contracts are only offered on a discretionary basis.</p>
        
            <p>Conway's overall playing record combined with his commitment to be available for the vast majority of New Zealand games "sealed the deal", Weenink said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the current environment it's important to have flexibility in our system to navigate some of the challenges posed by franchise cricket - and this is another example of how we're working hard to retain our best players."</p>
        
            <p>Weenink reiterated the organisation's preference for selecting players on central or casual playing contracts for the Black Caps.</p>
