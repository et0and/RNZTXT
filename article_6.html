            <p>An out-of-sorts Chiefs needed a late Damian McKenzie penalty to beat the Rebels 26-23 in Melbourne and entrench their top-four status.</p>
        
            <p>A fourth straight win for the New Zealand side wasn't easily achieved as the Rebels fought back from a 12-point deficit midway through the second half to level the scores with six minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs kept their cool, snaffling possession and driving back onto the attack, where a penalty adjacent to the posts was converted by McKenzie, who finished with 16 points and was typically influential in their attacking game.</p>
        
            <p>When they flowed, the visitors made significant inroads but silly errors allowed the Rebels - who provided a robust forward challenge and were effective on counter-attack - to stay in the contest at AAMI Park.</p>

            <p>Winger Glen Vaihu crossed early for Melbourne before the Chiefs ground out a 13-11 halftime lead.</p>
        
            <p>Lock Tupou Vaa'i was a notable first-half figure, scoring a try in the 23rd minute before being shown a yellow card for a high cleanout.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs appeared to grab control with hooker Samisoni Taukeiaho scored a converted try and McKenzie landed his third penalty to put them 23-11 ahead.</p>
        
            <p>It sparked the Rebels's best period, with winger Lachie Anderson crossing twice to set up the tense finish.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs climbed from fourth to third - although they could drop back one place if the Brumbies beat the Crusaders on Saturday night - and remain firmly on course to host a quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>The Rebels remain sixth but aren't yet guaranteed their first-ever place in the Super Rugby post-season.</p>
