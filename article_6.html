            <p>The Tall Ferns gave a up a second quarter lead going down to Montenegro in their opening match at the Basketball World Cup pre-qualifiers in Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>After holding a 21-16 lead early in the second quarter, New Zealand eventually went down 64-88.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders were led by Ritorya Tamilo who scored 11 points and six rebounds while Penina Davidson also scored 11 points.</p>
        
            <p>The game also saw four Tall Ferns make their debuts: Bailey Flavell, Ashlee Strawbridge, Ella Tofaeono and Charlotte Whittaker.</p>
        
            <p>Statistically, Montenegro won the game not just with their shooting and offensive rebounding (16 boards, leading to a 19-8 advantage in second chance points), but also with a solid defensive effort.</p>
        
            <p>They forced the Tall Ferns into 25 turnovers - which they directly turned into 33 points.</p>
        
            <p>Following the game, Tall Ferns head coach Natalie Hurst said the side needed to learn from their mistakes and quickly with their next game against the hosts Mexico on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"This was our first run as a group together; so credit to Montenegro, they came out and pressured us from the start, and obviously they shot the ball very well," said Hurst.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be tougher, we need to guard the three point line a little better, and our communication was not where it needs to be tonight. So they're three key areas that we need to fix up pretty quickly."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the team will need to focus on the next challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"We got punched in the face first up; it's pretty hard to take - but it's pretty hard to win a game when the other team scores that many points and we only score 64. But it's a good lesson for us and we've got two pretty good opportunities coming up [to win]."</p>
