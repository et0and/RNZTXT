            <p>The New Zealand rugby factory has long been the envy of the world. The nation has inexplicably churned out legend after legend of the game. But not all Kiwi born players make their mark in black.</p>

            <p>NZ Highlight: 2006 Super 14 finalist with the Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>Highest NZ Honour: Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>England Highlight: 2013 Six Nations runner-up</p>
        
            <p>Snapshot: A shot put, discus and hammer throw star in high school, Waldrom was a standout performer for both the Hurricanes and Crusaders and at provincial level where 'the Tank' was also a cult hero in both Wellington and Hawke's Bay. With a plethora of loose forward talent in the All Blacks, Waldrom joined Leicester in 2010 and while awaiting residency, discovered his eligibility for England through his grandmother. Played the first of five tests against the Springboks in 2012. Won the English Premiership twice, in 2013 with Leicester and the Exeter Chiefs in 2017 and the competitions top try-scorer in 2015 and 2016. Unwanted by Eddie Jones, Waldrom ended his playing career back in New Zealand with the Lions.</p>

            <p>England Highlight: Scored a double in England's 57-14 win over Italy in 2019</p>
        
            <p>Snapshot: A stalwart of Wellington rugby since his debut at 19, Shields was an age grade rep and junior World Cup winner in 2011. Formed a dynamic loose forward trio with Ardie Savea and Victor Vito as the Hurricanes claimed their first Super Rugby title in 2016. Having played 100 caps for the Hurricanes, including leading the side in a draw against the British and Irish Lions, Shields was yet to sniff an All Blacks jersey, and transferred to London Wasps in 2018. Was immediately eligible for England through his parents and made his debut against South Africa in 2018. Injuries and rising stars saw him fall out of favour after nine tests. Has since returned to Wellington where he won the 2024 NPC with the Lions.</p>

            <p>Snapshot: A junior star for Mt Albert Grammar, Halaholo played for both NZ Schools and Tonga U20's. After standout seasons for the Southland Stags, he was picked up by the Hurricanes in 2015. Replaced Ma'a Nonu in the Hurricane's midfield in 2016 following the legend's retirement and played in the final against the Lions. With SBW still blocking his path to the All Blacks, he transferred to Cardiff, achieving residency and a test debut in 2019. Played in four of the five matches of Wales' 2021 Six Nations title win. Returned to New Zealand and played in the 2023 NPC final with Bay of Plenty.</p>

            <p>Snapshot: Won a World Cup with the NZ U20's in 2010, Thomson played for Taranaki and the Hurricanes, but tragically was ruled out of both the 2014 NPC and 2015 Super Rugby finals through injury which both his sides won. Earned six caps for the Maori, winning all but one. With Ardie Savea, Kieran Read and Sam Cane locked as the All Black loosies, the dynamic Thomson joined Scarletts in 2018. Qualified for Scotland through his grandfather, Thomson was promoted to the Scottish squad later that season, though did not make his debut until August 2019 in a 17-14 win over France. He went on to appear in three of the side's four pool games at the 2019 World Cup, his last test a 25-24 loss to Wales in the 2021 Six Nations, following the rise of Jamie Ritchie and Matt Fagerson for Scotland. Head injury forced his retirement at just in 2023.</p>

            <p>Snapshot: Heinz played four years in the Burnside High 1st XV before making his Canterbury debut in 2009. With Andy Ellis' stranglehold on the Crusader's number 9 jersey, Heinz moved to England in 2015 after breaking his leg in Super Rugby pre-season, signing with Gloucester where he would go on to play 100 caps. Qualified for England through his grandmother and made his debut as vice captain in August 2019 against Wales. Featured at that year's world cup, missing the final after suffering an injury in the semi-final win over the All Blacks. Retuned to Aotearoa in 2022, playing in the Crusader's 25-20 win over the Chiefs in the 2023 Super Rugby Pacific final.</p>

            <p>Snapshot: A key cog in the legendary Otago side of the nineties, 'Chainsaw' bagged 15 tries in the '98 NPC season including in the 49-20 win over Waikato in the final. A fan favourite in the deep south, Laney was never a serious contender for the All Blacks with the likes of Lomu, Cullen and Wilson blocking his path. Played his final game for the Highlanders in 2001 and eligible through the controversial 'granny rule,' Laney was selected for Scotland just two days after leaving Aotearoa, and made his test debut just eleven days later, causing a serious stir. He went on to score 100 points in just nine tests, spending five seasons with Edinburgh.</p>
