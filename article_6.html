            <p>France were eliminated as a potential America's Cup challenger, losing their dream of competing for the coveted trophy, while Britain chalked up key wins to top the round-robin series leaderboard in light winds off Barcelona.</p>
        
            <p>As the leaders, Ben Ainslie's Britannia team get to choose their opponents for the semi-finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest, we weren't really expecting that," Ainslie said after beating the Italian Luna Rossa team in a sail-off, while declining to say who they would pick to race now.</p>
        
            <p>"Big credit to the team ... all the work has paid off. I think we've got a quick package so we've just got to keep that ball rolling," Ainslie said.</p>
        
            <p>Five potential challengers for the America's Cup -- Britain, France, Italy, the United States and Switzerland -- have been battling in the double round-robin stage of the challenger series in often volatile sailing conditions on the Mediterranean.</p>
        
            <p>Britain earlier put French team Orient Express out of the competition with a convincing win over the late entrants as Cup challengers.</p>
        
            <p>"We fought really hard, but it was not enough," Quentin Delapierre said of the French crew's performance, adding "what the team has achieved is really unbelievable".</p>
        
            <p>With the exit of the French team, who despite some robust racing only chalked up one series win, the four surviving teams will go into a semi-final round for a place in the final, which will decide who challenges defenders Team New Zealand in October.</p>
        
            <p>All four are aiming to get a tilt at the oldest international sporting trophy, known as the 'Auld Mug', which was first won off the south coast of England in 1851.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand completed their involvement in the round-robin section of the challenger series with a 2 minutes and 37 second [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/527363/team-nz-win-penultimate-race-of-america-s-cup-challenger-series win over American Magi.</p>
        
            <p>America's Cup campaigns now cost tens of millions of dollars and are fought out in state-of-the-art 'foiling' AC75 boats in what some equate to Formula One for sailing.</p>
