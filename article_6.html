            <p>Central Stags cricket captain Tom Bruce has posted the third-highest score in domestic first-class cricket, scoring 345 against Auckland at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce's first triple-century is the highest first-class score in New Zealand since December 1952, when the late great Bert Sutcliffe produced his national record of 385, while opening the batting for Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Sutcliffe is the only person to score more runs than Bruce in a first-class innings in New Zealand - including Test cricket - and he did that twice, also scoring 355 in the Plunket Shield in December 1950 against Auckland.</p>

            <p>Resuming on his overnight score of 212 not out, Bruce went past Peter Ingram's Central Stags landmark of 247 to become his team's individual recordholder.</p>
        
            <p>He also shared consecutive Central Stags record stands over the course of his innings. On Wednesday, his 292 with Dane Cleaver (115) broke the fourth-wicket partnership record of 276, previously held by Martin Crowe and Scott Briasco.</p>
        
            <p>A fifth-wicket record followed on Thursday, when Bruce and Josh Clarkson, who reached a career-best 166 not out, compiled 303 together. The previous mark stood at 301, set by Ross Taylor and Jarrod Englefield in 2004/05.</p>
        
            <p>When Bruce eventually feathered an attempted sweep to wicketkeeper Cam Fletcher, off spinner Louis Delport, at 670/5, a remarkable innings came to a close and his Auckland Aces opponents ran after him to congratulate him, before he left the field to a standing ovation from those few who witnessed it.</p>
        
            <p>His knock spanned almost nine-and-a-half hours and came off only 401 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce declared at 700/5 in the middle session - a record team total for the Central Stags and the fifth highest total in all first-class games (including Tests) on New Zealand soil.</p>
