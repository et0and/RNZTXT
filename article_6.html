            <p>Wellington Phoenix have conceded top spot on the A-League men's standings after going down 2-1 to new leaders Central Coast Mariners in Gosford.</p>
        
            <p>A 91st-minute winner from fullback Mikael Doka sank the Phoenix, who would have stayed three points clear on the regular season table with three rounds remaining if they'd held on for a draw on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, they trail their arch-rivals on points differential, setting up a scrap for the Premiers Plate over the closing rounds.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington's favour is that the Mariners will need to juggle AFC Cup commitments, including a trip to Kyrgyzstan, in coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Colombian forward Angel Torres had headed Central Coast in front an hour into the match before All Whites midfielder Ben Old drew Wellington level with 12 minutes remaining in normal time.</p>

            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano was disappointed with the nature of Doka's match-winner, with the Brazilian given too much space as he cut inside from the right-wing and curled a left-footed shot from outside the box into the bottom corner.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we've conceded a goal like that all year, especially top of the box," Italiano said at the post-match press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"We usually defend that very, very well so I was really disappointed with that. But in saying that the Mariners are a good team, they're at home and they hardly lose here."</p>
        
            <p>"The Mariners still have to win those three games. They have to travel halfway across the world, so they have to deal with those variables and we still have to win our games. There's still a lot to play for this season."</p>
        
            <p>Giancarlo Italiano made three changes to the XI which started the 1-0 win over Brisbane Roar on Easter Sunday, with academy graduates Ben Old, Lukas Kelly-Heald and Matt Sheridan coming into the side for suspended captain Alex Rufer, and Mo Al-Taay and David Ball.</p>
        
            <p>It was Sheridan's first start after three previous appearances off the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Fit-again fullback Tim Payne and 16-year-old Gabriel Sloane-Rodrigues were also included amongst the substitutes, while Scott Wootton captained the Phoenix in Rufer's absence.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix will have little time to dwell on their fourth defeat of the season, as they travel home to face the third-placed Melbourne Victory on Friday night.</p>
