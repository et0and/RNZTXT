            <p>Mushfiqur Rahim's brain-fade moment led to his obstructing-the-field dismissal but Bangladesh took charge of the second test against New Zealand after 15 wickets tumbled on a frenzied opening day of the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing a series-levelling victory, the Black Caps appeared to nose ahead in the contest after bundling out Bangladesh for 172 at Mirpur's Shere Bangla Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists had to contend with a top-order meltdown of their own when they came out to bat and they were reeling at 55-5 when bad light stopped play with only 79 overs bowled in the day.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell (12) and Glenn Phillips (five) will resume New Zealand's battle to stay in the contest when play resumes on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier opting to bat, Bangladesh slumped to 47-4 in 15 overs with New Zealand's spin duo of Mitchell Santner (3-65) and Ajaz Patel (2-54) wrecking their top order.</p>
        
            <p>Mushfiqur (35) and Shahadat Hossain (31) combined in a 57-run stand to steady the ship until the 41st over when New Zealand prised out a wicket in the unlikeliest of fashions.</p>
        
            <p>Mushfiqur defended a Kyle Jamieson delivery and then instinctively extended his right hand to push the ball away even though there was no chance of it hitting the stumps.</p>
        
            <p>The TV umpire upheld New Zealand's appeal for what was previously known as handling-the-ball but was brought under obstructing-the-field dismissal in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Mushfiqur is the first Bangladesh batter to be given out obstructing the field, seven batsmen had previously been given out 'handling the ball' in test cricket.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips wrecked Bangladesh's lower order with figures of 3-31.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's top order could not master the spin-friendly conditions and looked ill at ease against Mehidy Hasan Miraz (3-17) and Taijul Islam (2-29).</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh won the opening test in Sylhet by 150 runs.</p>
