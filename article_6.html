            <p>All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua will remain with Hurricanes and New Zealand Rugby until the end of 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Aumua has played 68 times for the Hurricanes since his debut against the Crusaders in 2018 following a breakout season with the Lions in the 2017 NPC.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old has represented New Zealand at secondary schools, under-20 and the All Blacks level.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty special playing with my brothers and playing for my city so I'm excited to extend my time here with the Hurricanes," Aumua said.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Clark Laidlaw said Aumua signing on for a few more years was significant news for the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw last year, when he got that consistency of game time and preparation, just how good of a rugby player he is.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a dynamic ball carrier and attacker, destructive defender but for us, he's also maturing into a good leader.</p>
        
            <p>"This year he is one of our captains and he has the ability now to influence others and the environment through his maturity and consistency."</p>
        
            <p>Aumua had been sidelined with a lower leg injury since late last year and made his Super Rugby Pacific return last week when the Hurricanes beat the Highlanders in Dunedin.</p>
