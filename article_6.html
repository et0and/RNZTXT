            <p>The White Ferns won the series opening ODI against Pakistan by 131 runs after posting the team's highest one-day total in five years.</p>
        
            <p>Sent in to bat, New Zealand scored 365-4 from their 50 overs in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan were all out in the final over of the game.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns' top four batters all scored half centuries as New Zealand passed 300 runs at home for the first time since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>A 165-run first wicket partnership between Suzie Bates who made 108 - her 13th ODI century - and Bernadine Bezuidenhaut who scored her first ODI 50 and went on to make 86 gave the home side a good platform.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Sophie Devine kept the momentum going pummelling 70 off just 36 balls including six sixes, putting on 107 for the third wicket with Amelia Kerr who made 83.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr did take an injury break when she was hit on the back of head by a stray outfield throw when she was on 51 but she was assessed and continued on.</p>
        
            <p>Nashra Sundhu was the best of the Pakistan bowlers taking 1-52 off her 10 overs.</p>
        
            <p>In reply Pakistan's openers Muneeba Ali (44 runs off 48 balls) and Sidra Ameen combined for a 110-run partnership.</p>
        
            <p>Sidra was the standout for the visitors with the bat scoring her fourth ODI hundred before she was run out in the 44th over for 105.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders shared the wickets with six bowlers taking at least one wicket each in the win.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Kerr took 3-44 off 8.5 overs. Lea Tahuhu was the most expensive of the White Ferns bowlers but took two wickets for 49 runs off her 8 overs.</p>
        
            <p>The second ODI is on Friday in Christchurch.</p>
