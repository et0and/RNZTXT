            <p>The injury ravaged Warriors claimed their second straight NRL win with a gutsy 24-20 victory over the Dolphins in Auckland in a game that went down to the wire.</p>
        
            <p>Backing up last week's unbelievable outing against reigning premiers, the Panthers, the Warriors delivered another hard-fought performance, this time against Wayne Bennett's men.</p>
        
            <p>With the Auckland side's four tries matched by the Dolphins, Adam Pompey's boot proved crucial for the Warriors in front of a crowd of 23,000.</p>
        
            <p>Trailing 16-12 at half time, the Warriors second half blitz saw a superb try to Dallin Watene-Zelezniak with 22 minutes to go.</p>
        
            <p>Then Marata Niukore brushed off one tackle and crashed through two more to score in the 67th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Hitting back with five minutes on the clock, the Dolphins scored to set up a tense finish as Jamayne Isaako beat Marcelo Montoya to ground the ball.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors held strong at the death for their fifth win of the season ahead of next weekend's bye.</p>
        
            <p>Stand-in captain Mitch Barnett led by example while Te Maire Martin pulled the strings at halfback.</p>
        
            <p>Another feature was strong kicking from both Martin and Chanel Harris-Tavita. They forced three repeat sets that lead to Marata Niukore's crucial try late try.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster pieced the team together on game day with Tohu Harris and Shaun Johnson out through injury.</p>
        
            <p>Last week's fullback star Taine Tuaupiki sat out the game awaiting the birth of his first child, while Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad was sidelined through illness.</p>
        
            <p>And with Prop Addin Fonua-Blake sitting out due to a breach of club standards, the Warriors outfit had a makeshift look about it.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors began with a try inside the opening three minutes through Jamayne Isaako before their second from Herbie Farnworth for the 10-0 lead.</p>
        
            <p>Te Maire Martin broke through a couple of tackles using excellent footwork to score under the posts to close the gap.</p>
        
            <p>Farnworth made a linebreak through the middle for the Dolphins with Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow going over for a 16-6 advantage.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors came back into the contest as Marcelo Montoya caught a high kick and handed the ball to Chanel Harris-Tavita to score ahead of half-time with the deficit reduced to four points.</p>
        
            <p>With their fifth win of the season the Warriors head into the bye after another week of defying injuries to their key stars.</p>
