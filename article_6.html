            <p>The country's top men's golfer, Ryan Fox has pulled out of the New Zealand Open in Queenstown later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Fox, 37, and ranked number 28 in the world made the announcement on social media saying he wants to focus on the PGA Tour.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately I have made the tough decision to miss the New Zealand Open this year,'' Fox wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst it is disappointing to miss one of my favourite events, my priority is in succeeding on the PGA Tour and I'll be staying in the US for the foreseeable future in order to give myself the best chance of doing that.</p>
        
            <p>Fox also missed last year's event opting instead to play in the Arnold Palmer Invitational in California.</p>
        
            <p>Fox earnt close to $6 million last year finishing fifth in the Race to Dubai standings, which qualified him for a full PGA tour card.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament starts of February 29th and runs until March 3rd.</p>
        
            <p>Iâ€™m sorry @NZOpenGolf but I will be back in the future! Wishing everybody all the best pic.twitter.com/DbUb5y5VL6</p>
