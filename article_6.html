        <h2>NRL: Shaun Johnson back for Warriors</h2>
        <p>
The star halfback is back in the squad to take on the Storm this weekend at Mt Smart.
</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Johnson is ready to return to action for the Warriors, as they head into a huge clash with the Storm this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster confirmed that Johnson, who has sat out their last three matches with a pectoral injury, has been included in the match day squad that will be named this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson's last game was the Warriors' 38-18 defeat to the Roosters in Sydney on May 12, in which he suffered the injury before halftime but played on and eventually left the field after 70 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>In Johnson's absence, the Warriors have won three games in a row, with Te Maire Martin in career best form at halfback. It's a situation that Webster said "will not change anything" for Martin.</p>
        
            <p>"He's still going to get to play his way," said Webster.</p>
        
            <p>"Chanel (Harris-Tavita) will still be in the 17 somewhere… we also had Charnze (Niccol-Klokstad) play six, so I think it's going to be a good combination… Shaun just wants to fit in with what the team needs and then you've got a threat on both sides of the field."</p>
        
            <p>The better you go, the more players you get back, you still have the same challenges in where you fit them all in.</p>
        
            <p>After coming off an impressive 42-12 win over the Cowboys over the weekend, Webster admitted that a change in the halves strategy would have happened regardless of the injury situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Something had to change, I believe that. It wasn't looking as good as it could," he said in reference to the teams' sluggish start to the season.</p>

            <p>"I just feel like it's given Te Maire this confidence with this opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Webster also confirmed that while Roger Tuivasa-Sheck has been named in the squad, the centre will sit out this weekend's fixture as he recovers from a hamstring strain. This means that by the time the side travels to the Gold Coast for a return match against the Titans, Webster may well have a fully fit squad to pick from for the first time this season.</p>
        
            <p>The table-topping Storm currently hold a formidable record over the Warriors, having last tasted defeat way back in 2015. The 10th-placed Warriors almost snapped that streak back in round two this season, with only a spectacular try by Storm wing Xavier Coates in the dying stages separating the sides in a thrilling encounter.</p>
