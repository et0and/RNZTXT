            <p>Anthony Joshua is gunning for a third world heavyweight title this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Boasting a combined 45 career knockouts, Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois both possess ungodly power, and this weekend they are both prepared to wield it in their grudge match at Wembley Stadium for the IBF world heavyweight title.</p>
        
            <p>With the bad blood, gold on the line, and close to 100,000 fans in the arena, a classic clash is on the cards.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off his vicious knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, Joshua said he was more dangerous than ever.</p>
        
            <p>"Aside from belts, and it being him, I'm just ready to fight. This is alpha male business now. September 21. It's going down," he told DAZN Sports,</p>
        
            <p>Joshua is riding a four fight win streak following back to back losses to Oleksandr Usyk.</p>
        
            <p>Now in the midst of a career resurgence, he said that 'the best AJ is still to come,' and he has his target locked firmly on Dubois.</p>
        
            <p>"I know boxing very well, I've study Daniel, and he will see. I don't focus on the belt, just him."</p>
        
            <p>Though giving up an eight-year age difference, Joshua is oozing confidence ahead of the London showdown.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a high paced fight with two big punchers. These fights take a lot of you, and you have to dig deep because there's no there's no other exit except for victory."</p>
        
            <p>As well as the IBF title, the winner will likely get the next shot at either Tyson Fury or Oleksandr Usyk when the pair rematch on December 21 in Riyadh.</p>
        
            <p>The tension between the pair is obvious, almost coming to blows at a press conference where Joshua demanded that Dubois not disrespect him after Dubois suggested they find out who the better fighter was then and there.</p>
        
            <p>Much of it stems from a rumoured sparring match between the two several years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"People say he rocked me. People say he dropped me around that time. There's about 15 heavyweight saying that they're dropped me everyone uses my name for clout, but the best way to prove it is by fighting me," Joshua said.</p>
        
            <p>Neither would elaborate on the details but Dubois said whatever happened counts for little come Saturday."</p>
        
            <p>"That happened seven years ago. This is not sparring."</p>
        
            <p>It's been a long journey to the title for Dubois after suffering a knockout loss to Joe Joyce in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in a dark place, but I feel like I've been resurrected again and I am in the light and ready to fight. He has been the king for a while, a long time in fact, but I am a kingslayer."</p>
        
            <p>Dubois said it's his time.</p>
        
            <p>"Joshua's the main man holding all the keys. I aim to knock him out. I need to go out there and take it from him. I'm going to turn him into an old man in the ring. I'm going to make a fool out of him by knocking him out."</p>
        
            <p>Joshua vs Dubois </p>
        
            <p>10am Sunday September 22 (NZ time). </p>
