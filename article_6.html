            <p>The Black Caps hero of day two has come to the party again, this time with the ball.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips made a fighting half century yesterday afternoon as his side conceded a 205 run first innings lead against Australia, but a five-wicket haul from Phillips has seen the tourists bowled out for 179.</p>
        
            <p>He claimed 5/45 with New Zealand set 369 for victory.</p>
        
            <p>Among his scalps were Usman Khawaja, Cameron Green, Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head and Alex Carey.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips told TVNZ it was a pretty surreal moment to take five wickets in Wellington, believing any chance he would have had would come in the subcontinent.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a dream come true. I've had a serious set of coaching staff help me over the years, and as a bowling unit we definitely stuck to the things we wanted to stick to, partnership bowling the whole way through."</p>
        
            <p>Phillips took off in a celebratory run as Cameron Green flicked him to Will Young at short leg.</p>
        
            <p>"Any celebration a six-year-old girl would do, that's me, the emotion, the way the crowd went up, it was just an unbelievable moment."</p>
        
            <p>The all-rounder said they are very much in this test match.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to combat the situations out there now, obviously there is a bit of tun how we got about facing (Nathan) Lyon is going to be a challenge. But we have the time on the board to hopefully be able to pull this off."</p>
        
            <p>Lyon would end up top scoring for Australia as nightwatchman with an innings of 42 to frustrate the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>It was not all smooth sailing on day three for the hosts, with two dropped catches coming from Phillips' bowling, first Scott Kuggeleijn and then substitute fielder Henry Nicolls.</p>
        
            <p>A short time ago, New Zealand was 8/0.</p>
