            <p>Steven Alker rang up seven birdies and an eagle for a 9-under-par 63, allowing him to take sole possession of the second-round lead at the season-opening Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai in Ka'upulehu-Kona, Hawaii.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander is at 16-under 128 after two rounds at Hualalai Golf Course, good for a two-shot edge over Harrison Frazar and Steve Stricker.</p>
        
            <p>Alker said it "doesn't take long" for him to get back in the rhythm of committing to his shots at the dawn of a new season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really only like a couple of rounds, get my swing where I want it and just let it go," Alker said. "But the hardest thing starting out the year ... I find, anyway, is my commitment.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, I hit nice iron shots today. Made a couple of 20-, 25-footers today too, which helped out. Very pleased."</p>
        
            <p>Alker won the season-long Charles Schwab Cup in 2022, while one of the players on his tail is the reigning champion. Stricker prevailed at Hualalai to kick off a 2023 season that saw him win six tournaments on the PGA Tour Champions, including three majors.</p>
        
            <p>Like Alker, Stricker stayed bogey-free today, rolling in eight birdies for a 64.</p>
        
            <p>"I think (Alker has) been playing well the last few years and so have I," Stricker said. "It's good to see us both come into the new year playing well again and it's good to get off to a good start. We've got one more day."</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to an eagle at the par-5 10th hole, Frazar shot 7-under 29 on his back nine to land a round of 63.</p>
        
            <p>"I got hot with the putter and made probably 150 feet worth of putts on the back nine," Frazar said. "Anytime that happens, you're having fun."</p>
        
            <p>Ernie Els of South Africa (67 on Friday) is in fourth at 11 under. David Toms and Justin Leonard each shot 66 to form a tie for fifth at 10 under.</p>
