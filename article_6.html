            <p>Despite admitting to feeling a bit of burnout at the end of last season, Cam Norrie is back in Auckland for another tilt at the tournament that holds a special place in his heart. The world number 18 and famous 'one that got away' for New Zealand sport was jet lagged but generous with media after touching down in the city he grew up in.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of strange," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My parents now not being here anymore, but it's still a special tournament for me and obviously growing up here playing a lot here. So, it feels good to be back, looking forward to it."</p>
        
            <p>Norrie admitted to feeling disappointed after a 2023 season that saw him fail to pass the third round of any of the Grand Slams, but to simply state that at all when he's maintained a top 20 ranking shows just how high his ambitions are at age 28.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it was just a pretty long year for me and I was a little bit burnt out towards the end into the year and, and I think just played so many matches over the last three years, but I think I really had a good pre-season and stayed in one place and rest as much as I could and really just trying to evolve and work on my game and just try to get to the next level.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's nice to feel a bit more refreshed."</p>

            <p>He credited his experience on tour and his team with giving him the support around him to deal with the punishing schedule of a professional tennis player at the top of their game.</p>
        
            <p>"I think for me, I really like to play a lot of matches and, and I think it's just being smart and learning over the years what surfaces you like, what tournaments you like and how much you want to play.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's finding that balance of getting enough matches and and feeling rest and the freshness not only physically but mentally as well. My team has been great with me and and lucky I get to have my team members that are so committed and they love the tour, they love traveling with me."</p>

            <p>Norrie was quick to point out that while he had felt both physical and mental fatigue, it wasn't something that was diminishing his desire to compete.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the sport, I love the practice and I love trying to get better every day. And the tournament's a kind of a bonus to be able to compete and play tennis for a living. So for me, very rarely happens.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's small, small, very minor things that make, you know, like a big difference. The margins are so small and the players are so good that if you drop very slightly, then someone's on your heels ready to take your place."</p>
        
            <p>Despite representing the UK, Norrie will enjoy the same vociferous support he always has received at Stanley Street. He's reached the final twice, in 2019 and again last year, only to fall agonisingly short of lifting the trophy in from of his loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>As second seed, Norrie has a first round bye and will play the winner of the match between American JJ Wolf and a yet to be determined qualifier. Like the women's tournament, at the top of the draw it's a bit more cutthroat: top seed Ben Shelton will play the winner of a tough first round match between French veteran GaÃ«l Monfils and world number 64 Fabian Marozsan of Hungary.</p>
        
            <p>But they won't be Norrie's issue until the business end of the men's ASB Classic, something he's determined to be a part of.</p>
        
            <p>"I love this tournament and I've come close to winning a couple of times now. I'm just happy to be back here and I feel good."</p>
        
            <p>The men's main draw begins on Monday 8 January.</p>
