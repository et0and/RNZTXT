            <p>Black Ferns Director of Rugby Allan Bunting has opted to keep the team who lost to England at Twickenham in September unchanged for their next match against the world number one side.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns meet England in their second Test of the WXV1 Tournament in Langley, Canada on Monday morning, hoping to bounce to bounce back from last weekend's shock loss to Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>The only change to the 23 from their last outing against England in the Twickenham game is in the replacements, with Mererangi Paul replacing Amy du Plessis on the bench, the latter ruled out due to a concussion.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns lost that game 24-12 but stuck with England for large parts of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Bunting has however made a handful of changes following last weekend's WXV 1 loss to Ireland, which includes the return of Chryss Viliko, Georgia Ponsonby, and Tanya Kalounivale to the starting front row.</p>
        
            <p>Alana Bremner, who impressed from the bench last weekend, starts alongside Maiakawanakaulani Roos, while Liana Mikaele-Tu'u moves back into the number six jersey to make way for the return of Kaipo Olsen-Baker at number eight.</p>
        
            <p>Ruahei Demant shifts to inside centre and Ayesha Leti-I'iga, is named to start on the right wing. Maia Joseph and Hannah King form the halfback pairing.</p>
        
            <p>Logo-i-Pulotu Lemapu-Atai'i (Sylvia) Brunt will make her 20th Test appearance and is named to start at outside centre.</p>
        
            <p>England's starting team for the 33rd encounter between the two sides features five changes, four in the forward pack including the entire front row.</p>
        
            <p>Bunting said it will be a great test for the team.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been through some real adversity and have taken some critical learnings as a whole group. I have been very impressed with how quickly our wƒÅhine have bounced back on task."</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted more quality Test matches, and we are certainly getting that. Once again, we have the opportunity to play England this week and I know there is a real desire to put on a performance we are proud of," said Bunting.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are in search of their first win against England since the 2022 Rugby World Cup Final.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns have won 19 out of the past 32 matches with the Red Roses, including all six Rugby World Cup finals that they have met in, dating back to the first match in 1997.</p>
