            <p>A utility back, he will join the Crusaders as a first-five alongside Rivez Reihana and Taha Kemara, with the Canterbury based franchise hoping O'Connor will provide both on-field expertise and off field mentorship.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really excited to be joining the Crusaders for the 2025 season and eager to test myself in a new environment," O'Connor said.</p>
        
            <p>"My whole career I've heard so much about the Crusaders culture and innovation. So to experience it first hand and learn a new way of playing the game is something I'm really looking forward to."</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders head coach Rob Penney said O'Connor was a "world-class and ambitious athlete".</p>
        
            <p>"When we heard he was available we reached out as we thought we could offer him something new and challenging," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have two exciting and talented 10s in Rivez and Taha, and James brings a level of maturity that we believe will complement them exceptionally well.</p>
        
            <p>"Having played internationally and in a range of overseas competitions, we're looking forward to what James can bring to our environment from his 17 seasons of professional football.</p>
        
            <p>"He's also a competitor and ambitious, which will ensure there is weekly competition for the 10 jersey."</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor will be in the Crusaders environment shortly before the team's first pre-season game, with the date of that match and the opposition to be confirmed later this month.</p>
