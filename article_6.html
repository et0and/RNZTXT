            <p>The Southern Steel can't escape the ANZ Premiership's unwanted wooden spoon, after their narrow loss to the Northern Stars in the penultimate round.</p>
        
            <p>Heading into Monday night's fixture in Dunedin, the two sides had a win apiece from their earlier clashes this season so an intense battle resulted, before the Stars claimed victory by one point, 54-53.</p>
        
            <p>With their eye-boggling nine bonus points in the competition, they are in fifth place on 15 points, eight clear of the Steel, who cannot avoid bottom place even if they beat the Magic in the final round on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The lead changed multiple times, with both sides having five-goal streaks, but the Stars found their nerve in the final two minutes when it counted to win their second match of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars' tactic of shooting long balls to goal shoot Maia Wilson gave them the early edge, before the Steel hit back.</p>
        
            <p>Down by one point after the first quarter, the Steel launched a five-point run, with sharp passing from the midcourt's Kate Heffernan and Serina Daunakamakama to shooters Grace Namana and Georgia Heffernan paying off. But momentum changed and the Stars also had a five-goal streak to win the lead back and at halftime they were in front, albeit by only one point.</p>
        
            <p>The Steel had the better of the third quarter and went into the final spell two ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The score remained tight, but in the last couple of minutes, the Stars forced the Steel into a turnover and goal attack Amorangi Malesala landed the resulting shot.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson only one missed shot, landing 38 goals, with Malesala also accurate after a nervous start, with 11 from 14, and Monica Falkner nailing her five attempts.</p>
        
            <p>Namana scored 37 from 40 and Heffernan 16 from 20 for the Steel.</p>
        
            <p>The final round features the battle for hosting rights for the final, with the top teams, the Tactix and Pulse, clashing in Wellington on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>They both suffered losses at the weekend - with the Pulse going down to the Mystics 68-58, and the Tactix losing 51-49 to the Magic.</p>
        
            <p>That result put the Magic just one point behind the Mystics, with this weekend's matches to determine which of the two teams makes the vital third spot for the finals series.</p>
