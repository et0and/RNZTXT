Who will shine the brightest, the American stars or the Kiwi Sun?

            <p>The draw has been made, the courts are ready and the ball kids have been assembled for the start of New Zealand's premier tennis tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The action at the Auckland Tennis Centre starts on Monday with the women's week of the ASB Classic - and for the first time in a long time, we have a real chance of seeing a local going deep and potentially lifting the trophy.</p>
        
            <p>But it's not just about the action on the court. The ASB Classic is as much about what goes on in the stands, boxes and out in the hospitality area, so there is plenty to look forward to in our all-too-brief summer of tennis.</p>
        
            <p>Here is a look at who is competing and what to look out for:</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Madison Keys will be feeling pretty good right now. The last time she came to Auckland back in 2013 she was bundled out in qualifying, but this time returns as the number one seed.</p>
        
            <p>She is currently ranked 20 in the world, but might be on a collision course with fellow American Sofia Kenin in the quarters. Kenin has won the last two matches between the two, with chances of an overall American victory high given that there are 10 of them in the draw.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Lulu Sun, born in Te Anau and raised in Switzerland, returns to Auckland as an official NZ representative for the first time. Not only that, but at her highest ranking of 40 and coming off a boom season that saw her reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon and be judged WTA Newcomer of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>She has won over $1 million in prize money in 2024, and while she has not won a WTA title yet, she reached the final of the Abierto GNP Seguros in Mexico back in August.</p>
        
            <p>It's fair to say that a win for Sun this week would be a dream for tournament organisers and headline writers alike.</p>

            <p>It is probably not accurate to say that the former world number one and four-time Grand Slam champion is desperate to reach those heights again, more that she simply wants to be consistently competitive and enjoy it along the way.</p>
        
            <p>Osaka had a much-publicised mental health break in 2021, just as she was poised to become the long-term face of the women's game - which in financial terms would make her one of the highest paid athletes in the world.</p>
        
            <p>It was a coup to get the current 58th ranked player in the world here, but judging by her social media this week, Osaka is having a good time so far.</p>

            <p>After a first visit to Auckland that could not really have gone much worse, Emma Raducanu has come back for the third year in a row and will once again be a crowd favourite.</p>
        
            <p>The 2021 US Open champion featured in one of the best matches the ASB Classic has ever seen back in January, when she went the distance in an ultimately losing effort against powerful Ukrainian Elina Svitolina.</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu provides the star power alongside Osaka, and both players have a nice run of matches before the business end of the tournament begins.</p>
        
            <p>The only other Kiwi in the draw, Vivian Wang, has been granted a wildcard but drew number two seed Elise Mertens in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>The Belgian is coming in ranked 34 in the world, while American Amanda Anisimova, Sun and Denmark's Clara Tauson round out the top five seeds.</p>

            <p>The ASB Classic has a well-earned reputation for being one of the best-run sporting events in this part of the world, with a lot of that down to the hospitality options on offer. As long as the weather plays its part, the stands should be full every day, and out the back there is plenty of room to watch the action on big screens.</p>
        
            <p>It is a rather unique setting, with centre court surrounded by corporate boxes, with the liberal amounts of booze served making for some rowdy crowds watching the later matches.</p>
