            <p>The Paris Paralympics was described as one of the most influential editions of the Games in the 64-year history of the Paralympic movement.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's 24 Paralympians in Paris returned to Aotearoa with nine medals - the lowest total in three decades.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked a six-time Paralympian and the Paralympics New Zealand chief executive what the Paris campaign meant to them.</p>
        
            <p>As the Paris Games wrapped up this week Paralympics New Zealand (PNZ) boldly claimed: "The multi-sport extravaganza will provide a trigger that will change perceptions of disability in New Zealand as well as continue to transform lives through the power of Para sport."</p>
        
            <p>PNZ chief executive Greg Warnecke said Paris "set a new benchmark" for the delivery of a Paralympic Games.</p>

            <p>"The Games has been a huge platform to be able to hopefully drive change, be able to have those conversations and to be able to make sure that inclusivity, equity, opportunities across Para sports and any sport is something that is a forethought rather than an afterthought.</p>
        
            <p>"We want people to talk positively about disability, to ask questions to be able to understand a little bit more and those conversations are what are athletes want people to have because that's what will open doors for more people with a disability living in New Zealand to be able to have opportunities through Para sport."</p>
        
            <p>Warnecke said attitudes and awareness around Para sport had changed over time but there was still work to be done.</p>
        
            <p>He said he wanted people to talk about Paralympians as athletes - not because they have a disability.</p>
        
            <p>"Because they're athletes, they're role models, they've got the ability to be able to capture the nation as they've been doing."</p>
        
            <p>The International Paralympic Committee campaigned before the Games on the motto that "the Paralympians are here to compete not to participate".</p>
        
            <p>Which was something Warnecke said was noticeable in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"The level of competition here has been intense. Fine margins are deciding medals the competition is really fierce and people are here to win medals.</p>
        
            <p>"The elevation of the level of competition has been heightened by the French crowds who have been absolutely incredible... every one of those people will now leave the stadium witnessing what's humanly possible and understanding disability a whole lot more than when they were when they first bought a ticket to come along to the Paris Paralympic Games and that's what we're hopefully trying to be able to continue to harness back in New Zealand."</p>

            <p>Warnecke said Paralympic debutantes like table tennis player Matthew Britz - who attracted a large television audience in New Zealand - was an example of someone who could have an impact after the Games were over.</p>
        
            <p>"In talking to Matthew afterwards and telling him he was on live TV, helping him to understand that he's actually hopefully inspired another 10, 20, 30 kids with a disability to go out and potentially take up table tennis.</p>
        
            <p>"We get this one moment [Paralympics] but we're hoping to be able to stretch that out a little bit more to work with our Paralympians to be able to showcase [them] and be able to continue to talk about them.</p>
        
            <p>"We had 10 debutantes come to Paris and we'd love to see more debutantes feature at LA 2028 and indeed in Milano Cortina at our next winter Games in 2026."</p>

            <p>Getting to Paris was a long road for six-time Paralympian Michael Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Lingering Covid restrictions, a broken rifle and last chance qualification all factored into Johnson's lead-up.</p>
        
            <p>The path to Paris began in Korea in 2022 before a world championships in the UAE and then 2023 included stop-offs in Korea and a first time visit to Peru before he secured a place in Paris with a medal in India.</p>
        
            <p>The 50-year-old Waiuku-based athlete, who claimed R4 Air Rifle 10m Standing SH2 gold on his Paralympic debut in Athens 2004, earned a slot for New Zealand at Paris 2024 by winning a silver medal in the R4 Air Rifle 10m Standing SH2 event at the 2024 World Shooting Para Sport New Delhi World Cup in March.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson was entered in three events at the latest Games- the R4 Mixed Air Rifle Standing SH2, R5 Mixed Air Rifle Prone SH2 and R9 Mixed 50m Rifle Prone SH2.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to achieving his qualification Johnson had struggled with his form.</p>
        
            <p>"I was looking for different techniques or set-ups things that I could utilise that would help improve me because I think with shooting you need to keep evolving. I've been in this sport for such a long time that if you just stay stagnant with what you are doing and you're not getting good results you need to up your game," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>The shooting at this year's Paralympics was held three hours away from Paris at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very different the feeling, was a mix between a small Paralympic Games and a World Cup so I actually enjoyed the whole atmosphere that we were able to create as a sport in itself but still operating under that Paralympics banner.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say this Paralympic Games has been my most memorable, most favourite, not because of my results but because of the support that I had that I have been working towards building to help me, my loader and our team manager I've been working on getting the right people to support me over the last few years."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said recognition had increased since he was first in the Paralympics.</p>
        
            <p>"But we still had the same old problems with the media and television they throw the kitchen sink at the Olympics but when it comes to the Paralympics the media steps down and it's not really a big deal and so that's how you feel.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially for shooting for example for the first two or three days there were no TV cameras or no footage at all and then on our own New Zealand TV they were only going to show the finals."</p>
        
            <p>Who tried to qualify for the Paralympics had developed over time.</p>
        
            <p>"What I've noticed over the years is a change, even within our own New Zealand Paralympic team, is I've got a spinal cord injury and I use a wheelchair but at this Games and in previous Games I was noticing more people who were amputees or ambulatory and can walk around and less people in chairs which is quite interesting."</p>
        
            <p>The make up of the New Zealand team also impressed Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>"What I love is there was so many new athletes that I'd never seen or met before and that was really exciting and that's what I love is that new blood into sports I really love that evolution.</p>
        
            <p>"I always think that these Games are inspirational for other people out there with disabilities or people without disabilities to inspire them to get off the couch and go for a walk or go and do something."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said personally he was "always up for new challenges".</p>
        
            <p>"I think one of my main quotes is there is there always another competition and I think that's what's the problem and that's what keeps me in the sport."</p>
