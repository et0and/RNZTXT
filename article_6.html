            <p>The Wellington Phoenix have beaten Perth Glory 4-3 in a thriller in Sydney to to return to the top of the men's A-League standings.</p>
        
            <p>In an exciting finish to the inaugural Unite Round - featuring all 12 teams - with the in-form Kosta Barbarouses scoring a brace either side of rare goals from Alex Rufer and Tim Payne.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's seventh win of the season lifts them level with Melbourne Victory, and ahead of them courtesy of more wins.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams are three points clear of the chasing pack and will meet in a table-topping clash in Wellington on Frdiay.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano praised his side's mentality after the Phoenix fell behind early and saw Perth twice draw level in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've now built the belief that we can come back into any game," Italiano told the post-match press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"Even at three-all I was like 'we're going to make a chance it's just whether we capitalise and we breakthrough'.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pleased for the group that they can do that. That puts us in good stead because I feel like if you can't battle through those moments, you're going to drop a lot of points throughout the season."</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses has now scored eight goals in his past five matches to jump to equal second in the golden boot race.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't find this a surprise," Italiano said. "He's been on the end of a lot of chances this season and for whatever reason in the early rounds it just wasn't clicking for him, but now he has confidence and he's back to his old self.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm delighted for him. He's been the best pro for us. He's a great leader off the park.</p>
        
            <p>"He mentors a lot of these young guys, not so much by what he says, but by what he does. He doesn't complain [and] he applies himself at training."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix found themselves a goal down early when Adam Taggart expertly picked out the top corner with a header from near the penalty spot.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington started to take control of the match midway through the first half and Barbarouses equalised shortly before the half hour mark when he cut into the box and slotted a left-footed shot past Cook.</p>
        
            <p>Rufer put his team in front with virtually the last kick of the first half, when the Glory hesitated for a moment as the Nix appealed for a penalty and the loose ball fell to the Wellington captain who rifled home his shot from outside the box.</p>
        
            <p>Perth equalised after the break through Aleksandar Susnjar but Wellington reclaimed the lead when Barbarouses turned creator, cutting the ball back from the left byline where Payne crunched his first-time effort through a sea of defenders.</p>
        
            <p>As heavy rain intensified, Perth found another equaliser through Jarrod Carluccio but it took just three minutes for Barbarouses to restore the lead after Payne delivered a slick assist.</p>
