            <p>Heinrich Klaasen and Rassie van der Dussen scored half-centuries as South Africa eased to a comfortable seven-wicket win over ailing England in Karachi to book a semi-final place at the Champions Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa bowled England out for 179 in 38.2 overs after the latter had chosen to bat, before reaching their target with a huge 125 balls to spare following a 127-run third-wicket stand between Klaasen (64) and Van der Dussen (72 not out).</p>
        
            <p>They top Group B and join Australia, India and New Zealand in the semi-finals, with the fixture line-up to be confirmed when the latter two meet in Dubai on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The match was the last in charge for England captain Jos Buttler, who is stepping down from his role after the side lost all three pool fixtures in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>England were already out of semi-final contention going into the game and, after winning the toss, their innings never got going as they played some poor shots on a good batting wicket.</p>
        
            <p>"A really disappointing performance," Buttler said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were so far short of the mark there today. It was a decent surface -- pretty slow and a bit two-paced.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not going on and making those big, telling contributions which has been a story of this side for some time now with the bat."</p>

            <p>South Africa did well to expose England's desire to chase the run-rate with injudicious shots but also bowled both sides of the wicket and will need to tighten up their lines, whoever they face in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>"The wicket was quite slow, slower than we expected," South Africa stand-in captain Aiden Markram said. "The boys adapted really well and kept trying to hold a length for as long as they could. We took wickets throughout.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a great squad with lots of options. Whatever role each individual has, (regular captain) Temba (Bavuma) backs them along with the coach (Rob Walter)."</p>
        
            <p>Joe Root top-scored for England with a well-constructed 37 before he was bowled by seamer Wiaan Mulder (3-25), while Buttler managed 21 in his final game as skipper.</p>
        
            <p>There was little else to enthuse over for the side, with Ben Duckett (24) and Jofra Archer (25) also managing starts.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa lost Tristan Stubbs (0) early in their chase, as he played on to his wicket from a delivery by Archer (2-55).</p>
        
            <p>But once Klaasen and Van der Dussen got together they constructed a fine partnership that showed the England batters how to play on the wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Van der Dussen's unbeaten 72 came from 87 balls and included three sixes as he anchored the innings along with the more explosive Klaasen.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa will sweat over the fitness of Markram, who left the field with a hamstring injury, ahead of their semi-final, while Bavuma and opening batter Tony de Zorzi missed the game through illness.</p>
