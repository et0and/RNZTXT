            <p>Eleni-Klaoudia Polak from Greece has been provisionally suspended and has been disqualified from the women's pole vault due to a failed drug test, the IOC says.</p>
        
            <p>It refers to the test results as an adverse analytical finding.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has qualified three athletes - Eliza McCartney, Imogen Ayris and Olivia McTaggart - for the medal round which will have an unusually large number of 19 finalists.</p>
        
            <p>Results of the women's pole vault qualification which was held at Stade de France on Tuesday have been revised accordingly and the athlete DQ according to Anti-doping Rule 10.1, the IOC said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Greek athlete had tested positive for banned substances at the Paris Games and had been expelled from the athletes' village, the Greek Olympic Committee said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The team had been informed on Monday afternoon by Greece's anti-doping agency and the athlete, whose name or sport were not announced, was provisionally suspended and moved away from the team, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>The Paris Games have seen only a handful of positive tests during competition so far, including that of Commonwealth Games bronze medallist and African Games boxing champion Cynthia Ogunsemilore, of Nigeria.</p>
        
            <p>Iraqi judoka Sajjad Sehen tested positive for steroids a day before the start of the Games.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will be in action in the pole vault final from 5am on Thursday.</p>
