            <p>New Hurricanes lock Zach Gallagher thought long and hard about leaving the Crusaders and moving north.</p>
        
            <p>After limited game time with the Crusaders the 23-year-old felt a move would probably help his career.</p>
        
            <p>It started when he received a phone call from Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw last year, but he took his time before committing to the change.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought that challenging myself and stepping outside my comfort zone would be good for me," Gallagher told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been in Christchurch my whole life and the Crusader environment for a while, so I thought it would be a good change up."</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher was head boy at Christ's College, where he captained the 1st XV. He also rowed in the Maadi Cup.</p>
        
            <p>He made his Canterbury debut in 2020 and was an All Blacks XV representative in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>With an intense rivalry between Canterbury and the rest of the country, the 197cm second rower knew he was set for some ribbing from friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been given a bit of stick for coming up here, but my dad's side of the family are all Wellingtonians and so when I was down south it was the opposite with them struggling to support the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually living with my Nana up here and I've got quite a few relatives so it's been nice to connect with them and spend a bit more time with that side of the family.</p>

            <p>He managed just one game for the Crusaders in 2024 before a head knock suffered against the Hurricanes sent him to the sidelines.</p>
        
            <p>While the Hurricanes finished top of the table last season before losing in the semi-finals, the Crusaders managed just four wins and missed out on the play-offs for the first time since 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher said it wasn't a case of jumping ship.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely wasn't escaping They'll be a good team this year, probably keen the right some wrongs from last year so round one will be an interesting match-up."</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher was a product of the Crusaders Academy and went on to play 19 games for the Crusaders between 2022 to 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"They do have an awesome academy and a programme that brings people through school into Canterbury and the Crusaders and I think they're the most successful academy in the world at transitioning their own talent into Crusaders."</p>
        
            <p>Pre-season training has gone well for Gallagher who has enjoyed his new environment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been more than I expected, it's been really high performance with the integration of the coaches and the mindset has been really impressive."</p>
