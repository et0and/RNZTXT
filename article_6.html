            <p>Analysis - Super Rugby Pacific had a hard act to follow after the stunning first round, but somehow it delivered another excellent weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The competition has had many detractors over the years, a lot of the criticism fair too, but really right now if you're still complaining that says more about you than anything else. Every game was again highly entertaining, from the Chiefs' win on Friday to the Force's upset 45-42 victory over the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>So it's fair to say an awful lot of people would've been very impressed, all except Blues fans that is, who are still trying to process just how the defending champs managed to lose 29-21 to an under-manned Highlanders side in Dunedin. There was so much wrong about the Blues' performance last weekend against the Chiefs, but they managed to completely outdo themselves this time around with a couple of shocking decisions at the back end of the game.</p>

            <p>The Highlanders had lost Saula Mau'u and Ethan de Groot to injury, then Daniel Lienert-Brown to an upgraded red card, which meant they still had to pack eight players in a depowered scrum and hand the Blues a two-man overlap. So a scrum should've been the only option for the Blues when they were awarded a couple of penalties five metres out from the line, however they took two lineouts which were promptly lost due to Fabian Holland having clearly figured out their calls.</p>
        
            <p>Even if Ricky Riccitelli had muscled over for a lineout drive try earlier, surely a simple draw and pass with almost the entire width of the field open was the higher percentage play.</p>

            <p>Then there was just the overwhelming lack of intensity the Blues showed after a really good start. While Beauden Barrett scored a really nice try, he also ended up on the other side of the highlight reel when his two aimless kicks resulted in Finn Hurley's two excellent tries. Rieko Ioane and Caleb Clarke were barely involved. Hoskins Sotutu, last year's standout performer, was nullified by a fired up Highlanders' defensive effort.</p>
        
            <p>Really though, you won't find a better captain's knock at the business end than Timoci Tavatavanawai's effort for the home side. He put in a pretty good case for being considered for the loose forwards as well, with several key turnovers that swung the game the home side's way.</p>
        
            <p>There's still a long way to go. The Blues have plenty of time to turn it round and the Highlanders can't afford any injuries or suspensions at all, let alone a bunch in the same position. It's certainly a win for the smaller men in professional rugby though - Hurley is listed at 75kgs, for context that makes him smaller than a lot of the Year Eight students turning out for Auckland high school rugby this season.</p>
        
            <p>Clayton McMillan was in a forgiving mood despite losing his captain Luke Jacobson after only a few minutes in Friday's big 49-24 win over the Crusaders. The Chiefs coach was happy to let the head contact be handled by the judiciary after seemingly being missed by the TMO, refusing to blame the officials. That's probably cold comfort for Jacobson, whose nose now resembles that of beaten Crusaders coach Rob Penney - who, for his part, dubiously claimed he hadn't even seen the incident despite it being replayed several times on the stadium big screen.</p>
        
            <p>It's unlikely the Hurricanes' 38-34 win over the Fijian Drua in Napier will win any awards for structured play or overall rugby intelligence, but it certainly will be one of the more watchable replays. That is unless you're in the Drua team, who have let two golden opportunities in a row now slip through their fingers. There were 11 tries at a well-attended McLean Park, with the Drua butchering a couple more, but Harry Godfrey's one as time expired was the ultimate difference.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika have nurtured a real star in Kyran Tamoufolau, with the winger scoring another two slick tries on Friday in their 56-36 loss to the Reds. In fact, tries don't seem to be an issue for Moana as they've got 11 in their first two matches. The problem? They've conceded 101 points the other way, with defence being the most glaring problem in this team's identity. It's not even a revelation either, as Moana had the worst points differential by miles last year, so fingers really need to start being pointed as to why this is happening.</p>
