            <p>England prop Joe Marler has added some spice to this weekend's clash with the All Blacks at Twickenham, saying the haka "needs binning".</p>
        
            <p>Marler, who has previously fired shots at the pre-match challenge, took to social media to air his views.</p>
        
            <p>"The Haka needs binning. It's ridiculous," he wrote on X, before adding: "It's only any good when teams actually front it with some sort of reply. Like the league boys did last week."</p>

            <p>Marler was referring to last week's rugby league international between Samoa and England in Wigan, when the hosts stood toe-to-toe (and head-to-head in some instances) with the visitors as they performed the Siva Tau.</p>
        
            <p>The scenes brought a fresh round of calls from rugby fans and pundits for opponents to stand up to the pre-match challenges, rather than standing back and watching.</p>
        
            <p>England were fined at the 2019 World Cup when Marler and others crossed the halfway line during the pre-match ritual in breach of World Rugby's "cultural challenge" rules.</p>

            <p>Referee Nigel Owens intervened and sent several England players back.</p>
        
            <p>While Marler seems to like the idea of confronting the haka, he will not get the chance against the All Blacks this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>He broke his foot in England's defeat to the All Blacks in Dunedin in July and is still sidelined.</p>
