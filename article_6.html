            <p>The All Whites have been soundly beaten in their football friendly against Mexico in California.</p>
        
            <p>Up one nil at half-time in Pasadena, Mexico put two more past the Kiwis in the second for a decisive 3-0 victory.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood was back for the first time in 2024 and Michael Boxall led New Zealand in his 50th cap.</p>
        
            <p>Orbelín Pineda opened the scoring after five minutes to give his side a 1-0 lead.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites had their best scoring chance just before halftime, when a Joe Bell corner fired across the goal but Tommy Smith couldn't reach to head the ball into an empty net.</p>
        
            <p>The result was assured after oranges as César Huerta and Luis Romo netted a further two to sink the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites will next be in action against the United States in Cincinnati on Wednesday.</p>
