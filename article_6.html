            <p>All Whites coach Darren Bazeley has recalled a host of his best offshore-based players for internationals against Mexico and the United States in North America next month.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood is among eight changes to the 21-man New Zealand squad who contested OFC Nations Cup in Vanuatu in June.</p>
        
            <p>Bazeley used that tournament to blood a handful of new caps and to help prepare for the Olympic Games under-23 campaign, sweeping to four comfortable wins.</p>
        
            <p>However, he has unveiled a squad at close to full strength for the matches against Mexico in Pasadena, California on September 8 and the US in Cincinnati three days later.</p>
        
            <p>The two opponents are ranked 17th and 16th respectively, providing a sizeable challenge for the 94th-ranked All Whites ahead of the start of their World Cup qualifying games, featuring three matches in October.</p>
        
            <p>A glut of Europe-based midfielders are recalled, including regulars Joe Bell, Matthew Garbett, Marko Stamenic and Sarpreet Singh.</p>
        
            <p>In defence, there's a return for Ireland-based Nando Pijnaker and US-based Michael Boxall, who is line for his 50th cap.</p>

            <p>Bazeley highlighted the importance of the two US friendlies.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing two games against two of the 2026 FIFA World Cup hosts, in one of the host countries, is the perfect motivation for our players ahead of starting our own journey to qualify for the tournament this October," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"These are both two top sides but we need to be testing ourselves at this level so we are prepared for what we could face should we qualify for the World Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Wood was the goalscorer the last time New Zealand played Mexico, a 2-1 loss in the 2017 Confederations Cup tournament in Sochi, Russia.</p>
        
            <p>A year earlier, the All Whites played their most recent game against the US, resulting in a 1-1 draw in Washington DC.</p>

            <p>Bazeley expected his team to be fully tested.</p>
        
            <p>"For the Mexico game we are likely going to be facing a huge and passionate Mexican crowd, and for the USA game they could potentially have a new head coach in place, so these games will present new and interesting challenges for us which we will embrace as a team.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen a lot of high-profile transfers for our players over the last few months, so it will be great to assemble as a squad and witness how our players are developing ahead of some significant games for the team."</p>
