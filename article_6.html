            <p>British archer Jodie Grinham became the first pregnant Paralympics athlete to win a medal when she took bronze in women's individual compound, official Paralympics social media accounts said.</p>
        
            <p>Seven months pregnant, 31-year-old Grinham held her nerves to beat Tokyo Paralympics gold medallist and friend Phoebe Paterson Pine by a razor-thin 142-141 scoreline in the bronze medal match-up.</p>
        
            <p>"Baby hasn't stopped kicking," Grinham said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's almost like baby's going, 'what's going on? It's really loud, mummy what are you doing?' But it's been a lovely reminder of the support bubble I have in my belly.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really proud of myself, I've had difficulties and it's not been easy. But as long as I'm healthy and baby's healthy, I knew I could compete.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew if I shot as well as I could, baby or not, I could come back as a [medallist]."</p>
        
            <p>Grinham will hope to win a second medal when she competes in the mixed team compound quarter-finals on Monday (local time) along with Nathan McQueen.</p>
