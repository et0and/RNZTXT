            <p>Moana Pasifika v Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 7.05pm, Saturday, 8 March</p>
        
            <p>North Harbour Stadium, Albany</p>

            <p>This is the game everyone has been waiting for - Ardie Savea against his old team.</p>
        
            <p>As Moana Pasifika skipper and clearly their most accomplished player, a lot will ride on Savea's performance, but it is worth remembering that Moana came home with a wet sail last weekend in their tight loss to the Highlanders.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Canes will be hurting, after their tight loss to the Blues, and will need to find some results fast, if they are to make the same impact in the competition that they did in 2024.</p>

            <p>First-five Patrick Pellegrini gets his first start in Moana colours, after a very handy shift off the bench last weekend. The Tongan international controlled the game well in his side's comeback.</p>
        
            <p>Lalomilo Lalomilo has recovered from concussion and returns to the starting line-up at centre, while Samiuela Moli, Abraham Pole and Aisea Halo get their first run of the year off the bench.</p>

            <p>A very powerful loose forward unit includes Brad Shields, Peter Lakai and Brayden Iose to start, with Du'Plessis Kirifi backing up on the bench. Nic Souchon and Jone Rova from the reserves as well.</p>

            <p>Moana Pasifika won 24-19 in their first meeting with the Hurricanes in Super Rugby Pacific (Round 6, 2022), but have lost all four of their meetings since and conceded an average of 53.8 points per game across those last four losses.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the Hurricanes' three games this Super Rugby Pacific season have been won by the team trailing at halftime - the Hurricanes lost 25-33 to the Crusaders in Round 1, after leading 22-14 at half-time, and won 38-34 against the Fijian Drua in Round 2, after trailing 19-22 at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Moana fullback William Havili has been directly involved in six tries - two tries and four try assists - more than any other player in the competition this season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's our ability to handle expectationâ€¦ sometimes it's a bit of over-trying. Everyone's trying their hardest, it's about understanding that it's doing your job to the best of your ability." - Moana coach Tana Umaga.</p>
        
            <p>"It's never around individuals, but [Ardie] is a world class player, so it's about understanding his strengths. It's a really good test for us." - Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 32 Moana Pasifika 24</p>
        
            <p>A spirited performance by Moana last May saw them well in the game until the last five or so minutes, before the 'Canes closed it out with a couple of penalties. The result certainly summed up Moana's season, as they were almost there and just needed a bit of killer instinct to pull off an upset.</p>
        
            <p>This is a pretty intriguing game, because if Moana can pick up where they left off last weekend, they'll be more than a handful for a 'Canes side that have often been their own worst enemies this season. However, the added class of Love and Harry Godfrey's great form so far will give them a great deal of confidence, especially behind that very powerful loose forward trio.</p>
