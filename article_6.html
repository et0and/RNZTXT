            <p>The Crusaders coach Rob Penney has cast doubt over the effectiveness of a law change in Super Rugby Pacific aimed at reducing kicking duels between teams.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby's current offside laws state players in front of the kicker can be put onside as soon as the kick receiver has either passed the ball or run five metres with the ball.</p>
        
            <p>This rule has been coined the "Dupont law" and has often been controversial.</p>
        
            <p>French halfback Antoine Dupont often exploited the existing law that produced territorial battles between the 22-metre lines where players would kick the ball back and forth until a mistake was made or one side made a gain when the ball was kicked out.</p>

            <p>For Super Rugby, defenders will remain offside until they have been put onside by a teammate who has come from behind the kicker, or the kicker themself.</p>
        
            <p>The change has been implemented this season to try and stop territorial kicking duels and create more running rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Super Rugby Pacific chair Kevin Malloy said the move was in response to feedback from fans, coaches and players.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to create a game that's exciting for our fans and enjoyable for our players. Part of that is seeing our players running the ball rather than trading multiple kicks in a battle for territory."</p>

            <p>The law change has been sanctioned by World Rugby as a trial.</p>
        
            <p>However, Penney, who is guiding the Crusaders following the departure of new All Blacks coach Scott Robertson, told RNZ he believes the rule tweak won't have a palpable affect on the way teams play.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, I don't think they went far enough.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be interesting to see how teams adjust, but it won't have the impact everyone is seeking unfortunately we think."</p>

            <p>Penney said the change would need to be more dramatic to have the desired result.</p>
        
            <p>"If you were to say anyone in front of the kicker was to have to retreat that would open up massive amounts of space and opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's the 10 metre rule where if you're in front of the kicker you can't advance if you're within 10 metres across the field, but you are allowed to stay there and if you do want to move laterally you just have to make sure you move some degree backwards," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"So what in all intensive purposes has happened is there is a bit more emphasis on the kick chaser having to get up with the guys in front and put them onside, but it hasn't really gone far enough to open up the opportunity to counter if teams are very active in their kick chase."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby chief executive, Mark Robinson, is heading to the UK next week for a series of meetings with the sport's leaders.</p>
        
            <p>He hopes the Northern Hemisphere's rugby powers adopt Super Rugby's alteration of the "Dupont law".</p>
        
            <p>"It (the Super Rugby Pacific law change) shows if we're really committed to it we can make change quickly, because we turned that around very quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"Issues around length of time for games to be played and interventions are again dominating some headlines and post-game analysis (in Europe). Those are the sort of things we think we can do better with.</p>
        
            <p>"It's why we're so excited. This is year two of us really taking a lead on the global stage with our domestic professional competitions."</p>
