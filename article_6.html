            <p>The Black Caps believe they've had an ideal preparation for the Champions Trophy and are confident they will be genuine title contenders.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are in strong form having won the recent one-day Tri-Series against Pakistan and South Africa and then beating Afghanistan in their final warmup game.</p>
        
            <p>The Champions Trophy starts Wednesday night with the Black Caps facing hosts Pakistan in Karachi.</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper/batter Tom Latham said they would be sticking to what's been working for them.</p>
        
            <p>"Pleasing to win the Tri-Series, from a preparation point of view it has been fantastic," Latham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing ODI's in these conditions, including a couple here in Karachi, I guess getting use to conditions has been a great step in the right direction."</p>
        
            <p>Latham said they would be taking the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix' attitude into their first game.</p>
        
            <p>"We try to keep things nice and simple and it is certainly no different here, preparation has gone really well over the last ten days."</p>
        
            <p>Opening batter Devon Conway returned to form during the Tri-Series with Kane Williamson also in the runs.</p>
        
            <p>While impressed with some of the individual performances so far on tour, Latham said there was no room for error at a major tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"It is vitally important that guys are hitting form at the right time and this tournament is short and sharp so you have to be playing your best cricket from game one."</p>
        
            <p>With the four games that they have played in last fortnight and the success they have had, the New Zealanders are quite rightly bullish about their chances.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes so all bases have been covered," said Latham.</p>
