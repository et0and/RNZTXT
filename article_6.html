            <p>Tasmanian Alex Hunt has won the Coast to Coast Longest Day men's multisport race at his seventh attempt, while New Zealander Deborah Lynch has claimed the women's event in her third attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt, who has had five previous podium finishes in the event - including a gutting second last year - beat defending champion Hamish Elliott by four minutes, in a time of 11 hours 29 minutes, 20 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Clark finished third, just over 12 minutes behind Elliott.</p>
        
            <p>Lynch proved too strong for endurance event great Simone Maier, who had won the race for five out of the past six editions, with a strong kayak leg and gritty final cycle burst.</p>
        
            <p>Lynch admits feeling unsure about how close behind Maier was.</p>
        
            <p>"Even on that last stretch along the boulevard, I was like, 'She could come', so… I was redlining the whole way.</p>
        
            <p>"I spent my entire day not trying to get ahead of myself and stay in the moment… I didn't believe [I'd won] until I crossed that finish line.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, it's yet to sink in."</p>
        
            <p>Lynch finished in 13 hours six minutes, 11 seconds just over four minutes ahead of Maier, with Elina Ussher, of Finland almost 12 minutes back in third place.</p>

            <p>Hunt, 33, was the first Australian since 1993 to win the Longest Day.</p>
        
            <p>"I still can't believe it, I'm just in shock. It's going to take a moment to sink in."</p>
        
            <p>The competitors ran, kayaked and cycled from Kumara Beach on the West Coast to New Brighton in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt had trailed Elliot for much of the race, but made a move on the 70km kayak stage on the Waimakariri River, emerging with a two-minute lead going onto the final cycle leg.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't an immediate decision to come back, that's for sure," Hunt said after the race.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd told myself and my family that it was going to be the last one, but Maggie my partner was supportive and keen for me to go again."</p>
        
            <p>To prepare for the 243km race he moved to New Zealand with Maggie and two-year-old daughter in early January.</p>
        
            <p>"We've done close to 20 trips to Arthurs Pass this year to train on the mountain run and Maggie's driven and looked after our daughter every day. She's amazing."</p>
        
            <p>The last Australian to win the Coast to Coast was Melbourne's John Jacoby in 1993.</p>
