            <p>New Zealand athlete Maddi Wesche has hit form ahead of the Olympics in Paris, smashing her shot put personal best in winning a competition in Germany.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche twice threw 19.81m at the Schoenebecker SoleCup throws-only meet, a full 18cm further than her previous best of 19.63cm achieved at the Diamond League meet in China in April.</p>
        
            <p>In the best sequence of her career, the 25-year-old Aucklander achieved the distance in the third and sixth rounds while she also produced a 19.65m heave in her second visit to the circle.</p>
        
            <p>Second place went to German indoor world championship silver medallist Yemisi Ogunleye with 19.53m.</p>

            <p>Wesche said she and coach Mike Schofield credited a meticulous season planning for her form as they prepare for competition which will come late in the Games at Paris - with qualification set down for August 8 and the final two days later.</p>
        
            <p>It continues a gradual career progression for the 25-year-old, who claimed gold at the 2018 world under-20 championships in Finland.</p>
        
            <p>She finished sixth at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (18.98m) and earned a bronze medal at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games while placing seventh at the last two world championships, producing a best of 19.51m at Budapest last year.</p>
