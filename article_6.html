            <p>Littler, born 21 days after 56-year-old Van Barneveld won his last world title in 2007, hit nine 180's to overpower the veteran Dutchman.</p>
        
            <p>The Englishman became the youngest player to reach the World Championship quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>"Unbelievable! My average has shown it, my double percentage has shown it - I don't know what to say!", Littler told Sky Sports.</p>
        
            <p>"He (Van Barneveld) said 'you can go all the way, I hope you can go all the way'. I said 'thank you' - he's a true gentleman and I respect Raymond."</p>
        
            <p>Littler will play Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan in the last eight.</p>
