            <p>South Africa have beefed up their squad with several World Cup winners for the two Rugby Championship home tests against old foes New Zealand, and also offered a recall to lock Nicolaas Janse van Rensburg to boost their second row options.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Steven Kitshoff, No 8 Jasper Wiese, halfback Jaden Hendrikse, centre Andre Esterhuizen and utility back Canan Moodie all return from injury or suspension to bolster the side that won back-to-back tests in Australia this month.</p>
        
            <p>Janse van Rensburg's only previous test was against Argentina in 2021, but the Montpellier second row gets his chance with Franco Mostert, Lood de Jager and Jean Kleyn all sidelined through injury.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to have Steven, Jaden and Canan back from injury, along with Jasper and Andre (who were suspended)," coach Rassie Erasmus said in a media release from South African Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"They are all Rugby World Cup winners, who have delivered quality performances consistently against the top teams in the world, so they'll bring experience and their unique skillsets to this squad.</p>
        
            <p>"All these players, with the exception of Nicolaas, were members of our training squad in Pretoria in July and our alignment camps earlier in the year.</p>
        
            <p>"They've have been regular members of the squad in the last few years, so they understand our systems and should slot in with ease."</p>
        
            <p>Erasmus confirmed lock R G Snyman, who was part of the squad but missed the two tests against Australia, should be fit to face New Zealand in the first Test in Johannesburg on 31 August. The second game is in Cape Town a week later.</p>

            <p>Erasmus has selected only two hookers in Malcolm Marx and Bongi Mbonambi, but prop Jan-Hendrik Wessels will provide cover.</p>
        
            <p>"Jan-Hendrik is a versatile player who enjoys playing both prop and hooker and we also have (flanker) Marco van Staden who can slot into the middle of the front row if needed," Erasmus said.</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks lead the Rugby Championship table following their bonus points wins against Australia, five points ahead of New Zealand.</p>
