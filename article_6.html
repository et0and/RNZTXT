            <p>"The South Sydney Rabbitohs have been made aware of a photograph circulating through social media of Latrell Mitchell following a personal appearance in Dubbo on the weekend," a statement from the NRL club said.</p>
        
            <p>"The club has informed the NRL Integrity Unit about the photograph.</p>
        
            <p>"The Rabbitohs will be making no further comment at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell reportedly attended rugby league games in the local Peter McDonald Premiership and attended coaching clinics in Dubbo over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old has not played since injuring his foot against the Rabbitohs in round 18.</p>
