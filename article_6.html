            <p>Israel Adesanya is set for his first non pay-per-view fight in the UFC in seven years.</p>
        
            <p>'Ya'll must've forgot.'</p>
        
            <p>Israel Adesanya is out to remind the world that he is one of the greatest mixed martial artists alive.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a brutal fall for the former UFC middleweight king, losing his title, submitted in his next shot, and now moved to a non-pay per view card for the first time in seven years.</p>
        
            <p>But the 'Last Stylebender' is adamant he is far from done.</p>
        
            <p>"Why am I still fighting? because I can, and I'm really, really, really good at it. I almost forgot how great I was. It's good to remind yourself. I keep saying, 'y'all must have forgot.' F***, I forgot," Adesnaya said on his Youtube channel.</p>
        
            <p>The middleweight will main event UFC Fight Night in Saudi Arabia on Sunday against Nassourdine Imavov, his first non-numbered card since he defeated Brad Tavares on The Ultimate Fighter Finale in July of 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Though whether or not there is gold on the line, Adesanya's motivations remain the same.</p>
        
            <p>"I still get paid. There's still a referee, it's two of us in there, there's a crowd. It's not like in the f**king Apex or something, so it doesn't feel any different. People think it must be eating me alive to be on a fight card. They're not in my shoes. They're not in my shorts."</p>
        
            <p>After an historic run inside the cage which saw him in 11 consecutive main event title fights, seven of which he won, Adesanya is coming off back to back losses, for the first time in his storied career.</p>
        
            <p>First dropping the strap in a stunning upset against Sean Strickland in 2023, he then became the first defence of Dricus Du Plessis' title reign in August of last year.</p>
        
            <p>Both fights had incredibly tense feuds in the lead up, though there is no rivalry to speak of with Imavov.</p>
        
            <p>"The last two opponents was personal in a way, because they try to attack my character. I'm so far removed from it now. , it's a fight. We're going to go in there and fight. The hands will talk. I'm ready to show what I can really do in the full range of mixed martial arts. I don't need animosity to fight someone or take them out."</p>
        
            <p>Since his debut in 2018, Adesanya has been one of the most active fighters in the UFC, entering the octagon 17 times, which included a move up to light heavyweight in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>His Russian-born French opponent (15-4) provides a stern challenge, riding as three fight win streak which included a knockout of Jared Cannonier, a man Adesanya defeated by decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen his fights. I know he's dangerous. I know he's slick. I like his styles go. It's not bad footwork. He's dangerous. Well-rounded," Adesanya said.</p>
        
            <p>Now 35, Adesanya told MMA media he considers himself a veteran of the UFC.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like the old dog, there's the young guys coming up and it's my job to send them back down and let them know, I'm still here."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was content with his significant accomplishments to date.</p>
        
            <p>"If I lose my next ten fights it wouldn't affect my legacy I'm doing this one for me. I'm not really chasing anything. I don't need anything. I'm just doing what I love."</p>
        
            <p>The former champion said he is no longer chasing greatness, but fighting for himself, his team, and his true fans.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to evolve, or die."</p>
