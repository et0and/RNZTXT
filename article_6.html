            <p>New Zealand sprint star Zoe Hobbs has won the 100m at the Potts Classic in Hastings to kick off a big year.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs extended her outstanding record at the meet with a time of 11:39, running into a slight headwind in warm conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The Oceania 100m record-holder, who reached the 2023 World Championships semi-finals, has claimed successive women's 100m at the Potts from 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs looked in full control in a strong field including Australian Bree Masters, who finished second and New Zealand 200m record-holder Rosie Elliott, who came in third.</p>
        
            <p>"The goal today was just to run it smooth, open the season and dust the cobwebs off so I'm glad I've got that under my belt now and a big focus towards the rest of the season now," Hobbs said.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs is heading to Europe in mid February, and will compete in the World Indoors event in the first weekend of March, before returning to New Zealand for nationals.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs is preparing for a big 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Last year Hobbs qualified for the Paris Olympics with a time of 10.96 seconds to become the first New Zealand female sprinter to achieve the feat in a number of years.</p>
