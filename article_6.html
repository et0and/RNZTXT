            <p>The World Cup winning Black Ferns were not happy with how last year ended and they are out to make amends this season.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand finished 2023 on a disappointing note, beaten by France and England at the inaugural WXV in Aotearoa in October and November and they are on a mission to get themselves back to the top of the pile.</p>
        
            <p>That mission starts on Saturday with their first game of the Pacific Four series, and they have named three debutants to take on the United States in Kirikiriroa, with lock Maama Vaipulu and halfback Maia Joseph in the starting XV and first-five Hannah King on the bench.</p>

            <p>Vaipulu, 21, who has a background in volleyball, was one of the standout players in Super Rugby Aupiki.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns co-captain Ruahei Demant, who played with her at the championship winning Blues women, believes Vaipulu has the potential to become one of the world's best locks.</p>
        
            <p>"She loves that tight, dirty work, all that stuff that locks do. All that stuff that no one else is going to see, that no one will praise you for, she loves that. She's a really physical player, she loves being involved in the contact and she's really good at it.</p>
        
            <p>"Then in addition to that, with her volleyball background, she's a weapon in the air."</p>
        
            <p>Maia Joseph, the daughter of former All Black and Japan coach Jamie Joseph, said her dad would not be in the stands in Hamilton for her Black Ferns debut, with another family commitment taking priority.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually my sister's graduation at exactly the same time. She's graduating law school and so my parents are at that in Dunedin and coming next week (to the Black Ferns test against Canada in Christchurch). She must be the favourite," Joseph joked.</p>

            <p>Outside of the three debutants the Black Ferns have a settled look to their team and head coach Allan Bunting insists that will not change as they build towards next year's World Cup in England.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns won last year's Pacific Four series and will want to defend their title in 2024 and qualify for the end of year WXV tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The WXV which pits the three best teams from the Pacific Fop against the three top teams from the women's Six Nations.</p>

            <p>The WXV, in Canada, will be a preview of next year's World Cup and veteran lock Charmaine Smith said retaining their world title is the Black Ferns number one goal.</p>
        
            <p>"We're definitely looking ahead to be building towards the World Cup, but then also taking it one week at a time, one game at a time."</p>
        
            <p>This week that game is against a United States side that the Black Ferns are expected to beat, after Canada thumped the US by 43 points in last month's series opener.</p>
