            <p>Some big hitting from Scott Kuggeleijn has pushed the Black Caps' lead over Australia to 251 runs in the second Test in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were 345 for six in their second innings at tea on day three at Hagley Oval, with Australia having claimed three quick wicket midway through the second session - including Rachin Ravindra for 82 and Daryl Mitchell for 58.</p>
        
            <p>Number eight Kuggeleijn's unbeaten 38 from 36 balls - featuring four fours and two sixes - shifted momentum back in the Black Caps' favour, with Glenn Phillips not out on 16, with the pair having put on a quickfire 49 for the seventh wicket.</p>
        
            <p>It could prove to be an important stand, with Australia potentially set to chase more than 300 in the final innings of the Test to seal a 2-0 series sweep.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have a chance of squaring the series, helped by half-centuries to opener Tom Latham (73), along with Ravindra and Mitchell, who combined for 123 for the fourth wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell was the first to depart, caught behind off Josh Hazlewood after striking the pace bowler for successive fours from the two previous deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra followed - also snared by wicketkeeper Alex Carey - off the first ball of a new spell from Australian captain Pat Cummins (3-49).</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell's modest form with the bat continued when he struck a poor delivery from Cameron Green to cover to depart for nine.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Latham added eight to his overnight score before he was caught by wicketkeeper Alex Carey off Pat Cummins' bowling.</p>
        
            <p>The Australians successfully reviewed after the original decision was not out, with replays showing a fine inside edge from Latham's bat.</p>
