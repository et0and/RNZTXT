            <p>The White Ferns have been swept in the ODI series in England, but the tourists did put up more of a fight in the third and final game in Bristol.</p>
        
            <p>England won by five wickets, chasing down a target of 212 in a rain-reduced 42 overs.</p>
        
            <p>The match was delayed for 95 minutes before England won the toss and for the third time in the series New Zealand batted first.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand scored 211/8 from their 42 overs with Amelia Kerr top scoring with 57.</p>
        
            <p>Suzie Bates made 24, while Kerr and captain Sophie Devine (43) put on 68 runs for the third wicket.</p>
        
            <p>31 from Brooke Halliday and 14 from Lauren Down got the Ferns over 200 for the first time in the series.</p>
        
            <p>Lauren Bell took her maiden five wicket haul for England, finishing with 5-37.</p>
        
            <p>In reply Hannah Rowe grabbed the wicket of Tammy Beaumont in the first over.</p>
        
            <p>Rowe also picked up the wicket of captain Heather Knight for 9 as the home side slipped to 33 for three in the eighth over.</p>
        
            <p>However Nat Sciver-Brunt and Amy Jones put on 90 runs for the fifth wicket.</p>
