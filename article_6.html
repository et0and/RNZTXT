            <p>Pride is at the forefront for the Warriors with three games left in their National Rugby League season, head coach Andrew Webster says.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors are licking their wounds after a 34-32 golden point loss to the Dolphins in Brisbane on the weekend, which all but ended their top eight hopes.</p>
        
            <p>Webster said the players had a lot of pride in the jersey.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to do that justice, be professional, there's a lot to play for.</p>
        
            <p>"Mathematically obviously it's almost impossible to make it ... but I think we'd never forgive ourselves if we don't give ourselves the best opportunity to do that," Webster said.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday they meet the Sea Eagles in Sydney but Webster said he would not use the rest of the season to test players with a view to next year.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we should just be handing our jerseys, it doesn't mean that we can't reward people that we think deserve it. I've got one eye on the fact that we want to win every week and we're going to put the best team out there to win."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said the loss to the Dolphins hurt and it was not the first time the Warriors lost a tight tussle this season.</p>

            <p>"I think everyone can tell we still haven't played our best football, we haven't taken our opportunities and we've put ourselves in difficult situations.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the end of the day we conceded 32 points on the weekend so that's just not good enough to win NRL games."</p>
        
            <p>A group of players are flying over on Tuesday to join the extended squad, including Shaun Johnson, who Webster confirmed will play this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Webster said the group felt very connected.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spoken a lot about this group will never be together again ... we didn't have many leave last year, we're going to have a few this year. And we're going to have players who've had a strong contribution for this club and for the game of rugby league that won't be here next year.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's just probably not about yourself right now, how you're feeling, it's probably more so about what do we want to do as a group. I know for a fact if we don't make it our holiday's going to feel a lot better win three wins as opposed to three loses."</p>

            <p>Club legend Johnson announced a couple of weeks ago that he would retire at the end of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Webster said despite several disappointing losses, the players had fought throughout the year.</p>
        
            <p>"I reckon this year there's probably been two or three games we haven't been happy with our effort. I think the rest of our poor results have been around execution.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a team that care about the result, that's why we've been in so many contests and that's why I feel like our fans still turn up and want to watch us because they know that they do care about the jersey and I think they care about each other.</p>
        
            <p>"So I've been really proud of that fact even though we haven't executed the way we wanted to."</p>
        
            <p>Goal kicker Chanel Harris-Tavita had a tough outing against the Dolphins last week and Webster said they had a few options to consider this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I still believe in Chanel as a goalkicker ... he actually does have a good strike rate in the NRL."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said Luke Metcalf would be in consideration off the back of two really good performances in the New South Wales Cup. Adam Pompey was likely to be back in contention this week as well, he said.</p>
