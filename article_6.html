            <p>All Whites defender Tim Payne is with the Wellington Phoenix for the longterm.</p>
        
            <p>Payne has signed a three-year contract extension, keeping him with the A-League club through until the end of the 2027-28.</p>
        
            <p>The deal extends his stay at the club to the best part of a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Payne, 30, scored three goals and contributed four assists for the Phoenix during the 2023-24 A-League and was named in the PFA men's team of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very happy here and very settled," he said. "I believe in what Chiefy (Giancarlo Italiano) and his coaching staff have done.</p>
        
            <p>"They have given me the opportunity to play consistently at right back and I feel like they got some of the best football out of me last season.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a very successful last season and we're looking to build on that and hopefully go one better this season. And if it's not this season than the year after, or the year after that.</p>
        
            <p>"All of the players and all of the staff believe that we can go on and win the whole thing. That's our aim and that's what we're going to try and do."</p>
        
            <p>His form for the Phoenix also helped the versatile defender become a regular for the national team.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really looking forward to the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in a good place to be in that squad and playing for New Zealand should we qualify next year.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm enjoying playing right back a lot. Prolonged time in one position has probably helped me push forward and play better.</p>
        
            <p>"I think my performances last season and the start of this season have shown that."</p>
        
            <p>Payne was born and bred in Auckland and concedes returning home was tempting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an interesting one. Auckland FC are doing fantastically well at the moment so there's that aspect and I have a lot of friends and family up there.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good thing for us players that there are now two professional clubs in New Zealand, but I've weighed up all possibilities, all of the pros and cons and I think the Phoenix is a very good place for me at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Tim Payne is the 16th player in the Wellington Phoenix men's squad contracted to the club beyond the 2024-25 season.</p>
