            <p>The United States pulled off one of the biggest shocks in cricket history by beating former champions Pakistan in a super over in Dallas.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan looked to be avoiding embarrassment at the T20 World Cup before Nitish Kumar hit the final ball of the US innings for four to tie the scores at 159.</p>
        
            <p>Sloppy for large parts of the game, Pakistan fell apart in the added time. Mohammad Amir bowled three wides, one of which the co-hosts also pinched two extra runs from.</p>
        
            <p>The US scrambled to 18-1, leaving Pakistan to chase 19 off left-arm seamer Saurabh Netravalkar. With 14 needed off four, Kumar made another stunning intervention, this time holding a magnificent catch at long-off to dismiss Iftikhar Ahmed.</p>
        
            <p>With seven required from the last ball, Shadab Khan could only take a single, sparking joyous celebrations among the American players and supporters.</p>
        
            <p>All this at the end of a riveting contest, one which fluctuated in the burning Texas sunshine.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan recovered from 26-3, including an astonishing catch from America's Steven Taylor, to post 159-7.</p>
        
            <p>The US were cruising in the chase, at one stage needing only 56 runs from seven overs with nine wickets in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan forced the super over and should have escaped, but the US completed the first upset of this expanded World Cup, one that gives them every chance of reaching the Super Eights.</p>
        
            <p>After beating Canada in their opening game, they may now need only one win in their remaining group matches against India and Ireland in order to qualify.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan, winners in 2009 and beaten in the final by England in 2022, are already at risk of an early exit and must somehow regroup for a showpiece clash with fierce rivals India in New York on Sunday.</p>
