            <p>New Zealand's next group game is against the United States on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>After the match, Garbett told Sky Sport he was happy with the team's efforts.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought the first half was excellent. We had a few chances and could have gone two or three nil up. I missed a penalty unfortunately but straight after luckily we got that first goal.</p>
        
            <p>The second half I think we showed that New Zealand character to dig deep and get stuck in and fight it out to the last minute. I'm very proud of to lead out the boys for the first time and get the win."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
