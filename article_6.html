            <p>He was one of the most thrilling players to grace the field, but now rugby legend Carlos Spencer worries excitement is going out of the game.</p>
        
            <p>An over-reliance on the Television Match Official has left Spencer feeling disillusioned with the game, a feeling shared by many fans, pundits and players.</p>
        
            <p>World Rugby has come under heavy criticism following the World Cup final which saw a number of interjections from upstairs, in particular a try by Aaron Smith that was ruled out despite TMO Tom Foley overstepping his jurisdiction in doing so.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament itself suffered from a multitude of in-game delays due to constant delegation between the officiating crews.</p>
        
            <p>According to reports, World Rugby has acknowledged errors made in the final, which was won 12-11 by the Springboks and apologised to the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Spencer said the influence of technology was not setting the game up for a bright future.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty disappointing when the games come to what it is, and there's obviously been a lot of talks around TMOs, you know, ruining the game. I probably have to agree to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>Spencer led three of the most exciting sides in rugby history - the '96, '97 and '03 Blues.</p>
        
            <p>He won three Super Rugby titles and earned 44 All Black tests.</p>
        
            <p>Known as "The King," Spencer dazzled audiences with his banana kicks, no look flick passes and searing speed.</p>
        
            <p>However, he admitted the game has shifted significantly since his era.</p>
        
            <p>Now coaching Blues Aupiki, Spencer said referees needed to be given as much responsibility as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"If we look at that World Cup final, I just thought the TMO had too much influence on the game. The referee is there for a reason."</p>
        
            <p>A host of prominent rugby icons have spoken out about referees being less empowered having a detriment on the game's flow, including legendary whistle blower Nigel Owens.</p>
        
            <p>"We have got to be mindful of where the game is heading around these TMO's and our referees. I just think the way it's going at the moment is you're not putting their game I suppose in a bright future for the young kids wanting to play the game."</p>
        
            <p>An onfield innovator, Spencer hoped the powers at be could be as bold and help save rugby from the clutches of the bunker.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make the game as exciting as possible and I think we've lost it over the years."</p>
