            <p>Analysis - The merits of football's position in the Olympic canon aside, New Zealand's participation in the 2024 edition of the Games' soccer tournament is over - following Group Stage exits for both the Football Ferns and the Oly Whites.</p>
        
            <p>With drama both on the pitch and off it - specifically, hovering above a Football Ferns training session - what did we learn from New Zealand's footballing excursions at Paris 2024?</p>
        
            <p>The best spies are the ones you least expect. Which is probably why the stereotypically polite and non-confrontational Canadians have been getting away with it for so long. The Football Ferns were thrust into the Olympic spotlight before a ball was even kicked with the spy drama that engulfed their opening fixture, and it certainly served as a welcome distraction from the Kiwis' own internal issues.</p>

            <p>The build-up to the Games was marred by controversy surrounding the future of head coach Jitka Klimkova. Meanwhile, the Ferns were also in a challenging group with the reigning champions of the Great White North, host nation France and up-and-comers Colombia.</p>
        
            <p>Weirdly, despite losing all three games, the Football Ferns likely overperformed at the tournament. They pushed both Canada and France all the way, losing 2-1, but a sub-par showing against Colombia in between cost them any chance of advancing.</p>
        
            <p>The pre-Games controversy has asked some difficult questions of this group but they avoided the embarrassment many predicted for them.</p>
        
            <p>There was some real fight on show, particularly in those close defeats against quality opposition in Canada and France.</p>
        
            <p>There's also considerable hope for the future, with standout performances from young players such as Kate Taylor, Mackenzie Barry and Anna Leat.</p>
        
            <p>First things first: the coaching situation needs to be sorted. Mystery still shrouds the future of Klimkova, who stepped aside for the Games as a restorative process surrounding a recently concluded independent workplace employment investigation - which found in the 49-year-old Czech's favour.</p>
        
            <p>Having a stable and confirmed coaching picture in place before potential friendly fixtures in October or November will be crucial toward capitalising on the momentum of last year's World Cup on home soil.</p>
        
            <p>To progress with the wrong set-up now will be hugely detrimental to any hopes of further improvements at the next World Cup in Brazil in 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Like the Football Ferns, the men's side also exited at the group stage and similarly to the women, it was a mixed bag.</p>

            <p>Things started brilliantly, with Darren Bazeley's high-press tactics getting the better of Guinea in their opener.</p>
        
            <p>However, a poor start in their next clash with the United States cost them greatly. To advance, a result against the USA was paramount, but a sloppy opening half hour contributed to a 4-1 loss.</p>
        
            <p>Host nation France, as expected and without great effort, put the final nail in the coffin.</p>
        
            <p>Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>First, there is clearly talent in the New Zealand ranks. Alex Paulsen's performance against Guinea justified AFC Bournemouth's faith in his ability. This would have also been a big learning curve for Matthew Garbett, who stepped up as captain ahead of a campaign in the Dutch top-flight this season.</p>
        
            <p>But mostly, it outlined the importance and impact of the All Whites' more senior players. Chris Wood, Liberato Cacace and Kosta Barbarouses will be big players in any World Cup cycle - as will Sarpreet Singh, who reminded us of his raw talent in his continued injury rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>For the U23 side who represented New Zealand at the Games, not much, but for some of the players this was an audition for the senior team ahead of marquee friendlies against Mexico and the USA in September.</p>
        
            <p>For many of the young talents on show, those fixtures will be the last chance to demonstrate their worthiness of a place in the World Cup 2026 qualification campaign, which gets underway in October.</p>
        
            <p>With a guaranteed place in the tournament on offer for the Oceania region for the first time, this could be the first step on the path to a World Cup squad in two years' time.</p>
