            <p>Olympic champion Lisa Carrington has been beaten by fellow New Zealander Aimee Fisher in the lead-up to the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher pipped Carrington by 0.33 seconds to win the K1 500m at the latest canoe sprint World Cup in Hungary.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher, who walked from the New Zealand team in the lead-up to the Tokyo Olympics because of an internal dispute, announced her return to the big stage with an incredible finishing burst to relegate Olympic and world champion Carrington to a silver medal.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was lining up, I just wanted to be courageous, and I wanted to paddle beautifully, and light up my own lane," Fisher said.</p>
        
            <p>"And I think I did that. I didn't panic, I stayed calm. I could hear everyone cheering us on, I could hear my name being called, I felt like I could hear everyone back home, and it was like there was this love pulling me to the finish line.</p>
        
            <p>"There were definitely some tears afterwards. It was a really special moment. It's been tough, I feel like I have walked through fire at times, but it's transformed me as a person and as an athlete. It's been a good ride."</p>

            <p>Both paddlers went under the previous world best time and the race in Hungary may have been a preview to this year's Olympic final, with both Carrington and Fisher on the New Zealand Olympic team and both expected to race in the K1 500 in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Belgium's Hermien Peters took the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>The second Canoe Sprint World Cup will be held in Poznan, Poland, in a fortnight.</p>
