            <p>After five games on the sideline, it's lesson learnt for Breakers point-guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright.</p>
        
            <p>He was charged with pushing a game official during their Christmas clash with Tasmania and later handed a suspension.</p>
        
            <p>He returns against the same opposition on Thursday night in Auckland, and hopes it is the last he sees of the judiciary.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a bit frustrating. It's an unusual circumstance for myself. I can't even remember the last time I've been ejected from a basketball game."</p>
        
            <p>The American import was knocked to the floor by Reuben Te Rangi and in response Jackson-Cartwright got to his feet and charged at Te Rangi, making incidental contact with an official in the process.</p>
        
            <p>"I meant no harm to anybody but I have accepted the situation, and hopefully everyone can move on from it."</p>
        
            <p>During his time off, Jackson-Cartwright said he had reflected on his actions.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a time that you look inward, you gain some more perspective. I was disappointed in the way I acted, but it the end, you accept it, you move past it, and come back with a mindset to win basketball games."</p>

            <p>He said his biggest lesson has been not to take anything for granted.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything is about choices, I wish I had some better disarmament in that moment but now I have let my emotions settle down, I have reflected on how much I love playing basketball, and not being able to be out there for the last few weeks has definitely hurt."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright said he would like to think he will react differently in future.</p>
        
            <p>"This is high level basketball, stakes are high, and people are competing their hearts out and with that comes physicality and sometimes things happen."</p>
        
            <p>On court, it has also been a tough time for the Breakers, who languish in ninth. Only a mathematical miracle would see them make the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>"Every season has its adversity and we expect a lot of ourselves, we know what we have to do to make it work, and we are expected to do that," Jackson-Cartwright said.</p>
        
            <p>Regarding his future in Auckland, Jackson-Cartwright said his focus was on finishing the season strongly.</p>
        
            <p>"I never say never. I love this club, so I'm going to compete until my last game, whenever that is."</p>
        
            <p>Thursday night's game against Tasmania will mark the Breakers' 100th appearance at Spark Arena.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big milestone for the club, a great moment for us as players to be part of history so it should be a special night."</p>
        
            <p>However, he knows the defending champion JackJumpers present a stern challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"They are champions so any time you're playing the champions it's going to be a tough game."</p>
        
            <p>Tip off is at 7.30pm.</p>
