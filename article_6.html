            <p>Grammy Award-winning artist Kendrick Lamar will headline the halftime show at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans on 9 Feburary, he announced on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Lamar, 37, will be on the Super Bowl stage for the second time in four years. The 17-time Grammy Award winner performed as a guest artist with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J. Blige at Super Bowl LVI on 13 Feburary, 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date. And I'll be there to remind the world why," Lamar said in a statement. "They got the right one."</p>
        
            <p>Lamar posted a YouTube video that showed himself on a football field in front of an American flag. The NFL confirmed the news and shared a promotional poster on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"Few artists have impacted music and culture as profoundly as Kendrick Lamar," NFL head of music Seth Dudowsky said. "Time and time again, Kendrick has proven his unique ability to craft moments that resonate, redefine, and ultimately shake the very foundation of hip-hop."</p>
