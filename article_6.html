            <p>FIFA is investigating a video circulating on social media that showed some members of the Argentina national team singing about France's players that the French Football Federation decried as "racist and discriminatory".</p>
        
            <p>The French Football Federation said on Monday that it would file a complaint to the global soccer governing body over the video, in which Argentina players were celebrating winning the Copa America.</p>
        
            <p>"FIFA is aware of a video circulating on social media and the incident is being looked into," a FIFA spokesperson said in a statement. "FIFA strongly condemns any form of discrimination by anyone including players, fans and officials."</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana described the video posted to social media by his club team mate Enzo Fernandez as "uninhibited racism".</p>
        
            <p>Fernandez later apologised on social media, saying he had gotten "caught up in the euphoria of our celebrations."</p>
        
            <p>"The song included highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>The Premier League side said in a statement on Wednesday: "Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour completely unacceptable. We are proud to be a diverse, inclusive club where people from all cultures, communities and identities feel welcome."</p>
