            <p>The 2024 ASB Men's Classic champion Alejandro Tabilo will return to defend his tennis title in Auckland, a title that sparked a remarkable 2024 season for the up-and-comer.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old Canadian-born Chilean bagged his first ever ATP title at Auckland in January, after going through qualifying at the ASB Classic.</p>
        
            <p>Tabilo reached a placing of 83 in 2023, which was not high enough to earn an automatic entry to the ASB Classic last year, but now sits at No 22 in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Since his win in Auckland, Tabilo has won two ATP titles, along with a stunning victory over multiple grand slam winner Novak Djokovic on his way to the semi-final of the 1000-level Rome Masters, which helped catapult him to a career-high international placing of 19.</p>
        
            <p>The Chilean has won more than half of his career $US2.8 million earnings to date in his break-out 2024 season, which began in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It was my first title. It was unbelievable. It was an unreal week and I was just so happy to get my first win in Auckland," Tabilo said.</p>
        
            <p>"What pleased me most since that win is just the consistency I have had this whole year.</p>
        
            <p>"More than the wins, is just being able to stay in the high ranking and keep going with these guys head-to-head. Obviously the win with Djokovic was surreal and gave me the confidence that I can compete with those guys."</p>
        
            <p>Tabilo is focussed on further developing his career and defending his title at the ASB Tennis Arena in January.</p>
        
            <p>"It is nice to come back to Auckland as the defending champion - with a bit more pressure, but I want to do the best I can and try to defend that title.</p>
        
            <p>"I loved playing there - it is a great atmosphere and I feel so comfortable playing on those courts."</p>
        
            <p>ASB Classic Tournament Director Nicolas Lamperin said the performance of Tabilo magnifies what the tournament can do for a rising player and the important role it can have in a player's career.</p>
        
            <p>"Alejandro is one of the great tennis stories on the ATP Tour in 2024, and it is a thrill for all of us at the ASB Classic that we were able to provide the platform to springboard his career," Lamperin said.</p>
        
            <p>"While we love to bring top names to Auckland, fans should realise that all of the players who line-up at the ASB Classic are world-class and all have the capability to progress up the rankings.</p>
        
            <p>"Many, like Tabilo, are hoping for that one big result, [that] can provide the platform for them to begin to realise their potential."</p>
        
            <p>Lamperin said further top-line players are under negotiation at present, and he expects them to be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>
