            <p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it appears to be the mantra for Chiefs Clayton McMillan heading into this weekend's semifinal against the Hurricanes in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>McMillan has named an unchanged lineup from the side that defeated the Reds 43-21 in the quarterfinal last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It is a far tougher task awaiting the Chiefs in the form of the table-topping Hurricanes, a side they have lost to twice in 2024. However, the Chiefs bring more recent play-off experience with this being the first for the Hurricanes since 2019.</p>
        
            <p>McMillan said the key area of focus for them this week had been accuracy and discipline.</p>
        
            <p>"We improved significantly against the Reds, and that alone enabled us to play the type of game we know we have always been capable of playing. It is also encouraging that we have a fit and fresh squad who are chomping at the bit, and for the first time this year, we are able to name an unchanged matchday 23," McMillan said.</p>

            <p>Plenty of players put their hands up in last week's rout of the Reds, none more so than first-five Damian McKenzie who added another 13 points to his competition-leading tally of 157.</p>
        
            <p>"The Hurricanes have set the pace in this year's competition, have earned the right to get the home advantage through the finals, and will be formidable opposition again in front of a large and expectant home crowd," McMillan said.</p>
        
            <p>The last time the sides met, the Hurricanes were able to draw a couple of crucial penalties at the scrum on their way to a tight 20-17 win in Hamilton. It was part of a highly disciplined second-half from the Hurricanes, who did not concede a penalty.</p>
        
            <p>"They are a well-balanced team, riding high on confidence. They will be a tough nut to crack as we have already experienced twice this year. Playing each other for a third time creates new opportunities. I imagine both teams will draw on previous experiences to understand where the gains can be made."</p>
