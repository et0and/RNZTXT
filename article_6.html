            <p>The Black Caps had a 640-run lead at stumps on day three of the third test against England in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were dismissed for 453 in their second innings late in the day, giving the visitors two days to bat for a series sweep.</p>
        
            <p>England will resume on Tuesday on 18-2, as New Zealand bowled six overs to finish the day.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee picked up his first wicket of his final test, clean bowling Ben Duckett for four, before Matt Henry had Zak Crawley's wicket for the sixth time in the series.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand top order batter Kane Williamson began the day on 50 and added 106 runs before he was dismissed by Shoaib Bashir after tea.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson's 156 was the 33rd time he had scored a Test century and the seventh time he had passed the milestone at Seddon Park.</p>
        
            <p>He brought up his century with a six down the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Rachin Ravindra started the delayed first session of the day alongside Williamson, but fell just short of a milestone of his own.</p>
        
            <p>Rain washed out the morning session and play began after lunch, Ravindra adding 42 runs to his overnight score before getting out for 44 as Matthew Potts' only wicket of the innings.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell joined Williamson at the crease and scored 60, including seven fours and two sixes, before becoming left-arm spinner Jacob Bethell's first test wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell and Mitch Santner combined to extend New Zealand's lead by finding the boundary regularly.</p>
        
            <p>Picking up from where he left off in the first innings, Santner scored with ease, picking up 49 off 38 balls before he was out to Joe Root's off-spin.</p>
        
            <p>Southee scored two runs in his final turn at bat as an international test cricketer, becoming Bethell's second wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Bethell then dismissed Matt Henry for a duck as Blundell ran out of partners and was unbeaten on 44 off 55 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Bethell ended with 3-72 from his 14.2 overs.</p>
        
            <p>England captain Ben Stokes left the field with a left hamstring injury after lunch and he did not return to the field during New Zealand's second innings. He will undergo further assessment of the injury to determine his availability to bat in England's second innings.</p>
