            <p>Najmul Hossain Shanto produced a captain's hundred and forged two significant partnerships to put Bangladesh in a commanding position in the opening test against New Zealand in Sylhet.</p>
        
            <p>The home side finished day three on 212-3 for a lead of 205 and with seven wickets in hand they would be confident of going 1-0 up in the two-test series.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand, who made 317 in their first innings, would have to play out of their skin batting last in the spinner-dominated contest.</p>

            <p>Shanto was batting on 104, his third hundred in four test innings, when bad light stopped play with Mushfiqur Rahim on 43 at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealand resumed on 266-8 and went on to eclipse Bangladesh's first innings total of 310 after Tim Southee (35) and Kyle Jamieson (23) put together a 52-run stand for the ninth wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh lost both their openers early in their second innings when they came out to bat.</p>
        
            <p>Zakir Hasan fell to Ajaz Patel for the second time in the match and Mahmudul Hasan Joy's stay was cut short in bizarre fashion.</p>
        
            <p>Shanto's straight drive brushed bowler Southee's fingers before hitting the stumps at the non-striker's end with Joy short of the crease.</p>
        
            <p>Shanto combined with Mominul Haq (40) in a fluent 90-run partnership to tide over the crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Mominul was run out after an almighty mix-up with Shanto, who went on to consolidate Bangladesh's position with a 96-run partnership with Mushfiqur for the unbroken fourth wicket.</p>
