            <p>A scholarship and trophy named in honour of one of New Zealand's all-round sporting personalities, the late Sir John Graham, has been launched at a reunion of the 1999 New Zealand cricket team at the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Graham, a former All Black and Auckland Grammar principal, managed the New Zealand cricket side from 1997 to 1999.</p>
        
            <p>The trophy and scholarship will have a focus on management skills.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket said a panel including former 1999 team members - and now NZ Cricket (NZC) directors Roger Twose and Dion Nash - will select an inaugural winner from applications received over the next year.</p>

            <p>NZC credits Graham with having a key role in the New Zealand team's revival during the late 1990s, including their 2-1 series in England.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir John set the standard a quarter of a century ago with his style and tone of team management, and it's appropriate that we're both recognising him now and exploring new pathways for aspiring team managers," Black Caps manager Mike Sandle said.</p>
        
            <p>The reunion was being held during the second test between England and New Zealand.</p>
