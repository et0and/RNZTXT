            <p>New Zealand martial arts fighter Dan Hooker has undergone surgery on his left hand after withdrawing from Saturday's co-main event lightweight fight against Justin Gaethje at UFC 313.</p>
        
            <p>Hooker (24-12 MMA, 14-8 UFC) withdrew from the fight last month, disclosing a fractured hand in a video with his daughter posted on YouTube.</p>
        
            <p>He said the injury occurred when he hit the top of the head of his sparring partner with his knuckle.</p>

            <p>Hooker took to social media again on Monday night, sharing a picture on Instagram from a hospital bed with his surgically-repaired hand.</p>
        
            <p>His message simpley said "BRB" a shortened version of "be right back".</p>
        
            <p>The 35-year-old Hooker is on a three-fight win streak. He last fought in August, beating Mateusz Gamrot in Australia to extend his winning streak to three fights. However, he will not get to face Gaethje (25-5, 8-5) on Saturday, with Rafael Fiziev (12-3, 6-3) stepping in.</p>
        
            <p>It a rematch of a fight Gaethje won by majority decision at UFC 286.</p>
        
            <p>It will also mark Gaethje's first return to the Octagon since the 36-year-old was knocked out by Max Holloway in the fifth round at UFC 300 in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>The main event of the UFC 313 card is a light heavyweight title fight between Alex Pereira and Magomed Ankalaev.</p>
