            <p>Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has been crowned snowboard slopestyle champion for a third time following a thrilling final in Corvatsch, Switzerland.</p>
        
            <p>The Wanaka-based Olympic champion underlined her class with a performance that bagged a sixth career world championships medal.</p>
        
            <p>Five have come in Slopestyle, including previous golds in 2021 and 2019, along with silvers in 2017 and 2023. Her other silver was in the Big Air in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott, who missed last year's championships with injury, said she was in disbelief.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't really believe it; I didn't really think about it coming into this week. I was just feeling incredibly grateful for this whole winter after my injury last year and really thankful for the support from my sponsors, my team, my friends and my family."</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old was only sixth out of 12 riders after the first run after an uncharacteristic bobble on her third jump of the technical course.</p>

            <p>Mirroring her Beijing 2022 Olympic Slopestyle gold, Sadowski-Synnott produced her best when it was needed in her second and final run.</p>
        
            <p>She remained composed to leapfrog into the top spot with the only score of the competition in the 90s to power three points clear of her nearest rival.</p>
        
            <p>Her winning run included a cab 270 on, 270 off on the top rail and a backside double-corked 1260 melon grab on the third jump, all executed flawlessly.</p>
        
            <p>"That was crazy, I messed up my first run and put so much pressure on myself coming into the last run," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"All the girls were riding so good, and I was stoked to watch everyone's runs - it just vibed me up to land that run. I have never done that [run combination] in contest before, so I am super stoked."</p>
        
            <p>Japanese riders Kokomo Murase and Reira Iwabuchi rounded out the podium in second and third.</p>
