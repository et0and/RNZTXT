            <p>Legendary coach Arch Jelley has been made a life member of Athletics New Zealand at the age of 102.</p>
        
            <p>The award recognises a coaching career that has inspired generations of New Zealand athletes particularly in middle distance running.</p>
        
            <p>Athletics NZ chief executive Cam Mitchell conceded it was "potentially overdue".</p>
        
            <p>Jelley's guidance famously helped Sir John Walker win gold in the 1500m at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>His journey as a coach began in 1959, and over the following decades he mentored over a hundred middle-distance runners, including Olympians, Commonwealth Games representatives and national record holders.</p>
        
            <p>He officially retired as a coach after the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>A former teacher and principal, Jelley combined his skills in education with his love for athletics, fostering both physical and personal development in his athletes.</p>
        
            <p>He was awarded an OBE for services to sport in 1982 and was among the first inductees into the Athletics New Zealand Coaches Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>Jelley said he was "rather surprised." to receive the recognition as "I hadn't really thought about, but it's a great honour."</p>
        
            <p>Reflecting on his decades of involvement in the sport Jelley said "I remember, Sir Peter Snell ran the world record 800 in ordinary old spikes on a damp track and broke the world record. And I think his performance would be equal to anything that they do now, even though they, you know, [run] 1:41.</p>
        
            <p>"I think his performance was actually fantastic. The other big things that have happened since I've been in athletics... is that there are just as many females as males [running], and it's just tremendous," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jelley had been a pioneer of women's coaching, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to see some of that recognised... So this is very much a well-deserved, and potentially overdue award. We're delighted to acknowledge you," he said.</p>
