            <p>Three seasoned Paralympians and a rising sprinter are the first New Zealanders unveiled to compete at this year's Paralympic Games in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>A four-strong group of para athletes was announced on Friday for the four-yearly Games, with Holly Robinson, Anna Grimaldi and Will Stedman all making at least their third appearance.</p>
        
            <p>The newcomer at the Games, that run from 28 August to 8 September, is multiple New Zealand record-holding sprinter Mitch Joynt.</p>
        
            <p>Vastly experienced Dunedin-based F46 category thrower Holly Robinson, who will contest the women's javelin F46 and shot put F46, said her fourth Paralympic Games would be different to the first three.</p>
        
            <p>"This will be my first Paralympic Games competing across two events, and while that presents a new challenge, I'm excited about the prospect of taking to both the javelin runway and shot put circle in Paris."</p>
        
            <p>Making her Paralympic debut as a 17-year-old at the London 2012 Games, four years later Robinson was selected as flag bearer at Rio, where she won silver.</p>
        
            <p>At the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Games, she went one place higher on the podium as a clutch sixth-round javelin throw of 40.99m catapulted her to gold.</p>

            <p>Robinson's shot put hopes were buoyed by a silver medal-winning display at last year's World Para Athletics Championships in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Long jumper Grimaldi will seek to complete a hat-trick of gold medals in the women's T47 long jump. The 27-year-old burst on to the international stage as a teenage athlete with victory at Rio, and backed it up with a dominant display at Tokyo.</p>

            <p>She will once again be among the leading names after setting a national record of 5.96m when claiming a silver at the world championships.</p>
        
            <p>Stedman will contest the men's 400m and long jump in the T36 category, and will hope to add to four medals won at two previous Paralympic appearances. As a 16-year-old, he claimed a pair of bronze medals in the 400m and 800m events before grabbing long jump silver and 400m bronze at Tokyo.</p>
