            <p>Analysis - "Keep politics out of sport."</p>
        
            <p>It's the war cry of the more 'traditional' footy fan, but there is no hiding from the fact that the two are closely linked and have been since the All Black's inception.</p>
        
            <p>TJ Perenara caused a serious stir during the haka in Sunday's final test of the year against Italy, and Perenara's final outing in black.</p>
        
            <p>The outspoken halfback called "Toitū te tiriti o Waitangi" as he led Ka Mate, again prompting rhetoric about players needing to just play the game.</p>
        
            <p>But whether it's a prime minister using the side to promote themselves, players calling out social injustice, or the side simply embroiled in geopolitical scandals, politics and sport are rarely far apart.</p>
