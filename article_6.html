            <p>Midfielder Ria Percival has announced her retirement from international football, ending an illustrious 18-year career with the Football Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>Percival played 166 times at senior level, more than any other female or male player in New Zealand football history, in a career that spanned four Olympic Games and five FIFA World Cups.</p>
        
            <p>Her final matches came during the pool phase of last year's World Cup co-hosted by New Zealand, having fought back from a serious knee injury suffered the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>The 34-year-old, who is on loan at English club Crystal Palace, said the decision to end her international career came with a "heavy heart".</p>
        
            <p>"It has been one of the most difficult decisions that I've had to make, and it's not been one that I've taken lightly, but I feel that it is the right time for me," Percival said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"As I look back, with many different emotions, and reflect on my time as a Fern, it's been the biggest honour and a pleasure to have represented New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I've worn the shirt with pride, courage, commitment, dedication and gave everything that I have for my country. I've learnt so much and grown both on and off the pitch over the years, becoming a leader, role model, and mentor, inspiring my team mates as well as the next generation."</p>

            <p>Percival's first taste of international football came as a 15-year-old, playing at the 2006 under-20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>She made her Football Ferns debut a year later, winning selection for the FIFA World Cup in China.</p>
        
            <p>After representing Auckland club Lynn-Avon United, Percival's long offshore professional career began in North America, before three stints at German clubs.</p>
        
            <p>After a season at West Ham, she moved to cross-town English Super League rivals Tottenham Hotspur in 2019, playing nearly 50 games there before being loaned to Crystal Palace this year.</p>
