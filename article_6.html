            <p>Australia's Harrison Crowe rediscovered some of his form from the end of 2024 to grab the outright lead after the opening round of the New Zealand Open golf tournament at Millbrook Resort.</p>
        
            <p>With nine birdies and an eagle, the Sydneysider shot a round of 9-under-par 62, his only mishap coming on the par-4 13th hole of the Remarkables course, one of two in use over the first two rounds, when his tee shot flew out of bounds, leading to a double-bogey.</p>
        
            <p>Crowe is still chasing a first big win as a professional, leads James Marchesani, who played the Coronet course, by a shot.</p>
        
            <p>The leading New Zealanders, Josh Geary and Michael Hendry, are tied for ninth at 5-under-par four shots from the lead, with Ben Campbell in a share of 23rd at 4-under.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely had a lot of things going my way today, and I think to shoot those rounds you have to," Crowe said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the putter going, so it was nice to keep the momentum going after that one mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"It's starting to feel like that (the end of 2024) again. It's been a bit of a slow start this year after a Christmas break, and it was nice to have a few things going my way today."</p>

            <p>In the morning groups which were greeted by almost still conditions, Geary brought the good form from his Vic Open win at 13th Beach Golf Links earlier this month to the Remarkables course which he toured in 5-under 66.</p>
        
            <p>The highlight of his day were three straight birdies from the sixth to the eighth.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been here enough. I know what to do if the weather stays calm," Geary said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've just got to keep your foot down and make a lot of birdies. I'd assume that's how it's going to go."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi Hendry made his way to 6-under late in the afternoon before slipping up with his first bogey of the day, at the par-4 17th on the Remarkables. The former champion was still content, however, with his start.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hitting it really well off so as long as I can keep that going, I shouldn't put myself in too much trouble and then hopefully it's just about making some putts," Hendry said.</p>
        
            <p>Defending champion Takahiro Hataji started with a 2-under-par 70.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Danny Lee, playing in the tournament for the first time as a professional, is four over par after the first round and in a tie for 147th.</p>
