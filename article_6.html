            <p>Awarding the title of New Zealand's fittest has just become a whole lot tougher with New Zealand CrossFit Nationals' biggest turnout ever.</p>
        
            <p>Record numbers of nearly 1900 athletes are competing across all divisions this year.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 1500 competed in teams of six at Hamilton's Mystery Creek in late October. Another 380 qualified for the pair and individual competition set to kick off on Saturday at Bay Park in Mount Maunganui.</p>
        
            <p>Director of New Zealand Nationals Michael Gillum said the competitions had become increasingly popular.</p>
        
            <p>"There hasn't been a year where [the competition] hasn't sold out."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand Nationals was always looking for more space because "there's never enough space for teams".</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the competitions saw just over 1600 athletes across all divisions - teams, pairs and individuals.</p>
        
            <p>Gillum said more people were taking part to not only test their fitness, but their overall skills and limits.</p>
        
            <p>"[The competitions] are a test of weightlifting, gymnastics, and mono structural conditioning like running, rowing, biking, skiing, swimming, anything like that. Like your base conditioning stuff as well as skills.</p>
        
            <p>"Unique to teams and pairs, the competition is about testing someone's or a team's ability to be a team."</p>
        
            <p>He said the high athlete numbers were also because the focus was on delivering something beyond just the contest itself.</p>
        
            <p>"The competition is the medium in which we deliver the event, but the actual thing that people are coming for is the experience," he said.</p>

            <p>The 2024 team athlete field faced a shared marathon run in gruelling thunderstorms, a range of gymnastics workouts and some heavy weights.</p>
        
            <p>A memorable max lift included 18-year-old Gabbi Napper's 125kg split jerk, her personal best.</p>
        
            <p>CrossFit Mecca took out the title of New Zealand's fittest gym, followed by CrossFit Nas and Mount CrossFit. An honourable mention also went to Grassroots Club and CrossFit Kia Maia.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike the teams, all pair and individual athletes completed an online qualifier to solidify their spot on the floor.</p>
        
            <p>The two-day competition will see the athletes complete nine workouts in search for the fittest same sex pairs and individual athletes in the country.</p>
        
            <p>The first event is set to start at 8am.</p>
