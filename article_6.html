            <p>Arsenal missed the chance to end the year on top of the Premier League after falling to a 2-1 loss to Fulham, while Tottenham are up to fifth following a 3-1 win over Bournemouth.</p>
        
            <p>Bukayo Saka's early goal was cancelled out by Raul Jimenez before Bobby De Cordova-Reid's second-half strike ended the hosts' three-match losing streak.</p>
        
            <p>Fulham rose to 13th in the table with 24 points after 20 matches. Arsenal, who were top of the table on Christmas day, have ended the year fourth after going winless in their last three matches.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors started the match on the front-foot and found the breakthrough just five minutes in as Gabriel Martinelli ran into the box from the left and went for the finish.</p>
        
            <p>Fulham keeper Bernd Leno's diving parry denied Martinelli, but the ball went to Saka who finished from close range.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts were unshaken by the early setback and continued to build pressure, which paid off near the half-hour mark as Tom Cairney's cross from the left flank was met by Jimenez for a swift finish, restoring parity.</p>
        
            <p>Marco Silva's side maintained the momentum into the second half and took the lead near the hour-mark, when Andreas Pereira's corner created a scramble in the Arsenal box before De Cordova-Reid fired it into the net.</p>
        
            <p>Fulham almost scored their third when Pereira's late free kick rattled the crossbar.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very good reaction after the first goal. The way we beat their pressure and began to play our way," Silva told BBC Sport.</p>
        
            <p>The result marked the first time Fulham won a game after going a goal down in 24 league matches.</p>
        
            <p>"Really the best way to finish 2023, definitely. Our ambition was to finish on a high and react from the last two games," Silva added.</p>
        
            <p>"I really believe we deserve it. Over the 95 minutes we deserved it more."</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said it was "a sad day" to see his team end the year on two straight losses.</p>
        
            <p>"Today was our worst game of the season. The pace, the purpose we have in attack, defensively we were second best," he told BBC Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Not enough purpose speed or threat. We were sloppy with the ball. It wasn't good enough. We didn't deserve to win," Arteta added. (Reporting by Chiranjit Ojha in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar)</p>
        
            <p>Tottenham end Bournemouth hot streak </p>
        
            <p>Tottenham Hotspur brought resurgent Bournemouth down to earth with a flattering 3-1 Premier League victory thanks to goals by Pape Matar Sarr, Son Heung-min and Richarlison on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Bournemouth were unbeaten in seven league games with six wins in that sequence and they will wonder how that run was not extended as they dominated at times in rain-hit north London.</p>
        
            <p>Sarr gave Tottenham an early lead before he went off injured while captain Son and Richarlison scored late on after the home side had ridden their luck against a slick visiting side.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Scott replied for Bournemouth in the 84th minute but it was scant consolation for Andoni Iraola's side.</p>
        
            <p>Unconvincing as it was, Tottenham's win sent them into the New Year in the thick of the battle for a top-four finish.</p>
        
            <p>They have 39 points from 20 games, one behind fourth-placed Arsenal and only three adrift of leaders Liverpool.</p>
