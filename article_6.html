            <p>The Warriors ended 2023 with the bandwagon overflowing with fans and their supporter's catchcry 'Up the Wah's' was being shouted around the globe.</p>
        
            <p>They now kick off their highly anticipated 2024 campaign tonight against the Cronulla Sharks at a sold out Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Needless to say, hopes are high, so could it finally be the Warriors year?</p>
        
            <p>It was a stellar 2023 for the franchise who fell agonisingly short of a third NRL grand final appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Tohu Harris has felt the momentum carry into the pre season.</p>
        
            <p>"The excitement around New Zealand and not just Auckland, has been outstanding and there's there's always more room on the bandwagon," Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said they are not resting on their laurels.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to start fresh. It's a new squad, a new year. Hopefully we're progressing further than we did last year but we've got to start again and earn the right to play at the end of the year."</p>
        
            <p>The long awaited Warriors season gets underway at 8o'clock tonight and coach Andrew Webster has been like a kid in a candy shop ahead of kick off.</p>

            <p>"I came into work today bouncing. I'm excited, it's getting closer. I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying the boys. The banter is high, the work ethic is high, there's a buzz around the whole country. Why wouldn't you like it?"</p>
        
            <p>One of the key off-season signings for the franchise was that of Dally M Medal winner Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, who has returned to league from union.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in a different era as well. I'm a lot older and I'm playing a new position so I'm trying to adjust to that and adjust to the training load so there's quite a bit to learn."</p>
        
            <p>The veteran fullback is determined not to let standards slip.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys don't want to let these fans down. They're all turning up. They're selling out jerseys, selling out the stadium so we need to make sure that we turn up and put on a show for them."</p>

            <p>Another new face is Australian Kurt Capewell, who is already assimilating to the kiwi culture.</p>
        
            <p>He says he is looking forward to not being the target of the Warriors parochial fanbase.</p>
        
            <p>"Having to travel over here it's always cold, windy, quite wet. So it's not the best trip and to have that home field advantage and, and to have all our fans showing up here and really get behind us. It's gonna give us an extra little boost, that's for sure."</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Johnson was one of the stars of 2023, and understands teams will be gunning for them.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're gonna have more of a target, and rightly so. We played some good footy and we won some games. But we have methods and ways we deal with things. There is always going to be a lot of hype around this club. So whether people want to continue to pump that ties up it's really doesn't matter because we know what we need to do to win games and our focus will remain on that."</p>
        
            <p>However, Johnson is confident they can replicate last year's form.</p>
        
            <p>"If we bring what we know we can and we do it at a high level, then doesn't really matter who's standing across from us, we'll be okay."</p>

            <p>Webster says until they string together some winning performances, the hype behind them means nothing.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't played a game yet and that's our priority. I think the fans and all New Zealand just want us to play well and make them proud again."</p>
        
            <p>He maintains he will continue his season long superstition of not checking the NRL ladder.</p>
        
            <p>"I have checked it. We haven't won a game yet. So a bit upset about that. So I'll stop checking it see because you check it you get bad news."</p>
        
            <p>Webster says despite the burden of expectation he is not telling his players to ignore the noise.</p>
        
            <p>"Embrace it. There's expectation because you've done something well. We worry about the opinions inside the four walls meaning how we make each other accountable and and then off the back of that we're just so proud and excited about our fans. They get to come along for the ride. They turn up every week, they cheer they give us energy."</p>
        
            <p>Warriors CEO Cameron George says fans will be treated to the best show in town.</p>
        
            <p>"Plenty of action on and off the field. if you're a fan, you're gonna get a great deal of footy in front of you and you're going to have a lot of fun in the grandstands with your mates. We encourage everyone to come along, it's a safe and happy environment."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors and Sharks kick off at 8pm this evening.</p>
