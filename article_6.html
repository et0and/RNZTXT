            <p>A select group of victorious Wellington Phoenix women are jumping on a plane to South America for international duties.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand play FIFA Women's World Cup quarter-finalists Colombia in Bogota in 10 days time.</p>
        
            <p>In the upcoming international window, 15 matches will take place around the globe as Australia's Matildas head to Vancouver to take on Canada, and China face the United States women in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix players Michaela Foster, Macey Fraser, Mackenzie Barry, Brianna Edwards and Kate Taylor are all named in the young New Zealand side for the upcoming visit to South America's third largest city.</p>
        
            <p>For the Phoenix players, they can take plenty of confidence from their stellar A-League season so far which has seen the side transform from cellar dwellers to championship contenders.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington side sits third on the A-league ladder, a point behind Perth Glory and Melbourne City, heading into the international break.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix recorded their fourth win of the new campaign in Auckland last night coming from a goal down at halftime to beat the highly rated Perth Glory 2-1.</p>
        
            <p>American winger Hope Breslin drew the Wellington side level early in the second half before Chloe Knott scored what was ultimately the match-winner in the 61st minute.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big result for us to beat Perth who were obviously flying high," Phoenix head coach Paul Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw a different side of the performance in the last 20-30 minutes where we were strong, we were resolute, we didn't really give away any big chances and we defended really well and sometimes you need that."</p>

            <p>For the Football Ferns coach Jitka Klimkova, the upcoming fixture is an opportunity to cap an exhilarating 2023 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to wrap up 2023 with two great games ahead of another big year coming up in 2024," Jitka Klimkova said.</p>
        
            <p>"2023 has been a ground-breaking year. After a period of reflection and opportunities to learn from the past cycle, we now need to focus on the future and building a team to look forward to the Olympic qualifiers next year and ultimately the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027.</p>
        
            <p>"Colombia are a strong team with some outstanding individuals, who had a great FIFA Women's World Cup, so they will be a really good challenge for us, which is exactly what we want."</p>
        
            <p>Ali Riley, with 159 caps, will captain the New Zealand side.</p>
