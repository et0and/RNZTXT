            <p>Analysis - When Luis Figo infamously switched Barcelona for bitter rivals Real Madrid in 2010, the animosity incited one fan to hurl a dismembered pig head at the Portuguese superstar. Former Wellington Phoenix goalkeeper Alex Paulsen can expect a much tamer reception when he returns to Sky Stadium as an Auckland FC player on November 2. That said, his loan move just two months after leaving New Zealand's other professional football club, has certainly poured some extra fire onto this burgeoning domestic rivalry.</p>
        
            <p>So who are the winners and losers of this Kiwi transfer saga?</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC</p>
        
            <p>The obvious victors in all this. A huge transfer coup for the A-League's newest team sees them bring in the competition's outstanding stopper from last season.</p>
        
            <p>With the experienced Tommy Smith and title-winning Dan Hall in front of him, not to mention experienced Japan full-back Hiroki Sakai, the newbies have a formidable defensive unit under construction.</p>

            <p>The Paulsen deal essentially means the end for the so-called 'Caceres Clause'. For the uninitiated, A-League teams cannot buy and sell from each other. In 2016, this rule was circumvented when Premier League giants Manchester City signed Anthony Caceres from Central Coast Mariners, before immediately loaning him to their sister club, Melbourne City.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Caceres Clause' was therefore introduced to prevent repeat instances but the league's clubs, including the Phoenix, have backed amending this clause to make deals like Paulsen's possible.</p>
        
            <p>This is still pending Football Australia's approval. However, it is widely believed to be just a matter of time, paving the way for clubs tied to multi-ownership models, such as Melbourne City and now Auckland, with a huge potential advantage in the transfer market.</p>
        
            <p>All Whites</p>
        
            <p>It's a big season ahead for Darren Bazeley's national team, with World Cup qualifiers incoming. While Max Crocombe appears to currently have the number one spot for New Zealand, having Paulsen playing regularly, and more importantly, locally, will be seen as a big boost for the near future.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Paulsen</p>
        
            <p>One thing Paulsen was never assured of when leaving the Phoenix for the bright lights of the Premier League was regular football. That is no longer the case, as he is surely a shoo-in to start for Steve Corica's side this season.</p>
        
            <p>To do so in his hometown, for an exciting new club, only adds to the special nature of this deal.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Paulsen</p>
        
            <p>You can spin this two ways for the 22-year-old with the negatives potentially outweighing the positives.</p>
        
            <p>Paulsen has already proven himself at this level and was ready to level up. This could be a sideways or even backward step.</p>

            <p>For whatever reason, other potential temporary moves did not eventuate, including a mooted switch to another Foley-affiliated club in the form of Scottish top-flight side Hibernian.</p>
        
            <p>A deal like that makes sense. A definite but gradual step up in quality, intensity and scrutiny that helps prepare Paulsen for the rigours of the English game. A return to the league he's already proven himself in, not to mention with a start-up team in a shortened league format compared to Europe? That does not seem to be in his new parent club's long-term best interests.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Woud</p>
        
            <p>Paulsen's fellow Aucklander was probably excited to finally be getting regular game time when he was announced as one of the first clutch of new players to join the upstart club.</p>
        
            <p>But after spending the past two years playing second fiddle at Japan's Kyoto Sanga he now has the unenviable task of usurping the A-League's reigning best keeper to avoid a repeat in his own backyard.</p>
        
            <p>The A-League and Football Australia</p>
        
            <p>While it seems Paulsen's deal will eventually be ratified the fact he is technically in limbo at present is a shocker for the powers at be.</p>
        
            <p>A change to the 'Caceres Clause' has officially been on the drawing board since May but has not yet been ratified, leaving us in this messy situation - doing neither players nor clubs any favours.</p>
        
            <p>Hopefully, a swift solution is inbound.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix have handled this situation with absolute class, with general manager David Dome publicly wishing their former player all the best.</p>
        
            <p>However, from a purely footballing perspective, this development will hurt last year's fallen semi-finalists - who have now seen three of their past four first-team stoppers (Oli Sail to Perth Glory and Filip Kurto to Macarthur the others) end up at league rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Paulsen's exit was followed by that of his deputy Jack Duncan, leaving the Nix with no recognised first-team goalkeeper ahead of the new season.</p>
        
            <p>The pool of affordable trans-Tasman options has dwindled, leaving the Phoenix potentially hunting for an import goalkeeper. Director of football Shaun Gill has a tough task on his hands and, at this rate, they might have to haul Jacob Spoonley out of the commentary box.</p>
