            <p>A third quarter blitz of 18 goals ha helped the Central Pulse ease past the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic</p>
        
            <p>The Magic put up a brave fight until a 12-4 scoring run shut the gate on them at TSB Arena.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse are now two from two to kick off their ANZ Premiership campaign while the Magic are without a win.</p>
        
            <p>Though the Magic enjoyed a higher shooting percentage, 25 from 32 converted turnovers proved pivotal for the Pulse.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse defender Kelly Jackson said it was imperative that they did not take the foot off the gas.</p>
        
            <p>"We know from history with the Magic that you really have to grind them down and then we came out on top in the second half so really happy we were able to absorb that pressure."</p>
        
            <p>She said with star shooter Tiana Metuarau sidelined with injury, it offered the opportunity for some wider squad members to deliver.</p>
        
            <p>"We put some young blood out there which is great to see them step up and it shows we have some really good stock on the bench."</p>
        
            <p>Magic skipper Ameliaranne Ekenasio concedes a lack of consistency throughout the sixty minutes is costing them.</p>
        
            <p>"We are starting off really well. Have we got enough in the tank? I honestly think that we do. We are fit enough. train so hard, but maybe it's just that real top two inches, that real mongrel out there on court. Potentially we're shying away from really demanding the ball. So we'll just go away and continue to work on that."</p>

            <p>She said players were not executing individual roles.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we just have to demand and expect more of each other in those situations. We lost a bit of discipline across the board, me included for that whole game. It's a bit of a shame. It's frustrating."</p>
        
            <p>It was all Magic early on as Saviour Tui put her side three goals ahead after the opening three minutes</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse finally got on the board and soon tied things up before edging in front after five minutes of the opening quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse goal defence Parris Mason was sent off for two minutes for dangerous play while a beautiful long shot from Tui in the final minute and an uncharacteristic Ekensio miss gave the Magic a 12-11 lead.</p>
        
            <p>Tui carried on in second sinking the first as the Pulse clawed back to a</p>
        
            <p>15-all ledger.</p>
        
            <p>Locked up at 22-all in the final minute, back to back goals for the Pulse courtesy of substitute Khiarna Williams pushed them ahead at the break by 24-22.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse surged out in the second, a 12-4 scoring run through Amelia Walmsley and Williams inside the circle.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts were looking conformable after three quarter with a nine-goal lead at 42-33 ahead of the last fifteen.</p>
        
            <p>It was a strong start to final fifteen for Magic, as they managed to close the gap to seven before the Pulse brought up 50 with seven to play.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of crucial intercepts stifled any hope of a Magic miracle, as they slumped to a second consecutive loss to start their season.</p>
