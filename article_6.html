            <p>Bangladesh set New Zealand a daunting target of 332 on a turning track and then reduced them to 113/7 to close in on victory on day four of the opening test in Sylhet.</p>
        
            <p>Batting last in a spinner-dominated contest, New Zealand had to play out of their skin but a top order meltdown has left them on the brink of defeat in the opening match of the two-test series.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell provided some resistance with the bat, and was on 44 when bad light stopped play with Ish Sodhi on seven at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam claimed 4-40, which ensure Bangladesh did not really miss the bowling of regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who is among several frontline players ruled out of the series with injury.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, resuming on 212-3, Bangladesh were all out for 338 in the second session of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Mushfiqur Rahim (67) completed his 50, while Mehidy Hasan Miraz made an unbeaten 50 to stretch Bangladesh's lead.</p>
        
            <p>For New Zealand, Ajaj Patel claimed four wickets though he went above four runs per over.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were rattled early in their second innings with Shoriful Islam, the lone seamer in Bangladesh's spin-heavy attack, dismissing Tom Latham in the first over before the spinners took over.</p>
        
            <p>Taijul struck a body blow when he trapped Kane Williamson lbw for 11 to put Bangladesh in the box seat.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson offered a forward defensive shot but was beaten by the ball which rapped him low on his front pad.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson opted to review the decision that had gone against him but could not get it reversed.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand slumped to 60-5 after Taijul dismissed Devon Conway and Tom Blundell in quick succession. but Mitchell's obduracy stretched the game to its final day.</p>
