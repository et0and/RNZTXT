            <p>American tennis firebrand Danielle Collins delivered on her pledge to take a vacation in the Bahamas with her Australian Open prize money in a final shot at fans who booed her at the Grand Slam.</p>
        
            <p>The world number 12 was given a hostile reception as she knocked out home favourite Destanee Aiava in the second round at Melbourne Park and responded by saying the hecklers were funding her next holiday.</p>
        
            <p>Collins posted video on social media on Sunday showing her enjoying a "five star vacay" at a Bahamas resort with friends.</p>
        
            <p>The video finishes with her slapping her backside after winning a point while playing pickleball.</p>
        
            <p>Collins riled up the Melbourne Park crowd by slapping her backside during her win over Aiava.</p>
        
            <p>"Every person that's bought a ticket to come out here and heckle me or do what they do, it's all going towards the Danielle Collins Fund," she later told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, bring it on. I love it. Me and my group of girlfriends love a five-star vacation."</p>
        
            <p>Collins, the 2022 Australian Open runner-up to local hero Ash Barty, was also jeered during her third round defeat to compatriot and eventual winner Madison Keys.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old said after the match she did not care what the fans thought and that people needed to lighten up a bit.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest thing is nobody got hurt. Maybe some feelings got hurt or things were taken personally. They probably shouldn't have been," said Collins, who earned $320,000 for her run to the third round in Australia.</p>
