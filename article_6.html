            <p>The business end of Super Rugby Pacific is just around the corner, but there's still plenty of opportunity for teams to make a move due to the much-debated playoff system. Yes, eight teams are a lot but it probably is worth remembering that it was primarily conceived to maximise broadcast revenue post Covid by adding in an extra weekend of rugby. This weekend sees some crucial matches for the fortunes of teams trying to scrape into that eight, while there's an NZ derby at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm Friday 17 May</p>
        
            <p>Sky Stadium, Wellington</p>

            <p>Get in, get the job done, get out. That's the assignment for a Canes team that is fully capable of getting a bonus point win here and staying in touch with the Blues at the top of the table. Clark Laidlaw has rotated his team but will be wary of the trouble that Moana caused the Chiefs in the first half of their game last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Harry Godfrey, 14 Daniel Sinkinson, 13 Bailyn Sullivan, 12 Peter Umaga-Jensen, 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Aidan Morgan, 9 Richard Judd, 8 Devan Flanders, 7 Du'Plessis Kirifi, 6 Brad Shields (c), 5 Ben Grant, 4 Justin Sangster, 3 Siale Lauaki, 2 Raymond Tuputupu, 1 Pouri Rakete-Stones</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 James O'Reilly, 17 Xavier Numia, 18 Pasilio Tosi, 19 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 20 Peter Lakai, 21 Jordi Viljoen, 22 Riley Higgins, 23 Salesi Rayasi</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Fine Inisi, 13 Henry Taefu, 12 Julian Savea, 11 Neria Fomai, 10 William Havili, 9 Jonathan Taumateine, 8 Lotu Inisi, 7 Sione Havili Talitui (c), 6 Jacob Norris, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Tom Savage, 3 Sione Mafileo, 2 Samiuela Moli, 1 Abraham Pole</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Sama Malolo, 17 Tevita Langi, 18 Sekope Kepu, 19 Ola Tauelangi, 20 Alamanda Motuga, 21 Aisea Halo, 22 Christian Lealiifano, 23 Anzelo Tuitavuki</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 9:35pm Friday 17 May</p>

            <p>Same assignment for the Chiefs, who can't fly under the radar for much longer as they're now safely ensconced in the top four. The Rebels have been back in the news this week regarding whether they'll even exist next year and are capable of putting up a stern challenge at home, plus probably only need one more win to secure a play-off spot.</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Jake Strachan, 14 Lachie Anderson, 13 Filipo Daugunu, 12 Nick Jooste, 11 Darby Lancaster, 10 Carter Gordon, 9 Ryan Louwrens, 8 VaioliniI Ekuasi, 7 Brad Wilkin, 6 Josh Kemeny, 5 Josh Canham, 4 Tuaina Taii Tualima, 3 Sam Talakai (c), 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 Isaac Kailea</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ethan Dobbins, 17 Matt Gibbon, 18 Pone Fa'amausili, 19 Angelo Smith, 20 Maciu Nabolakasi, 21 Rob Leota, 22 Jack Maunder, 23 Glen Vaihu</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Shaun Stevenson, 14 Emoni Narawa, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 12 Quinn Tupaea, 11 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Cortez Ratima, 8 Luke Jacobson (c), 7 Kaylum Boshier, 6 Simon Parker, 5 Tupou Vaa'i, 4 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 3 George Dyer, 2 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 1 Aidan Ross</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Bradley Slater, 17 Jared Proffit, 18 Reuben O'Neill, 19 Naitoa Ah Kuoi, 20 Wallace Sititi, 21 Xavier Roe, 22 Josh Ioane, 23 Rameka Poihipi</p>

            <p>Here's a danger match for the Reds, who have been pressing hard for a top four spot and would already be there had it not been for a couple of disappointing losses. The Drua have been tough in Lautoka but were comfortably beaten in their only match in Suva so far this season, but have plenty to play for here too as they can go a long way to locking in a play-off spot.</p>
        
            <p>Fijian Drua: 15 Ilaisa Droasese, 14 Selestino Ravutaumada, 13 Iosefo Masi, 12 Waqa Nalaga, 11 Epeli Momo, 10 Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 9 Simione Kuruvoli, 8 Elia Canakaivata, 7 Kitione Salawa, 6 Etonia Waqa, 5 Isoa Nasilasila, 4 Mesake Vocevoce, 3 Mesake Doge, 2 Tevita Ikanivere (c), 1 Jone Koroiduadua</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Mesulame Dolokoto, 17 Emosi Tuqiri, 18 Samu Tawake, 19 Te Ahiwaru Cirikidaveta, 20 Vilive Miramira, 21 Peni Matawalu, 22 Kemu Valetini, 23 Taniela Rakuro</p>
        
            <p>Reds: 15 Jock Campbell, 14 Suliasi Vunivalu, 13 Taj Annan, 12 Hunter Paisami, 11 Floyd Aubrey, 10 Lawson Creighton, 9 Tate McDermott (cc), 8 John Bryant, 7 Fraser McReight, 6 Liam Wright (cc), 5 Cormac Daly, 4 Ryan Smith, 3 Zane Nonggorr, 2 Josh Nasser, 1 Peni Ravai</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 George Blake, 17 Sef Fa'agase, 18 Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, 19 Seru Uru, 20 Joe Brial, 21 Kalani Thomas, 22 James O'Connor, 23 Tim Ryan</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 4:35pm Saturday 17 May</p>

            <p>It's unfair to say that the Crusaders hit rock bottom in their loss to the Highlanders, because they actually played pretty well (by this season's standards anyway) but the fact remains that it has all but doomed their play-off hopes. The one ray of hope is their very impressive record in Canberra, having not lost there in 20 years, but clearly history hasn't counted for much for the Crusaders lately.</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies: 15 Tom Wright, 14 Andy Muirhead, 13 Len Ikitau, 12 Tamati Tua, 11 Ollie Sapsford, 10 Noah Lolesio, 9 Ryan Lonergan, 8 Rob Valetini, 7 Jahrome Brown, 6 Nick Frost, 5 Cadeyrn Neville, 4 Darcy Swain, 3 Allan Alaalatoa (c), 2 Connal McInerney, 1 James Slipper</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Liam Bowron, 17 Rhys van Nek, 18 Sosefo Kautai, 19 Tom Hooper, 20 Luke Reimer, 21 Harrison Goddard, 22 Jack Debreczeni, 23 Ben O'Donnell</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: 15 Johnny McNicholl, 14 Chay Fihaki, 13 Jone Rova, 12 David Havili, 11 Sevu Reece, 10 Fergus Burke, 9 Noah Hotham, 8 Christian Lio-Willie, 7 Tom Christie, 6 Cullen Grace, 5 Quinten Strange, 4 Antonio Shalfoon, 3 Fletcher Newell, 2 Codie Taylor (c), 1 Joe Moody</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 George Bell, 17 George Bower, 18 Seb Calder, 19 Jamie Hannah, 20 Dom Gardiner, 21 Mitch Drummond, 22 Rivez Reihana, 23 Macca Springer</p>

            <p>The Blues have seen fit to rotate their side a bit but they will need to still be able to hit the high gears if the Highlanders can play the way they did last weekend. It's probably a bit early to anoint Cam Millar as the answer to their problems, but he certainly controlled the Highlanders backline well in their memorable win.</p>
        
            <p>Opposite him is another man who certainly put his hand up last weekend too, Harry Plummer's goal kicking and general play was ultimately the difference in the Blues' win over the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Blues: 15 Cole Forbes, 14 AJ Lam, 13 Bryce Heem, 12 Corey Evans, 11 Caleb Clarke, 10 Harry Plummer, 9 Sam Nock, 8 Akira Ioane, 7 Dalton Papali'i (c), 6 Adrian Choat, 5 Sam Darry, 4 Laghlan McWhannell, 3 Marcel Renata, 2 Kurt Eklund, 1 Ofa Tu'ungafasi</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Soane Vikena, 17 Mason Tupaea, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Josh Beehre, 20 Cameron Suafoa, 21 Taufa Funaki, 22 Stephen Perofeta, 23 Kade Banks</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 15 Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, 14 Timoci Tavatavanawai, 13 Tanielu Tele'a, 12 Jake Te Hiwi, 11 Mart√≠n Bogado, 10 Cam Millar, 9 Folau Fakatava, 8 Nikora Broughton, 7 Sean Withy, 6 Oliver Haig, 5 Fabian Holland, 4 Mitch Dunshea, 3 Jermaine Ainsley, 2 Henry Bell, 1 Ethan de Groot (c)</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Jack Taylor, 17 Ayden Johnstone, 18 Saula Ma'u, 19 Will Tucker, 20 Will Stodart, 21 James Arscott, 22 Sam Gilbert, 23 Finn Hurley</p>

            <p>Definite 'who cares' factor about this one, even by Tahs fans because the only thing they're playing for is avoiding the wooden spoon. However, the Force are a shot at making the play-offs and will enjoy rubbing the faces of the Sydneysiders in it after a long journey to Western Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Force: 15 Kurtley Beale, 14 George Poolman, 13 Bayley Kuenzle, 12 Hamish Stewart, 11 Chase Tiatia, 10 Ben Donaldson, 9 Nic White, 8 Reed Prinsep, 7 Carlo Tizzano, 6 Will Harris, 5 Izack Rodda, 4 Jeremy Williams (c), 3 Santiago Medrano, 2 Tom Horton, 1 Harry Hoopert</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Feleti Kaitu'u, 17 Marley Pearce, 18 Tiaan Tauakipulu, 19 Lopeti Faifua, 20 Michael Wells, 21 Issak Fines-Leleiwasa, 22 Sam Spink, 23 Henry O'Donnell</p>
        
            <p>Waratahs: 15 Mark Nawaqanitawase, 14 Triston Reilly, 13 Joey Walton, 12 Lalakai Foketi, 11 Dylan Pietsch, 10 Will Harrison, 9 Jake Gordon (c), 8 Jed Holloway, 7 Charlie Gamble, 6 Lachlan Swinton, 5 Miles Amatosero, 4 Fergus Lee-Warner, 3 Enrique Peiretto, 2 Jay Fonokalafi, 1 Lewis Ponini</p>
