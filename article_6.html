            <p>Rugby league's Pacific Championships is returning and New Zealand will host three tests starting in October.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby League has announced the men's and women's international test competition will return in October and November in partnership with the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>Two match days will take place in New Zealand, with Ōtautahi Christchurch's Apollo Projects Stadium set to host a double header between the Kiwis, Kiwi Ferns, and rival Australian Kangaroos men's and Jillaroos women's teams on 27 October.</p>
        
            <p>This will mark the Kiwis' return to Christchurch for the first time in five years and the Kiwi Ferns' first South Island Test since 1998.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will then face Tonga at Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland's Go Media Stadium at Mt Smart on 2 November.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a very special occasion to partner with Ōtautahi Christchurch and work with Canterbury Rugby League to take the Pacific Championships to our fans in the South Island for the first international fixtures there in five years," NZRL chief executive Greg Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're excited to work with Tonga to bring their rugby league heroes back to play in front of their proud community in Auckland, with the support of Tātaki Auckland Unlimited making this possible.</p>
        
            <p>"International rugby league in Aotearoa creates celebrations of culture and passion that captures the hearts and minds of all sports fans, the Tests here will be unmissable."</p>
        
            <p>Both teams head into this year's international season on a high, having convincingly defeated rivals Australia in their final matches in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The games saw the Kiwis lift the Pacific Championship's Pacific Cup in its inaugural year, with the Kiwi Ferns ending Australia's seven-year streak of wins against them.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 Pacific Championships is a two-tiered competition, with men's and women's teams from across the Pacific competing for the Pacific Cup and the Pacific Bowl.</p>
        
            <p>The grand finals will be played in Sydney, Australia on 10 November.</p>
