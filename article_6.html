            <p>Dame Noeline Taurua has been named as the Silver Ferns head coach for a second time.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement was made just after 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>But it was largely foreshadowed by RNZ's netball reporter Bridget Tunnicliffe who revealed on Thursday that Taurua had once again got the job.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline answered an SOS to take over the Silver Ferns in 2018 and took them to a remarkable World Cup victory in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>But things have not gone so well since. The Ferns are currently ranked second in the world but had their worst ever World Cup finish last year when they finished fourth in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>In February Netball New Zealand said it would advertise the job, with Dame Noeline's contract coming to an end and the popular coach welcomed the process, saying she would reapply.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Netball New Zealand said she has been reappointed for two years.</p>

            <p>NNZ chief executive Jennie Wyllie said Dame Noeline had shown she was the right person for the Silver Ferns' job.</p>
        
            <p>"Her coaching record stands out - she has a genuine passion for our players along with the ability and desire to both evolve as a coach, and add something significant to the Silver Ferns' legacy."</p>
        
            <p>Taurua was quoted in the statement as saying she was "excited" to go through the interview process.</p>
        
            <p>"I have competed for the job. I have reset the dial. I am rejuvenated and can't wait to build upon the current foundation towards an era of Silver Ferns' excellence," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline told Checkpoint she had not had the chance to celebrate yet because she has been suffering from a cold.</p>
        
            <p>She said the selection process was a chance to ask herself why she wanted to continue in the job, what else could she offer and could she do better.</p>
        
            <p>"And going through the process actually rejuvenated me, got me excited and I came out the other end thinking I really want to. I want to be part of the team for the next World Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline said while the squad had established "a great foundation", she was fully aware of what needed to be worked on to gain some improvements.</p>
