        <p>

            <p>Another year of Super Rugby rolls around and with it plenty of questions surrounding future stars, returning veterans and players with a point to prove.</p>
        
            <p>Here are players to keep an eye on in 2025:</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>1. Che Clark, Blues. </p>
        
            <p>Position- Loose Forward. </p>
        
            <p>Clark was an omission for the All Black sevens squad for Paris, and has since shifted his sights to another black jersey, this time in the 15-man code.</p>
        
            <p>A new face on the roster for the defending champions, Clark idolised Jerome Kaino as a kid, the man who's position he hopes to make his own this season. Possessing plenty of silky skills as well as size and power, Clark has all the weapons to step up in the wake of Akira Ioane's departure.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention- Payton Spencer. Another All Black Sevens product, and highly touted young prospect, Spencer could soon be emulating father Carlos and pulling the reins at Eden Park once again. Having guided Hamilton Boys to a world title in 2022, and making his international sevens debut in 2023, Spencer is already well accustomed to the big stage.</p>

            <p>2. Samisoni Taukie'aho, Chiefs. </p>
        
            <p>Position- Hooker.</p>
        
            <p>The forgotten man of New Zealand rugby. Taukie'aho stormed onto the scene in 2021 and for a while usurped both Codie Taylor and Dane Coles as the country's preferred hooker. However, a nasty calf injury sustained in last year's Super Rugby semifinal has sidelined him and he will miss the opening weeks of the 2025 competition. The hulking hooker will be hungry to restake his claim upon his return.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Leroy Carter.</p>
        
            <p>While team success has fluctuated of late, there is no shortage of stars emerging from the All Blacks Sevens side. Carter is another to have made the hop to 15s and immediately lit up the NPC on the wing for Bay of Plenty. With searing speed and a nose for the tryline, Carter gives the Chiefs backline stocks a needed boost with Shaun Stevenson missing a large chunk of the season.</p>

            <p>3. Riley Higgins, Hurricanes. </p>
        
            <p>Position- Second five. </p>
        
            <p>Higgins should see plenty of opportunity in the wake of Jordie Barrett's sabbatical. The stylish midfielder conjures comparisons with the legendary Conrad Smith for his astute ability to read a situation. A strong ball carrier, deft offloader and tidy defender, Higgin's all-round game will bring great stability to the Hurricanes midfield alongside Billy Proctor.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Fehi Fineanganofo. Also from the sevens conveyor belt, Fineanganofo has already shown in last year's NPC how damaging he can be.</p>
        
            <p>Can a breakthrough star on the sevens scene in 2024 bring the fireworks to 15s?</p>

            <p>4. Ioane Moananu, Crusaders. </p>
        
            <p>Position- Hooker. </p>
        
            <p>With Codie Taylor's career in its twilight stage, Moananu and George Bell will be locked in a fierce battle to claim the coveted spot when the legend finally hangs up his boots. Moananu draws comparisons to a young Keven Mealamu due to his strong ball running while being solid in his core hooking roles.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Macca Springer.The Tasman flier is looking more assured in Super Rugby with every cap and with a deadly combination of speed, skill and strength, he could be knocking on the door for a starting spot again in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>5. T.K Howden, Highlanders. </p>
        
            <p>Position- Loose forward. </p>
        
            <p>Caught in a logjam of quality loosies at the Hurricanes, Howden has taken his talents to the deep south. A Maori All Black and New Zealand U20 rep, the powerful and versatile flanker is out to resurrect his career in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Finn Hurley. The diminutive first five can be mesmeric on his day, with skills similar to that of Damian McKenzie though Hurley is yet to cement himself in the maestro role for the Highlanders.</p>

            <p>6. Jackson Garden-Bachop, Moana Pasifika. </p>
        
            <p>Position- First five. </p>
        
            <p>It's sure to be an emotional season for the new Moana playmaker, who lost his younger brother Connor in 2024 due to a medical event. Honouring a wish the brothers had to move to the club, Garden-Bachop's ability to pull the strings will bring much needed stability to Moana.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Solomon Alaimalo. After a brief stint in rugby league, the former Chief returns to Super Rugby and will be eager to make his mark in an exciting Highlanders' back three.</p>

            <p>Position- Number 8. </p>
        
            <p>Had his momentum stalled by injury in 2024 after a strong debut season in Canberra. Returns after shoulder surgery to remind Joe Schmidt of his talents.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Austin Anderson.</p>

            <p>Position- Midfield, wing. </p>
        
            <p>Can the league convert light it up in his new code after an impressive start with the Wallabies?</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Taniela Tupou.</p>

            <p>9. Tim Ryan, Reds. </p>
        
            <p>Position- Wing. </p>
        
            <p>The find of 2024, the wing known as the 'Junkyard Dog' will look to surpass his amazing try scoring feats in his sophmore season.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Massimo De Lutiis.</p>

            <p>Position- Centre</p>
        
            <p>With one test under his belt and over a decade since his Super debut, Proctor brings a wealth of experience to the Force midfield.</p>
        
            <p>Honourable mention-Atu Moli.</p>
