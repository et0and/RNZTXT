            <p>The Chiefs have already had their rematch clause from last year's final invoked, finding themselves back on hostile territory to start the new season. A Blues side arguably even stronger than last year awaits them on a sunny evening at Eden Park, one that lifted the title last year through a return to the old Auckland rugby tactic of simply being the biggest bullies in the competition. Well earned confidence or impending hubris? This tough first encounter will give us an indication.</p>

            <p>Harry Plummer at first five and Beauden Barrett at fullback is the big talking point, but it makes sense as Stephen Perofeta and Zarn Sullivan are both injured. There's more than adequate backup on the bench in Cole Forbes as well, while up front the only enforced change is Laghlan McWhannell starts at lock. One move that has gone under the radar is Taufa Funaki starting at halfback over Finlay Christie, however when Christie was injured last year Funaki really made the most of his chance.</p>

            <p>Like the Blues, the Chiefs have tinkered with the 10-15 axis but the reasons for doing so are a lot less clear. Josh Jacomb is a highly touted prospect but no one had predicting him getting a start over Damian McKenzie, which means both All Black first fives are playing fullback instead. Clayton McMillan has opted to save five test players for the second half, however it's still a very well-balanced backline with exciting All Blacks Sevens wing Leroy Carter set to make his debut.</p>
        
            <p>Blues 41 - 10 Chiefs</p>
        
            <p>The Blues and their fans didn't even need to wait till halftime to start celebrating this one, as it was one way traffic to the title in last year's final. The only real question was which one of the home side would be man of the match, also how on earth the Chiefs managed to save their worst performance for last. The only real positive for the Chiefs was that they now know exactly what not to do this time around.</p>
        
            <p>If there's one thing that the Blues thrive on, it's confidence and the knowledge that they've re-established Eden Park as their own fortress. They will look to land a few heavy shots early and let the Chiefs try and chase the game, which will likely be done from deep in the visitors' own half. If the Chiefs are to have a shot here, it will require the Jacomb experiment to go off without a hitch, because he will certainly have a target on him for the Blues' loose forwards.</p>
