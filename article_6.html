            <p>A rampant Wellington Phoenix women bagged four goals and three crucial points against Adelaide United on Wednesday afternoon to keep their A-League playoffs alive.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix are essentially playing knockout football and will take plenty of confidence from today's drubbing ahead of their final two must win games of the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Michaela Foster said it was a bit of a turnaround from their 4-2 defeat to Sydney on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"We just had to mentally switch off from that Sydney game, we had to win today and we did it in front of a really cool crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"To have a clean sheet and to put four goals in the nets is really exciting so we just have to do that again."</p>
        
            <p>Dominant from start to finish at Porirua Park, it took just three minutes before Claudia Jenkins was called on to repel a Phoenix onslaught, the hosts putting two shots on in quick succession.</p>
        
            <p>The breakthrough came in the 13th minute, Mariana Speckmaier netting her 10th goal of the season and her seventh in as many games.</p>
        
            <p>Macey Leigh Fraser forced a turnover inside the area following a defensive error from Adelaide, before linking with Speckmaier who thundered it to the right of Jenkins for the game's opener.</p>
        
            <p>The Venezuelan had another shot a few minutes later following a storming run down the left flank, but could only find the arms of Jenkins.</p>
        
            <p>Isabel Hodgson produced the only real chance for Adelaide in the 28th, a desperate dive from Rylee Foster able to tip it over the bar.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix continued to pepper Adelaide but were unable to net a second before the break.</p>
        
            <p>They would continue to dominate both territory and possession and would be rewarded after another 15 minutes of one-sided football.</p>
        
            <p>With Speckmaier having just made way for Michaela Robertson, the 21-year-old made an immediate impact with a surging run and pinpoint cross.</p>
        
            <p>Adelaide had the chance to clear it but could only find the feet of Katie Taylor who powered it home.</p>
        
            <p>Barely five minutes later, the Phoenix were in again, Isabel Cox setting off on a blistering break before Emma Main put it on a platter for Robertson to chip it into the back of the net.</p>
        
            <p>Just as the 90 minute mark rolled over, Foster put the icing on the cake, Robertson setting her captain up beautifully to seal an emphatic win.</p>
        
            <p>The win moves Wellington into eighth spot on the ladder, and they will meet Canberra away on Sunday afternoon.</p>
