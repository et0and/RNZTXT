            <p>People across Taiwan celebrated their men's doubles badminton gold medal victory over Chinese opponents that sparked scenes of jubilation while also exposing deeper geopolitical divides between the two sides.</p>
        
            <p>Wang Chi-Lin and Lee Yang of Taiwan, the reigning champions from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, won a three-game thriller against China's Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang.</p>
        
            <p>In cities across Taiwan, from Wang's home in the capital Taipei to southern Kaohsiung, and Lee's hometown on the island of Kinmen just off the coast of China, public screens were set up that lured thousands of fans.</p>
        
            <p>Many were eager to see the island win its first gold medal of the Paris Games against the sporting goliath of China that has already won 19 golds.</p>
        
            <p>Over 1000 spectators packed into the hall of Taipei's main train station, cheering and applauding each point won by the home duo, and falling silent at every point lost. Some waved Taiwan flags and chanted "Support Taiwan!"</p>

            <p>As with previous Olympics, Taiwan's international status has been thrust into the spotlight given its longstanding sovereignty disputes with China.</p>
        
            <p>The island competes as 'Chinese Taipei' rather than as Taiwan, to avoid objections from China, which claims the island as its own territory.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to beat China because of the political situation," said Irene Lai, a 27-year-old office worker who was watching with her boyfriend near the back of the packed Taipei station.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the final, some Taiwanese supporters arriving at the Paris venue were forced to rub off face paintings of the Taiwan flag, while others had banners confiscated as security staff enforced Olympic rules on political messaging.</p>
        
            <p>International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules prohibit flags or signs that include political messages or support countries that are not participating at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a chance to prove Taiwan's strength and to affirm our international status ... In every area China suppresses us, we can't even use our proper name at the Olympics and are called Chinese Taipei. So our players are helping us become recognised," Lai, the supporter, added.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, made a phone call to Wang's father.</p>
        
            <p>Lai thanked Wang and Lee for fighting hard to win back-to-back Olympics golds, both times against Chinese opponents.</p>
        
            <p>"They are the country's glory," said Lai, who has been dubbed a "separatist" by China and someone who has undermined peace between the two sides.</p>
        
            <p>Cheng Li-chun, deputy head of Taiwan's executive yuan, told the crowds at Taipei station that Wang and Lee's success showed Taiwan's spirit and has "let the world see Taiwan."</p>
        
            <p>"I hope one day we can bravely hold our flag in an international event without (it) being snatched away," said Danny Tsai, 36, a local Taipei resident in the crowd.</p>
