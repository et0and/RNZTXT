            <p>The RPA has represented England's players for 20 years in negotiations over fees and commercial deals with the Rugby Football Union (RFU).</p>
        
            <p>The RPA will continue to represent England men until this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The move follows plans by the RFU to introduce 25 hybrid contracts as part of the new Professional Game Partnership (PGP).</p>
        
            <p>The hybrid or "enhanced "contracts would give the RFU closer control over player workload.</p>
        
            <p>On announcing the forthcoming split, the RPA said it would continue to support rugby players away from the England men's side.</p>
        
            <p>The statement added: "A current Elite Player Squad men's representative has placed on record that the squad give the RPA their full backing in supporting players across the English game."</p>
        
            <p>The union will continue to represent England's women, although some of the Red Roses players are also represented by the Women's Rugby Association (WRA).</p>
        
            <p>The RPA represents more than 800 active male and female players, along with more than 400 former players, but the departure of England's men will represent a loss in income.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, England prop Ellis Genge announced plans to start a new union to gain better "support and legal advice" for elite players</p>
        
            <p>While his new union never emerged it was one of the first signals that not all the players were happy with the RPA relationship.</p>
        
            <p>No information on the new agency understood to represent the England men has yet been released.</p>
