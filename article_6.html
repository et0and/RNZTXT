        <h2>All Blacks: Robertson says returning Perenara is 'the koro we needed'</h2>
        <p>
The coach said experience counted for a lot when it came to picking his halfback.

            <p>Experience at halfback counts for a lot when it comes to picking the All Blacks first test side, says coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>In a tightly congested picture for the number nine jersey, 80-test veteran TJ Perenara has won the race to start against England this Saturday in Dunedin, with Robertson saying that he is "the koro we needed".</p>
        
            <p>"He picked himself, he's on form, he's a competitor. He's 80 test matches in."</p>
        
            <p>Finlay Christie will come off the bench, while Cortez Ratima will have to wait for his test debut. All three had solid cases for starting this test, however it does feel fitting for Perenara to get the nod given that it was against England that he suffered a serious knee injury back in November of 2022. That saw him miss a year and a half's worth of rugby, but once he returned to the Hurricanes Perenara has been in some of the best form of his career.</p>
        
            <p>Other tightly contested selection areas were blindside flanker and wing, with Samipeni Finau rewarded for a strong season with the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>"He's six foot five and 120 kilos. He's a great lineout jumper, can tackle and he's a test forward," Robertson said when asked about what he liked about Finau. The 25-year-old played one test last season and is the latest in a long line of players to try and make the number six jersey their own.</p>

            <p>Robertson admitted the wing selections were difficult, before opting for Sevu Reece and Mark Tele'a.</p>
        
            <p>The most interesting call was at fullback, where Stephen Perofeta was preferred over Beauden Barrett. Robertson said that Perofeta's performance in the Blues' Super Rugby Pacific final win was a factor.</p>
        
            <p>"It was all considered. Obviously, the experience of 123 tests matches counts for a lot, but (Perofeta) is great under the high ball, playing great footy and just a couple of weeks ago was playing in a test match level game. Beauden can play his part covering 10 and 15."</p>
        
            <p>There are no debutants in this All Black side, however Robertson said it wasn't a case of being risk-averse.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't call it safe, it's just the best team for this test. To set them up with combinations is really critical, and there's a lot of guys who have played a lot of tests. We've got a strong bench, a very experienced bench that'll be really critical."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson also revealed that World Cup winning All Black coach Sir Graham Henry had been in touch with a message of support.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Ted actually texted me last night saying all the best, his career started down here 20 years ago in the same place. It was a nice touch from him and he had a hell of career, didn't he?"</p>
