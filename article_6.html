            <p>New Zealand athlete Hamish Kerr has delivered another impressive performance three months out from the Paris Olympics, beating a strong high jump field at the Diamond League meet in Shanghai.</p>
        
            <p>Reigning world indoor champion Kerr cleared a best height of 2.31m to see off his nearest rival - an Olympic champion - by 2cm and put his name firmly in the equation to challenge for a medal at the Games.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr was 5cm below his personal best but maintained his consistent form of the last two years, which also featured a gold at the Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>With victory already wrapped up in Shanghai, the 27-year-old went on to fail in two attempts at 2.33m and another at 2.35.</p>
        
            <p>Runner up was Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim, who leapt to fame when he shared gold at the Tokyo Olympics with Italian Gianmarco Tamberi.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been working on a few technical things, so for that to work out tonight, I'm stoked," Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>"Just to be out there with these athletes who I really look up to like Barshim and to beat them, I still have to pinch myself.</p>
        
            <p>"This gives me a lot of confidence going into the season ahead."</p>
        
            <p>Two other Olympic-bound New Zealanders were in action.</p>
        
            <p>Javelin thrower Tori Peeters threw a season best of 59.11 to place seventh but was nearly 4m behind Japanese winner Haruka Kitaguchi.</p>
        
            <p>In the women's shot put, Maddie Wesche could not match her efforts at the opening Diamond League meet in Xiamen, placing sixth with a best distance of 19.23m.</p>

            <p>Armand Duplantis missed out on another pole vault world record but made a strong statement ahead of this year's Olympics by easing to victory.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old Olympic champion had broken his own world record with a stellar effort of 6.24 metres at Xiamen last week and wrapped up another victory in China with his best of 6.00m too good for the rest of the pack.</p>
        
            <p>With the bar raised to 6.25m, Duplantis was primed to break the mark for a ninth time but he was unable to clear the height in his three attempts, coming agonisingly close in his final chance to leave some fans disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>Akani Simbine powered to victory in the men's 100m race after making a good start and crossing the finish line in 10.01 seconds to deny reigning Diamond League champion Christian Coleman of the United States back-to-back victories this season.</p>
        
            <p>Coleman's pace dropped towards the end and he settled for silver with a time of 10.04 seconds, ahead of compatriot Fred Kerley who clocked in at 10.11 seconds for bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Briton Daryll Neita stunned pre-race favourite Sha'Carri Richardson in the women's 200m with a time of 22.62 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The Diamond League season continues in Doha on 10 May.</p>
