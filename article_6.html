            <p>The Black Caps got late breakthrough to have Australia 62-1 at lunch on day one of the first test in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand won the toss and sent Australia in to bat on a green pitch in overcast conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Some inaccurate bowling to start the day gave openers Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja an opportunity to capitalise.</p>
        
            <p>Smith edged a Matt Henry delivery which was caught by wicketkeeper Tom Blundell in the 25th over be out for 31.</p>
        
            <p>Khawaja survived an LBW review in the 21st over and New Zealand lost a review. He will resume after lunch on 28.</p>
        
            <p>In his first Test in New Zealand Marnus Labuschagne will be at the crease on 1 when the second session starts.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps bowled 15 overs of pace in the first hour of the day headed by captain Tim Southee who took the new ball alongside Henry.</p>
        
            <p>Newcomer Will O'Rourke and Scott Kuggeleijn in his second Test were the other bowlers used in New Zealand's all-out pace attack in the first session.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opted to include Kuggeleijn in the playing 11 in place of spinner Mitch Santner.</p>
        
            <p>Australia are playing with the same 11 that lost to the West Indies in Brisbane in January.</p>
        
            <p>This the first test series between the Black Caps and Australia in New Zealand since 2016.</p>
