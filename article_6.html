            <p>New Zealand snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has completed a stunning comeback from injury by winning the FIS Snowboard Slopestyle World Cup in Aspen.</p>
        
            <p>It's the third slopestyle World Cup win of her career and first since coming back from injury.</p>
        
            <p>Just last week Sadowski-Synnott landed the world's first triple cork in a women's slopestyle competition, which saw her take gold at the Aspen X Games.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old was the top qualifier going into today's finals in Colorado, and earned the advantage of dropping last into each of the two finals runs.</p>
        
            <p>She put down a solid first run that had her sitting in the top spot, but with a couple of bobbles on the rails, and some of the top riders on the start list today, there was no guarantee it would hold.</p>
        
            <p>Kokomo Murase of Japan put down a strong second run, which bumped Sadowski-Synnott off the top spot, but as the last athlete to drop the Wānaka snowboarder had the deciding run.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott put down her winning run, tidying up the rail section and then lacing her back-to-back double corked 1080's on the last two jumps.</p>
        
            <p>An ankle injury meant she missed most competitions in 2024 but Sadowski-Synnott said she got some confidence coming off the Laax Open two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>"...And I worked so hard to get back to this level and [to] be competing with the rest of the girls because they are pushing it so hard, I am so happy to be back," Sadowski-Synnott said.</p>
        
            <p>"I watched her [Kokomo's] last run and knew it was going to knock my first run score so I knew that I needed to clean up that rail section and I am stoked how it came out, stepping it up from X Games last week."</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott took the win by a significant margin as the only woman to score in the 80's with an 87.80. Murase finished in second place with Great Britain's Mia Brookes rounding out the star-studded podium in third.</p>
        
            <p>The men's snowboard slopestyle World Cup finals also went down in Aspen this morning, with Kiwi's Dane Menzies and Rocco Jamieson dropping in.</p>
        
            <p>Menzies had a career best result, finishing in fourth place and put down a frontside 1800 for his first time in a slopestyle run. Jamieson finished in twelfth.</p>
        
            <p>Fin Melville Ives and Luke Harrold are about to compete in the freeski halfpipe World Cup finals.</p>
