            <p>The New Zealand E-Sports Basketball team is set to challenge for the eFIBA World title in Sweden this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Their gaming careers had humble beginnings, playing a Grand Turismo driving game on a Playstation 2.</p>
        
            <p>Now Esport athletes Cameron Fox and Ethan Simmonds are set to play against the greatest gamers on the planet.</p>
        
            <p>In just their first year, the New Zealand E-Sports basketball team, the E-Blacks, have risen to eighth in the world.</p>
        
            <p>They have earned entry to the first-ever in-person eFIBA World Finals in Sweden this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It will be a stark contrast to the qualifiers, which saw the team take on Guam from the comfort of their bedrooms.</p>
        
            <p>"When we played them, there was a lot of delay because obviously they're so far away from us so we couldn't really play how we wanted to play. But obviously we did what we needed to do and got the win," Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>Eight countries will compete in World Finals 2023 to determine the world's best from Turkey, Lebanon, Philippines, Brazil, Morocco, France, New Zealand and the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Fox said the U.S. will be heavy favourites.</p>
        
            <p>"They have an actual league that professionals play in that they play full-time. So it's kind of like the NBA. They are full-time gamers and have got literal NBA teams backing them so it's pretty pretty crazy," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are still grappling with the reality that their hobby has turned into a career.</p>

            <p>"Obviously it's a first time something like this has ever happened. So yeah, it's just crazy going halfway around around the world to compete in ESports, it's mind blowing really."</p>
        
            <p>The E-Blacks breezed past Guam in the best of three series but the environment will be much more intense in Sweden.</p>
        
            <p>"You try to have that set up that you can be comfortable, you know where everything is. So that's why it's going to be a bit odd in Sweden, because obviously it's the first time that we're not playing on our own set-ups," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>Fox said another factor will be the in-person competition.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be the first time that we're all playing in the same room together as well. So that'll be interesting to see that dynamic."</p>
        
            <p>The E-Blacks are seeded eight in the tournament but say they are going over to cause an upset.</p>
        
            <p>They still contend with detractors who say they are not real athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"We do just as much preparation and planning and watching film. We've dedicated so much time to it that it is really a real sport at the end of the day," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously we're not physically moving as much as what other sports would do. But mentally, and play - it's just as much, it's just as draining."</p>
        
            <p>Simmonds said there were a number of different skills required to be an elite gamer.</p>

            <p>"There's a lot of hand eye co-ordination ...we probably run just as many plays as like a regular basketball team would run," Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>One way the sport will be legitimised is if it became part of the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"If that happened that would be huge for just every kind of aspect of gaming."</p>
        
            <p>Fox said the market for gaming was immense.</p>
        
            <p>"You look at games like Fortnight, where there's literally billions of people playing it," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>Should the E-Blacks perform in Sweden, their stock will rise greatly.</p>
        
            <p>"It will open a lot of doors especially for New Zealand E-Sports as well. It shows that we can compete with the best of the best. We can be elite and also, personally it opens a lot of doors for the players and the coaches as well."</p>
