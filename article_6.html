            <p>Australian product Claire O'Brien and Pulse defender Parris Mason have been named in the Silver Ferns for the first time, while another two former Ferns have earned a recall.</p>
        
            <p>Selectors have confirmed a 2024/25 Silver Ferns Squad of 16, with two spots still open, while a 10-strong Silver Ferns Development Squad has also been named.</p>
        
            <p>New Steel midcourter Kimiora Poi and Magic defender Erena Mikaere have both been recalled into the top squad.</p>
        
            <p>Tiana Metuarau, Peta Toeava, and Paris Lokotui have been dropped to the Silver Ferns development squad.</p>
        
            <p>O'Brien, Mason, and Poi have also been named in a Silver Ferns team of 13 to take on the England Roses next month.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns shooting circle for the England series will again be anchored by Ameliaranne Ekenasio along with Grace Nweke, Amelia Walmsley and Maia Wilson.</p>
        
            <p>Poi, who last played for the Silver Ferns in 2022, returns to a midcourt featuring Maddy Gordon, Kate Heffernan, O'Brien and Whitney Souness. The defensive quartet for the series also includes Kelly Jackson, Karin Burger and Phoenix Karaka.</p>
        
            <p>O'Brien, who grew up in Australia, and Mikaere were both part of a resurgent Magic team in this year's ANZ Premiership. Poi was a key cog for the Tactix with a standout season and Mason helped the Pulse reach the ANZ Premiership final.</p>

            <p>Dame Noeline Taurua said all four players showed consistency throughout the ANZ Premiership and took another step up during the three-day trial in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"Claire showed promise during the ANZ Premiership season. At trials she demonstrated her understanding of game strategy and netball IQ, subtleness and efficiency of movement, hard catch of the ball with two defenders marking, and her feeds into circle I would consider her trademark quality. We add those qualities to others in the attacking unit and that's where the excitement lays," Dame Noeline said.</p>
        
            <p>Mason has already represented New Zealand in basketball and Dame Noeline she already had a strong combination with Pulse team-mate and Silver Ferns goal keep Kelly Jackson.</p>
        
            <p>"Parris has a basketball background and has the potential to deliver edge to our defensive unit and team. She can deliver on that man-to-man type of defence and also has an innate awareness of incircle set up. She can get ball. One of her trademark qualities is that she is a natural ball carrier. Her vision and attacking ball skills and movement are outstanding. If an opening presents with the shooter she will see that opportunity deep and let it rip. We add her qualities to the current mix of defenders, and she strengthens our collective unit."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline said the midcourt selections were tough because of the depth in that area.</p>
        
            <p>"When we look at the incircle defence and shooting area for both squads, the depth is starting to grow."</p>
        
            <p>She said both Poi and Mikaere were examples of athletes who have matured as people.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so proud of Kimiora. She has endured some tough conversations and selector feedback for the past three years. Her game, fighting spirit, superior speed and movement, body strength and leadership is next level. I can see the maturity in her game where she plays with no limits," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Defensively watch out attackers. She will contest on the body or pinch the ball from the blindside.</p>

            <p>"Erena brings presence in the defence unit, and she leads from the back as well as within the team environment. She gets ball lifted because of her height and has mastered the block in the air. She loves to be physical on the shooter and wants to torment them under the post. When she gets beaten, she doesn't give up.</p>
        
            <p>"For both players I get a sense there is a deeper appreciation of what it means to be a Silver Fern when you get recalled back into the squad. It's a timely reminder for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Four new faces have been included in the Silver Ferns Development Squad with Saviour Tui, Martina Salmon, Georgie Edgecombe and Catherine Hall all named.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns meet England in three Tests for the Taini Jamison Trophy with the first to be played at The Trusts Arena in Auckland on 29 September.</p>
        
            <p>A team to take on the Australian Diamonds in the Constellation Cup will be named after the Taini Jamison Trophy.</p>

            <p>Netball New Zealand has also confirmed the FAST5 Ferns team to compete at the FAST5 Netball World Series to be played in Christchurch from 9-10 November.</p>
        
            <p>Erena Mikaere, Saviour Tui, Georgie Edgecombe, Catherine Hall and Martina Salmon are set to make their FAST5 Ferns debut.</p>
