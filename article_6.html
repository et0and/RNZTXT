            <p>Sprinter Zoe Hobbs eased to an eighth 100 metre national title in Wellington in 11.13 seconds on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Somerfield was second in 11.55 seconds and Portia Bing, who normally competes in 400m hurdles, was third in 11.67 seconds for her first medal of the National Championships.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs holds the national record time of 10.97 seconds set last year but said after not running many 100m races this season and coming off a lot of travel, including to the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow this month, she thought her time was "pretty solid".</p>
        
            <p>After her record setting time at the same meet last season Hobbs said she was not expecting a repeat.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit of a unique year because I've training through this period and not put a lot of emphasis and focus into this block of the year ... lay some solid foundations and then look for the long run lead in to Paris so all eyes on later in the year and anything that happens in this block has been a bonus including the world indoors."</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs has gained an Olympic qualifying standard but the first Olympic selection announcement for Paris will be made by the New Zealand Olympic Committee in April.</p>
        
            <p>"This will be my first Olympics so that in itself is really really exciting to be up for."</p>

            <p>Hobbs had expected Wellington to turn on "thunderstorms" for the meet at Newtown Park.</p>
        
            <p>"I packed three bags for the rain and cold so it's nice that the sun came out."</p>
        
            <p>With Olympics on her mind Hobbs won't be competing in the 200m at nationals - or at all before Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbs has a rest week next week before she returns to working on some technical changes she had made to her racing over the last couple of months.</p>
        
            <p>She has a race in Japan in May and will also be competing in Europe.</p>
