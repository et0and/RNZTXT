            <p>With another Super Rugby season kicking off tonight, RNZ sport takes a look at 10 unforgettable moments from the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Check out the first list here.</p>
        
            <p>1. Tana throws handbags</p>
        
            <p>Up there with the Keith Murdoch punch in terms of its place in rugby folklore, former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga channelled his inner Real Housewife and smacked teammate Chris Masoe in the head with a woman's handbag after Masoe tried to start a fight with another patron. The blow was hard enough to significantly damage the bag owner's cellphone as well as Masoe's ego.</p>
        
            <p>2. Lauaki floors McCaw</p>
        
            <p>Regarded for his tenacious defence, this was a rare occasion where Richie McCaw not only came off second best, but was embarrassed by the late Sione Lauaki. The Tongan powerhouse had his share of Super Rugby highlights, notably his incredible match winning try against the Blues in 2004. However, seeing the All Black captain being put on his backside was as rare as a millennial homeowner.</p>
        
            <p>3. SBW vs the Highlanders</p>
        
            <p>Things got heated under the roof in Dunedin during this 2012 clash and in an ill-advised move, three Highlanders decided to take on the then New Zealand Heavyweight boxing champion, Sonny Bill Williams.</p>
        
            <p>4. Marshall's walk off</p>
        
            <p>In 2000, a defiant Justin Marshall decided he was done with referee Andre Watson, and believing he was about to be yellow carded, opted to excuse himself from the field before sheepishly returning to receive his reprimand from Watson.</p>
        
            <p>5. Carter's Banana</p>
        
            <p>Just because he could.</p>
        
            <p>6. Dunning's disastrous droppie</p>
        
            <p>A prop slotting a 30 metre drop goal would generally be cause for celebration, but Waratah Matt Dunning's successful pop resulted in an absolute ear lashing from his teammates. Looking confused, Dunning soon realised what he'd done. In the final round of the 2003 season, the Waratahs needed to beat the Chiefs by two tries to get into the semis. They didn't. A drunk Dunning took out his frustrations later in the night on the face of teammate Des Tuiavi'i.</p>
        
            <p>7. Barrett pulled into Hurricanes huddle</p>
        
            <p>Brilliant banter from Dane Coles and the Canes.</p>
        
            <p>8. Nadolo sends Duffie into orbit</p>
        
            <p>Matt Duffie likely would have preferred to be anywhere in the world other than at North Harbour Stadium with the man-mountain Nemani Nadolo barrelling towards him at full speed. The resulting collision went as expected, with the much slighter Duffie sent hurtling backwards and the reconsideration of his career choices clear to see on his face.</p>
        
            <p>9. Sam Whitelock's 60-metre stunner</p>
        
            <p>The 153-test veteran made the Reds defence look like a 6th grade side not sure if they're playing touch or tackle.</p>
        
            <p>10. "Mitch Hunt with the drop goal!"</p>
        
            <p>Locked up with time up on the clock and thrown the ball with orders from the captain to "f****** do something!" Mitch Hunt slotted this absolute miracle as Scotty Stevenson blew a fuse in excitement.</p>
