            <p>Super Rugby Pacific kicks off tonight and there are plenty of intriguing storylines, including whether the Crusaders can return to the top of the pile and whether the Blues can go back to back after winning their first title in more than two decades.</p>
        
            <p>The defending champion Blues are the bookies' favourites to win this season and All Blacks back Rieko Ioane said they're determined to prove last year's success wasn't a flash in the pan.</p>
        
            <p>"That's obviously the dream and the goal of this club. But you can't start talking dynasty's until you win another one (title) and start doing that consistently," Ioane said.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs were beaten finalists the last two seasons and All Blacks midfielder Anton Lienert-Brown said they wouldn't be lacking motivation.</p>
        
            <p>"Two years in a row we've fell short. Last year in particular we made it to the final but we got well and truly beaten, which was frustrating," Lienert-Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Though from last year there's a lot to be proud of, we lost some key leaders, players that will go down as legends of our club and New Zealand rugby as well. So to lose that level of leadership and come together and go all the way to the final, that was impressive.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of those young boys that had to step up into a role, they learned a lot and will be better for it this year."</p>
        
            <p>Lienert-Brown is confident the Chiefs have made the improvements they need to go all the way in 2025, but he says the Vern Cotter coached Blues deserve to be title favourites.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they probably surprised everyone last year with the simplicity they played the game. Obviously, Vern Cotter has done a great job up there and they're big, fast, talented boys and they're playing a game plan that really suits their athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm really interested to see this year is how teams decide to combat that. No one figured it out by the finals last year, but I know we've certainly talked about it and I'm sure other teams have talked about how to stop that bully ball sort of attack and how to mitigate the threats they show."</p>

            <p>The Crusaders probably have the most to prove of any side, with the 14-times champions, the most successful team in Super Rugby, failing to reach the playoffs last year for the first time since 2015.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks fullback Will Jordan is adamant they can put that disappointment behind them, starting with Friday's season opener against the Hurricanes in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a team that I'm extremely passionate about. There's obviously a bit of hurt from last year that's motivating the boys and it provides a fresh challenge and perspective for the group. We can't wait."</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders have other challenges to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>They have more than a dozen players on the injured list, threatening to derail the start to their season.</p>

            <p>The Hurricanes are also depleted.</p>
        
            <p>The squad's first five stocks look particularly thin with first-choice 10 Brett Cameron out for the season and new recruit Lucas Cashmore also sidelined, forcing them to bring in Wellington pivot Callum Harkin, who hasn't played Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>That leaves rookie Harry Godfrey to start against the Crusaders in the season opener, but coach Clark Laidlaw doesn't believe the position will become an achilles heel for the side.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really confident in how we're trying to grow these men. Have they got loads of experience around a Super Rugby team at first-five? No. So it's our job to coach them, to help, to help them have real conviction around the week and the whole team will get around those guys," Laidlaw said.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika made the biggest off season signing in luring star All Blacks loosie Ardie Savea away from the Hurricanes and it's hoped more top players could follow suit.</p>
        
            <p>This year their biggest challenge will be to improve on the four wins they had in 2024 and to try and push their way into playoff contention.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies are again the top rated Australian side while the Fijian Drua are seeking to reach the finals for a second straight year.</p>
        
            <p>The bookies haven't given the Highlanders much chance of success, with only Moana Pasifika and the Western Force ranked less likely to win Super Rugby.</p>
