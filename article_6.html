            <p>In a finish for the ages, LawConnect has sensationally overtaken Andoo Comanche in the final moments to snatch line honours in the 2023 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect's finish time was 8:03:58 - just 51 seconds before Comanche's 8:04:49.</p>
        
            <p>The yachts were racing for a day and 19 hours.</p>
        
            <p>One moment could face closer scrutiny, just metres out from the finishing buoy.</p>
        
            <p>Just as LawConnect turned to make a final push to the finish, a spectator catamaran appeared to cross by the side of Andoo Comanche.</p>
        
            <p>The crew of Andoo Comanche can be seen gesturing towards the catamaran.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear yet if there will be an official protest from Andoo Comanche over the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of spectators watched the dramatic finish at Constitution Dock from 7am as the two super maxis jostled for the top position.</p>
        
            <p>It was the perfect finish to one of the most memorable editions of the blue water classic, held amidst intense storms over south-east Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Andoo Comanche appeared to have an insurmountable lead as the crew rounded the Iron Pot on the final approach to Hobart, but LawConnect read conditions better in the mouth of the River Derwent.</p>

            <p>The remainder of the fleet is crossing the Bass Strait, where conditions are easier than the previous night.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a testing 78th edition of the Sydney to Hobart, with a man overboard, stormy seas, damaged yachts and rapid wind changes.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven boats have retired, including race favourite SHK Scallywag, which broke its bow sprit on the first day.</p>
        
            <p>The skipper of two-handed Rum Rebellion, Shane Connelly, was sent overboard at 6pm on Boxing Day after encountering rapid wind changes off the coast between Cronulla and Wollongong.</p>
        
            <p>Two-handed Currawong also retired, after facing various issues in rough conditions off New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Owner Kathy Veel said they were disappointed but believed they made the right decision.</p>
        
            <p>"Last night was quite difficult and there was a lot more of that ahead of us in a long race," she said.</p>
        
            <p>They were the last boat to cross the finishing line at last year's event, making a well-received arrival in Hobart at midnight on New Year's Eve.</p>
