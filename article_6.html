            <p>France claimed their first Olympic Games sevens rugby gold medal with a 28-7 win over Fiji at the Stade de France this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Star French player Antoine Dupont scored two late second half tries and helped the side create history in front of a partisan 69,000 crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji, who were chasing a three-peat attempt at the Paris Olympics, paid the price for giving away critical penalties in the second spell as France took control, settling for silver in the end.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji's Josaia Raisuqe said it was a good final, but Fiji made some mistakes.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe because [France] were playing on their home soil, it was a special motivation for them. But we must just keep on going.</p>
        
            <p>"We gave our best in this final. But when it comes to the end, one is going to win and one is going to lose, so we accept that."</p>
        
            <p>He said the medal is silver but "still it is important to me".</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe we are going to come back in the next Olympics and we will give everything.</p>
        
            <p>"I have silver on my neck.</p>
        
            <p>"My family and country is happy now. My mum and dad brought me into this sport and I am thankful for that."</p>
        
            <p>The Fijians, who claimed the gold at the both the 2016 and 2020 Games, started the game with a Josefa Talacolo try.</p>
        
            <p>But France responded through Jefferson-Lee Joseph and the two teams were tied 7-all at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Fijian captain Jerry Tuwai had to be content with winning his first silver medal, having won two previous gold medals in Brazil and Japan.</p>
        
            <p>But he had not been in the team earlier in the sevens season.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very hard when I was left out but I always had hope that I could play another Olympic Games and it happened," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was coming for the gold but it wasn't to be. What can you say?</p>
        
            <p>"My first Olympics (Rio 2016) was a real surprise to me because it was the first time for rugby at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"The second was better and this one was better still, even though I didn't win gold with my teammates and for my country. I am grateful I could come this far."</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Osea Kolinisau was also hoping to become the first sevens rugby coach to have won an Olympic gold medal as a player and coach, having been captain when Fiji first kissed gold in Brazil in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>France, with former Test captain Dupont leading their charge in the second haf , had their fans cheering early when play resumed for the second spell, running down the flank to set up Aaron Grandidier for their first try.</p>

            <p>Then it was Dupont who came to the front for his country, claiming his double and shutting Fiji out.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji did not have much possession in the second half as France applied pressure and played rushed defence to disrupt the defending champions.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji sailed through to their third final with an outstanding display of flair and skills, beating Australia 31-7. The two teams were 7-all at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The Aussies managed to score first following a Fiji mistake.</p>
        
            <p>Joji Nasova replied with a length of the field try when he raced away from close to his tryline.</p>
        
            <p>France came from behind to beat South Africa 19-5.</p>
        
            <p>It was a tight affair with both teams failing to score any points in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>The South Africans were the first to score after the break before the hosts answered with three successive tries.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa defeated Australia in the bronze medal final to claim their second Olympic Games bronze, with a 26-19 win.</p>
        
            <p>In the other play-offs, New Zealand finished fifth, defeating Ireland 17-7.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina hammered USA 19-0 to claim seventh spot, Kenya finished ninth beating Samoa 10-5 and Uruguay ended up 11th with a 21-10 win over Japan.</p>
        
            <p>The women's competition kicks-off on Monday morning (NZ time), with medal finals scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
