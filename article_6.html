            <p>Pacific Championships round 2: Kiwis v Kangaroos </p>
        
            <p>Sunday 27 October, 6.05pm </p>
        
            <p>Apollo Projects Stadium, Christchurch</p>
        
            <p>A year since they were last seen in action, the Kiwis are back to take on the world champs.</p>
        
            <p>Five players have been named to make their test debuts as New Zealand meet the Kangaroos in Christchurch on Sunday in their opening Pacific Championships clash.</p>
        
            <p>Australia won't be short of motivation, as they look to avenge the heaviest loss ever suffered in the side's 116-year history.</p>
        
            <p>With so many players sidelined since the end of the regular NRL season, Kiwis coach Stacey Jones said they had been busy blowing out some cobwebs over the past few days.</p>
        
            <p>Jones, who was working in a caretaker role with the Kiwis until taking the top job earlier this year, admitted it was a different feeling being the head honcho.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a shorter campaign, and this is a campaign of dealing with the elite players, so it's making sure that we get the connections right within the group. What we did last year certainly set a benchmark."</p>
        
            <p>Among the new names are former All Blacks Sevens star William Warbrick.</p>
        
            <p>The Storm flyer won an Olympic silver medal with the All Blacks Sevens at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 before switching codes.</p>
        
            <p>"What a progression he's made. Melbourne have done a wonderful job with him. He's in a place where his development is the product of a very professional system."</p>

            <p>Also making his debut will be Newcastle hooker Phoenix Crossland.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know a lot about Phoenix. I had a couple of conversations with Blake Green, who's at Newcastle and was with us at the Warriors. He spoke highly of his character as a footy player and what he brings."</p>
        
            <p>Also earning a maiden test cap will be Keano Kini, Jordan Riki and Naufahu Whyte.</p>
        
            <p>While stacked with young talent, the Kiwis also boast plenty of experienced campaigners - none more so than Shaun Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been clear on what he wants. We understand we've got to manage Shaun a bit with his body. I just said to him, 'Enjoy it. Your experience will get you through and the rest of the players will thrive off of what you bring.'"</p>
        
            <p>Jones said Johnson showed he has plenty left in the tank during his final games with the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>"He showed some really good signs of just having a clear thought around how he wanted to play, but also bring back the enjoyment. And that's what this is about for Shaun, making sure, first and foremost, that he enjoys himself, but he knows the level of play that he needs to be at."</p>
        
            <p>The former kiwis and Warriors halfback credited Johnson for stepping up at short notice.</p>
        
            <p>"Shaun's doing it for his country. He's doing it for this group of players. He's doing it for himself and his family.</p>
        
            <p>"He knows that this is the end, and he's just really thriving being in the group, and he wants to deliver a performance."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will be led by James Fisher-Harris.</p>
        
            <p>"The word that you can describe Fish as is mana - the heart and soul of the team - and a leader that everyone respects. So he's so passionate about the space and we couldn't ask for a better leader."</p>
