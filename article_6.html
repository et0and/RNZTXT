            <p>India marched into the T20 World Cup semi-finals after skipper Rohit Sharma's blistering 92 set up their 24-run victory over Australia, who are now on the brink of elimination.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit clobbered eight sixes in his 41-ball blitz to lay the foundation for India's imposing 205-5, their highest total in the tournament, in Gros Islet, St Lucia.</p>
        
            <p>Travis Head led Australia's chase with a belligerent 76 but India managed to restrict them to 181-7 to remain unbeaten in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The Super Eight clash between two former champion teams had assumed greater importance after Afghanistan stunned Australia at the weekend to throw Group 1 wide open.</p>
        
            <p>Josh Hazlewood drew first blood as he bounced out Virat Kohli for a duck after Australia elected to field.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit has not been in the best of form but the India captain threw Starc out of the attack by hitting the fast bowler for four sixes in a 29-run over.</p>
        
            <p>Pat Cummins, who claimed back-to-back hat-tricks in his last two games, was pressed into service to end the batting carnage.</p>
        
            <p>Rohit greeted him by depositing the seamer's first ball on the roof of the stadium for a monster six en route to a 19-ball fifty, his first of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>India raced to the 100-mark in the ninth over but Starc returned to deny Rohit what could have been the first hundred by a batter in this tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Suryakumar Yadav (31) and Shivam Dube (28) produced breezy cameos and Hardik Pandya made 27 not out to propel India to their first 200-plus total of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Arshdeep Singh rattled Australia by removing David Warner in the first over in what could be the opener's last game in an Australia shirt.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Marsh (37) joined Head and they counter-attacked to put Australia's chase back on track.</p>
        
            <p>Axar Patel leapt to take a stunning one-handed catch at deep square leg to dismiss Marsh but Head raced to a 24-ball fifty.</p>
        
            <p>Kuldeep Yadav castled the dangerous Glenn Maxwell (20) and Jasprit Bumrah effectively sealed India's victory when he dismissed Head with a clever change of pace.</p>
        
            <p>India will play defending champions England in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Afghanistan will grab the other semi-final spot from the group if they beat Bangladesh.</p>
