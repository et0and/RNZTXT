            <p>He's the most feared man in the division, and now the most active fighter on the roster.</p>
        
            <p>Alex 'Poatan' Pereira will once again step into the octagon to main event a UFC card on Sunday, his tenth bout since November 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The Brazilian kickboxer has taken the sport by storm since his debut, winning titles in two weight divisions and going 8-1 in the UFC, his sole loss coming against his great rival, Israel Adesanya.</p>
        
            <p>Pereira meets Khalil Rountree Jr. for the 205 pound strap at UFC 307 in Salt Lake City.</p>
        
            <p>Rountree is ranked eighth in the division, and is riding a five fight win streak dating back to September 202, his last two finishes coming via knockout.</p>
        
            <p>The MMA community has been vocal in his disdain for the match-up, arguing number one contender Magomed Ankalaev should have been next in line for a shot at Poatan.</p>
        
            <p>Regardless of whether or not 'the War Horse' deserves the title fight, Roundtree is guaranteed to stand and trade with Pereira.</p>
        
            <p>Roundtree has nine career knockouts and has never attempted a takedown in the octagon.</p>
        
            <p>Pereira meanwhile has been tearing through the promotion, sending some of the biggest names in the game to the shadow realm with his unprecedented power.</p>
        
            <p>At Friday's pre-fight press conference, the champion talked up the credentials of the challenger.</p>
        
            <p>"Khalil is up there, you can't deny that, he's a great striker."</p>
        
            <p>Roundtree was adamant he wouldn't be looking to grapple the champ.</p>
        
            <p>"I've worked myself hard enough to get to this point, it would not make sense to completely switch who I am for this win. I have the scariest man in the division, but I'm going to continue to work, as big as this moment is for me I know its not the end."</p>
        
            <p>He promised fireworks come Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"You have two of the best strikers in the world going at it, it's MMA, anything can happen."</p>
        
            <p>His third defence of 2024 after winning the vacant title in November, Pereira said he had no intention of slowing down.</p>
        
            <p>"Fans pay and want to see fights and I deliver fights."</p>
