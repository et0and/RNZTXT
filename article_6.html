            <p>Olympic organisers have postponed the men's triathlon due to the pollution levels in the River Seine remaining too high.</p>
        
            <p>The race has been postponed until Wednesday evening NZ time.</p>
        
            <p>Two New Zealanders are due to compete in the men's event - Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist Hayden Wilde and Dylan McCullough.</p>
        
            <p>The decision is a blow to organisers who previously said they were confident water quality would improve in time for the race after heavy rains last Friday and Saturday dirtied the river.</p>
        
            <p>The 55 triathletes who were primed to compete on Tuesday now face more uncertainty.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the improvement of water quality levels over the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable limits," organisers said.</p>
        
            <p>World Triathlon will meet with coaches at 8am on Tuesday to provide them with all the information and the updated schedule for the race, they said.</p>
        
            <p>If levels of bacteria remain too high by Wednesday morning, both the men's and women's races are likely to be postponed to Friday, the contingency day reserved for the events.</p>
        
            <p>For the mixed triathlon relay event on 5 August the contingency day is 6 August.</p>
        
            <p>Paris authorities have promised to make the Seine swimmable as a key legacy of the Games, and spent 1.4 billion euros (NZ$2.57 billion) on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the waterway.</p>
        
            <p>Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the river herself earlier this month, in a bid to convince doubters.</p>
        
            <p>The gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off, especially as water quality varies widely day-to-day.</p>
        
            <p>Rain significantly increases concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli and enterococci.</p>
