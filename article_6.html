            <p>When it comes to international Rugby League, the Kangaroos well and truly sets the benchmark far higher than any other country. The classic feeling of trans-Tasman rivalry we see in a lot of sports reigns supreme as New Zealand plays a little brother role to Australia, never quite managing to make it out of their shadow.</p>
        
            <p>Out of the 145 test matches played between the two countries since 1908, Australia have won a massive 107 games.</p>

            <p>But when the Kiwis do finally get the rub of the green and get one up over the Kangaroos, there's nothing quite like it. So here's a look at some of the classic victories over the old enemy:</p>
        
            <p>1983 Trans Test Series, Lang Park Brisbane</p>
        
            <p>One of the most famous Kiwi victories, Graham Lowe's men made the trip over to Australia's fortress of Lang Park (nowadays Suncorp Stadium) in Brisbane and managed to upset one of the best Australian sides of all time. This kicked off a rugby league revolution in New Zealand with the public hungry for more success.</p>
        
            <p>2005 Tri Nations Final, Elland Road Leeds</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis coach Brian 'Bluey' McClennan led New Zealand to its most famous rugby league victory of all time, shocking the sporting world when they famously upset the Australians 24 - 0 in the 2005 Tri Nations final over in Leeds and winning New Zealand's first piece of International silverware in decades.</p>
        
            <p>2008 Rugby League World Cup final, Suncorp Stadium Brisbane</p>

            <p>It doesn't get much bigger than the first and only Kiwis Rugby League World Cup victory. It was an epic contest, was stacked with plenty of hard hitting action, amazing attacking football and a famous Billy Slater brain explosion.</p>
        
            <p>2010 Four Nations Final, Suncorp Stadium Brisbane</p>

            <p>The Kiwis backed up their 2008 World Cup success on the very same ground against Australia in 2010, in the most epic conclusion to an international league match in the modern era. Down and out, trailing Australia by two, they left it to literally the very last moment. Shaun Kenny-Dowell made a famous line break, shifting the ball to Jason Nightingale who went 30 metres down the wing before hoofing the ball in field. It fell to Benji Marshall, who almost blew it by not passing to a wide open Lance Hohaia, flung a pass over his head for Nathan Fien to score under the posts and seal the win.</p>

            <p>2014 was a peak year for the Kiwis where they seemed on top of the world. Shaun Johnson won the Golden Boot award for International player of the year, deservedly so after he sliced the Kangaroos open countless times over the test match season. The Kiwis walked away victorious in Wellington, locking up their second major piece of league silverware for the decade.</p>
        
            <p>2018 Trans-Tasman Test, Mt Smart Stadium Auckland</p>

            <p>It had been a long time between drinks for the Kiwis, having not beat Australia in four years. But along came a young player by the name of Brandon Smith, who absolutely tore them up out of dummy half. The Kiwis managed to hold off a late Australian come back to win in front of a sold out Mt Smart.</p>

            <p>In what was easily the Kiwis most comprehensive victory of all time and Australia's worst ever loss, Michael Maguire's young and energised side put on an absolute footy clinic from start to finish. Alarm bells were ringing for coach Mel Meninga amongst an ageing Australian camp, with plenty of big names from this game not being called back into the camp for 2024.</p>
