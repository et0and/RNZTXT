        <h2>'Extra effort for Connor' – Māori All Blacks win for fallen team mate</h2>
        <p>
Coach Ross Filipo said his side had extra motivation in their opening match in Tokyo, dedicating the win to Connor Garden-Bachop.

            <p>The Māori All Blacks made a winning start to their two-match tour, however the 36-10 win over a Japan XV in Tokyo was tinged with poignancy.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Ross Filipo said post-match that his side had the memory of Connor Garden-Bachop motivating their performance, and that the "emotion was definitely high".</p>
        
            <p>"We thought we would honour him and his family by having his initials on our jersey, and the only way we wanted to respect it was by giving all we could on the game. Being physical and just giving that extra effort for Connor and his family to be proud of," said Filipo, who was coaching the Māori All Blacks for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Garden-Bachop, who played two matches for the Māori All Blacks as well as three seasons at the Highlanders, passed away aged 25 earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The result was a pleasing one for Filipo, with his side coming back from an early 5-0 deficit at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium to control proceedings and dominate the scoreboard. They kept it simple against a Japanese side intent on running the ball and utilising some intricate backline moves, sending forward runners at the line and using their noticeable size advantage.</p>

            <p>Cameron Suafoa struck first for the Māori All Blacks, before Kurt Eklund and captain Billy Harmon also crossed from close range. Bailyn Sullivan pulled off a stunning try saving on Japanese wing Viliame Tuidraki in the first half as well, which snuffed out a brief revival by the home side.</p>
        
            <p>Harmon praised the Japan XV as "quite skilful".</p>
        
            <p>"We were on defence for probably the first 20 minutes. They threw some good cut balls, which really challenged the defence."</p>
        
            <p>The second half saw the game open up, with the impressive Sullivan scoring and Rameka Poihipi bagging a double.</p>
        
            <p>Harmon noted that the Māori All Blacks' scrum was an area they'd be looking to work on.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought they got lower than us. We couldn't use our scrum as a weapon and get penalties out of it like we thought we could. So, that'll be our work on for next week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides meet again at Tokyo Stadium next Saturday night.</p>
