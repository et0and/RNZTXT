            <p>The Wellington Phoenix women will find out later today if Rylee Foster will cop a one match ban after a contentious refereeing decision in their 2-0 win over Canberra United yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>An independent match review panel, which looks at all red cards, will meet today and give the club a decision this evening.</p>
        
            <p>If the panel gives Foster a mandatory one match ban the Phoenix plan on appealing to the disciplinary and ethics committee.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix returned to winning ways in the women's A-League in Porirua, despite being forced to play the final 25 minutes with just 10 players after Foster was sent off.</p>
        
            <p>Foster was shown a straight red card for making minimal contact with Canberra forward Deven Jackson in the Phoenix box.</p>
        
            <p>Mariana Speckmaier scored a goal either side of half-time and replacement keeper Brianna Edwards made an incredible penalty save to secure the Nix their first win of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Paul Temple was unable to make sense of the sending off, but said it created an amazing moment for Edwards.</p>
        
            <p>Canberra dominated possession for the remaining 25 minutes but their goal scoring opportunities were few and far between.</p>
        
            <p>The result meant the Phoenix jumped from 10th to sixth, at least momentarily.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix return across the Tasman for next Sunday's match against the Newcastle Jets in Newcastle.</p>
