            <p>Who would've thought just a few weeks ago that we'd be talking about the Chiefs being overwhelming favourites for this one? Certainly not the Blues, who are now trying to figure out how to snap out of their one-win, three-loss situation. But the challenge that awaits them tonight is one they've already faced in 2025 and failed, losing to the Chiefs in the opening match of the season.</p>

            <p>DMac's back from what looked to be a nasty knee injury that caused him to miss last weekend's match in Fiji, while Shaun Stevenson gets a start at fullback. That moves Josh Jacomb to the bench, while Luke Jacobson returns from a broken nose and is joined by Simon Parker and Jahrome Brown in the loose forwards.</p>

            <p>Very interesting team here, with Anton Segner starting at number eight and Sam Nock at halfback, which drops Cam Suafoa and Finlay Christie to the bench. Xavi Taele will debut at second five against the very in-form Quinn Tupaea, while Corey Evans gets the nod at fullback.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs have won 18 of their last 20 Super Rugby Pacific games at FMG Stadium Waikato, including their last three in a row. They've scored over 40 points in five of their last six games at the venue.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues have lost three of their last four Super Rugby Pacific games which is as many as they had lost across their previous 22 games in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Anton Lienert-Brown has crossed for three tries across his last two Super Rugby Pacific games, the first time since 2020 that he's scored tries in back-to-back games.</p>
        
            <p>"When you score, you want to keep attacking, you don't want to go back into your shell and start defending a lead. You want to keep scoring points and I think that's where we're probably failing a bit." - Blues captain Patrick Tuipulotu.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously they're a classy team that probably just haven't had the results go the way the last couple of games. They'll be hungry. The Battle of the Bombays always turns out to be a classic…they'll bounce back, we're looking forward to the challenge." - Chiefs fullback Shaun Stevenson.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 25 - 14 Blues</p>
        
            <p>This was a real boilover, given just how much the Blues had been talked up pre-season. Really though, this just came down to the Chiefs doing their homework and keeping the ball in the right end of the field - as well as some excellent defence and Damian McKenzie's big influence on the game.</p>
        
            <p>Something needs to change from the Blues, quickly, so expect far less kicking into the area between the 22s. Which means that the Chiefs will likely have to tackle hard again, but will also be looking for a quick knockout blow like they did against the Crusaders. Really though, the home side will be supremely confident heading into this one, especially with the sort of firepower the Chiefs possess out wide.</p>
