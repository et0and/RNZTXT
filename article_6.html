            <p>The Football Ferns have booked in their first games since the Olympics with two fixtures in Costa Rica.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders will kick off their new cycle building towards the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027 with two games against the 43rd ranked Costa Ricans on 22 and 26 February.</p>
        
            <p>Both games will be played at Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto in Alajuela, San Jos√©.</p>
        
            <p>The games mark the first time the two teams have faced each other at senior international level.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns will be led for these games by interim head coach Michael Mayne. The recruitment process for a permanent head coach will get underway in early 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Mayne took control of the side when Jitka Klimkova stood down in June.</p>
        
            <p>"What we have at this point, and will use to our advantage, is time to set our intentions and expectations as a team," Mayne said.</p>
        
            <p>"With a focus on preparing to perform in the qualifying tournament and FIFA Women's World Cup 2027, as well as providing our growing pool of talented players with international football experience.</p>
        
            <p>"The past couple of months have centred on understanding where we are at, and what we should focus on, starting in February against Costa Rica, and I'm excited about working with the team on and off the pitch to achieve something great.</p>
        
            <p>"Costa Rica are a really good fit for us in this window and will provide the perfect test for what I need to see from the players and staff as we embark on this new cycle."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand lost all three pool games at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Football is also in advanced discussions for games in the April and June FIFA match windows.</p>
