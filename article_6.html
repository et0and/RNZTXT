        <h2>Lone 'Bald Brother' Walker turns new page in Warriors tenure</h2>
        <p>
The departure of club stalwart Jazz Tevaga - and others - has left a void that those remaining must fill.

            <p>Warriors v Sharks (NRL pre-season trial)</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off 9:30pm, Friday 7 Feb</p>
        
            <p>Shark Park, Sydney</p>

            <p>A new season and diverging career paths have NZ Warriors utility Dylan Walker a little misty eyed.</p>
        
            <p>Over his first two seasons at Mt Smart, the veteran of more than 220 NRL first-grade games had formed a tight onfield and off-field partnership with popular clubmate Jazz Tevaga, with their shaven scalps earning them the collective moniker of 'Bald Brothers'.</p>
        
            <p>Alas, the fraternity is no more, with Tevaga's contract not renewed at the end of 2024 and his departure across the Tasman to find alternative employment.</p>
        
            <p>Ironically, he's found it at Walker's old Manly Sea Eagles stomping ground.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what Jazz is doing with his hair at the moment," chuckles Walker. "He had a mohawk going - a Mister T one that probably suited him.</p>
        
            <p>"He's living on the beaches close to where I used to be, so I've caught up with him a few times during the break.</p>
        
            <p>"I went back to the beaches on the weekend and he's going all right. He's enjoying it and it's a good place to live.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish him nothing but the best, but when it comes to round two, I've got nothing for him."</p>
        
            <p>To mark a new chapter in his Warriors tenure, Walker, 30, is growing his own locks out, although passing years and rugby league wear-and-tear mean he's unlikely to sport a mullet any time soon.</p>

            <p>The break-up is symptomatic of a new culture developing in the team, with the departures of Tevaga and front-rower enforcer Addin Fonua-Blake, and retirements of captain Tohu Harris and stalwart Shaun Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>"This year is a totally new group," reflected Walker. "We've had some players leave, a lot of guys have moved on and it's opened up a door for a lot of new guys.</p>
        
            <p>"Moving forward, we've just taken this as an opportunity to get better, and for the new group to create a culture that we want and leave it for the younger guys that come through next.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to instil that and practice it every day."</p>
        
            <p>Walker's seniority makes him an outside candidate to fill the captaincy vacancy. He has filled the role in the past, but probably sits behind frontrunners Mitch Barnett and James Fisher-Harris, with an appointment due sometime over the next two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"When you get older, you just fill those roles, especially with the experience I bring," he said. "I've been around a little bit and played a lot of football.</p>
        
            <p>"We've lost a lot of senior players with lots of games' experience, but we've also gained some through Fish and Erin [Clark]. We've got a great bunch of boys that are working hard and no-one's above anyone.</p>

            <p>"Everyone wants to compete and lead in their own individual way."</p>
        
            <p>Although he has been used primarily as a Swiss army knife off the bench, Walker may also emerge as a starter in Harris' No.13 locking jersey.</p>
        
            <p>He's been passed over by coach Andrew Webster for Friday's pre-season opener against Cronulla Sharks, selected on an extended 15-man interchange, with Clark preferred initially.</p>
        
            <p>"I just try to be the best teammate and team player I can be," he said. "If that's something Webby sees, then he does, but if not, I will just put my hand up where I need to be.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to go out there, play some good football and compete."</p>
