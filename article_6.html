            <p>One of the country's most prestigious cycle races is ending after 36 years.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Cycle Classic  is putting the brakes on the revered race due to financial issues.</p>
        
            <p>Without a naming rights sponsor for next January's event, race organiser Jorge Sandoval said he had no option but to advise cycling's international governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), that the five-day event will be cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Sandoval is not ruling out the possibility of the event returning, though the race would need to find a suitable naming rights sponsor for that to happen.</p>
        
            <p>This will be a significant setback for road cycling in New Zealand as the race is the only UCI 2.2 event held in Oceania, providing a platform for emerging riders before stepping onto the global stage.</p>
        
            <p>For many riders, it has enabled them to make their way to top Pro Tour teams in Europe.</p>
        
            <p>In the last 10 years, New Zealand Cycle Classic tour winners Corbin Strong, George Bennett and Ben O'Connor have gone onto ride in the Tour de France, while the likes of James Oram, Mark Stewart, Aaron Gate and Campbell Stewart have enjoyed medal winning performances on the road, as well as on the track.</p>
        
            <p>It is a legacy Sandoval said he is extremely proud of.</p>
        
            <p>"The tour has a rich and proud history of unearthing new talent and every year it's wonderful to see the next generation of riders coming through. Because it's always the first of the year, it sets the tone for many of the riders. They race over multiple days, learn team tactics and racing etiquette as well as fine tune their criterium, hill climbing and sprinting techniques."</p>
        
            <p>He said it has been a catalyst for cycling greatness.</p>
        
            <p>"I can sit and watch any of the world's biggest stage races, like the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a Espa√±a, or any other major European race, knowing that there are always riders who have taken part in my race."</p>
        
            <p>Sandoval also noted the specialised event crew the event required which included race officials and judges, traffic management, race doctors and ambulance, team managers and mechanics, volunteers and a media team including race commentators.</p>
        
            <p>While the event has been staged in Wellington, Wairarapa and Waikato during its 36 years, its home for the last decade has predominately been Wairarapa.</p>
        
            <p>However, the post Covid-19 world has meant rising event compliance costs and it has struggled to find a naming rights sponsor.</p>
        
            <p>"Generally speaking, feedback I've received from would-be sponsors is they're being more prudent with their sponsorship dollar thanks to rising costs and business uncertainty, so I did make the difficult decision to cancel the 2025 event."</p>
        
            <p>Sandoval said he will continue to run the North Island Team Series, beginning this September.</p>
