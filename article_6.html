            <p>Russ Cook, the so-called "Hardest Geezer" who became the first person to run the length of Africa, set off on a new challenge on Tuesday, running to Germany from Wembley Stadium to support England for the European Championship</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old, who is from West Sussex, completed his run across the entire length of Africa in Tunisia in April after travelling through 16 countries, with the 352-day odyssey including being robbed at gunpoint and suffering food poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes boys and girls. Absolutely buzzing to be back on road, running to Germany to support England throughout the Euros. Leaving Wembley now, ferocious 1s & 2s to every game. Come on," Cook posted on social media platform X.</p>
        
            <p>England kick off their Group C campaign against Serbia on Sunday, followed by matches against Denmark on June 20 and Slovenia on June 25.</p>
        
            <p>England's opener is in Gelsenkirchen, while the other two clashes are in Frankfurt and Cologne, respectively.</p>
