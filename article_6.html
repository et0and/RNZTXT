            <p>Black Caps fast bowler Lockie Ferguson has been ruled out of the three match ODI series against Sri Lanka after sustaining a left calf injury in Monday morning's T20 victory in Dambulla.</p>
        
            <p>Ferguson left the field after experiencing discomfort while bowling his second over and an initial medical assessment indicated that he would not be fit enough to take part in the upcoming 50-over matches.</p>
        
            <p>Ferguson will return home to New Zealand on Tuesday for scans which will determine the extent of the injury and the period of rehabilitation required.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Milne has been called into the squad as Ferguson's replacement and will join the squad in Dambulla on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We're gutted for Lockie," said coach Gary Stead.</p>
        
            <p>"He showed in the space of just two overs what an asset he is with the ball and he's also brought a lot of leadership to this group, so he'll be a big miss heading into an important ODI series for us.</p>
        
            <p>"To be ruled out so early in a tour is always tough to take, but we're hopeful his recovery will be short and he'll be back out on the field in no time.</p>
        
            <p>"Adam is a like-for-like replacement who brings genuine pace and plenty of international experience, so we're looking forward to welcoming him into the group."</p>
        
            <p>The three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka begins on Wednesday in Dambulla.</p>
        
            <p>The T20 series was drawn.</p>
