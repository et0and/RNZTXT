            <p>Petteri Koponen, who has been hailed as one of Europe's most promising basketball coaches, will succeed Mody Maor at the New Zealand Breakers.</p>
        
            <p>Koponen, 36, from Finland, has signed a two-year contract as head coach, with a third-year option.</p>
        
            <p>He will travel to Auckland after his gig as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs at the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, having been identified as a star head coach of the future at the Euroleague next generation tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The invitation to join the Spurs came through those youth Euroleague tournaments where he impressed talent scouts with his coaching abilities.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers owner Matt Walsh said there was strong interest in the position, which was left vacant after they granted Maor a release to head to Japan with one year left on his contract. Maor led the Breakers to the Australian NBL playoffs in both his seasons.</p>
        
            <p>"My goal was to find the best coach to lead the Breakers, and I am very confident we have found the right person for the job,'' Walsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"We ran an exhaustive search that included coaches from all over the world and included former NBA head coaches.</p>
        
            <p>"Petteri was an incredible player who has seamlessly transitioned to coaching and shares my vision of growing the game of basketball in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Koponen played for six seasons in the Euroleague, including with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.</p>
        
            <p>In that time joining the Euroleague's elite 90-50-40 club for players who shoot 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from the arch and 90 percent from the line over the course of a regular season.</p>
        
            <p>He won the EuroCup and made the All-EuroCup First Team in 2015, the Bundesliga in 2018, and the Spanish Cup in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Koponen was also a long-time rep for Finland, retiring after the 2022 EuroBasket tournament after helping the side advance to the quarter-finals for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>He will arrive in Auckland at the end of the month.</p>
