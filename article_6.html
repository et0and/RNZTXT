            <p>Auckland FC v Wellington Phoenix</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 5pm Saturday 7 December</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Mt Smart Stadium, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Live blog updates on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - That came around fast. Just over a month since a new chapter in New Zealand began with the first ever Kiwi Clasico, the nation's two only professional outfits will go head-to-head again for national bragging rights.</p>
        
            <p>On that occasion it was the upstart newcomers, Auckland FC, who outdid their established rivals, Wellington Phoenix by 2-0 at Sky Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>In a game that seemed to be drifting toward a combative stalemate, a mistake from Phoenix goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi gifted Jake Brimmer the chance to score late, with the Australian doubling the lead in the final minute to put the contest to bed.</p>
        
            <p>Now, Auckland are the hosts, in front of a sell-out crowd at Go Media Stadium, in arguably the biggest domestic football match in New Zealand history. Hyperbolic, perhaps, but when was the last time you felt this much of a buzz about the round-ball game in Aotearoa?</p>
        
            <p>Auckland are now top of the A-League and are yet to concede, let alone lose, while the Phoenix's only blemish is the reverse fixture in November - making this seemingly a battle between two of the league's best teams.</p>

            <p>The big question for Auckland this week revolves around their captain Hiroki Sakai, who missed last weekend's win over the Newcastle Jets with a minor hamstring problem. He is in the squad for the game and the consensus is he will shake off the knock in time.</p>
        
            <p>That would mean Callan Elliot dropping to the bench. That might be the only change, but don't be surprised if Neyder Moreno is rewarded for his goalscoring antics off the bench by replacing Logan Rogerson out wide.</p>
        
            <p>Predicted XI: Alex Paulsen (gk); Hiroki Sakai (c), Dan Hall, Nando Pijnaker, Francis de Vries; Louis Verstraete, Felipe Gallegos, Liam Gillion, Neyder Moreno, Jake Brimmer; Guillermo May.</p>

            <p>Giancarlo Italiano will also have the luxury of welcoming back his starting right-back, as Tim Payne returns to play against the club from his hometown. That will likely see Oskar van Hattum drop out of the starting XI.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix have had a couple of weeks off thanks to last weekend's bye, with Sam Sutton also available. But it was not long enough for Fin Roa Conchie to recover from injury - he remains absent.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefy will have decisions to make regarding Matthew Sheridan, Nathan Walker and potentially even Marco Rojas - but don't expect much deviation from what has worked so far.</p>
        
            <p>Predicted XI: Josh Oluwayemi (gk); Tim Payne, Scott Wootton, Isaac Hughes, Matthew Sheridan, Sam Sutton; Alex Rufer (c), Paulo Retre, Kazuki Nagaswa; Hideki Ishige, Kosta Barbarouses.</p>

            <p>"It's something special! It's one to look forward to. The crowd has been amazing the times we have played here. The Port is going to be massive for us this week as well so we are excited. We want to continue what we have started." - Auckland FC head coach Steve Corica.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm buzzing for it. I can't wait. I really want to get them back, because that'll make the final derby really, really interesting and I want to give all the Phoenix supporters a bit of ammo on social media. Hopefully we can get the win and stop their winning streak. I can speak on behalf of all the boys, we're pretty keen to smash them and get rid of that winning streak." - Wellington Phoenix youngster Corban Piper.</p>
        
            <p>How on earth do you predict this one? The common sense in me suggests that Auckland have to concede eventually and they came close against the Jets last week. But I have been thinking that for the past couple of games now, and still they remain defensively resolute. The Phoenix, meanwhile, also have a resolute back line - so all signs would indicate a low-scoring affair.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland are riding a train of momentum at the moment and it's doubtful that a fervent atmosphere in front of home supporters will dampen that.</p>
        
            <p>So a narrow Auckland win, as they continue to pitch their flag in the New Zealand football ground.</p>
