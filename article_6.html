            <p>The formidable rugby duo of Portia and Renee Woodman-Wickliffe are heading to Japan on playing and coaching contracts respectively.</p>
        
            <p>After announcing her retirement from international rugby and following the successful Paris Olympic Games campaign, two-time Olympic champion Portia is set to play fifteens rugby in the Kansai regional and national tournament for Japanese club, Mie Pearls.</p>

            <p>Wife Renee Woodman-Wickliffe - a two-time Rugby World Cup champion herself - is set to take on the assistant coach role, which will see the duo return to the rugby field once again, albeit in different roles.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been fortunate to visit and play in Japan many times with sevens and I've always loved the country, the culture and the people. Having the opportunity to play for the Pearls ... is something I'm really looking forward to," said Portia.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait ... for our whƒÅnau to experience living abroad together, with our daughter Kaia joining us."</p>
        
            <p>For Renee Woodman-Wickliffe, Japan will be a new experience.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an amazing opportunity to further grow as a coach, something I'm hugely passionate about and ... to do so with Portia and Kaia will be a special experience."</p>
        
            <p>Mie Pearls head coach Janna Vaughan welcomed the arrival of the couple.</p>
        
            <p>"Portia's on-field accolades across both sevens and fifteens speak for themselves. Her experience within the game will be a huge asset to the team and the wider club.</p>
        
            <p>"But more than this, I know she is a great person, with a huge heart and a valued teammate, who I'm just pleased I don't need to tackle ever again."</p>
        
            <p>Vaughan added: "Having Renee sign with us as an assistant coach is the icing on the cake. Her wealth of knowledge and rugby IQ is invaluable and will play a pivotal part for our campaign and winning the national title this season. Her ability to connect players and bring positive connections and culture to our environment is also significant."</p>
        
            <p>The pair will join the club ahead of the season in late October and be based there until early February.</p>
