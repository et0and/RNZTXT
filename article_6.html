            <p>There's been a twist in the tail of Sam Cane's career, as the former All Black captain walked in as part of Scott Robertson's extended squad at the test season launch today in Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Cane, along with Will Jordan and Josh Lord, was part of the group assembled at the NZCIS complex for a signing session and media opportunity, in preparation for next Saturday's first test again England in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>None of the three had been initially named in Robertson's 32-man squad, with Cane and Jordan on a list alongside Samisoni Taukei'aho and Cam Roigard as players not considered due to injury.</p>
        
            <p>The 95-test veteran did not talk to media after a signing session with local school children, however his inclusion in the launch is an indication that he may be part of new coach Robertson's plans. The All Blacks play 14 tests this season and the attrition rate is likely to be high, even with a very crowded loose forward picture.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, newly anointed vice-captain Jordie Barrett said that he was "extremely privileged" to be part of the All Black leadership set up.</p>
        
            <p>"Razor asked me if I wanted to step into that role alongside some great leaders… it's an exciting phase," said Barrett, whose brother Scott has been named captain, while other brother Beauden has also led the side in a match against the Barbarians in 2017.</p>

            <p>"I called him and asked him (Beauden) about it.He just said go for it, walk towards the opportunity and enjoy it. It's a privileged title to have… England aren't far away."</p>
        
            <p>For his part, Beauden Barrett was happy to be back in the All Black environment after a season playing in the Japanese Rugby League One for Toyota Verblitz. He said he was feeling mentally refreshed after the experience in Tokyo, as well as proud of brother Jordie's elevation to vice-captain.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super proud, as a big brother. I'll be right behind him, supporting him. We're all into it together, ultimately," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks will stay at the highly regarded NZCIS facility until Tuesday of next week, when they head to Dunedin for the test at Forsyth Barr Stadium.</p>
