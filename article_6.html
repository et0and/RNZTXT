            <p>The Australian bowlers ripped through the Black Caps batting lineup on the opening day of the second cricket test at Hagley Oval in Christchurch but the extended final session of the day belonged to Matt Henry.</p>
        
            <p>After being sent in to bat New Zealand were all out for 162 just before tea.</p>
        
            <p>In reply, Australia were 124-4 at stumps. Just 38 runs behind New Zealand's total.</p>
        
            <p>Marnus Labuschagne on 45 and Nathan Lyon on 1 will be at the crease to start day two.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand survived the opening hour of play unscathed before Will Young was the first to be dimissed for 14 by Mitchell Starc.</p>
        
            <p>The wicket allowed Starc to equal Dennis Lillee on 365 test wickets and move into joint fourth on Australia's all-time list.</p>
        
            <p>Young's dismissal ended at 47-run partnership with Tom Latham.</p>
        
            <p>Latham did not last much longer and got out for 38 - the highest score by a New Zealand batter in the low-scoring innings.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts were 71-3 at lunch.</p>
        
            <p>In his 100th test Kane Williamson made just 17 as he was the second wicket to fall after lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips made two while Scott Kuggeleijn's struggles on the test scene continued when he was out first ball.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell got through to 22 before being dismissed leaving New Zealand reeling at 107-8.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Tim Southee and Henry then combined for a quickfire 55-run, ninth wicket stand before Southee was dismissed for 26 while Henry was the last to go for 29.</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowler Josh Hazelwood was the chief destroyer, taking 5-31 for his 12th five wicket haul in tests while Starc finished with 3-59.</p>
        
            <p>With little to defend New Zealand needed their bowlers to step up and Henry did.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Sears in his test debut claimed Australia's first wicket getting Steve Smith out for 11.</p>
        
            <p>Henry then got Usman Khawaja (16), first test hero Cameron Green for 25 and Travis Head caught behind for 21.</p>
        
            <p>Henry told TVNZ at stumps despite things not going New Zealand's way with the bat they "knew how to operate out here" with the ball to put Australia under pressure.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that we started with the ball [with Sears] we could create some pressure from both ends that was something we talked about making sure we did that for long enough. They kind of put the pressure back on us a little bit there but we managed to grab it back, taking wickets is key out here."</p>
        
            <p>Henry said it was a new ball wicket and Saturday morning would be a big for the hosts' bowlers.</p>
        
            <p>In their three innings against Australia this series, New Zealand has failed to reach 200 each time.</p>
        
            <p>Australia lead the two-match series 1-0 after a comprehensive win in the first test in Wellington.</p>
