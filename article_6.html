            <p>Only one New Zealand able-bodied female swimmer has won an Olympic medal - and that was 72 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin's Erika Fairweather could be about to emulate Jean Stewart from the 1952 Helsinki Games.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old has arrived in Paris as a world champion after claiming New Zealand's first ever world championship title with victory in the 400m freestyle in Doha earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>She also won silver and bronze in other events in her favoured stroke at the same meet.</p>

            <p>While a number of the world's best missed that meeting, she will still be considered a medal prospect at this Games.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always special getting to compete at this level, so much hard work goes on behind the scenes to prepare for the Olympics and I can't wait to showcase it," the 20-year-old said.</p>
        
            <p>Born: 31 December 2003</p>
        
            <p>Māori (Ngāi Tahu)</p>
        
            <p>Based in Dunedin</p>
        
            <p>Olympic events: Women's 800m, 400m, 200m freestyle and 4x200m freestyle relay</p>

            <p>One third of New Zealand's swim team of nine belong to the Neptune club and train at the Moana Pool in Dunedin, the home of two-time Olympic swimming champion Danyon Loader.</p>
        
            <p>One of the three is Caitlin Deans who has been a training buddy of Fairweather since they were kids.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been training partners since before I can remember, we both learnt to swim here.</p>
        
            <p>"Having the three of us that train together, day in and day out, getting selected in the team together is just so special," Deans said.</p>
        
            <p>The third member of the Dunedin trio is Kane Follows.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023 Fairweather won world championship bronze in the 400m event, sharing the podium with swimming superstars Katie Ledecky and Ariane Titmus.</p>
        
            <p>It was a turning point.</p>
        
            <p>"I've gained a new sense of confidence in my ability.</p>
        
            <p>"Going into worlds I didn't back myself to be in the medals to be honest, I was thinking I could make a final but I'd be going for 4th, 5th, 6th. Now going forward I think that was a giant mistake, I think I should be reaching higher.</p>
        
            <p>"It was definitely something I wasn't expecting, I was in a race that was so hyped up so I didn't think I had a chance. To touch that wall and turn around and see the three beside my name was really cool."</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic swimming events start on 27 July and run through until 4 August.</p>
