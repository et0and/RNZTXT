            <p>Britannia have defeated Luna Rossa 7-4 to win the Louis Vuitton Cup and secure their place in the 37th America's Cup Match, where they will face the defender Team New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Britannia led from the start of race 11, taking a 10 second lead at Gate 1 and maintaining that lead at all seven gates, despite the Italian team Luna Rossa strongly challenging, and forcing them to keep a close cover throughout.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Ainslie's team eventually posted a 17 second victory in Barcelona this morning to clinch the overall win 7-4 to become the official Challenger for the 37th America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Over the first eight races there was nothing to separate the top two Challengers but on the final two days of the series, Britannia eked out a performance advantage that proved enough for them to win three straight races.</p>
        
            <p>It was an impressive effort from Britannia, over the vastly experienced 2021 America's Cup runners-up Luna Rossa of Italy, skippered by Jimmy Spithill.</p>
        
            <p>It is over 60 years since Great Britain had a yacht compete for the America's Cup trophy.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand and Britannia will go head to head in the Americas Cup sail racing - in a first-to-seven race series, which will begin on 12 October.</p>
