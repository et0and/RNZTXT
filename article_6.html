        <h2>Metcalf retains halfback role in unchanged Warriors line-up</h2>
        <p>
Coach Andrew Webster has kept faith in the team that lost to Canberra Raiders in Las Vegas.

            <p>Halfback Luke Metcalf will occupy the driver's seat again for NZ Warriors, when they host Manly Sea Eagles at Go Media Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>True to his word, coach Andrew Webster has stuck with the same line-up that wilted under the bright lights of Las Vegas two weeks ago, bowing to Canberra Raiders 30-8 in their NRL season-opener.</p>
        
            <p>With the retirement of Warriors stalwart Shaun Johnson, Metcalf was handed the coveted No.7 jersey, but didn't enjoy the happiest of days, providing the match-defining moment, when his pass near the tryline was intercepted and resulted in a length-of-the-field try to Raiders wing Xavier Savage.</p>
        
            <p>Webster's message to his half was to "back himself", when he matched up against one of the competitions best - and oldest - performers, Daly Cherry-Evans.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, Luke had such a good pre-season and I thought he was fantastic in the trials," said Webster. "I just want him to not care about anything else, but going after the moment and enjoying it.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't be shy at all, be excited and back yourself. He's a helluva player and we've got so much faith in him."</p>
        
            <p>Webster hoped the Warriors faithful would allow his charge some leeway, as he found his feet in his unaccustomed position.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd love fans to always be patient, but they'll see a really good football player in Luke Metcalf," he said. "He'll be a really good NRL player and I believe he can be this week.</p>
        
            <p>"He wasn't perfect last week, but we're certainly not hanging it on Luke. I think the fans have already seen moments of what Luke can do, and when we put it all together for him - the forwards go forward, the defence is better, our outside backs do their job - guys like Luke will be able to shine."</p>
        
            <p>While Webster has opted for the same starting unit named against Canberra, he pulled a last-minute switch before kickoff, moving Jackson Ford from the bench to the front row, co-captain Mitch Barnett to lock and Erin Clark to the interchange.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Manly have made one change to their line-up, with former Kiwi international and one-game Warrior Siosiua Taukeiaho sidelined by a knee injury and replaced by Josh Aloiai in the front row.</p>
