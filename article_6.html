            <p>Matt Henry has brought the Black Caps back into the second test against Australia with a stunning spell of bowling at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>Henry took 7/67, record figures for New Zealand against Australia in New Zealand, to dismiss the tourists after lunch on day two, conceding a 94 run lead.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old seamer told TVNZ early wickets were absolutely crucial.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good to finally get them out, there is obviously a lot of work to do but pleased that we did get the job done today."</p>
        
            <p>He said the pitch should continue to offer something for the bowlers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's slowed up a bit, there will be enough there with the new ball, they showed with Labuschagne that if you get stuck in there are runs to be had, there is always bounce here at Hagley and that keeps the bowlers in the game so it's about being as accurate as possible and sticking to your plans."</p>
        
            <p>Ending day one at 124/4 after the Black Caps capitulated to 162 all out, Nathan Lyon was first out this morning, Henry claiming his fourth scalp.</p>
        
            <p>Henry had Mitch Marsh trapped in front for a duck shortly after, Southee opting to successfully review the original decision of not out.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips got in on the action, sending Alex Carey back to the pavilion for 14 before Southee claimed the crucial wicket of Labuschagne for 90.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Starc and Pat Cummins eked out some runs from the tail before Henry finished off the innings to claim seven wickets as Australia took a 94 run lead.</p>
        
            <p>Will Young was out early in the second innings for just one bringing Kane Williamson and Tom Latham together.</p>
        
            <p>The pair put on a patient century partnership to chip away at Australia's lead.</p>
        
            <p>Both men reached fifty shortly before the final hour, Latham bringing his up off 110 balls with a slash to the boundary through point.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson brought up the century stand just six balls later, and notched his 34th test fifty the following delivery.</p>
        
            <p>Having closed the deficit and with a lead of 17, Williamson dragged Cummins back onto his stumps on 55.</p>
        
            <p>Rachin Ravindra dug in with Latham to finish the day unbeaten with the Kiwis 134 for two, a lead of 40.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson told TVNZ it was a tense final hour.</p>
        
            <p>"Nice to get a little bit of luck and put together a bit of a partnership and hopefully tomorrow we can put a few more on there."</p>
        
            <p>Williamson said the Australians made things they made things tough out there.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just about implementing our plans there is a bit still in the surface and credit to Tommy Latham who has led the way, and played beautifully but there is plenty of work to do tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Day three will resume at 11am with Ravindra on 11 and Latham 65.</p>
