            <p>New Zealand judo athletes Sydnee Andrews and Moira Koster both say they're honoured after being named to compete at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Koster has booked her ticket to a second Games, 12 years after she first competed at Olympic level.</p>
        
            <p>She will be joined by Olympic debutant Sydnee Andrews, who showcased her talent in winning bronze at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>Since competing at London 2012 a lot has changed for Koster, who has married partner and fellow judoka Jason Koster, with the pair having a child.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long journey for me," Koster said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such an incredible honour to be able to represent my country again at the Olympic Games, 12 years on from my first. None of this would be possible without my whole team on and off the mat.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope my performance inspires them and makes them proud, knowing that their support has been instrumental in helping me get here."</p>

            <p>Koster is New Zealand's most experienced female judoka.</p>
        
            <p>She is a two-time Commonwealth Games medallist and has won a bronze medal at a World Cup, and gold, three silver and six bronze medals at Continental Opens.</p>
        
            <p>Koster almost didn't make the team, suffering a serious injury in April as she competed in the bronze medal final of Pan American Games in Brazil.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't get up to finish the fight and I had to be wheeled through the airport," Koster said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since then, I've been extremely stubborn and have worked incredibly hard to get back to this level of fitness. I'm now feeling really strong and am getting good numbers in the gym so again a massive shoutout to my team who have been fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Gisborne raised 21-year-old Andrews has relocated to the United Kingdom, where she is based at the Camberly Judo Club.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews won bronze at both the Rome Open and the Zagreb Grand Prix in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Being speechless for me isn't a thing but I can't find the words to describe how I'm feeling right now," Andrews said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am truly honoured, excited, grateful and proud to be going and representing my country at the Olympic Games. It proves that hard work does pay off and never giving up on what you want in life. I'm still young so it's the first of many to come hopefully."</p>
