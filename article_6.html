            <p>Warriors forward Zyon Maiu'u has had his dangerous tackle charge downgraded at the NRL judiciary.</p>
        
            <p>Maiu'u was sent off mid-way through the first half of their pre-season game against West Tigers in Christchurch on Sunday for a high shot on Tigers centre Declan Casey.</p>
        
            <p>Casey spent ten minutes on the ground before being taken off on a strethcer.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors decided not to take an early gulity plea and faced losing the prop for four games.</p>
        
            <p>Maiu'u was found guilty at the judiciary but was successful in having a Grade 2 Reckless High Tackle charge downgraded to a Grade 3 Careless High Tackle, resulting in a two-game ban.</p>
        
            <p>The 21 year old Maiu'u played for the Warriors reserves last year and is yet to make his NRL debut.</p>
        
            <p>He won't be available for their opening two games against the Sharks and the Storm.</p>
