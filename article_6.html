            <p>The Warriors have been dealt a stark reality check by the Dragons after slumping to St George 30-12 in Wollongong.</p>
        
            <p>It was a dominant opening twenty from the Warriors, but they faded badly, conceding tries either side of halftime which essentially shut the gate on them.</p>
        
            <p>Zac Lomax ran the show for the Dragons, bagging a try, four conversions and a two point field goal in a stunning individual effort.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors coach Andrew Webster said it was an uncharacteristic performance from his team.</p>
        
            <p>"We completely lost the ruck, they blew us away and off the back of some poor discipline I thought we lost our way defensively."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said they would need to work on their attitude on defence ahead of their clash with the Gold Coast in six days time.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys are going to get to play soon and make it right which is really cool because I know the boys are really disappointed with the way they went tonight."</p>
        
            <p>Webster conceded that after a tough month, a poor performance was possibly due.</p>
        
            <p>"We have three or four hard games in a row so maybe it could have been coming but I certainly didn't see signs of that this week during our preparations."</p>
        
            <p>Warriors captain Tohu Harris said you can't afford to give a side as dangerous as the Dragons momentum.</p>
        
            <p>"They ran hard all night long, to start the game we had some really good moments but they just did it for longer tonight and we just stopped working well together and lost that physical battle."</p>
        
            <p>Dragons captain Ben Hunt told Fox Sports it was their best performance of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"The most pleasing thing was our defence, we just kept turning them away, to keep the Warriors to 12 is a real achievement."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt said Lomax delivered another masterful effort.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been special all year, not just his class but his work rate, he does a lot of heavy lifting for our side."</p>
        
            <p>The halfback said the sky was the limit for his side in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can keep performing we can show we are a finals team, the big challenge for us is to do it every week, it's been a bit patchy so far this season so we need to stay consistent."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors meanwhile were listless at times, Charnze Nicholl-Klokstad held to less than half his first half running metres after the break.</p>
        
            <p>Tackles counts were high with Wayde Egan, Kurt Capewell and skipper Tohu Harris all nearing 50 but other than a typically spectacular finish from Dallin Watene-Zelezniak, the Warriors failed to fire any real shots with ball in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Tonight's defeat brings the Warriors season record to three wins, three losses and a draw.</p>
        
            <p>It will be a short turnaround for the Warriors, who host the Titans in an Anzac Day clash on Thursday.</p>
