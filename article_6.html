            <p>With the ASB Classic women's wrapping up on Sunday, it's time to turn our attention to the men. This will be the final tune up for everyone heading on to the Australian Open, but also there are some valuable ranking points to be picked up - as well as the opportunity to gather some important momentum as the new season starts.</p>
        
            <p>We only need to look as far as last year's champion to see how important that is, and we welcome back some old faces as well as new talent. Here's who to look out for:</p>
        
            <p>The young American is living up to the hype so far in his young career. He finished 2024 ranked 21 in the world and making the semi-finals at the US Open in 2023, he is definitely one of the most exciting prospects of the new wave of American players.</p>

            <p>New Zealand-raised Norrie returns to Auckland after a tough season in 2024, one that saw him drop out of the top 50 for the first time since 2020. That was due to a bicep injury that kept him out for three months, a gap that saw him miss the US Open, so his appearance this year will hopefully be the start of a resurgence at age 29. It feels like Norrie has a few good years left, a win here would be great for the tournament as it's something that he's been trying to tick off for a while now. It would certainly make up for last year, when he cruised through to the semis only to suffer an injury that ruled him out.</p>

            <p>The main benefactor of Norrie withdrawing was Chilean Tabilo, a relative unknown who had spent most of the tournament toiling away on the back courts. Tabilo went on to not only win the tournament, but continue on with a very impressive season, rocketing up from 100th in the world to 23 by the end of the year. It's fair to say he will not be flying under the radar as much this time around.</p>

            <p>The French veteran and crowd favourite is back in action for his 22nd season on tour, starting back at the ASB Classic for the third time and second year in a row. While the 38-year-old is in the twilight of his career, he still managed to put in perhaps the best match of last year's tournament when he lost to Hungarian Fábián Marozsán in a third set tiebreaker.</p>

            <p>Kiwi Isaac Becroft gets a chance to play in an ATP event, after winning the playoff tournament in Te Anau last weekend. He's drawn qualifier Zizou Bergs from Belgium, and with a ranking gap of 930 places between them, it'll be a tall order for Becroft.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton, Tabilo, Francisco Cerundolo and Sebastian Baez all get a free pass to the second round, as the top four seeds.</p>
        
            <p>Is looking good all week!</p>
