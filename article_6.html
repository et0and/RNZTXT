            <p>Defending champion Blues Women are still stacked with plenty of Black Ferns talent, with coach Willie Walker saying he had been aiming for the right mix of experience and youth.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've recruited well," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"The additions we've made will only add to a strong returning group of players from last season. I'm proud of the way we've been able to retain a lot of our squad, it makes me think we've got the culture and vibe right if players want to come back and play for us," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Chryss Viliko, Aldora Itunu, Sophie Fisher, Cheyenne Tuli-Fale, Harono Te Iringa, Awhina Tangen-Wainohu, Atlanta Lolohea, Oceane Donelley, Maiakawanakaulani Roos, Eloise Blackwell, Maama Mo'onia Vaipulu, Liana Mikaele-Tu'u, Elizabith Moimoi, Lemalu Dajian Brown, Paris Mataroa, Holly Greenway, Lily Murray-Wihongi, Kahlia Awa, Tara-Leigh Turner, Ruahei Demant, Krysten Cottrell, Sylvia Brunt, Daynah Nankivell, Portia Woodman-Wickliffe, Patricia Maliepo, Katelyn Vahaakolo, Jaymie Kolose, Kerri Johnson, Braxton Sorensen-McGee, Danii Mafoe</p>

            <p>Chiefs Manawa coach Dwayne Sweeney has the advantage of being able to tap into a powerful Waikato side that won this year's FPC title. Kelly Brazier and fellow Black Fern Sevens standout and NRLW finalist Tenika Willison have signed on and prop Santo Taumata makes her much-anticipated return from injury.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be biased, but Waikato were immense during FPC this season and earned their title. We have selected several of our rookies from within that team as across the competition; we feel they were the best of that next generation of players," Sweeney said.</p>
        
            <p>Ariana Bayler, Azalleyah Maaka, Charmaine Smith, Chyna Hohepa, Grace Houpapa-Barrett, Grace Kukutai, Hazel Tubic, Jade Coates, Kate Henwood, Kelly Brazier, Kennedy Tukuafu (nee Simon), Kiriana Nolan, Krystal Murray, Logan Hauraki, Luka Connor, Mererangi Paul, Mia Anderson, Reese Anderson, Renee Holmes, Rosie Kelly, Ruby Tui, Santo Taumata, Shoshanah Seumanutafa, Tanya Kalounivale, Tenika Willison, Veisinia Mahutariki Fakalelu.
