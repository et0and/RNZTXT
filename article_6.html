            <p>Tauranga Whai have proved stormed to their first Tauihi national women's basketball crown with an emphatic 90-71 win over Wellington's Tokomanawa Queens in Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>It was a remarkable turnaround for the Alex Stojkovic-coached Whai, who won their first match and then dropped their next five as they battled without injured stars Mikayla Cowling and Morgan Yeager .</p>
        
            <p>But with Cowling and Yeager back and McKenna Dale arriving from the US, they hit their straps as the season wore on, upsetting last year's champions KƒÅhu 76-63 in the semi-finals and entering the final confident in their fast-paced game.</p>
        
            <p>The Queens won the inaugural title two years ago, but had to settle for being beaten finalists two years in a row as they found themselves outclassed on the day.</p>
        
            <p>The Whai sped to a 12-point first quarter lead, with Ashley Joens signalling their style of attack with an early three point jump shot, followed up by Dale with two more from beyond the arc.</p>
        
            <p>They dominated the second quarter, extending their lead to 20 and it was 68-47 at the end of the third quarter, and they held their nerve in the final quarter to register a comfortable victory.</p>

            <p>Yaeger, named the final's MVP, led the way on points, with 19 plus four assists, backed up by Dale (16) and Lara McSpadden (14).</p>
        
            <p>Louise Brown never gave up for the Queens, also scoring 19 points, recording five assists and 17 rebounds, while Jihyun Park scored 17.</p>
        
            <p>Dale, whose parents travelled from Connecticut for the final, said getting healthy and belief were the two planks for turning their season around.</p>
        
            <p>"We never give up. We trusted in each other, we trusted the process, our coaches trusted us and believed in us, and I think that really brought us together and we found our stride," she told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Lou Brown said she was proud of her team for making the final for the third year in a row.</p>
        
            <p>She had a succinct reason for the Whai's success. "They can shoot the heck out of it."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the Whai's broken style of play and notching three pointers was a tough style to guard against.</p>
