            <p>New Zealand pole-vaulter Eliza McCartney is about to return to the Olympic arena, eight years after she last competed.</p>
        
            <p>McCartneystormed onto the world stage aged 19 with a bronze medal at the Rio 2016 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Since then her career has been blighted with injuries which meant she was unable at the compete at the Tokyo Games.</p>
        
            <p>She remains cautious about injuries which has meant she has had limited competition in the build-up to Paris.</p>
        
            <p>McCartney told RNZ she would have liked to have had more competition, but she hasn't let it bother her.</p>
        
            <p>"I have very little choice these days which is fine because it means that I do get to compete and train, but just not in the way I use to.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be hard when I see everyone else competing every weekend, but I've been rewarded this year by being patient and doing what we know works for me."</p>
        
            <p>McCartney has been working closely with new lead pole-vault coach for Athletics New Zealand, Scott Simpson for the last nine months.</p>

            <p>"We know the best approach for me, I just have to keep following that and I know it will work.</p>
        
            <p>There was a four-year period from 2018 to 2022 when the Auckland athlete was hit with injury after injury and many wondered if she would ever return to the runway.</p>
        
            <p>But she is back and this year managed 4.84m in France and won silver at the World Indoor Championships.</p>
        
            <p>She continues to have a few achilles tendon niggles and has taken a conservative approach in her build-up to the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"My coach comes with a wealth of knowledge when it comes to pole-vault specific achilles injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't take anything for granted and real gratitude for what I get to do for a job, nothing is guaranteed and expect anything."</p>
        
            <p>Nothing was expected of McCartney when she competed and won a bronze medal in Rio in 2016 and she admits she takes a similar attitude into Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to have the same feelings but it's for different reasons.</p>
        
            <p>"The less expectation I have and the more enjoyment I have for just doing what I love, the better my performance is."</p>
        
            <p>McCartney along with Olivia McTaggart and Imogen Ayris start the pole-vault competition on 5 August.</p>
