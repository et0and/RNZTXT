            <p>Former Manchester United and Scotland forward Denis Law has died at the age of 84, the Premier League club said on Friday (local time).</p>
        
            <p>"It is with a heavy heart that we tell you our father Denis Law has sadly passed away. He fought a tough battle but finally he is now at peace," a family statement shared by United said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to thank everyone who contributed to his wellbeing and care, past and much more recently.</p>
        
            <p>"We know how much people supported and loved him and that love was always appreciated and made the difference. Thank you."</p>
        
            <p>Law began his career at Huddersfield Town but made a name for himself at United where he spent 11 years, winning the league title in 1965 and 1967, and the 1968 European Cup.</p>

            <p>He scored 237 goals in 404 appearances for United, becoming the third top scorer in the club's history behind Wayne Rooney (253) and Bobby Charlton (249).</p>
        
            <p>Law, known as "The King", became the only Scotsman to win the Ballon d'Or and the European Player of the Year award, claiming both honours in 1964.</p>
        
            <p>The former Manchester City and Torino player remains Scotland's all-time leading scorer with 30 goals in 55 caps after making his international debut in 1958 at the age of 18.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone at Manchester United is mourning the loss of Denis Law, the King of the Stretford End, who has passed away, aged 84," United added in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"He will always be celebrated as one of the club's greatest and most beloved players. The ultimate goal-scorer, his flair, spirit and love for the game made him the hero of a generation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our deepest condolences go out to Denis' family and many friends. His memory will live on forever more."</p>
