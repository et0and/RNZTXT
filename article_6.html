            <p>Former Australia flyhalf Matt Giteau will return to professional rugby at the age of 41 after signing with American club San Diego Legion for the 2024 season of Major League Rugby (MLR).</p>
        
            <p>Giteau, who played for MLR club LA Giltinis before they folded last year, announced his retirement in February, joking that he had "milked the game and contracts dry".</p>
        
            <p>"We are over the moon to secure Matt's services for the upcoming season," San Diego coach Danny Lee said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"He is a world-class player who will bring an incredible wealth of knowledge, a competitive attitude, and a drive to succeed with him that will no doubt spread throughout the squad."</p>
        
            <p>The 103-test Wallaby played at three World Cups and had a key role in Australia's run to the 2015 final in England.</p>
        
            <p>He also won seven elite competition trophies across the globe in his two-decade career, including titles in Australia, France, Japan and the U.S. in 2021 with the short-lived Giltinis.</p>
