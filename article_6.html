            <p>Taranaki have beaten Tasman 42-29 in Nelson and won rugby's coveted Ranfurly shield in the process</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki will get to lock the shield away for the rest of the season and have a chance to complete the ultimate double.</p>
        
            <p>With Sunday's win, Taranaki are second on the NPC ladder and will meet Waikato in the quarter-finals, which have all been finalised.</p>
        
            <p>Top of the table Wellington will play Counties-Manukau, Bay of Plenty will play Hawke's Bay, and Tasman will meet Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>In their last four Ranfurly Shield challenges, Taranaki have won it three times and had the upper hand from the get-go today.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki scored two tries in the first half through Daniel Rona and Michael Loft, before Tasman player Jack Gray scored the third try of the match.</p>
        
            <p>But Taranaki first-five Josh Jacomb did a lot of damage with the boot, converting all tries and penalties in the first half to lead his side 23-8 at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Sail then scored a try early in the second half for Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki then replied with two quick tries through Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, and Rona.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman player Ryan Coxon then scored before All Black David Havili converted his own try.</p>
        
            <p>Suddenly Tasman were trailing 35-29 - just a converted try away from a win but every time it looked like they were getting close, Taranaki had an answer.</p>
        
            <p>That answer was a try through Adam Lennox, and another conversion from Jacomb, putting it out of reach.</p>
