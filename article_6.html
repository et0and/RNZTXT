            <p>Almost 1000 athletes are jumping, flipping, twisting and balancing in Palmerston North this week at the national gymnastics championships.</p>
        
            <p>Olympic trampolinists Maddie Davidson and Dylan Schmidt are the star attractions in the chalky, sweaty arenas, filled with clapping, music and moves.</p>

            <p>But there are dozens of other talented gymnasts on show, such as Jaimie Le Bas, from Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>She is only 25, but has competed at nationals since 2008.</p>
        
            <p>This year she is coaching and judging other events, while performing in the aerobic gymnastics section.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the one on the wooden floor, where we're doing some push-ups and a lot of aerobic elements. It's kind of like 1980s-style, but more gymnastics based."</p>
        
            <p>She looks the part.</p>
        
            <p>"I've gone for some yellow eye shadow, matching the Taranaki colours and to match my leotard as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's really into it. We've got a bumble bee theme this year. You'll see us wandering around with some little antennas on."</p>

            <p>Like many others, Le Bas relishes the national champs as a chance to catch up with fellow athletes, after many hours often training alone.</p>
        
            <p>But it is not all bad.</p>
        
            <p>"There's nothing cooler than going to the gym and you're doing a flip. Not many people can do that."</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt and Davidson were proving popular among the throng, having just finished a meet and greet with young competitors when RNZ caught up with them.</p>
        
            <p>"We've done a couple of signings. It's cool to see the kids get involved and get excited to see us, and we're excited to see them," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We generally don't get to go to nationals unless it's an Olympic year because we're always away. This is the first nationals in three years that we've been able to get to," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>Both said it was nice to hear of people staying up all night to watch them compete in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Their paths to the Olympics began at the national champs.</p>
        
            <p>"We were at nationals and we loved it. I definitely have memories of being a kid running around in gyms like this, going crazy and enjoying the trip," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>"My first nationals were in 2008. It's definitely a big competition and I think it sets the fire for wanting to do bigger comps," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt missed out on a medal this year at Paris, after picking up bronze in Tokyo, but he and Davidson will still prove popular when they compete today and tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Then they will have a few months away from the sport and get back to their day jobs - Davidson at a gym club and Schmidt at PWC.</p>
        
            <p>There are about 900 gymnasts at the competition from throughout New Zealand, and about 1000 people watching what is going on in each of the two arenas.</p>

Artistic gymnastics is along the five disciplines on show in Palmerston North this week.

            <p>Event manager Jenny Jujnovich is having some long days.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got five different codes. We have artistic, which is men and women. We have rhythmic. We have aerobics. Then we have trampoline and tumbling, but within trampoline we also have double and mini tramp, so in total there's actually seven events."</p>
        
            <p>On the sidelines the noise is tremendous, as are the somersaults.</p>
        
            <p>Among the spectators is proud mum Ronda.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm from Christchurch and I'm supporting [son] Jorden O'Connell-Inns. He represented New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games at Birmingham a couple of years ago."</p>
        
            <p>He was in the men's artistic team.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been doing gymnastics since he was 5 years old. He's now 27.</p>
        
            <p>"I put him in ballet at 4 and at 5 and a half he wanted to have a go at gymnastics, and he's done it ever since."</p>
        
            <p>Even former competitors cannot stay away, such as Aimee Jules, from Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to be a gymnast for 12 years and now this is my fourth nationals photographing it.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when you grow up in gymnastics it's like a full-time job. It's a big family so it's nice to come back."</p>
        
            <p>Even young gymnasts put in plenty of work, such as 13-year-old Lily Richardson, from Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>She competes in artistic gymnastics.</p>
        
            <p>"I did all right. I came eighth place, which isn't very good for me.</p>
        
            <p>"We do about 12 hours' training a week, after school from 4-8 on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays."</p>
        
            <p>The championships finish on Saturday, and Schmidt and Davidson are giving a trampoline exhibition at 4pm.</p>
