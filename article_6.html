            <p>Ardie Savea's first game as captain of Moana Pasifika has ended in heartbreaking defeat to the Force. The 45-44 result was sealed with a try four minutes after the hooter to Wallaby first five Ben Donaldson, who sprinted 80 metres to score under the posts, then knocked over the simple conversion to give his side the win.</p>
        
            <p>The game featured 12 tries in sunny conditions at HBF Park in Perth, finishing off a wild opening round of the competition. Moana came in with high hopes and were making good on their intent to play attractive rugby by racing to a 17-3 lead thanks to two tries to William Havili and a Jackson Garden-Bachop drop goal.</p>
        
            <p>The Force answered back with Carlo Tizzano grabbing a double of his own, with Moana holding a slender 27-24 lead at the break. The tries kept coming in the second half, with Moana's impressive young winger Kyren Taumoefolau picking up where he left off last year and then halfback Jonathan Taumateine looking to have given them enough of a lead with a try in the 73rd minute.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Force didn't accept the defeat, hitting back in the dying stages through Dylan Pietsch and then Donaldson who benefitted from some tired Moana defence. Despite the result, there was plenty to like about Moana's first up performance under Savea's captaincy, especially a very dominant scrum and effective set piece.</p>
