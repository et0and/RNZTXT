            <p>T20 World Cup winning coach Ben Sawyer has been reappointed White Ferns coach for two more years.</p>
        
            <p>The extension until December 2026 means he'll be at the helm for the 2025 ODI World Cup in India and the T20 title defence in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Sawyer has been in charge since June 2022.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket head of women's high performance Liz Green said it was important Sawyer had a chance to build on the good work already underway.</p>
        
            <p>"He's unlocked a lot of belief and trust in this group and to have him stay now is massive, both for the current squad and the long-term planning for the White Ferns, Green said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of our young players who made their international debut on Ben's first tour two years ago are starting to thrive, as we saw in the recent T20 World Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Captain Sophie Devine said Sawyer's reappointment would provide stability.</p>
        
            <p>"The team is in a great spot right now so I think locking him in for another two years and having that consistency will be big for us."</p>
        
            <p>The squad to take on Australia in the three-match ODI series at Wellington's Cello Basin reserve will be named later this week.</p>
        
            <p>The newly crowned ICC T20 World Champions will display their World Cup trophy at the upcoming matches, giving fans the chance to see it up close and capture photos.</p>
        
            <p>Rose Bowl schedule:</p>
