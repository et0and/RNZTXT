            <p>Wellington Phoenix women's coach Paul Temple has lamented a "tentative" spell as they opened their A-League season with a 4-2 loss to Western United in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix were punished for a lacklustre 23-minute spell in the first half in which they conceded all four goals, having opened the scoring.</p>
        
            <p>"It's tough to comprehend really what went on in that 20-minute period in the first half," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we started the game really well and we were clearly the team in the ascendancy. We had them pegged back and it was attack after attack really.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't think we used that dominance in their box to score goals. We were a bit tentative and didn't really take those good opportunities when we got in behind them, but we deserved to be one-nil up.</p>
        
            <p>"And ultimately if you defend like we did for that 20 minutes, there's no way you're going to win games at this level.</p>
        
            <p>"It was sort of mistake after mistake and ultimately cost us the game."</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington side featuring three debutantes in the starting side - Carolina Vilão, Maya McCutcheon and Mebae Tanaka - were more competitive than the final scoreline indicated.</p>
        
            <p>They had their share of chances during an end-to-end first half but went to the interval trailing 4-1.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix had gone ahead in the 15th minute when Alyssa Whinham won the ball high up the pitch and delivered a dangerous left-footed cross into the six-yard box, which Western's Sasha Grove turned into her own net under pressure from Tanaka.</p>
        
            <p>However, Western captain Chloe Logarzo equalised from the following kick-off when she slipped in behind the Wellington back three, kick-starting the home side's run of goals.</p>

            <p>Aimee Medwin slotted home Western's second, before Kahli Johnson and Logarzo scored before the break.</p>
        
            <p>Temple responded by making three changes, introducing Lara Wall - on debut - and Zoe McMeeken, along with midfielder Daisy Brazendale.</p>
        
            <p>The second half was less open and Wellington scored the only goal through Emma Main from the penalty spot after Wall was fouled.</p>
        
            <p>Temple said there was still "lots to like" about the performance, notably the second-half response.</p>
        
            <p>"Other teams may have crumbled more and the way that they came out and attacked, went for it, took risks and played some good football," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We ended up winning the second half but by that stage we'd given ourselves a tough mountain to climb.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there's any massive systematic changes (that need to be made) or anything. It's a new system and it's always going to come with bumps in the road and for 20 minutes it was bad."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington next face Canberra United in their opening home match of the season at Porirua Park on Sunday next week.</p>
