            <p>All Blacks prop Ethan de Groot has been ruled out of the two Rugby Championship tests in South Africa because of injury.</p>
        
            <p>De Groot has not recovered from a neck injury sustained two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>He has been replaced in the squad by George Bower.</p>
        
            <p>De Groot, 26, was taken off after 59 minutes of the 38-30 defeat to Argentina in Wellington on 10 August and did not feature against the same opposition a week later as New Zealand won 42-10.</p>
        
            <p>Bower, 32, played the first of his 21 tests in 2021 but was not part of the original squad to tour South Africa named by new coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>He missed much of 2023 with a serious knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand take on the world champions at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on 31 August and a week later in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa have a maximum 10 points from their opening two wins over Australia, five more than New Zealand.</p>
