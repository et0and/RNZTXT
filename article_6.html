            <p>Promising allrounders Nathan Smith and Josh Clarkson have been awarded Black Caps contracts for the first time, effectively replacing Devon Conway and Finn Allen on the central contract list.</p>
        
            <p>The elevation to the central contract list caps off a memorable twelve months for Oamaru-born Smith who was named the Men's Domestic Player of the Year at the Cricket Awards in March.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old was a standout performer in the Wellington Firebirds winning the Plunket Shield, leading the competition wicket-taking charts with 33 wickets at an average of 17, including career-best first-class figures of 6-36 against Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>His performances in the white-ball arena were also impressive - claiming 11 and 13 wickets in the Ford Trophy and Dream11 Super Smash campaigns respectively - his 4-5 against the Otago Volts in Alexandra the best men's figures in last season's men's T20 competition.</p>
        
            <p>27-year-old Clarkson has featured in three ODIs and six T20Is for the BLACKCAPS since making his international debut in the 1st ODI against Bangladesh in Dunedin in December.</p>
        
            <p>The hard-hitting allrounder broke into Black Caps contention off the back of a successful 2022-23 domestic campaign where his all-round performances helped his Central Stags lift both the Plunket Shield and the Ford Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>Both players have also represented New Zealand at Under 19 level - at the 2016 ICC Under 19 World Cup in Bangladesh, alongside fellow contracted players Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra and Ben Sears.</p>
        
            <p>Last month Devon Conway and Finn Allen opted out of the central contract system, following the likes of Kane Williamson, Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne.</p>

            <p>Black Caps head coach Gary Stead said the elevation of both players had come off the back of impressive recent performances.</p>
        
            <p>"Nathan's been on our radar for a while having been a significant performer in domestic cricket for some time," said Stead.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been particularly impressive in red ball cricket and we think he has the skills to be successful in international cricket when he gets a chance."</p>
        
            <p>Stead said Clarkson had earned his opportunity based off the skillset he offered and his recent international performances.</p>
        
            <p>"Josh has been involved in both white ball squads over the past twelve months which shows the strides he's made in his game," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a hard-hitting player with plenty of skills and has shown in his chances so far that he can offer a lot with bat and ball on the international stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Josh will provide depth and adds value given the volume of white ball cricket on the horizon."</p>
