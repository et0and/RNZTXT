            <p>The Black Caps play at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru for a second and final time during the Cricket World Cup on Thursday night and for allrounder Rachin Ravindra it is a place full of childhood memories.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra has already had a World Cup to remember after scoring three centuries - including one in the loss to Pakistan at the same stadium on Saturday - and he could play a key role in helping the Black Caps secure a semi-final place when they play their final round robin match there against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is one of 10 venues being used during the world cup in India and it is a place Ravindra is very familiar with.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old said he grew up with "some very close mates" and had "some amazing chats" at the Karnataka State Cricket Association Club House out the back of the stadium where he stayed during his "teenage formative years" on yearly tours to India with the Hutt Hawks Cricket Club - the club his dad Ravi Krishnamurthy founded in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra's parents moved from Bengaluru to Wellington in the 1990s and would make frequent trips back with young cricketers including their son.</p>
        
            <p>Fast forward a few years and Ravindra is back with a new group of team mates and taking fans on a tour via the Black Caps social media.</p>
        
            <p>After showcasing the food, the accommodation and the stadium Ravindra also recalled some of the international cricket he had watched at the venue.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have been about 10 years old...it was when [Sachin] Tendulkar scored his 14000th Test run here watching him play against Australia and it was around October time that atmosphere was electric.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess being a young 10 year old from Wellington visiting India once in a while and you have the opportunity to witness such a special innings from a generational talent as Tendulkar was was something I'll never ever forget and just those memories of visiting India...is close to my heart."</p>

            <p>When Ravindra is out in the middle of the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday he could chip away at his own piece of history.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra has scored 523 runs at the world cup so far to sit third in the tournament run charts, close behind South African Quinton de Kock (550 runs) and Indian Virat Kohli (543).</p>
        
            <p>All three are well in contention to surpass Tendulkar's record for the most runs at any world cup of 673 set at the 2003 tournament.</p>
