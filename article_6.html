            <p>He replaces Michael Maguire who stood down from the position in December after six years in the role.</p>
        
            <p>Jones was an assistant at the Kiwis in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He was also Warriors interim head coach for part of 2022 after the departure of Nathan Brown.</p>

            <p>"I've enjoyed working with the Kiwis over the last few years and seeing the team develop under Madge (Michael Maguire). I've learnt so much being involved with such a special group of players.</p>
        
            <p>NZRL chief executive Greg Peters said Jones had serveda lengthy apprenticeship with the Warriors and with the Kiwis. as assistant coach.</p>
