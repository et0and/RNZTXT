            <p>Stephen Hilson has dedicated years to teaching karate to people living with disabilities - and he is about to see his students compete in their first tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Hilson - also known as sensei - has been running a karate club in Wellington since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>But this is not just any karate club. This is the New Zealand Disability Karate Association - the first specifically for people with access needs.</p>
        
            <p>"We make the karate fit the person, not the person fit the karate," he said.</p>

            <p>"The people who are the experts on the disability are the people living with it, so our philosophy is [to] listen to what they need from us."</p>
        
            <p>Hilson - whose day job is in the public sector - said it did not matter if someone was neurodivergent, had a physical impairment, or no disability at all - everyone was welcome to join the club.</p>
        
            <p>"My goal is to normalise disability, to make sure that it is just something that is accepted in society, given that 25 percent of New Zealanders have a disability."</p>

            <p>One of his students, Nathaniel Robson, has a vision impairment.</p>
        
            <p>"That can make things a bit challenging, you know... to follow what the instructor is explaining," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In this kind of environment, you can just go up to the instructor and say, 'How do you do that?' [or] 'What way do you have your hand?'"</p>

            <p>Another student, Molly Tebo, joined the club with her family.</p>
        
            <p>"Unexpectedly, I think my partner and I are getting a lot more out of it than we thought we would," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sensei is just the most patient man I know.</p>
        
            <p>"I've tried other martial arts, and it just hasn't clicked in the same way, but I think because sensei is so patient, and so passionate about it, it's just been a really fantastic experience."</p>

            <p>Hilson had been working with the Special Olympics - in Japan, New Zealand, as well as in the UK - to work out a way for his students to compete.</p>
        
            <p>Now, six years after it was established, the club is sending them to their first tournament on 13 July.</p>

            <p>After that, Hilson wants to award his first black belt.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so excited about that."</p>
        
            <p>He also aims to develop the club, and open in more locations. Membership doubled to 60 last year after Hilson promoted it at Armageddon Expo.</p>
        
            <p>On top of his day job, he runs hour-long classes every Wednesday at 6pm and 7pm in the Khandallah Town Hall, 30-minute Zoom classes on the first Sunday of the month, and Manaaki Ability Trust classes in Lower Hutt every Friday at 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>Hilson is writing a book for other instructors to help them support people with a disability.</p>
        
            <p>And he has even written a series of children books - Rainbro's Karate Adventures - about a rainbow trout who joins the local karate club. The final book, Rainbro's Black Belt, will be published in November.</p>
