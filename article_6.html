            <p>Decorated British sailor Sir Ben Ainslie has parted ways with Britannia in a major change of direction for the beaten America's Cup finalists.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ineos Britannia team owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe confirmed Britannia would launch a challenge at the next America's Cup but said 47-year-old Ainslie would not be at the helm.</p>
        
            <p>Ineos said in a statement that they could "not find agreement" with Ainslie on "terms to move forward" after last year's regatta in Barcelona, where Team New Zealand beat Britannia 7-2 in the Cup match.</p>

            <p>Four-time Olympic champion Ainslie reportedly had a strained relationship with wealthy businessman and Manchester United co-owner Ratcliffe around plans for the next America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Ainslie was the team's principal and skipper having joined up with Ratcliffe in 2018 in a bid to deliver the "Auld Mug" to Great Britain for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Ratcliffe did not address the split with Ainslie directly but said he was "enormously proud" of "developing a British boat that was truly competitive for the first time in decades".</p>
        
            <p>Ainslie won medals at five consecutive Olympics from 1996 onwards, including gold at four consecutive Games from 2000 to 2012.</p>
        
            <p>Since winning gold at London 2012, Ainslie's goal has been to claim the America's Cup for Great Britain but all his attempts in a British boat, including those backed by Ineos, have ended in disappointment.</p>
