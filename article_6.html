            <p>The Fast5 Ferns will take advantage of rule changes for this year's Fast5 World Netball series, which are designed to reward risk taking.</p>
        
            <p>Teams from Australia, Jamaica, England, South Africa, and Uganda are in Christchurch for this weekend's annual tournament of the shorter, fast-paced version of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Teams are made up of five players, rather than the traditional seven and four six-minute quarters means the games are quick.</p>
        
            <p>At this year's event some Fast5 rule trials are taking place, with an emphasis on letting the ball go and shooting from long distance.</p>
        
            <p>The power play period has been extended from the final 90 seconds of each quarter to the final two minutes of each quarter to increase chances for double points.</p>
        
            <p>And during the power play, only goals scored from the two and three-point zones will be worth double, while any goals scored from the one point range will remain just one point, instead of two as they have in previous years.</p>
        
            <p>The idea is to incentivise teams to shoot from a longer range during the power play period.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Fern defender Kate Burley will be playing in her third straight Fast5 World Netball series and said the rule trials suited the way New Zealand played.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year we actually lost in the final because Aussie played quite a safe kind of game of netball so they were taking those ones but it was worth two then, whereas we were willing to take those risks and go for the longer shots so I think it will make it a lot more exciting. I'm really looking forward to watching our shooters sinking those long ones," Burley said.</p>

            <p>The last time Silver Fern shooter Maia Wilson played at a Fast5 Netball World Series was back in 2017 and there has been a number of rule adjustments since then.</p>
        
            <p>The Fast5 Ferns came into camp on Wednesday and have spent a bit of time talking about different strategies.</p>
        
            <p>"Are we going to just tick the scoreboard over by shooting ones or are we going to go big in those power play moments? I feel like we've got the strategy behind the scenes that we're going to hold in our back pockets for now but you'll definitely be seeing some big shots getting sunk I reckon," Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>The more radical rule being trialled this year is 'using possession'.</p>
        
            <p>Previously umpires would say 'use it' to warn teams that they needed to play the ball forward but that has been taken to another level.</p>
        
            <p>Once the ball has progressed out of one third of the court towards the attacking team's scoring end, it cannot be passed backwards into that third again. Teams will not be able to run the clock down by passing the ball back and forth between thirds.</p>
        
            <p>Players will have to let the ball rip down the court, even if there is no one obvious to pass to.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said it would be an interesting change to navigate.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm nervous that it potentially might see a lot more balls being thrown away so hopefully we can make sure that we're tidy. It may mean that we're shooting some big bombs especially in those last five or 10 seconds. But from a defensive perspective when I'm at goal attack for example, as soon as it goes into their shooting third, I'm walking off and getting ready for the next moment because I'm not needed anymore," Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>Burley said it was a challenging rule because it was something they did all the time in traditional netball.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily we have had three practice games now against our men's team, so we've really had a chance to play that in real time because our habits from playing in the ANZ are we can reset and go again so that's been quite a different adjustment.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't afford to turn back and as a goal defence when I'm in the centre third, I won't be able to call to my centre and shooters because they might pass it back so there's definitely some adjusting there."</p>
        
            <p>Burley felt there would be more opportunities for clean intercepts under the 'using possession' trial.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes there might only be one person available to actually receive the pass so as a goal keeper if the ball is coming through, and they can't send it back anymore the ball might only be able to go to the goal shoot so it definitely gives us a better opportunity to back ourselves and go for intercepts because there's nothing else to think about," Burley said.</p>
        
            <p>In the lead up to the 2025 ANZ Premiership, Netball New Zealand will reveal rule changes to the domestic competition, which starts in May.</p>
        
            <p>One of the changes considered was the introduction of a two-point shot, which Burley would like to see.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just another addition to our game and I think all of our goal attacks and even some of the goal shoots, shoot from a far range anyway so it will just make that scoreboard a little bit more exciting. I think it would be a really exciting addition to the game."</p>

            <p>Wilson is open to a two point shot in next year's competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely know you will see some changes when the 2025 ANZ Premiership rules come out. I'm open to a two point shot, I don't mind it, I'm happy to shoot out from there," Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>"In some ways I wonder what it does to the traditional side of things once we play international netball but in terms of fan engagement and showing a more broad skill set, I think it will be great for the game."</p>
        
            <p>Wilson, who was part of the Silver Ferns recent Constellation Cup series against Australia, said the rare series victory over the world number one side was among her career highlights.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel stoked to be now a part of two winning Constellation Cup teams and I think what was a bit different to this time around was you definitely physically saw the collective buy-in from no matter who was on the court - we were all one."</p>
        
            <p>Wilson got 15 minutes at goal attack in the final test.</p>
        
            <p>For a few seasons now there has been talk of Wilson playing more in the goal attack position for the Stars in the ANZ Premiership but she has been relied on heavily in the goal shoot bib.</p>
        
            <p>But with Australian shooter Charlie Bell joining the franchise next year and standing at a whopping 196cm tall, Wilson might finally get the opportunity to spend big chunks of time at goal attack for the Stars.</p>
        
            <p>"You've seen in international netball I'm starting to move out a lot more into goal attack so it would be lovely to get some match fitness week in week out for in the Stars so having someone like Charlie gives me the ability to do that so that's quite exciting for my own personal development."</p>
        
            <p>The Fast5 Ferns start their tournament on Saturday against Jamaica at 1.15pm. Australia are the defending champions.</p>
