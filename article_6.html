            <p>A brilliant bowling performance from skipper Melie Kerr has propelled the Wellington Blaze into tomorrow's Super Smash final after beating the Northern Brave in Wellington on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr, fresh from being named ICC women's cricketer of the year this week, also top-scored her side's innings, with 29.</p>
        
            <p>The Blaze will have the benefit of their home Basin Reserve wicket when they play the Otago Sparks in the final on Sunday (start time: 12.40pm).</p>
        
            <p>The Brave contested the elimination final strongly, but in the end they couldn't master Kerr's wrist spin, and went down by 23 runs with eight balls remaining.</p>
        
            <p>The Brave side had done well to restrict the Wellingtonians to 133-6 after putting them into bat. Opener Rebecca Burns blazed her way to 21 off 10 balls before losing her wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr and her sister Jess had a promising looking third wicket partnership but when they had put on 33, Melie failed to control a shot off Kayley Knight's bowling and was caught by Jess Watkin.</p>
        
            <p>The Blaze couldn't get a decent partnership together after that, but their total was at least competitive.</p>
        
            <p>The Brave set out after the Blaze bowling, with skipper Watkin leading the way, scoring 25 off 13 balls.</p>
        
            <p>When she was run out, Caitlin Gurrey and Samantha Barriball carried on the good work.</p>
        
            <p>But when Kerr brought herself into the attack, the momentum changed instantly with Gurrey out to Kerr's first ball and Barriball trapped in front in the same over.</p>
        
            <p>Marina Lamplough (16) and Ninesh Patel (23) kept the run rate up, but when Patel succumbed to a Kerr delivery in the 16th over, the damage was done.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr, who finished with four for 19 off her four overs, said home advantage in the final should be a plus as they have played a lot at the Basin this summer.</p>
        
            <p>"We are playing a quality Otago side who haven't played much cricket as of late whereas we have come off a lot. I think that's a big help, but again it's a new day tomorrow and we might have a lot of tired bodies so we have to get up," she told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Watkin rued losing too many wickets after a good batting start. "We just needed to kick on and build a few more partnerships."</p>
