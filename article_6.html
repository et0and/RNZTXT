            <p>New Zealand's Lydia Ko is among a couple of golf stars who have struggled during the opening round of the US Open in Pennsylvania.</p>
        
            <p>Ko, the world number 14, had trouble right from the start of her first round at the Lancaster Country Club.</p>
        
            <p>She bogeyed her first two holes, before a double bogey on a par three.</p>
        
            <p>On her second nine she had four bogey's and a triple bogey.</p>
        
            <p>Ko managed to hit just five of 14 fairways and only hit greens in regulation on eight of the 18 holes.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old finished with a ten over par 80, which has her currently tied for 149th, 12 shots from the leaders.</p>
        
            <p>She wasn't the only one with problems with world number one Nelly Korda putting three balls in the water on her third hole on her way to an 80.</p>
        
            <p>Korda, a two-time major champion, arrived as a heavy favourite after winning six of her past seven events.</p>
        
            <p>Korda's tee shot at the 161-yard 12th hole bounced over the green into a bunker. Her shot out of the sand rolled past the pin and into the water. After a penalty drop, her low pitch hit the bank and rolled back into the stream.</p>
        
            <p>Following a second penalty drop, her pitch hit the front of the green and once again rolled back into the water. Korda's pitch after a third penalty drop stopped about 8 feet past the hole and she two-putted to complete the shocking septuple-bogey 10.</p>
        
            <p>And while golfers love to be associated with the term "birdie", for Isi Gabsa, that wasn't the case during one particular portion of her opening round</p>
        
            <p>Gabsa's tee shot on the par-3 12th sailed toward the green before directly hitting a birdie, as in the animal.</p>
        
            <p>A tournament staff member removed the creature from the green.</p>
        
            <p>The situation evoked memories of Hall of Famer Randy Johnson's infamous pitch that killed a low-flying bird during a spring training game in 2001.</p>
