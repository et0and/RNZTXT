            <p>Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell were closing on a century partnership for the fourth wicket as the Black Caps stretched their lead over Australia to 149 runs in the second Test in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>At lunch on day three, New Zealand were 243 for three, with Ravindra on 67 and Mitchell 42.</p>
        
            <p>The only wicket to fall was opener Tom Latham - for 73 - after the Black Caps resumed for the day at 134 for two.</p>
        
            <p>Latham added eight to his overnight score before he was caught by wicketkeeper Alex Carey off captain Pat Cummins' bowling.</p>
        
            <p>The Australians successfully reviewed after the original decision was not out, with replays showing a fine inside edge from Latham's bat.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra had struck eight fours in his 165-ball knock while the more aggressive Mitchell had faced 73 balls and struck four fours and a six.</p>
