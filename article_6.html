            <p>Finally!</p>
        
            <p>The Southern Steel have snapped their losing streak, beating the Northern Stars 63-61 in an extra-time thriller in Invercargill this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>It broke the long drought of 21 games without a win - 713 days to be exact - and is their first victory since May 22, 2022, when they beat the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Kate Heffernan naturally was thrilled to get their first victory in nearly two years.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been working so hard, so I think it's so cool to actually be able to get the reward and in front of this crowd, and in front of these fans," Heffernan said.</p>
        
            <p>''They're just the absolute best and we're so grateful that they keep turning up and it's so cool to be able to give them a win."</p>
        
            <p>The Stars were dominant in the third quarter and went into the final quarter of regular time leading 50-42.</p>
        
            <p>But the Steel, even without Shannon Saunders on the court, were determined to fight back and levelled the game 58-58 at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Young Ivari Christie showed a wealth of courage to come on and remain steady in the Steel's attack end.</p>
        
            <p>The Steel had the better of the first part of extra time and went up 62-59.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars fought back to trail by just one with 1min 30sec left on the clock and things started to get messy with both teams desperate.</p>
        
            <p>But the Steel held their cool, played that ball around and found Namana under the post to win 63-61.</p>
        
            <p>In the end the Steel just wanted it more.</p>
