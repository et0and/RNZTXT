            <p>The Tall Blacks head coaching role has passed from one legend of New Zealand basketball to another.</p>
        
            <p>Judd Flavell, who is considered one of the most successful basketball coaches in the country, would guide the national side through the next competition cycle.</p>
        
            <p>Flavell played for the Tall Blacks 38 times from 1999 to 2002 and took the coaching job off his former New Zealand team mate and FIBA Hall of Famer Pero Cameron.</p>
        
            <p>During the appointment process Basketball New Zealand chief executive officer Dillon Boucher said the organisation had been "overwhelmed" with the off-shore interest to replace Cameron who stepped down after five years in August.</p>
        
            <p>Flavell spent 16 seasons in the Australian NBL as an assistant coach and was part of four championship campaigns with the New Zealand Breakers, he had also won four domestic titles coaching three different clubs including back-to-back NZ NBL titles with the Canterbury Rams.</p>
        
            <p>Basketball New Zealand knew how Flavell operated. He coached the the New Zealand under-18 team more than a decade ago, was Junior Tall Blacks assistant coach in 2014 and was Tall Blacks assistant coach in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>With limited resources compared to international counterparts, coaching the Tall Blacks was a unique role in the global basketball landscape and knowledge of New Zealand culture appeared to have won out.</p>
        
            <p>Boucher said Flavell had "the right mix of character and experience" to lead the Tall Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"I think our culture is what makes us unique as a nation compared to other international teams, the Tall Blacks culture is something we've been known for - Tu Haka and our innovative style of basketball - and it means we've always had to think a little outside the box in regards to the way we do things; because we're unique in our skillsets, our personnel, the way that we play," Flavell said.</p>
        
            <p>"And that goes deep into our heritage, and the way that our players feel excited to put on that black singlet for their country; I've had the honour of putting on that singlet myself so I want to make sure during my tenure that we're doubling down on that as much as we can.</p>
        
            <p>"Our culture defines us and it should be front and centre of what we do - it's our core - and all the X's and 0's and on-court strategy comes after that."</p>

            <p>The Tall Blacks are ranked 22nd in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing where we are currently at with the programme you can't help but get excited looking ahead at the pool of talent that we have coming through with the youngsters.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a depth of talent that has played a lot of meaningful games and that's important because that experience is something we used to struggle with years ago but now we have a pool of world-class levels at every position who we can call upon.</p>
        
            <p>"We still have work to do but I like the direction we've been going in, and the constant improvement of our players.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like the best of the Tall Blacks is yet to come, so my focus is for this team to push its boundaries and reach new heights - I get excited by that."</p>
        
            <p>Flavell grew up watching some of the greats of New Zealand basketball like Stan Hill and Glen Denham and had been part of some big moments in New Zealand history himself as a player including the 2002 FIBA World Championships where he helped lead New Zealand to a fourth-place finish. He said the Tall Blacks culture and ambition came from those who had worn the jersey before and he wanted to continue that with the current and future players.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past 20 years we've had our moment on the world stage, knocking off some top-level teams when no-one expected us to. Our challenge is to go from putting in one great performance - like we did against Croatia [at the FIBA Olympic Qualifiers in July] - and backing that up into wins in the next game and the next. The more experience and self-belief we have, the better.</p>
        
            <p>"And that comes back to the preparation work we do and the way we play together - we have to work harder than everybody else, and we have to play smarter than everybody else."</p>
        
            <p>Flavell's first games in charge would be against the Philippines and Chinese Taipei in a home and away FIBA Asia Cup Qualifier series in November.</p>
        
            <p>He said having his first Tall Blacks home game as head coach in Christchurch would be a fitting moment.</p>
        
            <p>"The Rams gave me an opportunity when they bought me back to New Zealand from Australia to coach, and we've had a fun journey over the past few years; we're achieved some great things and I've gotten to work with some amazing people and players - in front of some amazing fans.</p>
        
            <p>"It's my home away from home and it'll be very cool to coach the Tall Blacks there next month."</p>
