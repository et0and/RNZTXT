            <p>Bryson DeChambeau is feeling positive vibes and his golf game is backing those up, in the US Open.</p>
        
            <p>DeChambeau shot a three-under-par 67 and moved to a three-stroke lead on Sunday (NZ time) after three rounds at Pinehurst, North Carolina.</p>
        
            <p>"It just gives me a spike in my adrenaline and allows me to focus more on delivering for the fans and for myself," he said of the fan support.</p>
        
            <p>DeChambeau, who dealt with some hip discomfort, is the first golfer to ever break 70 in the first three rounds of a US Open at Pinehurst No 2. He said he'll hold up physically.</p>
        
            <p>"It's OK," he said of the ailment. "I've had it for a long time now. It's just something that popped up."</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Cantlay (third round 70), Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy (69) and France's Matthieu Pavon (69) are all three strokes back.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealander Ryan Fox struck double bogey trouble on the second nine, finishing with a six-over 76 to be in a tie for 65th, 11-over for the tournament. Fox had double bogeys on the 11th and 13th holes, to go with four bogeys and two birdies.</p>

            <p>DeChambeau's lead grew to four strokes before a late double bogey threatened to derail his momentum.</p>
        
            <p>Yet on Monday (NZ time), DeChambeau will try to secure his second US Open in a five-year stretch and add another Southern Methodist University connection to this tournament venue. Payne Stewart, who, like DeChambeau, was an ex-SMU golfer, won the first time the US Open was held at Pinehurst 25 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I am going to try and hit a lot of the greens, give myself some good looks on some holes and two-putt a lot," DeChambeau said of his final-round plan.</p>
        
            <p>Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who began the day with a one-stroke lead, shot 73 and is tied with Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (70) at two-under.</p>
        
            <p>DeChambeau, who also shot 67 on Friday, strung together five birdies - including both par-5 holes - in a 10-hole stretch, and suddenly the Pinehurst No 2 course didn't seem so menacing, at least for one golfer. That thought was dashed by the time he recorded a 6 on the 16th hole before responding with a birdie on the next.</p>
        
            <p>DeChambeau, who won the US Open in 2020, hasn't finished better than T20 since then.</p>
        
            <p>Cantlay stayed in the mix despite only two birdies. McIlroy had bogeys on two of the final four holes.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the test that Pinehurst is presenting, and you've got to focus and concentrate on every single shot out there," McIlroy said. "It's what a US Open should be like."</p>
        
            <p>Pavon, whose great start with birdies on three of the first seven holes came before a pair of back-side bogeys, said he wants to remain in position to make a move.</p>
        
            <p>"The course is really showing its teeth so far," he said. "It's a tough one. You feel like sometimes you are flying a little bit, your game, everything is going on, and then at some point you just miss one green, can see a bogey."</p>
        
            <p>Tony Finau (72) and England's Tyrrell Hatton (70) share seventh place at 1 under.</p>
        
            <p>Seven golfers registered under-par scores.</p>
        
            <p>Collin Morikawa posted an early 66 and shot up the leaderboard with the day's best score. After the bogey-free round with three birdies on the backside, he's at even par and tied for ninth place with Canada's Corey Conners (71) and South Korea's Tom Kim (71).</p>
        
            <p>"If I play the way I did (Saturday), who knows what could happen," Morikawa said. "This course is only going to get tougher. I know it's not going to be easy."</p>
        
            <p>Defending champion Wyndham Clark posted his second 71 of the week and sits at 5 over.</p>
        
            <p>World No 1 Scottie Scheffler also recorded his second 71 of the tournament. At 6 over, he's not in position to make a charge to the top after winning five tournaments already this year. He said he's having trouble reading greens.</p>
        
            <p>"Another frustrating day," Scheffler said. "Today was a day where I thought I played a lot better than my score."</p>
        
            <p>Germany's Martin Kaymer, who won the US Open on this course 10 years ago, shot 77 and fell to 10 over.</p>
