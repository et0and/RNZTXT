            <p>New Wallabies boss Joe Schmidt says he has never been so unprepared for a test coaching role and plans to experiment in the July tests against Wales and Georgia as he gets to know the Australian players.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander coached Irish province Leinster before stepping up to run the national team and had a spell with the Auckland Blues before joining the All Blacks setup ahead of last year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been so unprepared, to be fair," Schmidt told reporters on Thursday after a four-day camp with the squad in Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the one time I've got to meet all these players and, in those previous roles, I'd had three years with Leinster and I knew a greater proportion of that squad. Before the All Blacks, I had the Blues, and so it's a little bit daunting, to be honest.</p>
        
            <p>"But if I wasn't nervous, I don't think I'd be on the edge doing my job right. So I'm happy to be nervous because it just encourages me to work a bit harder and engage a bit quicker and a bit more often with the players."</p>

            <p>When asked about the captaincy, Schmidt said it was going to be hard to select one until he knew what his core of regular starters looked like.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just getting to know them," he added. "I think it's easier to select that first captain once you've selected your team to make sure they're a starting player.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably there'll be a little bit of movement in the side. I'm pretty sure that we'll use more than just 15 of the same starters, so there could be a different captain for one or two of the tests.</p>
        
            <p>"And that will also allow us to just experiment a little bit. But you can't experiment too much when you've got a team like Wales coming."</p>
        
            <p>Wales, who the Wallabies play in Sydney and Melbourne on consecutive Saturdays from 6 July, effectively ejected Australia from last year's World Cup with a 40-6 drubbing in Lyon.</p>
        
            <p>Australia also host Georgia in a one-off test on 20 July at the Sydney Football Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt was equally unforthcoming about the way he wanted Australia to play.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still learning what [their] strengths are," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'm not going to say that we've arrived at a way to play that's going to be successful, because that's going to take one more week, hopefully, and then we can put something together next Saturday."</p>
