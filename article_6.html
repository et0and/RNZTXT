        <h2>Bad to worse for Crusaders as they lose skipper Barrett</h2>
        <p>
Things have gone from bad to worse for defending Super Rugby Pacific champions the Crusaders.

            <p>Captain Scott Barrett has been ruled out for six weeks due to a fractured finger, sustained in the lead-up to their clash with the Fiji Drua at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It is the latest setback for the defending Super Rugby champions, as they grapple with mounting injuries to key personnel and growing pressure amid a three game winless start to their campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Now back in Christchurch, the unbeaten Hurricanes await.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett joins fellow internationals Will Jordan and Ethan Blackadder on the sidelines.</p>
        
            <p>This is on top of an exodus of other key exponents including Sam Whitelock, Richie Mo'unga, Jack Goodhue and Leicester Fainganuku offshore, alongside hooker Codie Taylor's sabbatical.</p>
        
            <p>First-five Fergus Burke, who was set to take the reins from the departed Mo'unga, is also in the casualty ward.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders coach Rob Penney put on a brave face before Wednesday's training hitout, trying to remain philosophical and upbeat ahead of a must-win clash on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing's changed, the weight of expectation was there before we kicked off round one," said Penney.</p>
        
            <p>"Long that may continue because it keeps you razor sharp."</p>
        
            <p>Immediately following this comment, Penney breezily acknowledged the "Freudian" reference to his coaching predecessor Scott Robertson, when responding to questions about "the pressure", much to the amusement of media gathered.</p>
        
            <p>But the injury to Barrett is no laughing matter.</p>

            <p>Penney said his captain would be sorely missed on the field.</p>
        
            <p>"His onfield performances are world-class every week, he goes to deep to that well.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew we had some positions of vulnerability going into the comp and unfortunately those are the positions where we've been hammered a bit.</p>
        
            <p>"The beauty of this organisation is that we've got a reasonably deep well and we've got to have faith in the boys that are coming through."</p>
        
            <p>It has been somewhat of a baptism of fire for Penney during the first few weeks of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Three opening round defeats to the Chiefs, Waratahs and the Drua has subjected the team to their worst start since Super Rugby's inaugural year in 1996 - in other words, the dark old days.</p>
        
            <p>Before they became the most dominant force in the history of Super Rugby, the franchise's initial entry was meagre.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders notched two wins in total during the '96 campaign, which left the side at the foot of the ladder following an eleven week round robin.</p>
        
            <p>A similar unholy run for the 12-time-champions this season, remains an audacious prediction.</p>
        
            <p>But a return to home turf cant come soon enough ahead of a pivotal and potentially testing period.</p>
        
            <p>Friday's home meeting with the Hurricanes, will be followed by a trip to Eden Park to face the Blues before a return bout with the Chiefs at the end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>The team has never dropped four games on the bounce.</p>
        
            <p>"O and three isn't pretty and there's some pretty disappointing images in that," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking forward to being back at home, it's been quite a tough travel programme we've had, but that's part of the competition."</p>
        
            <p>"It's no excuse."</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully we can get a good crowd and the people can come and support us because the boys need a bit of love at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Penney offered reflections on the physical difficulties facing the team during their 20-10 defeat to the Drua in Lautoka on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second straight loss to the Fijian outfit at Churchill Park, a road trip which continues to trouble the red and blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"[The Drua game] was a bit unique.</p>
        
            <p>"We had the boys in the changing room, almost half-a-dozen, moments away from needing ambulances," he said.</p>

            <p>Despite a tough start, Penney said he felt the team "wasn't far away".</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a lot of capable boys with good skillsets and we've just succumbed to making a lot of unforced errors," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We can fix that quickly."</p>
        
            <p>It will be a timely return to the field for lock Zach Gallagher who will slot into second row in place of Barrett for Friday's showdown with the competition leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher admits the franchise's rich history looms large as the side strive to revive its campaign. You've always got to draw from your history a little bit and we've had a great run over the past couple of years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's up to us to keep that going. It's not going to just happen, we've got to make it happen."</p>
