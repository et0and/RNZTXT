            <p>Opinion - Dear Santa, we've been mostly good this year. So, it's fair that as a New Zealand sporting public, we can jump on your lap and ask for some stuff.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a list of things for next year that would be great.</p>

            <p>Stands look bad when they're not full, so maybe some sort of inspiration to the marketing departments of all teams that aren't the All Blacks or Warriors? Really, it's about time they started realising that they need to throw some money and thought at the game-day experience.</p>

            <p>Speaking of which, building a whole new stadium would be a decent start. It seems unlikely that any sort of construction will be happening in the near future, but at least a decision on whether or not Auckland will get a long-awaited stadium on the waterfront would generate some serious interest.</p>

            <p>Super Rugby has at least read the room on this issue and said the TMO's influence on games is going to be reduced, but at what point does the whole concept of technology for officiating just become too hard? VAR and the NRL bunker are weekly gripes, with the only real accepted success being in cricket - and even that is not without its flaws.</p>

            <p>The NZ Rugby CEO is a good bloke when he's not having to rattle off corporate-speak about governance, so why don't we just keep it that way? An issue-free season for NZR is impossible to foresee, but since Robinson's job to bring large scale directional change both financially and culturally is well underway, it'd be nice to just concentrate on footy for a while.</p>
        
            <p>Not every rugby game is great, not every player is amazing and fans have a right to say so since they're the ones paying for it, both through tickets and TV subscriptions. Not every aspect of criticism has to end with a discussion about mental health.</p>

            <p>Despite their patchy form, a Black Caps test series win against South Africa is feasibly within reach later on this summer. But really the big-ticket item is the two-test series against the all-conquering Australians in March, so let's set a realistic goal of simply making sure each of them goes into the fifth day, then build from there?</p>

            <p>Zoe Hobbs simply making the Olympic 100m final would rank as one of the greatest athletics achievements a New Zealander has accomplished. She's the best hope on the track, which would be nice to go alongside the big folks throwing shot put during the athletics event.</p>

            <p>New Zealand hasn't fallen out of love with the All Blacks, but it's fair to say the relationship hasn't exactly been at its strongest recently. It's certainly been worse, but Robertson bringing a new persona to the team as its main character has the potential to give the All Blacks the level of cultural transcendency they've been lacking lately.</p>

            <p>They've got the team, a decent draw and a stability that's not been seen at Mt Smart for years. So why not dare to dream? Andrew Webster has the chance to create a dynasty with this Warriors group, with signings that are pointing to serious succession planning in the coming years. Addin Fonua-Blake is going and presumably it's Shaun Johnson's last season, so there's the fairy-tale aspect to what the Warriors can achieve in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>They're going great guns right now, with a new manager and sitting top of the table heading into Christmas. The Nix have a well-balanced look to their side and while it's a long way to the end of the A-League season, the signs are there that they can ride the momentum to a maiden title.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, up the road all the talk is about the aforementioned waterfront stadium 'Dollar' Bill Foley is planning on building. But there's the matter of what hisnew A-League team is going to be called, which is a fun little guessing game that everyone is just hoping doesn't end in disaster.</p>
        
            <p>If nothing else than so we don't have to re-tread our annual articles about Stanley Street needing a roof.</p>
