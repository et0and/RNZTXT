            <p>South Africa saw off a spirited fightback from Afghanistan to win by five wickets with 15 balls to spare in their final Cricket World Cup group game and consolidate second place in the standings.</p>
        
            <p>The result also helps consolidate New Zealand's grip on a semi-final spot.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa have 14 points from their nine games, two points ahead of Australia who play Bangladesh on Saturday while Afghanistan are sixth.</p>
        
            <p>Both South Africa and Australia have already qualified for the semi-finals, with the two teams set to play each other in Kolkata on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"They say winning is a habit so we want to take that momentum through, we take a lot of confidence," South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma said.</p>
        
            <p>"We did something differently today, we normally bat first but we batted second. To get over the line in that manner will give us confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to be playing here again [in the final] in front of a full capacity crowd. But there's a hurdle we have to get over first against Australia in Kolkata."</p>
        
            <p>Afghanistan opted to bat first but they failed to build partnerships as South Africa picked up wickets regularly.</p>
        
            <p>The Asian side posted 244 in 50 overs on the back of Azmatullah Omarzai's unbeaten knock of 97, which included seven boundaries and three sixes.</p>
        
            <p>Azmatullah was alone in putting up a fight and the all-rounder looked destined for a first ODI century but finished three short as Kagiso Rabada conceded just three runs in the final over.</p>

            <p>Gerald Coetzee was the pick of the South African bowlers with figures of 4-44 while Quinton De Kock finished with six catches to tie the record for most wicketkeeping dismissals in a World Cup match.</p>
        
            <p>In response, De Kock set up the chase with a breezy 41 that took him to the top of the tournament's scoring charts on 591 runs but they were in a spot of bother at 182-5.</p>
        
            <p>But Rassie van der Dussen (76 not out) guided the Proteas home, stitching together a 65-run partnership with Andile Phehlukwayo, who smashed the winning runs with a massive six over deep mid wicket in the 48th over.</p>
        
            <p>"In any chase there has to be an anchor, we had a lovely platform and that made it easy for me to come in and assess the conditions," Van der Dussen said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen what our batting lineup can do... We got some good partnerships in the middle there."</p>
        
            <p>Afghanistan wrapped up their best ever World Cup campaign with four wins and also sealed a place in the Champions Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi said the tournament was a good learning experience as the team, once considered World Cup minnows, delivered some surprise wins.</p>
        
            <p>"We gave a good message to the world, we played big teams and fought till the end," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud of what our batsmen did in this tournament, we were struggling before the tournament... It's a positive thing looking to the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone knows we have a good spin department, but if we carry the momentum of what we did with the bat, we will be a very good side."</p>
