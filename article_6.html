            <p>New Zealand boxer Joseph Parker is again crediting his team for having him in great shape for Saturday's heavyweight showdown with Zhilei 'Big Bag' Zhang in Riyadh.</p>
        
            <p>The pair meet on the undercard to the Anthony Joshua bout with former UFC star Francis Ngannou.</p>
        
            <p>Parker is coming off arguably one of the best performances of his career when he beat American Deontay Wilder in a unanimous decision in December which took his record to 34 and 3.</p>
        
            <p>Zhang has a record of 26-1-1 and has held the WBO interim heavyweight title since last year.</p>
        
            <p>It's his most recent victories that has given him the favouritism over Parker.</p>
        
            <p>40 year old Zhang twice knocked out Brit Joe Joyce in 2023, while Parker lost to Joyce in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>However 32 year old Parker doesn't believe that record is relevant here.</p>
        
            <p>"Zhang did an excellent job in beating Joe Joyce twice," Parker told the pre-fight media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"The fighter that I was when I fought Joe Joyce is a totally different fighter now physically and mentally.</p>
        
            <p>"He's the favourite going into this fight and he said I'm the underdog but I'll show you what I can do come fight night.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of the credit for Parker's renaissance in recent years has been given to Irish trainer Andy Lee.</p>
        
            <p>Parker has also taken on board nutritionist George Lockhart.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a great team that I fully trust and believe in.</p>
        
            <p>"When everything is going good in camp and everything is balanced and you feel great and you're seeing results I feel dangerous and Zhang is going to feel the danger.</p>

            <p>A silver-medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Zhang boasts an enormous 1.97m frame and won of the most powerful left-hands in the heavyweight ranks.</p>
        
            <p>He holds a significant height advantage over Parker and carries a big punch.</p>
        
            <p>"Joseph Parker is a hell of a fighter, he's young and hungry and he's coming here for the belt, Zhang said at the media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm the Tiger right here, I'm here to hunt, if you want to take the food out of my mouth you're going to pay the price.</p>
        
            <p>In the typical pre-fight banter, Parker responded.</p>
        
            <p>"He said he wanted to bang me, I just want to say to Zhang I'm going to bang you.</p>
        
            <p>To win Parker will probably have to adopt a similar game plan he used against Wilder and us his speed and fitness to tire Zhang.</p>
        
            <p>Whoever wins is likely to line up a fight with WBO champion Oleksandr Usyk of Ukraine.</p>
