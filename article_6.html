            <p>Scott Barrett has been named as the new All Blacks captain, with a 32-strong squad including five uncapped players announced for two Tests against England in Dunedin and Auckland, and one against Fiji in San Diego.</p>
        
            <p>The squad is the first selected by the coaching group of All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson and his four assistant coaches Scott Hansen, Jason Holland, Leon MacDonald and Jason Ryan.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Barrett will become the 81st captain of the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old has played 69 times for the All Blacks since making his debut against Ireland in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>He will be assisted by vice-captains Ardie Savea and Jordie Barrett.</p>
        
            <p>"When you think of the leaders who have gone before you, it's quite humbling to be asked to captain the All Blacks, so it's not something I took lightly," Scott Barrett said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big responsibility, but I have two great leaders beside me in Ardie and Jordie, and I know we'll have the full backing of the coaches."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said his long-standing relationship with Scott Barrett was a factor in his choice of captain.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some great leaders in our group, but having that existing connection to Scott was important. He's tactically astute, he leads from the front, and he's got the respect of the players and coaches.</p>
        
            <p>"Leadership is a shared responsibility and Ardie, Jordie and our wider leadership group will be crucial to how we come together and connect ahead of the first Test against England."</p>
