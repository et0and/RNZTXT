            <p>Roy Christian, a record-setting rugby league Test captain for the Kiwis during the 1960 and 70s, has died.</p>
        
            <p>He was 80.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up he played rugby league for Ōtahuhu and went on to play 32 tests for the Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>He got his first test call up in 1965 for a two-Test series against Australia at home.</p>
        
            <p>Although a replacement at the time, he held his spot throughout the 1965-66 Kiwis' tour of Britain and France, playing all six Tests and went on to be named Player of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>After missing the 1968 World Cup due to a hamstring injury and he was named captain for the 1970 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>In 1971 Christian captained the Kiwis to a famous 24-3 win over Australia before claiming New Zealand's first official series triumph in the UK, the 'Grand Slam' heroics seeing the team defeat Great Britain and France.</p>
        
            <p>Christian went on to captain the Kiwis in another World Cup in 1972, and although not a great campaign for the Kiwis, Christian became the New Zealand's then longest serving Test skipper with 15 Tests at the helm.</p>
        
            <p>His record was only beaten by Mark Graham in 1986.</p>
        
            <p>Ending his 74-game, 32 Test career in 1972, Christian was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to rugby league.</p>
        
            <p>He also led the New Zealand Māori side.</p>
        
            <p>Christian was a direct descendant of mutiny on the Bounty leader Fletcher Christian.</p>
        
            <p>Post his playing days he became a Presbyterian minister based in Māngere.</p>
        
            <p>"We sadly mourn the passing of Roy Christian, one of our Legends of League, and offer our deepest condolences to his whānau on his passing," said NZRL chief executive Greg Peters</p>
        
            <p>"With Roy's career in the black and white jumper, especially his record-breaking tenure as captain, he will forever be known as one of the greats of the game."</p>
