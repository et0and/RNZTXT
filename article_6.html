            <p>Kane Williamson emerged as New Zealand's saviour for the umpteenth time in his career and compiled a patient hundred to help the tourists finish day two of the opening test against Bangladesh on 266-8.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand batters struggled against Bangladesh's spin-heavy attack on a turning track in Sylhet but Williamson batted close to five hours for his cultured 104, which included 11 fours.</p>
        
            <p>His 29th test hundred drew him level with Australia great Don Bradman and India stalwart Virat Kohli.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Tim Southee (one) and Kyle Jamieson (seven) will resume New Zealand's bid to erase the 44-run deficit when play continues on Thursday in what promises to be a low-scoring contest.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Bangladesh were all out for 310 after Southee claimed the last wicket of Shoriful Islam with the first delivery of the day.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand lost Tom Latham, Devon Conway and Henry Nicholls before reaching the 100-mark but Williamson featured in three half-century partnerships to keep New Zealand in the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell (41) and Glenn Phillips (42) made useful contributions while Williamson held up one end.</p>
        
            <p>The top-order batter took a single off Nayeem Hasan to bring up his hundred before left-arm spinner Taijul Islam (4-89) breached his stubborn defence after Williamson attempted a forward defensive shot.</p>
        
            <p>At 253-5, New Zealand looked set to grab the lead but Bangladesh claimed four wickets in the final session to leave the match evenly poised.</p>
