            <p>Canterbury's Chad Bowes has struck the fastest limited overs double century in first class cricket history, taking just 104 balls to achieve the milestone against Otago at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Bowes, who has played six one day internationals and 11 T20's for the Black Caps, finished on 205 off 110 balls and clubbing seven sixes and 27 fours.</p>
        
            <p>His double century bettered the previous mark by Australian Travis Head playing for South Australia and Indian Narayan Jagadeesan playing for Tamil Nadu.</p>
        
            <p>It's just the second double century scored in the domestic Ford Trophy competition with Central Districts Jamie How the only other player to achieve the feat, scoring 222 during the 2012-13 summer.</p>
        
            <p>Unsurprisingly Bowes accounted for the bulk of Canterbury's total of 343-9.</p>
        
            <p>The next highest scorer was Zak Foulkes who made 49 not out.</p>
        
            <p>Defending Ford Trophy champion Canterbury's 240-run victory against the Otago Volts Wednesday at Hagley Oval is the largest winning margin in the 54-year history of the competition.</p>
