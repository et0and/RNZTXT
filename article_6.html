            <p>Sitting just one point from the bottom of the table, the Blues have been forced into some 'brutally honest' conversations following their stuttering start to the season.</p>
        
            <p>The defending champions have won just one game from four, and are set to take on the table topping Chiefs at home this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Patrick Tuipulotu said there have been several blunt assessments of their performances to date.</p>
        
            <p>"The last three weeks have been pretty much like that and it can get pretty heated, but I think that's all part of the game. That's all part of how we have to get better and that's just a reality we're in now, one from four three. It's not ideal."</p>
        
            <p>An inability to close out games has dearly cost the defending champions across the opening four rounds.</p>
        
            <p>"Crucial mistakes, especially after half-time when we talk about it in the changing sheds, trying to make things right and then having that lapse of focus or judgement and letting the other team back in."</p>
        
            <p>The All Black lock said they have lacked composure after racking up points.</p>
        
            <p>"When you score, you want to keep attacking, you don't want to go back into your shell and start defending a lead. You want to keep scoring points and I think that's where we're probably failing a bit."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Vern Cotter said the Blues have been beating themselves more so than opposition playing out of their skins.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not as if we're playing badly all the time, it's just that we're not finishing and so there's been a real focus."</p>
        
            <p>Compounding the Blues woes is the loss of star Beauden Barrett who fractured his hand in last Friday night's loss to the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>"It was something that perhaps we felt as a team. So without him it just means that we've got Stephen Perofeta coming back into the squad who brings another dimension again."</p>
        
            <p>Cotter said they have plainly identified the areas where the side has gone wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"They're really simple fixes and a lot of it comes from just preparation and attitude."</p>
        
            <p>Tuipulotu said that ultimately they have been beaten physically.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a matter of fronting up."</p>
