            <p>The Hurricanes newcomer Jordi Viljoen reckons he's learnt a fair bit from former All Blacks halfback Aaron Smith.</p>
        
            <p>20-year-old Viljoen, the son former Hurricanes and Springboks No.9 Joggie Viljeon, made his Super Rugby debut last week, scoring a try in the Hurricanes 44-14 win over the Western Force in Perth.</p>

            <p>He said to run out in the Hurricanes number nine jersey was a special moment for his family.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of joy and happy emotion getting to run out for my first time. Starting as well, you never really expect it on debut and just super grateful.</p>
        
            <p>"Very special for my family, especially Dad playing for the same club. Everyone stayed up late to watch the game, so super happy."</p>
        
            <p>Joggie played for Manawat큰 in the mid-2000s and that's when Jordi moved to Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Jordi Viljoen said he eventually developed a connection with a Manawat큰 star in All Blacks halfback Aaron Smith.</p>
        
            <p>"I always had a really good family connection with Aaron Smith.</p>
        
            <p>"When Nuggy (Smith) was at Fielding Ag [Fielding High School] and Manawat큰 my dad would take him for training and we were really close with their family and we have a personal bond."</p>

            <p>While he's soaked up plenty of advice from Smith, his dad and others, including Hurricanes halfback and another former All Black, Tj Perenara, and current All Blacks No.9 Cam Roigard, Viljoen said he wants to be his own player.</p>
        
            <p>"Bit of a mix, I just try and bring my own style to the game and don't try and be anyone else. I just want to be the best version of myself.</p>
        
            <p>"Having that connection with Aaron Smith and now being in the environment with TJ and Cam and seeing those players and having those connections, you just start to develop."</p>
        
            <p>Viljoen has represented New Zealand at under 20s level and despite his heritage, with his dad and grandfather being Springboks, he wants to one day play for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"100 percent I'd love to play for the All Blacks, it's been a dream ever since moving here. New Zealand has given me a lot and all the opportunities in terms of rugby and living a safe and happy life."</p>
