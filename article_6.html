            <p>Of the 24 New Zealand cricketers who will feature in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction starting on Sunday night, Bevon-John Jacobs is by far the dark horse of the group.</p>
        
            <p>Among a bunch of high profile current and former Black Caps, Jacobs is the only uncapped New Zealand player on the list.</p>
        
            <p>The 2025 IPL mega auction, which will run over two days in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, will see all 10 teams vying to fill their rosters. All up, 574 players will go under the hammer - made up of 366 Indians and 208 overseas players.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 204 slots are to be filled, with 70 available for overseas players. It's the first time that the marquee auction list has been split in two.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs, who plays for the Auckland Aces, is happy to have just made the auction shortlist, which was whittled down from 1574 players who registered themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah 100 percent, it was a pleasant surprise, it's cool to see that but I know that there's a slim chance but I guess that's the first step right. You've got to make that official cut so that was quite nice to see," Jacobs said.</p>
        
            <p>"But also just trying to keep things in perspective and not think too much about which way it goes. If it does happen then brilliant, if it doesn't then you know that's not too bad either but I think it's just about me working on my game and then if something like that does come along I'll take it with both hands."</p>
        
            <p>The right-handed batsman is the lowest valued New Zealand player entered in the IPL auction, opting to register himself at $60,000 - the minimum base price.</p>

            <p>A number of Black Caps have registered for the highest base price of $400,000 including Trent Boult, Matt Henry, Kane Williamson, Finn Allen and Devon Conway. Rachin Ravindra has priced himself at $300,000.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs said putting his name forward for the IPL player auction was a last minute decision.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's one of those things you think about, like 'what if?' so I just thought I'd put my name in the hat and see what happens. Obviously I know it's a long shot but you never know what might happen and who might have their eye on you. So I just thought that I'd take a shot and had some people help me sort that out so it was kind of last minute but happy I did it."</p>
        
            <p>At last year's auction Daryl Mitchell struck it rich with the Chennai Super Kings, signing a $2.7 million contract - the second highest for a New Zealander in the tournament history after fast bowler Kyle Jamieson earnt a $2.86m deal with the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</p>
        
            <p>Jamieson has a base price of $300,000 for this year's auction.</p>
        
            <p>Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Jacobs' family moved to New Zealand when he was three years old and cricket runs through the family.</p>
        
            <p>"My Dad and Grandad and everyone on both sides of the family do enjoy their cricket so it's been something from a young age and my Dad was also a cricket coach and he's kind of the one that started me on the path and then I guess at some point we were like 'we'll try and give it a crack' and we kind of went from there."</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old grew up in Auckland and represented Westlake Boys' High School in school-level cricket and Auckland at age-group level.</p>
        
            <p>He played for Sydenham Cricket Club in the 2021 Christchurch Metro competition, and scored 178 runs in a match - recording the highest individual score in the history of the competition. In the same season his tally of 535 runs in the one-day format set another record.</p>

            <p>Jacobs made his professional debut in November last year for Canterbury in the Ford Trophy competition.</p>
        
            <p>When he made his T20 Super Smash debut a month later he belted 42 runs off just 20 balls, against Black Caps bowlers Jimmy Neesham and Ben Lister. He then averaged 33 over 6 innings at a strike rate of 188.</p>
        
            <p>He signed with Auckland for the 2024/25 domestic summer and made his first class Plunket Shield debut for them earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The right-handed batsman has found himself as either an opener, or in the 'finisher' position.</p>
        
            <p>Three months ago Jacobs spent a few weeks in Australia playing in the Queensland Premier Cricket T20 Max competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I hadn't really been anywhere outside of New Zealand for cricket at that level so it was nice to get some experience on that front and being an overseas player.</p>
        
            <p>"The level of the competition was pretty cool as well. You've got some Australian internationals that were playing in some of the other teams and stuff, so it was nice to go out there and get a few runs away but also watch some other guys go about their work and it was a good experience, and there was plenty that I could take away from it."</p>
        
            <p>On the last day of the competition he smashed 100 off 40 balls.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a nice way to finish off the tournament before heading home. I was surrounded by a good bunch of lads and an awesome team that got around me so it was good fun."</p>

            <p>Given that IPL franchise coaches will be less familiar with Jacobs' abilities, any intel or footage that can be provided to prospective bidders is important.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what agents and your contacts can definitely help with. The Indian franchises might not have much footage of players from New Zealand's domestic level so anything that can be provided like batting highlights to kind of push my case.</p>
        
            <p>"Then it's up to them if they see something that they like, then maybe they throw you a bone. Otherwise, you just keep pushing and you keep working year on year and then you see when you can get there."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs is very happy his big knock in the Queensland Premier League was captured via YouTube.</p>
        
            <p>He would not be the first South African-born cricketer to do well in this country and could join the likes of current and former Black Caps Neil Wagner, Glenn Phillips, Devon Conway and BJ Watling in achieving international honours.</p>
        
            <p>"It is always good to see those guys get to that level. I've got family in South Africa, and have South African roots but I do very much see myself as just a Kiwi you know, but obviously that's still the dream if I happen to be another one on that list then that would be a blessing but I'll just keep working on it and see what happens."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs is busy with the Auckland Aces but will keep an eye on the auction, which will be live streamed.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd be lying if I said I 100 percent understood how the auction system works. But if I got picked up out of the blue ...if that happens it's an awesome bonus."</p>
        
            <p>Teams have a salary cap of $24m. The dates for the 2025 IPL have not been confirmed, but this year it ran from 22 March to 26 May.</p>
