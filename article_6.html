            <p>It is the event many paddlers from around Aotearoa gun towards, but the heat has intensified for this year's competition.</p>
        
            <p>The annual Waka Ama Sprint Championships held at Lake Karapiro has attracted waka enthusiasts from near and far, including Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, UK, and the USA - contributing to record entries.</p>
        
            <p>The event has 3875 paddlers charging for a place on the podium, a 19% increase over the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Ama New Zealand chief executive Lara Collins said the increase reflects on the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Sprint Nationals is always a pinnacle event for our waka ama whānau and it is exciting to see the growth in participation numbers for this year's event."</p>
        
            <p>Over seven days, the sprints event has competitors paddle at a high intensity for distances ranging between 200m and 1500m in W1 (single), W6 (6-person waka), and W12 (double hulled 12-person waka).</p>
        
            <p>More than half of the competitors are under 23 years old.</p>
        
            <p>"Waka ama is more than a sport- it is a way of life, and it's encouraging to see that over 60 percent of our participation for the event is aged 5 - 23 [years old]," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our clubs, regions, and wider waka ama whānau are doing amazing work at the community level and this is reflective in these statistics."</p>
        
            <p>Young tamariki and rangatahi racing concluded on Tuesday, with adults taking to the water on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of coaches of tamariki teams told RNZ that the venue was packed for the first three days of junior racing.</p>
        
            <p>They also revealed that there were different ways to make the youngest paddlers feel like they were world champs.</p>
        
            <p>"Say the word 'snow cone'," one said.</p>
        
            <p>Another mentioned that the tamariki would be more stoked to have their picture posted on the glass windows at the Don Rowlands Centre, than have won a final.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all about the camera shots, here comes the camera boat and they would pose instead of paddling forward."</p>
        
            <p>He said the two youngest age brackets contributed heavily to the increase in paddlers.</p>
        
            <p>"They see it on TV, that's the big thing, and their parents see it."</p>
        
            <p>"You can get kids doing [waka ama] from a young age and they can take it right through, anywhere you go - you can paddle and you're never a stranger."</p>
