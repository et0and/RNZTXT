            <p>Wellington Phoenix will go to Christmas ninth on the A-League standings and in a slump after a heavy 4-1 loss away to Western Sydney United.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's heaviest defeat of the season was also their third in a row, allowing mid-table rivals Western Sydney to leap-frog the struggling New Zealand side up to sixth in the standings.</p>
        
            <p>It completed a forgettable double for the two Kiwi men's sides, although Auckland FC at least remain top of the table despite being dissected 4-0 at home by Western United.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time the Phoenix have conceded four goals under second-season coach Giancarlo Italiano, who took his side to last year's semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disappointing more than anything. We gifted them three of the four goals - well probably actually four," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"Errors or just us being a little hesitant around the box. Defensively it was very uncharacteristic of us.</p>
        
            <p>"Second half I was very happy with the group, the way they bounced back. We had some big chances at 2-1 and if we'd made it 2-all, the whole complexion of the game would have changed.</p>
        
            <p>"They kept doing what I asked but in the end, a little bit of inexperience just cost us."</p>
        
            <p>With the game lost, Italiano took the chance to hand a late appearance to 16-year-old midfielder Luke Brooke-Smith, the former eight-time national age group BMX champion.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington were on the back foot from the start, conceding inside the opening minute, when forward Brandon Borrello took advantage of a slip from Isaac Hughes to get in behind the Phoenix defence and laid off a pass for Zac Sapsford, who swept home from near the penalty spot.</p>
        
            <p>Nine minutes later Borrello set up former Wellington midfielder Bozhidar Kraev, who calmly slotted past Josh Oluwayemi to double the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington bounced back after the interval with their lone goal, a spectacular Hideki Ishige overhead kick from close range.</p>
        
            <p>Ishige controlled a mis-hit shot from Japanese compatriot Kazuki Nagasawa with his thigh and then, with his back to goal, expertly picked out the roof of the net with an overhead kick.</p>
        
            <p>However, Western Sydney wrapped up victory through goals to Marcus Antonsson and Dylan Scicluna.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano had been forced to make one change to the side who started last Saturday's 2-1 loss to Macarthur FC.</p>
        
            <p>Corban Piper made his first A-League start in place of Marco Rojas, who rolled his ankle at training on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix next host the struggling Newcastle Jets on on Saturday.</p>
