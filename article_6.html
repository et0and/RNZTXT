            <p>India certainly had an advantage playing all their Champions Trophy games in Dubai according to Black Caps coach Gary Stead.</p>
        
            <p>India survived a late fightback from the Black Caps to win the final by four wickets.</p>
        
            <p>"No doubt about it", Stead told Morning Report after being asked if India had an advantage in the final.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament was hosted by Pakistan but India refused to play their games there because of political tension and instead played all their games in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think it was a factor. It is a little bit ironic that the Champions Trophy was meant to be in Pakistan but they get to play here (Dubai)," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is not much you can do about it, it was the cards we were dealt, we were up for the challenge, we just weren't quite good enough tonight."</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell top scored with 63 as the Black Caps scored 251 for seven after deciding to bat first.</p>
        
            <p>In reply Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill put on a century opening stand with Rohit making 76.</p>
        
            <p>They then managed their run chase and got home with six balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps were without their main strike bowler Matt Henry who was ruled out of the game with a back injury.</p>
        
            <p>"250 I thought was a competitive total, we probably needed to take a couple of early wickets to really keep us in the hunt and give ourselves a real sniff," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>Stead was asked what his future was with the team with a white ball series with Pakistan coming up at home to finish off the summer.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll get to the end of the season and work that out.</p>
        
            <p>"The team environment is great, it has been a hugely enjoyable tournament but I couldn't speak more highly for the culture and the way the guys get around themselves in this team. It is a joy to be a part of."</p>

            <p>Victory confirms India's place as the world's premier white-ball side.</p>
        
            <p>Since being beaten in the final of the 2023 World Cup they have won the T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy.</p>
