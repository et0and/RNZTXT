            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson admits the last few days have been surreal since finding out that he'll be driving alongside world champion Max Verstappen next year.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull has confirmed that Lawson will take the second seat in the top team after Mexican Sergio Perez's departure was confirmed yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very exciting, a still can't really believe it," Lawson told Red Bull.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was considered the front-runner for the seat, despite the challenge of his RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda who generally out performed him in the six races the New Zealander raced this season.</p>
        
            <p>However Team Principal Christian Horner felt the 22-year-old Kiwi had the mental attitude to succeed.</p>
        
            <p>"Liam got his opportunity and I think he's demonstrated to us in a limited space of time that he's got the right skill set and the right mindset to be able to step into a Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson has previously jumped into a car at short notice to race as either a reserve driver (in 2023) or as a late replacement for Daniel Ricciardo (2024).</p>
        
            <p>He admits his selection to the top team hasn't really sunk in and his mind is racing.</p>
        
            <p>"At least now I have an off-season to think about it, but I don't really know if I like that because I just want to get into it.</p>
        
            <p>"It is positive that I have time to let it sink in, spend the time, do the prep, come back strong and ready.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson said while he was well aware of the speculation, his seat was only confirmed by Red Bull boss Christian Horner over the past few days following a meeting with the team.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew a change was on the cards. Christian was kind enough to send me a text, just a heads up that the meeting was good and then he called me with the classic one-liner.... welcome to Red Bull Racing."</p>

            <p>The first person he then called was his father.</p>
        
            <p>"He was very emotional and I've never really seen him like that which is quite cool.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been a big part of the mentality I've had growing up and coming into racing, he let me believe as a kid that I could do anything if I believed in it enough and I worked hard enough for it."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson now has to live up to being four time world champion Max Verstappen's team-mate.</p>
        
            <p>It is a tough seat to hold onto with Daniel Ricciardo, Pierre Gasly, Alex Albon and Sergio Perez all having had their chance since 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson said he has a good relationship with Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>"He has always been kind and supportive when I came in last year as a reserve when I was obviously feeling a lot of pressure, he was someone who was really good to talk to.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cool to go up against him and as a team-mate, there is nobody better to learn from and so for me it's trying to be competitive as quickly as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson now has just over two months to prepare himself for his first full season in the championship.</p>
        
            <p>He will return to New Zealand to celebrate christmas and this promotion with his family. He will then have a couple of weeks relaxing at home before heading back to Europe.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson is going to allow himself a cheat day on Christmas to eat and drink all the things he said he probably shouldn't.</p>
        
            <p>The 2025 F1 championship season starts in Melbourne on 14 March.</p>
