            <p>Chelsea staged a last-gasp comeback to beat sixth-placed Manchester United 4-3 with their top scorer Cole Palmer claiming a hat-trick to turn a madcap match on its head after the Reds seemed to have staged their own unlikely turnaround.</p>
        
            <p>Palmer struck twice deep into time added to save the Blues who were on the verge of a 3-2 home defeat.</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea had raced into a 2-0 lead inside 20 minutes with a strike by captain Conor Gallagher and a Palmer penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Goals by Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes before halftime and another by Garnacho in the 67th minute turned the tide towards the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>But Palmer stroked home his second spot kick and then blasted a deflected shot into the net in the dying seconds to send Stamford Bridge into raptures with the win taking Chelsea up to 10th spot.</p>
        
            <p>Liverpool reclaimed the Premier league lead with nervy 3-1 home win over bottom placed Sheffield United on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Juergen Klopp's side have 70 points from 30 games, two ahead of Arsenal and three more than champions Manchester City.</p>
