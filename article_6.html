        <h2>Halfback battle between Roigard and Ratima begins</h2>
        <p>
The race for the number nine jersey is officially on, with the next few weeks an opportunity for both men to establish a lead.

            <p>It's been one of the big All Black narratives this year: just who wears the number nine jersey? However, as we enter the end of year tour fixtures this weekend with a test match in Japan, the story is very much shifting from one chapter's end to the start of another.</p>
        
            <p>It's important to acknowledge TJ Perenara's long walk to the door from a position that he would have been desperate for after all the years of sitting behind Aaron Smith. The Wellington stalwart has started five tests this season and may well be the preferred halfback for the big three test matches coming up in England, Ireland and France. The three years ahead of us will presumably see a battle between Cam Roigard and Cortez Ratima for the halfback spot, after dramatic introductions to test rugby for both.</p>
        
            <p>Since Roigard has only just returned from a serious injury sustained in the early rounds of Super Rugby Pacific, this will be the first time the two halfbacks have coexisted in the same squad. However, they are no strangers to one another, having first crossed paths for their respective school first XVs.</p>

            <p>"I've known Cortez in previous years, you know, we're similar ages, and we always compete against each other," said Roigard.</p>
        
            <p>"Through school up until here where we are now. So I'm really looking forward to working alongside him, competing against each other. I guess most nines are also being competitive and, but I think as we get the most of each other, so whatever role each person has will be doing what we can to, make each other better."</p>
        
            <p>Ratima said he is "excited" for the challenge that lies ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming through the ranks was like having that reached the highest level at this point. And it's pretty crazy, like just looking back from what we've come from, obviously battling it out in first XV to being at the top level now, it's just so unreal."</p>

            <p>Roigard will start this weekend's test against Japan in Yokohama after only two games for Counties-Manukau in the NPC. It's a clear indication from Scott Robertson that he is very much in the reckoning for the upcoming tests, although Perenara is still available and holds the sort of invaluable experience that the All Blacks need at venues like Twickenham, Aviva Stadium and Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>However, the six-foot (1.83m) tall Roigard's running game is a very enticing proposition for Robertson to consider, and the 23-year-old sits on the top of plenty of fans' depth charts despite being out for so long.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I'm in a really good place physically and mentally. I guess it's everyone's getting to that, feels like they're going to, they're back into the season where I feel like I'm just getting started," said Roigard.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Ratima has the advantage of having about as close to a playing style of Smith as anyone. Smith retired from test rugby last season after over a decade of never even being remotely challenged for the top halfback spot, and the vacuum he left will now be filled with at least one of Roigard or Ratima starting, with Noah Hotham presumably close behind. Hotham, who played one test this season, is another intriguing addition to the mix and will be standing by in the All Blacks XV side with Finlay Christie.</p>

            <p>Things are wide open for all of the players, with Ratima hungry to prove himself on tour.</p>
        
            <p>"Like, if I had it my way, I'd like to play every game, but, Yeah, just excited and hopefully get a few opportunities over there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it's pretty clear that there is an opportunity there," said Roigard.</p>
        
            <p>"To cement a spot in the All Blacksâ€¦well, it's no one's to start with. But I guess there is opportunity there, and I'm not trying to look too far ahead. I'm sure when, Nuggy (Smith) was first in the team, he wasn't even thinking that he was going to have the career that he had. Straight into starting and playing all those games consecutively. But yeah, really looking forward to working alongside Cortez, and TJ for this next block."</p>
