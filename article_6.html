            <p>A month out of the game has given White Ferns captain Sophie Devine the chance to observe the game in New Zealand and she's not entirely happy.</p>
        
            <p>Devine took a well-being break from cricket and returned to the pitch this week to play for the Wellington Blaze in the Super Smash.</p>
        
            <p>While she's been happy to see a number of White Ferns standout in the domestic Twenty20 competition she is critical of one part of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"In general I think the fielding has been pretty poor, that is something that has stood out," Devine told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I've watched most games on the television and it's been pretty disappointing to see the level of fielding across the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"That's certainly an area that we talk about at the White Ferns, making sure we're a really strong fielding team."</p>
        
            <p>Devine says it's an issue that each Major Association needs to address.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Kerr has dominated the bowling and Kerr and Suzie Bates the batting stats in the Super Smash.</p>
        
            <p>Devine says White Ferns need to be leading the way in the domestic competitions but would like to see more featuring.</p>

            <p>At the conclusion of the Super Smash, the players will return to the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield 50 over competition before England tours here in March.</p>
        
            <p>"You're always wanting more, especially from your New Zealand representatives.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the challenge that was laid out before the Super Smash that we want White Ferns to dominate these competitions.</p>
        
            <p>"So we (White Ferns) need to make sure we're scoring plenty of runs and taking wickets."</p>
        
            <p>Devine missed the majority of the Super Smash to take a well-being break following a heavy workload over the last 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>She says it achieved the purpose.</p>
        
            <p>"The chats that I had with (coach) Ben Sawyer and Liz Perry (Head of Women's High Performance at NZC) were around my priority with the White Ferns and making sure that I'm at a hundred percent for that.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some World Cups coming up in the next couple of years and so we're looking at the calendar and working out what gaps I've got.</p>
        
            <p>"It certainly was a bit of a longer break than I first intended but it's really done some good for me moving ahead."</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns play five T20 internationals and three ODI's against England in March and April.</p>
        
            <p>The T20 World Cup is scheduled for Bangladesh later this year.</p>
