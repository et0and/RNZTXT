            <p>Saffi Vette's thoughts quickly turned to her late father after her selection as one of two New Zealand surfers for the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Vette and Billy Stairmand have been named for the competition at Teahupo ªo in Tahiti, far away from the main Olympics fanfare in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>It will be the first Olympics for Vette, 22, and the second for Stairmand, 34.</p>
        
            <p>Vette, from Gisborne, lost her father, Andrew, to cancer in 2020. He was also a renowned surfer and her driving force in the sport, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Dad introduced me to surfing and I'm so grateful for that.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to work hard for something that he's given me, this opportunity to excel in a sport that I love. I also want to thank my mum as well, she's always been amazing and has really helped me to keep the dream alive these past few years. I wouldn't be where I am without them and without the community I've had around me."</p>
        
            <p>Vette, who recently secured a place on the World Surf League Challenger Series, said her Olympics selection was a dream come true.</p>
        
            <p>"I watched the Olympics growing up but never thought surfing would be involved. It's a huge opportunity to be amongst so many amazing athletes and it's a pretty massive achievement for a girl from Gisborne."</p>

            <p>Vette and eight-time national champion Stairmand have just spent two weeks training at Teahupo'o, regarded as one of the world's great reef breaks.</p>
        
            <p>"The wave itself is intense," Stairmand, who finished ninth at his first Olympics in Tokyo in 2021, said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's short and sharp and really critical. There's no room for errors but I learnt so much on my last trip over there, I got some amazing barrels and became way more comfortable and confident in that lineup," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm stoked to be representing New Zealand again and I know I can do something special over there."</p>
        
            <p>Stairmand and Vette nailed their Olympics spots with strong showings at the International Surfing Association World Games in El Salvador last year.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympics surfing competition will take place over four days in a nine-day swell window, from 27 July to 4 August.</p>
