            <p>Two New Zealand golfers will tee up in Saudi Arabia this week hoping to qualify for next year's LIV Golf Tour.</p>
        
            <p>Nick Voke has received an invitation into the 93 player Promotions event along with Ben Campbell who won on the Asian Tour this year.</p>
        
            <p>Both played on the Asian Tour in 2024, while Campbell was also a reserve on the LIV Golf Tour this year.</p>
        
            <p>Voke will play the first round, while Campbell is exempt into round two.</p>
        
            <p>Branden Grace of South Africa is the most recognizable name in the field, and he'll attempt to re-qualify for the league after being relegated at the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>A 15-time winner worldwide, including one LIV event, Grace's claim to fame is as the first player to shoot a round of 62 at a major championship (2017 Open Championship).</p>
        
            <p>The three-day competition features a unique structure with 29 players earning an automatic bye into the second round. The relegated players are among those exempted into Round 2, as well as certain amateurs and the top three players from the Japan Golf Tour, Korean Tour, Sunshine Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia.</p>
        
            <p>In the first round, 64 players will play 18 holes of stroke play, and the top 20 players plus ties will advance to Round 2. They'll be joined by the 29 auto-qualifiers, scores will be reset and after another 18 holes of stroke play, the top 20 players after tiebreakers will advance to Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>With Friday's scores wiped off the board, the final day consists of 36 holes of stroke play for those 20 golfers. The winner will receive $200,000 and qualify for the 2025 season of LIV Golf.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, the top 10 finishers plus ties will be fully exempt into the 2025 International Series sanctioned by the Asian Tour.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow New Zealander Danny Lee has been playing on the LIV Tour for the last two years and won an event in Arizona in March 2023.</p>
