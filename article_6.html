            <p>Nyika v Karpency </p>
        
            <p>He's been cordial, now it's time to fight.</p>
        
            <p>David 'The Nice Guy' Nyika shed his moniker today, vowing to violently end his bout with American Tommy Karpency.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been nice, now it's time to be a monster... I want to break him down. I want to go through the gears, whether he can stand up to it or not, that's for him."</p>
        
            <p>The two boxers squared off for the first time at SkyCity today.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw his hands and they are twice the size of mine, it's a testament to how long he's been in the sport for. I think he's going to come hard, come early and come fast."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi cruiserweight said he has plenty of respect for the American veteran for taking the fight on short notice.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he knows his role, he knows that he's not supposed to win his fight, there is nothing to lose for him."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika admitted the added pressure and spotlight will make a loss all the more painful.</p>
        
            <p>"If I slipped up it would be a massive hitch in my career but i just can't see it happening."</p>
        
            <p>Karpency said his key to victory was to simply fight his fight.</p>
        
            <p>He arrived Thursday from Pennsylvania after a 36-hour flight and admitted to still battling jetlag but was unfazed by the task ahead of him.</p>
        
            <p>"I fought a lot of rising young stars, there is nothing different about this situation than i have been in differently."</p>
        
            <p>Karpency insisted he never hesitated to accept the bout.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't not know him until I got the fight offer, but I'll fight anybody, anywhere."</p>
        
            <p>He believes he will make for a much more exciting opponent than Blake Carparello, who was initially scheduled but pulled after a failed drug test.</p>
        
            <p>"The situation I am in is going to force me to make it an exciting fight, I am definitely going to let my hands go. When it comes down to it, i am going to go out on my shield if it comes to it."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika shrugged off suggestions by Karpency that he was not on his level.</p>
        
            <p>"I know he's tough, he's seasoned, he's worked with the best and beaten the best. But I know how good I am, i just need the opportunities to prove it."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was going to put on a show for Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm doing this for Aotearoa. Being the hometown fighter is not where I thrive, I like being the underdog, I like having the odds stacked against me, but I am going to turn up and smash old mate anyway."</p>
