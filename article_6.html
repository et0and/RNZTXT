        <h2>Preview: Can New Zealandâ€™s football teams cause a shock at Paris 2024?</h2>
        <p>
Spying drama aside, what are the actual expectations for our two Olympic football teams in Paris asks Mathew Nash.

            <p>While it may not have the profile of the FIFA World Cup or the recently concluded men's European Championships, Olympic football certainly has its place - especially for smaller nations.</p>
        
            <p>For New Zealand, it is a rare chance for the Football Ferns and the OlyWhites to gauge where they are in comparison to the rest of the world.</p>
        
            <p>So, what can we expect from both the women's and men's Olympic football teams?</p>

            <p>Traditionally, Olympic football has been the pinnacle of the women's game. However, the recent growth of FIFA's tentacles into women's football has seen that dynamic shift.</p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless, New Zealand will be hoping to cause an upset and build on their positive World Cup performances from 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Current form</p>
        
            <p>6 April 2024 - 4-0 win v Thailand</p>
        
            <p>9 April 2024 - 0-0 draw v Thailand</p>
        
            <p>1 June 2024 - 2-0 loss v Japan</p>
        
            <p>4 June 2024 - 4-1 loss v Japan</p>
        
            <p>14 July 2024 - 1-1 draw v Zambia</p>
        
            <p>Squad</p>
        
            <p>Anna Leat, Victoria Esson. Mackenzie Barry, CJ Bott, Katie Bowen, Meikayla Moore, Gabi Rennie, Rebekah Stott, Kate Taylor, Ali Riley, Macey Fraser, Ally Green, Katie Kitching, Malia Steinmetz, Jacqui Hand, Grace Jale, Indiah-Paige Riley, Milly Clegg: Alternate Players: Claudia Bunge, Michaela Foster, Annalie Longo, Murphy Sheaff.</p>
        
            <p>What are their chances?</p>
        
            <p>Honestly, slim to none. An already difficult task has only got tougher amid controversy and mystery regarding head coach Jitka Klimkova - who has stepped aside from duties following a recent employment-related investigation. However, Canada seems to think they are going to be a threat as they were caught this morning sending a drone over Ferns training to spy on them.</p>
        
            <p>Star striker Hannah Wilkinson is also absent while the Ferns have an incredibly tough first-round draw, facing host nation France, reigning champions Canada and World Cup surprise package, Colombia in the group phase.</p>
        
            <p>If they can advance from pool play it would be a major feat.</p>
        
            <p>Fixtures</p>
        
            <p>Football Ferns v Canada - 26 July 3am NZT</p>
        
            <p>Football Ferns v Colombia - 29 July 3am NZT</p>
        
            <p>Football Ferns v France - 1 August 7am NZT</p>

            <p>One to watch - Katie Kitching</p>
        
            <p>The Sunderland midfielder has been a breath of fresh air since joining the Ferns fold at the back end of last year.</p>
        
            <p>Any success will largely depend on her ability to influence games in the middle of the park.</p>

            <p>Unlike the women's competition, the men's is an under-23 event. While this undoubtedly removes some of the prestige from the tournament, it does mean smaller nations like New Zealand have a better chance of doing well.</p>
        
            <p>Current form</p>
        
            <p>27 August 2023 - 3-0 win v Papua New Guinea</p>
        
            <p>30 August 2023 - 3-1 win v Fiji</p>
        
            <p>6 September 2023 - 8-0 win v Vanuatu</p>
        
            <p>9 September 2023 - 9-0 win v Fiji</p>
        
            <p>19 July 2024 - 3-1 loss v Uzbekistan</p>
        
            <p>Squad</p>
        
            <p>Alex Paulsen, Kees Sims, Tyler Bindon, Michael Boxall, Lukas Kelly-Heald, Matthew Sheridan, Finn Surman, Sam Sutton, Joe Bell, Fin Conchie, Matt Garbett, Ben Old, Sarpreet Singh, Jay Herdman, Jesse Randall, Oskar van Hattum, Ben Waine, Lachlan Bayliss. Alternate Players: Liam Gillion, Henry Gray, Isaac Hughes.</p>
        
            <p>What are their chances?</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were unfortunate to lose to host nation Japan on penalties at the truncated 2020 event and many of the same players will be returning in Paris - intent on going one further and getting a shot at a medal.</p>
        
            <p>Their group draw could have been worse. While host nation France, coached by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, will be a difficult task Darren Bazeley's side will be hoping they can cause an upset v the United States or Guinea to potentially advance.</p>
        
            <p>A medal seems unlikely, but a repeat of three years ago would be considered a success.</p>

            <p>One to watch - Alex Paulsen </p>
        
            <p>If New Zealand are to escape the group stage, their goalkeeper is going to need to be in fine form.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily, they have an immensely talented stopper at their disposal in the form of Premier League-bound Paulsen.</p>
        
            <p>The A-League's best goalkeeper at the Wellington Phoenix last term, the 22-year-old has joined AFC Bournemouth in the off-season and will be looking to show his prowess across the channel from his new home.</p>
