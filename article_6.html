            <p>Rafa Nadal marked his singles comeback after being out injured for nearly a year with a convincing 7-5 6-1 victory over Austrian former world number three Dominic Thiem in the Brisbane International first round on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-times Grand Slam champion had arthroscopic surgery last June after injuring his left hip flexor during his second round defeat by Mackenzie McDonald at the Australian Open in early 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Nadal returned to competitive tennis in the new season on Sunday and crashed to a doubles defeat while partnering retired veteran Marc Lopez but showed glimpses of his top form ahead of the January 14-28 Melbourne Park major.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is honestly an emotional and important day for me after probably one of the toughest years of my tennis career," Nadal said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the chance to come back after a year and play in front of an amazing crowd and play at a very positive level on the first day is something that makes us feel proud - my team and family who have been there every day in the last year."</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old looked razor sharp again during his latest meeting with qualifier Thiem in a rematch of their 2018 and 2019 French Open finals which he won, as he ramped up the pressure and claimed the opening set with a break.</p>
        
            <p>Roared on by fans inside a heaving Pat Rafter Arena, Nadal grabbed an early break in the second set with a superb backhand pass and barely looked back as he racked up a 5-1 lead before closing out the match on serve.</p>
        
            <p>"I missed being healthy an feeling competitive, playing in front of full crowds that have been amazing all my career here in Australia," Nadal added.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't thank everyone enough."</p>
        
            <p>Nadal's 1,069th men's tour-level victory meant he surpassed Ivan Lendl to sit fourth in the all-time list.</p>
        
            <p>"As you can imagine, today it wasn't a statistic I was aware of," Nadal said. "I had enough work just to be focused and come back on court and remember how to play in a competitive match. There were nerves and doubts before the match.</p>
        
            <p>"But things went well and I'm excited to be back."</p>
        
            <p>In the women's draw, Arina Rodionova overcame 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin 7-5 7-6(7) while double Melbourne Park champion Victoria Azarenka beat Anna Kalinskaya 6-1 7-6(8).</p>
        
            <p>U.S. Open holder Coco Gauff started her new season with a victory at the Auckland Classic as the 19-year-old defending champion beat fellow American Claire Liu 6-4 6-2.</p>
        
            <p>Gauff, who is looking to improve on last year's fourth-round finish at the Melbourne Park, next plays world number 117 Brenda Fruhvirtova after the Czech 16-year-old defeated Anna Blinkova 7-5 6-4.</p>
        
            <p>Second seed Elina Svitolina eased to a 6-4 6-3 victory over Caroline Wozniacki and next meets 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu who returned following wrist and ankle surgeries to beat Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-3 4-6 7-5.</p>
