            <p>Sprinter Danielle Aitchison claimed a silver medal in the women's 200m T36 final at the Paris Paralympic Games, while Nicole Murray snared bronze in the Women's C5 3000 Individual Pursuit at the velodrome.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third Paralympic medal for New Zealand after cyclist Anna Taylor clinched silver earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison produced an outstanding display inside a hot and steamy Stade de France but ultimately had to concede defeat to the outstanding Yiting Shi of China, who set a Paralympic record of 27.50 - to finish 0.14 ahead of the Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old Hamilton-based athlete entered the home straight marginally down on Shi, who was hunting a hat-trick of Paralympic titles in this event, and the duo set up a rousing finish as the Kiwi tried to hunt down the Chinese athlete.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, it was not to be for Aitchison, who set a world record of 27.47 when winning the Kobe 2024 Para Athletics World Championships title in this event in May, but she still had the satisfaction of winning silver and also executing one of the fastest competitive performances of her career.</p>
        
            <p>"It was definitely a hard race, I felt pretty strong coming out of the blocks and on the home straight I was neck-and-neck with Shi, it was a serious race," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a bit disappointed with the last five metres and got really fatigued.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling tired - I had a late night (after the evening heats) and didn't get to bed until this morning. I am happy with the time, which was great.</p>
        
            <p>"My mum was in the crowd and it was really cool to have nine support people watching me. A very different experience from Tokyo."</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison, who has cerebral palsy, has been coached by Alan McDonald in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>She won a silver medal in the women's 200m T36 and bronze in the women's 100m T36 at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison and Shi, the current world champion, are long-time rivals, with both frequently placing on the podium and besting each other's record times at international meets.</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison earlier broke the 200m Paralympic record in the qualifiers, with a time of 28.21 seconds.</p>

            <p>Murray ensured New Zealand would celebrate a second podium in a little under three hours of competition at Paris 2024 by securing a comprehensive victory in the bronze medal final from Claudia Cretti of Italy in the Women's C5 3000m Individual Pursuit.</p>
        
            <p>Despite forgetting her prosthetic, the Kiwi had earlier hacked more than two-and-a-half seconds from her national record in qualification registering 3:37.599 and the 31-year-old Cambridge-based Para cyclist was even more impressive in the bronze medal final.</p>
        
            <p>Dominating from the early stages by the 1000m checkpoint she opened up a lead of more than three seconds on her Italian rival and maintained the relentless pace for remainder of the race.</p>
        
            <p>Rapidly closing in on the struggling Cretti, Murray flashed across the line in 3:36.201 to better her New Zealand record from earlier in the day to complete an outstanding ride.</p>
        
            <p>In an all French final, Marie Patouillet defeated reigning world champion Heidi Gaugain to take gold.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm over the moon," Murray said. "This is my first Paralympic medal it feels amazing, I'm glad I can honour the team and all the people around me and all the work they've put into me. It is cool to share that feeling with them."</p>
        
            <p>Leaving her prosthetic at the Paralympic Village for her qualification"definitely cost me time at the start of the race', she said. "</p>
        
            <p>But the team rallied and got the prosthetic or me for the final. I rode the final a lot smoother and a lot more consistently.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been trying to hold myself together for the podium - it will come out when I hug my parents. It's unreal. This is the first time they've seen me race at any international competition and it is very special. When you are on the road with the Team you endure all the highs and lows and they become like your family. It is always great to have that support around me."</p>
        
            <p>All three Kiwi Shooting Para sport athletes were in action at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre, though none advanced to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Six-time Paralympian Michael Johnson finished 20th in qualification for the R5 Mixed Air Rifle Prone SH2 event.</p>
        
            <p>Neelam O'Neill and Greg Reid missed out on advancing to the eight-strong final of the R3 Mixed 10m Air Rifle Prone SH1. In the qualification session, O'Neill finished in 21st with Reid 31st.</p>
