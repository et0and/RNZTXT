            <p>All Whites striker Chris Wood has made history after being named the Premier League's Player of the Month for October.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old is the first New Zealander and first Nottingham Forest player to win the award.</p>
        
            <p>He scored in all three appearances in October, netting four goals in total to help Forest go unbeaten through the month.</p>
        
            <p>Your PFA Premier League Fans’ Player of the Month for October. Congratulations, Chris Wood.  pic.twitter.com/vfd2gZ0wG8</p>
        
            <p>Forest drew with Chelsea, beat Crystal Palace and beat Leicester City.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm over the moon with it. It's a fantastic achievement," Wood told the Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a credit to all of us and how the team's working. I couldn't have done it without them. They supply me with all the chances, so it's nice that I've been able to tuck them away for them."</p>
        
            <p>Wood has already picked up where he left off in October, scoring in his only November appearance so far as Forest beat West Ham United 3-0 to rise to third in the Premier League table.</p>
        
            <p>He is now the Premier League's second-highest scorer this season, on eight goals, three behind Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race.</p>
        
            <p>His eight goals have come from just 21 shots, too. No player to have had at least 20 attempts has a better conversion rate than Wood's 38.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi joined Forest from Newcastle United in 2023, initially on loan.</p>
        
            <p>Remarkably, since Nuno Espirito Santo's first match as Nottingham Forest head coach on 23 December 2023, Wood has scored 18 non-penalty goals. That is the joint-highest total of all Premier League players during that period, along with Haaland.</p>
        
            <p>Nuno was also named Manager of the Month.</p>
