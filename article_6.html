        <h2>No curfew in place for Warriors amid 'bright lights' of Vegas</h2>

"There's no respect from me to them, if I do that - that's not how we roll," coach Andrew Webster says.

            <p>Despite the temptations of the Las Vegas Strip just outside their hotel doors, NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster has no intention of imposing a firm curfew on his players, when they head stateside for their NRL season opener against Canberra Raiders next week.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland club has been selected for the second instalment of the rugby league showcase in the world's most lucrative sporting market, after Manly Sea Eagles, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Sydney Roosters and Brisbane Broncos dipped their toes into the pond last year.</p>
        
            <p>That successful venture - thankfully - seemed to pass without any off-field scandal and Webster is confident his team will not slur the competition's reputation this time.</p>
        
            <p>"I just don't do curfews," he insisted. "The boys know when they've got to be home, it's common sense.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not me saying, 'You've got to be home at 9 o'clock tonight' and then sitting in the foyer at 9.01pm, when someone's missing and knocking on their room.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no respect from me to them, if I do that - that's not how we roll. It's common sense and if someone is walking down the street, getting an ice cream at 9.30pm, I won't be crying about it."</p>
        
            <p>The game will present its share of onfield challenges, and the Warriors have played and practised on narrower dimensions to prepare for the skinnier American football layout, but that's only a very small part of what awaits them in 'Sin City'.</p>
        
            <p>To a first-time Kiwi or Pacific Island visitor, every big US city can be a mindblowing experience, but Vegas is New York on steroids.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not around the conditions," Webster said. "It's not going to be as hot as everyone thinks it will be - this time of year in Las Vegas will be very similar to one of our winters, so we won't struggle with that one.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's more about the bright lights that we'll have to acclimatise to. We're there to win, but we're there to enjoy the experience at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>"The pitch is one thing, but the pitch is the same for both teams."</p>
        
            <p>With all its sights and sounds, Vegas can suck the energy out of visitors over the course of a few days and the Warriors will be there a week, before they take on the Raiders.</p>

            <p>During the build-up to this game, every Warriors player who fronts the media has been quizzed about their excitement at making this pilgrimage. Every one of them talks about winning first.</p>
        
            <p>"I promise you, I'll have a better time than anyone," Webster said. "They'll have a vote on the way home on who had the best time and I'll be that guy.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now, I'm not… I'm just focused on the win, but as it gets closer, I'm getting more excited.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys get to say they played in an NFL stadium, but not many get to say 'in America'. It's an unbelievable experience for them, but I want them to remember it for the right reasons.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to kick our season off really well at a great venue, and we can draw on that experience and how much fun we had.</p>
        
            <p>"I reckon it's a great mental hurdle that will help us for the rest of the season."</p>
        
            <p>Promoters have worked to put NFL legends alongside this event to give it local credibility. The names of Super Bowl heroes Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski have been part of the hype, while US President Donald Trump is another rumoured for a surprise appearance.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awesome to put our game on the map, particularly in the States, which is the biggest sporting location in the world," Webster said. "They have a knack for making something small seem very big, they're very good at promoting things.</p>
        
            <p>"I think our game will promote itself, but having those guys around can help promote it. If Trump did one of his amazing tweets about NRL, that would be pretty cool… I'm staying out of politics, by the way.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots of good press for our game and great for our club."</p>
