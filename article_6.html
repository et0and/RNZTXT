            <p>It has been a horror first session on day three for the Black Caps as they look to save the test series against Sri Lanka in Galle.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has been forced to follow on after crumbling to 88 all out in their first innings.</p>
        
            <p>Asked to bat again, Tom Latham has already fallen as the Black Caps still trail by more than 500 runs, and are 3/1 at lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Starting the day at 22 for two, the Kiwis lost a further eight wickets, with Prabath Jayasuria the chief destroyer for the hosts, the left arm spinner claiming figures of 6/42.</p>
        
            <p>With the openers sent back to the sheds late on day two, Ajaz Patel was called in as nightwatchman, and stood at the other end as both Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra lost their wickets cheaply.</p>
        
            <p>Patel was next to go for a 41-ball eight as he was trapped in front, followed in quick succession by Tom Blundell and Glenn Phillips for one and none respectively.</p>
        
            <p>The last of the batsmen then sent one into the safe hands of Angelo Matthews as Daryl Mitchell also fell cheaply.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee had no answers to Jayasuria, nicking one behind to leave the Black Caps reeling at nine down with a mountain ahead of them.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Santner, who top scored with 29, was last to go as he lost his off stump to Nishan Peiris who took 3/33.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka took complete control of the test on day two as Kamindu Mendis scored his fifth century with the Lions piling on 602-5 declared</p>
        
            <p>His 182 saw him become the became the fastest Asian player to score 1000 test runs, doing so in just 13 innings.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka gave themselves 14 overs at the visitors before stumps and made them count.</p>
        
            <p>Asitha Fernando struck in the first over to dismiss Tom Latham for two, Jayasuria claiming the wicket of the struggling Devon Conway for nine.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps lost the first test by 63 runs and are winless in Galle from five attempts dating back to 1998.</p>
