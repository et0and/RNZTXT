        <h2>'They think that I'm mad': Man close to cracking half century playing rugby</h2>
        <p>
Gavin "Brick" Midgley has been playing rugby since 1981 - but won't decide if he will make it to 50 years of the sport until next season nears.

            <p>If the man they call Brick laces up his boots for one more season next year it will be his 50th playing senior rugby.</p>
        
            <p>And at the age of 65, Gavin Midgley still hits as hard as his nickname suggests.</p>
        
            <p>He has just finished another season of club matches and says he will not make a decision about what to do next year until closer to the season, but bringing up a half century must hold some allure.</p>
        
            <p>Gavin "Brick" Midgley began playing for Inglewood United Rugby Football Club in Taranaki in 1981, and he still plays, turning out as hooker or prop for their second team.</p>
        
            <p>His senior rugby days go back further, to North Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I started playing senior rugby up there when I was 16, so next year if I play it would be 50 years playing senior rugby."</p>
        
            <p>Midgley's family has long since given up asking if he will quit, although the thought of retiring did cross his mind - three decades ago.</p>
        
            <p>"The closest I got to that was when I was about 35 and I thought, 'That's enough, I've had enough of rugby'.</p>
        
            <p>"But we were going through a shortage of props about that stage and I thought I'll stay on and play."</p>
        
            <p>And he has been playing ever since.</p>
        
            <p>Former club mates include Taranaki reps and All Black Dave Loveridge.</p>
        
            <p>Many of these men have long since retired, but they still catch up.</p>
        
            <p>"[They think] that I'm mad still playing," Midgley said.</p>
        
            <p>"It keeps me fit so that's half the reason I keep on playing anyway."</p>
        
            <p>That, and being part of a team.</p>
        
            <p>Over summer, Midgley said he rode his bike on Taranaki trails to keep the body in shape, when he was not at work at Fitzroy Engineering - the New Plymouth company he moved to the region to join in 1981.</p>
        
            <p>He has played up and down the grades over the years, finishing top-division rugby with a championship win in 2006, aged 47.</p>
        
            <p>"The weekend before semis we played Waverley or Border in the Taranaki competition and I think we had three or four props get injured that day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The coach turned around to me at half time and said, 'It looks like you better bring your boots on Tuesday night for practice'."</p>
        
            <p>Midgley did and he played 30 minutes of the semi-final and 60 minutes in Inglewood's grand final win.</p>
        
            <p>The next oldest player in Midgley's team is 39 and the youngest are in their teens.</p>
        
            <p>Teammate and now team manager Kane Anderson said Midgley's seen off a new generation.</p>
        
            <p>"This guy who use to play in our team a couple of years ago - he's my age, 31, and Brick used to play with his dad."</p>
        
            <p>Midgley's a rugby man through and through, and had filled all sorts of roles at the club, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's always the first one at training. Sometimes he beats me. He's always the first one on game day.</p>
        
            <p>"He just loves rugby so much. It really has been his life for the last 40-odd years."</p>
        
            <p>And despite his age, Midgley could still take the hits - and dish them out.</p>
        
            <p>"He's pretty hard-arsed for a 65-year-old. He doesn't shy away from any contact," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"He just puts himself out there as best as he can, 100 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing that lets him down is he hasn't moved on from the early 2000s-1990s-style rugby when lying on the ball was okay.</p>
        
            <p>"He gets penalised a bit for not clearing the ruck."</p>
        
            <p>Midgley's famous for not getting injured and a recent calf complaint did not keep him from his Saturday run around.</p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless at his stage of life, Midgley does suffer the odd niggle.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a pretty good guy who does physio for us - a guy I used to play with," Midgley said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got into the physio side now and as long as we haven't done anything too bad he can work the injury out with a good rub down."</p>
        
            <p>Midgley said the game had changed a lot down the decades, and he had seen a few eras.</p>
        
            <p>"We were playing a better brand of rugby through the 1990s, probably, when Auckland was pretty strong.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that was a better running-type rugby. Now, we pretty much play league, as far as I'm concerned. We've just got a couple of extra players on the paddock."</p>
