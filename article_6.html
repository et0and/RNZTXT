            <p>The Tall Blacks have beaten the Philippines 87-70 in Auckland to top their pool and earn a favourable draw at basketball's Asia Cup in August.</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks started the third window of the FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers with a 92-51 win over Hong Kong in Hong Kong on Thursday before a gruelling turn-around and long-haul flight back to Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides had already qualified for the Asia Cup in Saudi Arabia but today's game decided the outright winner of Group B, and a place in the best pool in August.</p>
        
            <p>A three point barrage in first half gave the Tall Blacks an early advantage.</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks dominated the first half, leading 53-33 at the main break but the Philippines toiled hard in the third quarter, losing the period by just one point.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand led 74-55 going into the final quarter and the Philippines closed the gap to single figures but the Tall Blacks managed to keep the visitors at arms length.</p>
        
            <p>Tohi Smith-Milner top scored for New Zealand with 25 points.</p>
        
            <p>Corey Webster, who brought up his 100th game for the Tall Blacks, was a calming presence with 14 points.</p>
