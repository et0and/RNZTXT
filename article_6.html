            <p>It's the beef that's been brewing for over a year.</p>
        
            <p>At UFC 305, Kiwi Israel Adesanya will make his return to the octagon after a year long hiatus as he looks to regain his middleweight title against South African champion Dricus Du Plessis.</p>
        
            <p>And this one is personal.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday marks the first UFC title fight between two African-born fighters. The bad blood between the two stems from Du Plessis claiming he is the first true African champion in the UFC, as he lives and trains on the continent.</p>
        
            <p>The Nigerian-born Adesanya in turn called Du Plessis a coloniser, and during their first face-off screamed a racial slur a dozen times in his face.</p>
        
            <p>"Who I am as a person, my culture has never shifted. I got a tattoo of Nigeria with a line inside of my chest, where I'm from that will never, ever be taken away from me," Adesanya told UFC Embedded.</p>
        
            <p>Du Plessis in turn insists he is unemotional about the feud.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely personal for him because he took a lot of of offence at me speaking the truth. I stated facts, he's angry, I don't care, at the end of the day I am here for my business which is winning this fight."</p>
        
            <p>Their next encounter came at a press conference promoting the card back in July, in which the pair engaged in the most intense and prolonged staredown in UFC history.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been here before, I've battled with the best, no one can intimidate me, I expect him to bring his best, that's what I want," Adesanya said.</p>
        
            <p>The two-time champ is feeling more dangerous than ever after his time out of the cage.</p>
        
            <p>"Same animal but different beast."</p>
        
            <p>The title picture was seriously shaken up at UFC 293 in Sydney. The middleweight merry-go-round began in September 2023 when Sean Strickland shocked the world with a five round domination of Adesanya to steal the strap. In Strickland's first defence, he was edged in a fiercely close split decision to crown Du Plessis the new king.</p>
        
            <p>The South African poses a huge challenge to Adesanya. Both are world class kickboxers, while Dricus also has a strong wrestling pedigree and will put Adesanya's quality takedown defence to the test.</p>

            <p>Adesanya showed in his last bout against Strickland that his back foot, point-fighting style can be nullified should the opponent be willing to walk him down and force engagement.</p>
        
            <p>Though fan anticipation is palpable, Du Plessis is playing down the hype.</p>
        
            <p>"This fight is not any bigger to me than any other fight, I'm going out there to win or die trying, that's every single fight."</p>
        
            <p>For the 'Last Stylebender' however, there is much more on the line on Sunday than just the belt. This could be his final shot at gold should he lose in convincing fashion.</p>
        
            <p>After fighting five times in 16 months culminating in the loss to Strickland, Adesanya is now coming off the longest hiatus of his combat sports career.</p>
        
            <p>"Camp was awesome, it was refreshing, it was one of the best ones if not the best one yet. we reshuffled the deck, I have raised the level of athlete and fighter I am by taking this break."</p>
        
            <p>He said his team saw the need to scale back the activity.</p>
        
            <p>"They saw the detriment it was doing to me so it was good to refresh everything."</p>
        
            <p>He said the time off had given him a new perspective on his career.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot has happened in the last eleven months, I had to go through a lot of soul searching, asking myself, 'what do I want my legacy to be?'"</p>
        
            <p>Responding to those who say his title days are over, he is quick to remind people that they said the same following his loss to Alex Pereira .</p>
        
            <p>"This weekend, I want to do what I have to do, and when I do it, people will be like 'f*** how did we not see this coming? How did we underestimate that he was going to do this?' It's time to remind people."</p>
        
            <p>Sunday will mark the biggest card for Kiwis in 2024, with it also set to feature Kai 'Don't Blink' Kara-France and Dan 'The Hangman' Hooker from City Kick Boxing as well as Kiwi born Junior Tafa.</p>
        
            <p>Hooker is riding a two-fight win streak and is planning to steal the show at 305. He meets the number five ranked lightweight in Mateusz Gamrot, a number which has Hooker, ranked eleven, eager to make a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to make it exciting. That's why they put this fight together. I will press that action."</p>
        
            <p>Kara France meanwhile will meet Steve Ergec in the co-main in a clash of former title challengers at flyweight, both looking for a shot at champion Alexandre Pantoja.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a massive fight for the division, this can't not be fireworks."</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya said the CKB camp is primed for battle in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>"When you bleed together in the training, you sweat together in training, then it's time to go to war, we're brothers in the trenches, they're all integral parts of our team. When we go to war, we hold the f***in' line."</p>
