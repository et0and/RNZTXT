            <p>The White Ferns will play West Indies in their T20 World Cup semi-final after a dramatic last game of group play.</p>
        
            <p>West Indies, the 2016 World Cup winners, beat England by six wickets in Dubai to eliminate the English from the play-offs.</p>
        
            <p>West Indies, South Africa and England all finished group play on six points, with the English missing out on the semi-finals on net run rate.</p>
        
            <p>After being asked to bat first England made 141 for seven with Nat Sciver-Brunt top scoring with an unbeaten 57.</p>
        
            <p>In reply, West Indies got off to a rollicking start getting through to 102 before losing their first wicket in the 12th over.</p>
        
            <p>They were also helped by England dropping numerous catches.</p>
        
            <p>The Caribbean side got home with two overs to spare, finishing on 144 for four.</p>
        
            <p>Qiana Joseph made 52 and captain Hayley Matthews 50.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think many people had us reaching this point in the tournament so I'm incredibly proud of the group," captain Matthews told the ICC afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"We were up against all odds today and the way we came out in the first half with the ball and then to put on a performance with the bat with Qiana Joseph scoring her first 50... what a time to do it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a big game against New Zealand, but we're up for the challenge."</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time the West Indies have beaten England in 14 matches.</p>
        
            <p>Australia, who topped group A, will play South Africa in Dubai on Friday morning and New Zealand will play West Indies in Sharjah on Saturday morning.</p>
