            <p>Gauff had a straight sets win, 6-3 6-0, over the Czech qualifier Brenda Fruhvirtova.</p>
        
            <p>Gauff beat fellow American Claire Liu in her opening match also in straight sets.</p>
        
            <p>The top seed was pleased with performance particular her serve against an opponent she has known since she was a youngster.</p>
        
            <p>"I have known (Fruhvirtova) since I was ten years old. We used to be in France training in the same academy...we grew up training and playing alongside each other, so its great to see her on tour and I am sure she will go further than she has here," Gauff told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Gauff was satisfied with her form heading into the quarterfinals.</p>
        
            <p>"For the most part yes. It was a good match and I won but feel I can raise my level a lot more and that's what's it like in the New Year but hopefully playing back to back matches I will be satisfied by the end of the week."</p>
