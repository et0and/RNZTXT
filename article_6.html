            <p>NZ Warriors coach Andrew Webster has hinted he will give his humbled players a chance to redeem themselves, after slumping to a disappointing season-opening defeat to Canberra Raiders in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the Auckland club was part of a rugby league showcase for the American sports market, featuring an NRL doubleheader, an English Super League clash, and a women's international between Australia and England at Allegiant Stadium, home of the NFL Las Vegas Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>Despite their best intentions, the Warriors barely fired a shot, falling 30-8 against a Raiders outfit that missed the playoffs last season and aren't expected to return in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Some of Webster's players certainly did not live up to expectations, but rather than wield an axe, he's more inclined to give them another opportunity, before ringing wholesale changes.</p>
        
            <p>The spotlight burned white hot on new halfback Luke Metcalfe, who inherited the No.7 jersey from club legend Shaun Johnson, but struggled to control the game in his new role. His intercepted pass near the tryline resulted in a Raiders score at the other end, a potential 12-point swing that proved the defining moment of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Further along the backline, there are renewed calls for former Dally M Medal winner Roger Tuivasa-Sheck to move from wing to fullback, after an unhappy display by Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad at the back. He spilled a high ball under his posts that gifted Kiwi centre Sebastian Kris his second try just after halftime.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'm being honest, I want to give these guys an opportunity to right the wrongs," Webster said. "You won't see many changes at all."</p>
        
            <p>After the game, Webster observed that his players had not handled their surroundings well, succumbing to the occasion and the bright lights of 'Sin City'. Now back home and preparing for their first home game at Go Media Stadium, they must turn their fortunes around quickly against a rampant Manly Sea Eagles.</p>
        
            <p>That lineup will be named on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"There's frustration that you work so hard, and you don't see the reflection of what we were and what we practiced and what we wanted to be," admitted Webster. "That's the frustration.</p>
        
            <p>"The emotion of being away… there was a big build-up, because it was Vegas… all our fans were there, we were the most-supported team… it definitely hurts more, because you feel like you're letting people down.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day, it is round one and any time you lose a game, you have to look at it and say you weren't good enough, because two points always matter.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a case of there being any doubt, certainly not, but it's more a case of frustration that we weren't a reflection of the way we practiced all pre-season."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have had the dubious luxury of an extra week to stew over their shortcomings, while the other 13 teams - Gold Coast had a bye - completed their opening fixtures.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes with those games, you can't wait to turn around and play again," said co-captain Mitch Barnett. "We've had to let it soak.</p>
        
            <p>"At the start [of the game], we put a lot of energy in, but we weren't very technical. We burned a lot of energy and made a few errors.</p>
        
            <p>"There were still positives there. Some of the tries they scored were just individual moments and, if we owned those individual moments, the scoreline could have been very different.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a good hard look at ourselves, a bit of a wake-up call, we've moved on and we're setting the intent for Friday night."</p>
        
            <p>If there are changes, they may emerge from the Warriors Reserves, who opened their NSW Cup campaign with a scratchy, come-from-behind win over Canberra on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The contest marked the return of centre Rocco Berry and halfback Tannah Boyd from injury, while centre Moala Graham-Taufa scored a try double.</p>
        
            <p>Five-eighth Te Maire Martin may force his way into the halves, winger Ed Kosi may challenge specialist fullback Taine Tuaupiki on the wing, and young forwards Jacob Laban and Tom Ale may force their way onto the interchange bench.</p>
        
            <p>Or Webster may prove a man of his word and stick with the players that let him down at Vegas.</p>
