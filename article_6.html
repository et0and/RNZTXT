        <h2>For the love of the game: Monfils returns to the ASB Classic</h2>
        <p>
The French veteran is still enjoying himself on the ATP tour - and is now in his 21st year.

            <p>Gaël Monfils has reached a point in his career where he doesn't really know what to do next. But that's not to say he's not still enjoying himself, in fact the "love" that he has for tennis is something he can't stop mentioning.</p>
        
            <p>The 38-year-old is back at the ASB Classic for the second year in a row and third time overall, taking on Spain's Pedro Martinez in the first round today at Stanley Street.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm coming here with a bit of confidence…I love tennis, I love what I'm doing. When you love something, it makes it easier to do," said Monfils.</p>
        
            <p>That's a lot of love, considering that 2025 will be his 21st year on the ATP tour. He's been remarkably consistent, staying in the top 50 for all but four of those years, reaching a high of seventh back in 2016. He's long been known for his flamboyant and crowd-pleasing style and was involved in the best game of last year's tournament, when he lost a three-set thriller to Hungarian Fábián Marozsán.</p>

            <p>As a proud Frenchman, he said his desire to represent his country at last year's Paris Olympics was an "obsession", however it's left him in a unique position.</p>
        
            <p>"This year is the first time in my life where I don't have goals, any type of needs or anything," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing I need is to enjoy myself…I've been enjoying myself since the first day I played tennis. The biggest problem is travel - practice is easy, staying in shape is easy - but being able to see my daughter, this is a joy I must have."</p>
        
            <p>Monfils is coming off a second round exit at the Brisbane International last week, although that's no shame considering the player who knocked him out.</p>
        
            <p>"Last week playing against Novak (Djokovic) was great, big crowd, full house, it's beautiful. Hopefully I will find a goal or interest soon. The Olympics, that was the goal. There's less expectation for myself…it's a bit different. I'm happy with the 2024 season."</p>
        
            <p>At 38, Monfils is the oldest player in the top 100. Still playing at this level at that age presents a lot of challenges with fitness, however he said that he is managing his fitness well.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm lucky enough, I can still move OK."</p>
        
            <p>The other match of interest today is Auckland-raised Cam Norrie against Argentine lucky loser qualifier Facundo Diaz Acosta. Norrie comes in having slipped out of the top 50 after a tough 2024 in terms of both results and injuries but will still be harbouring a desire to win on home turf, however, the feeling is this may be one of the last times he'll be able to.</p>
