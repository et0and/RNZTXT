            <p>Rugby Australia (RA) is preparing a legal counter-claim against directors of the defunct Melbourne Rebels who are suing the governing body over the demise of the Super Rugby club.</p>
        
            <p>The directors lodged a claim at Australia's Federal Court this week and are seeking $33 million in damages from RA.</p>
        
            <p>RA spurned a rescue deal in May for the indebted club which was shuttered at the end of the Super Rugby Pacific season in June.</p>
        
            <p>RA said it rejected the directors' "ambit claims" and "attempts to shift blame for their financial mismanagement".</p>
        
            <p>"RA is preparing a counterclaim against MRRU (Melbourne Rebels Rugby Union) and its directors for misleading and deceptive conduct concerning the financial position of MRRU dating back to 2018," the governing body said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Had RA not been misled or deceived, it would not have provided MRRU with a participation licence and thus not lost in excess of $38 million that was paid to MRRU since at least 1 July 2018."</p>
        
            <p>Responding to the statement, the Rebels directors said RA had made false and self-serving counter-claims.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe this to be a desperate attempt to deflect attention from the reality of the situation that the RA Executive and Board have put the sport into," the directors said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want an independent person to decide whether the conduct of Rugby Australia meets the standards required by law - and that will now be a Federal Court Judge."</p>
        
            <p>The Rebels went into voluntary administration in January with debts of more than $22 million.</p>
        
            <p>RA stepped in to fund the Rebels' operations, including paying player and staff wages, to ensure the team could play out the season.</p>
        
            <p>The Rebels' administrator said this year that the club may have been trading while insolvent from 31 December, 2018. It recommended creditors accept a deal put forward by them to save the debt-ridden team.</p>
        
            <p>Creditors accepted the deal but RA rejected it, saying it was not sufficiently viable.</p>
