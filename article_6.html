            <p>Anton Lienert-Brown perplexed expression as he was ordered from the field was a perfect illustration of what fans were feeling watching on. Both he and Quinten Strange were sent off for HIA's despite neither appearing to suffer a significant collision. Turns out the technology simply failed at the wrong time, something the competition can't afford to happen again going forward.</p>

            <p>Following a mass exodus of All Blacks, 2024 provides the opportunity for the next generation of stars to stand up. Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens is already touted as the signing of the season. JRK was sensational under the roof in Dunedin, clearly benefitting from being trusted in the 15 jersey. Peter Lakai, given the unenviable task of filling Ardie Savea's boots, impressed in Perth for the Hurricanes. Chay Fihaki, stepping up into the 15 jersey in Will Jordan's absence, bagged a brace and was a big part of the Crusaders' epic comeback. On the other side for the Chiefs, Xavier Roe was solid, running the perfect halfback line to score a pearler under the sticks - a feat matched by debutant Jordi Viljoen for the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>The star studded Kobe Steelers scraped home in the rain against the Black Rams. Ngani Laumape continues to demonstrate what a loss he was to New Zealand's midfield stocks, scoring one and setting up another try in his side's hard fought 27-17 win.</p>
        
            <p>Italy were denied an historic 6 Nations victory against France by the barest of margins. Paolo Gabrisi was forced to rush his last-minute penalty due to the ball falling off the tee as well as a French player illegally attempting to charge it down, the heart-breaking miss leaving the sides deadlocked at 13-all.</p>
        
            <p>Arguably the world's best player broke Irish hearts with his first try for the French Sevens side proving to be a crucial one.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's easy beats showed they have plenty to offer in their third season of Super Rugby. An overhaul to the team had many wondering the way forward, but signs were positive in Dunedin, particularly in the first half. Julian Savea looked solid in the 12 jersey, William Havili continues to come of age, and Miracle Faiʻilagi and Lotu Inisi were tireless in the pack. Things won't get easier, but it's a good start.</p>

            <p>Referees were visibly more vigilant about time wasting tactics while the detested scrum reset did not chew up nearly as many minutes and we also saw very little TMO interference. The first half of the Blues vs Drua match saw only two minutes of additional time, so it shows how just a few minor tweaks can change a great deal.</p>
        
            <p>Proving to be England's biggest headache since Jonah Lomu, the destructive Duhan van der Merwe followed his try of the year against the old enemy in 2023 with a superb hat-trick at the weekend as Scotland beat England 30-21 at Murrayfield in the Six Nations.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen Perofeta- After a promising pre-season in Japan, the Blues first five didn't exactly take the reins the way he should have in what turned out to be a comfortable win against the Drua.</p>
        
            <p>Zarn Sullivan- His prodigious boot sets him apart from the pack and should Scott Robertson want a player who can turn a defensive penalty into an attacking lineout 50 metres down the field, Sullivan fits that mould perfectly.</p>
        
            <p>How's this for a post-match celebration from the Italian U20's?</p>

            <p>There were some screamers to kick start the Super Season, but the standout has to be the Highlanders 72nd minute effort against Moana. Sparked by a Sean Withy bust, the replacement flanker linked with Jona Nareki out wide who in turn found Folau Fakatava. The Hawke's Bay halfback threw an outrageous out the back offload for Billy Harmon, giving the final pass for Sam Gilbert to crash over in the corner. Honourable mention goes to Stade Français ' Peniasi Dakuwaqa for this unbelievable solo effort in the Top 14.</p>

            <p>"Obviously we want player welfare and that's paramount, but I think if you are influencing the game where key players are going off and they don't know what for that can be frustrating, there needs to be a happy medium somewhere." - Scott Barrett, Crusaders captain on smart mouth guards.</p>
