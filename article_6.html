            <p>Having celebrated his 67th birthday with 67 somersaults, Bruce Hopkins is looking to go one better to mark 68 years with more philanthropic flips.</p>
        
            <p>The actor will attempt the feat off a tower that days later will see the world's best cliff divers launch off for the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series in Wynyard Quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce will be leaping from a six metre tower, reaching speeds of up to 40km while the Red Bull Cliff Divers will later be launching from a 27 metre and 21 metre platform at speeds of about 85km.</p>
        
            <p>"I will be doing my humble exit from the lowest platform on the tower which they they do some practices on. It's going to be a nice little challenge because it's probably one and a half to two meters higher that what I jumped off last year."</p>
        
            <p>Discussing the risks involved, Hopkins mentioned the significant force experienced by professional cliff divers, reaching up to 10 G's upon impact.</p>
        
            <p>While acknowledging the dangers they face, he said that his challenge is not as extreme, though still physically demanding.</p>
        
            <p>"So they can literally die if they absolutely wipe out. I'm not risking my life. but when I did the 67 I found it quite fascinating how knackered I was at the end of it. You go into that little state of mind where you're a bit floaty in the head."</p>
        
            <p>While the pros will be competing for the world title that weekend, the actor best known for his role in Lord of the Rings as 'Gamling', will be jumping to raise funds for a cause that is close to his heart, Grandparents Raising Grandchildren.</p>
        
            <p>Over the years Bruce has helped raise over $30,000 for the organization- his past feats include walking the entire Te Araroa Trail.</p>
        
            <p>Hopkins highlighted the financial struggles faced by many grandparents raising grandchildren and urged well-off pensioners to consider donating a portion of their pension to make a positive impact on the lives of those in need.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a mid baby boomer person and I think we've had the most kind blessed era to come through. We have had essentially damn comfortable lives compared to the generation before us and now our mokopuna and tamariki are having to face a world that is just rampant in spiralling costs."</p>
        
            <p>The Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series is coming to New Zealand for the first time ever for the series season finale and 98th stop on the tour.</p>
        
            <p>The finals take place on 27 and 28 January 2024 at Wynyard Quarter, Auckland</p>
