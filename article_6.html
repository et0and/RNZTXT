            <p>The International Cricket Council says the pitch for the second test between the Black Caps and Bangladesh was "unsatisfactory".</p>
        
            <p>The ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process stated that the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur has been rated as "unsatisfactory" and that the venue has incurred one demerit point.</p>
        
            <p>The match, which finished on Saturday, lasted just 177 overs and spinners took 30 of the 35 wickets to fall.</p>

            <p>New Zealand won the test by four wickets to level the series and afterwards Black caps captain Tim Southee described the pitch as "probably the worst wicket" he had played on.</p>
        
            <p>Match Referee, David Boon, assessed that the bounce was inconsistent "from the first session onwards."</p>
        
            <p>The report has been forwarded to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), who now have 14 days if they wish to appeal against the sanction.</p>
        
            <p>Mr Boon said: "The outfield was very good and held up extremely well with the rain.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it appeared that the pitch may have been under prepared, as it was not hard and was covered in grass clippings on day one.</p>
        
            <p>"From the first session onwards, throughout the remainder of the match the bounce was inconsistent with numerous balls bursting the surface.</p>
        
            <p>"Deliveries from spin bowlers often went over the batter's shoulder when playing forward and then occasionally stayed very low."</p>
        
            <p>One demerit point will be awarded to venues whose pitches and outfields are rated by the match referees as unsatisfactory, while three demerit points will be awarded to venues whose pitches and outfields are marked as unfit.</p>
        
            <p>Demerit points will remain active for a rolling five-year period.</p>
        
            <p>When a venue accumulates six demerit points (or crosses that threshold), it will be suspended from hosting any international cricket for 12 months, while a venue will be suspended from staging any international cricket for 24 months when it reaches the threshold of 12 demerit points.</p>
