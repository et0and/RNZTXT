            <p>The Warriors assistant coach Richard Agar has accepted the fine and suspension handed down by the National Rugby League following an investigation into an altercation in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>Agar was the subject of an Integrity Unit probe over allegations that he physically assaulted English journalist John Davidson in the media box at half-time of the Warriors season opener against the Canberra Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>The breach notice issued last week proposed a $10,000 fine (half-suspended) and a three-game suspension, along with a requirement for appropriate education and training.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors chief executive Cameron George said the club and Agar have accepted the penalty.</p>
        
            <p>"It's in the best interests of the club, the players and the game to accept the penalty and move on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't condone Richard's actions. While he has a different view on some elements of the breach notice he wants to put the club first and accept the decision."</p>
        
            <p>Agar said he regrets what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I know it's not acceptable. I accept the penalty and now want to move forward and learn from this."</p>
