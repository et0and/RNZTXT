        <h2>NRL: Warriors coach Andrew Webster backs Metcalf for hotly contested halves duty</h2>

He admits picking his side for Friday night's season opener against the Sharks was "not easy, but it's something I'm really proud of".

            <p>Warriors coach Andrew Webster admitted picking his side for Friday night's season opener against the Sharks was "not easy, but it's something I'm really proud of."</p>
        
            <p>The reigning Dally M coach of the year has opted for a pairing of Luke Metcalf and Shaun Johnson in the hotly contested halves, with Metcalf's bulked up presence and attitude at training giving him the nod.</p>
        
            <p>"He put a lot of (training) sessions together," Webster told media.</p>
        
            <p>"He's put on six or seven kilos and he looks like he's in control, looks like he knows how to inject himself. He can play on the ball if we have to and I feel like he's going to be a threat."</p>
        
            <p>Webster also singled out the 24-year-old's work on the other side of the ball, who spent two seasons at the Sharks before crossing the ditch.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been impressed with his defence. If you want to play in our team you have to know how to do that, and he's certainly improved in that," Webster said.</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf has beaten out the incumbent standoff Te Maire Martin, as well as the returning Chanel Harris-Tavita.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a hard decision, with Te Maire and Chanel. They're both great footballers, but I also want to celebrate what Luke's achieved."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Webster's selections for the remainder of the side was simply based on form.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the way they played and trained, it's as simple as that. Anyone we pick, we know they're going to do a great job. And also proud that guys are turning around and saying 'Webby I want to play reserve grade, I want to get better', no one's spitting their dummy."</p>
        
            <p>The other real area of conversation is the make up of the Warriors bench, with Webster's hand forced due to a foot injury to Marata Niukore, who is expected back in round four.</p>
        
            <p>Freddy Lussick and Dylan Walker offer utility value but it means the Warriors do look a little light on the bench against a strong Sharks side.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think I've seen the Sharks start poorly, even when we won here last year they flew out of the blocks. We know they play tough footy, they play with a lot of skill too, there's threats across the park."</p>
        
            <p>A big crowd is expected at Go Media Stadium Mt Smart on Friday night, but Webster warned that both sides might be a little rusty in their first outing of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's OK that we're not going to be perfect this week, but it's how we cover up those mistakes, how do we move on quickly."</p>
