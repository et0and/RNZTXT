            <p>PGA Tour Champions season victor Steven Alker has designs on finally winning the New Zealand Open next year.</p>
        
            <p>Alker, who won the season-long Charles Schwab Cup on the Champions tour last month for the second time, has twice finished second in the NZ Open - in 2001 and 2002.</p>
        
            <p>His first attempt at winning it dates back 35 years when he was a schoolboy and leading amateur in the 1989 edition, won by Greg Turner.</p>
        
            <p>Alker, 53, has told Open organisers he will compete in the 2025 Open at Millbrook Resort, starting on February 27.</p>
        
            <p>It's a title he desperately wants to win and see his named etched on to the Brodie Breeze Trophy, alongside famous Kiwi golf names such as Sir Bob Charles, Campbell and Turner.</p>
        
            <p>Alker finished joint runner-up with Michael Campbell when David Smail won in 2001, and Alker and Campbell were one stroke away from Australian Craig Parry the following year at Paraparaumu Beach.</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely, the aim is to be holding the trophy come the end of the tournament next year. To win the New Zealand Open is something I have always wanted to achieve and I feel that my game is in a great place in terms of consistency and performance under pressure," Alker said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some great names on that trophy and I would love to see my name on there too. I have watched a few other Kiwis get the chance to lift the trophy, I hope that 2025 is my turn."</p>
        
            <p>No one could argue with his comment about his game being in a great place.</p>
        
            <p>Since he joined the Champions Tour on turning 50, he has been one of its most consistent performers.</p>
        
            <p>He won the Charles Schwab Cup for being the top player in 2022, was runner-up in 2023 and won it again this year.</p>
        
            <p>Alker has won $16.5 million since joining the tour.</p>
