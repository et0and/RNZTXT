            <p>An appeal court in Nepal on Wednesday cleared the country's highest-profile cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane, who was convicted by a lower court of raping an 18-year-old woman.</p>
        
            <p>His lawyers welcomed the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Lamichhane, 23, has been the face of cricket in Nepal and the only player from the Himalayan country to take part in prominent Twenty20 leagues in India, Australia, Pakistan and West Indies.</p>
        
            <p>The leg-spinner was suspended as Nepal's captain and taken into custody after police issued an arrest warrant for him over the assault in 2022. He was later released on bail.</p>
        
            <p>Kathmandu district court sentenced him to eight years in jail in January and said he should also pay about $3770 as a fine and compensation to the victim.</p>
        
            <p>Lamichhane's lawyers said the High Court, Patan, concluding the hearing on his appeal, set him free.</p>
        
            <p>"He had to be cleared and the high court has set him free. He was not guilty," Sabita Bhadari Baral, a lawyer for the player told Reuters after the court verdict, details of which are yet to be released.</p>
        
            <p>A jubilant Lamichhane appeared at the court premises after the verdict.</p>
        
            <p>His supporters blew traditional musical pipes and beat drums to celebrate.</p>
