            <p>Auckland FC coach Steve Corica praised his team's ability to respond to their first-ever A-League defeat as the competition's newcomers handed champions Central Coast Mariners a 4-1 thrashing to move four points clear at the top of the standings.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders, playing in their debut season in the A-League, bounced back from their 4-0 loss at the hands of Western United last week with a clinical display in Gosford on Saturday that saw Corica's side extend their advantage at the summit.</p>

            <p>"It was a great response to last week," said the former Sydney FC coach.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what we were looking for.</p>
        
            <p>"We all worked very hard for each other today, with the ball and without it. It's a first for us, to score four goals as well, which is great."</p>
        
            <p>Former Japan international Hiroki Sakai gave Auckland the lead with a 12th-minute header and, while Alfie McCalmont levelled for the home side two minutes later, goals from Jake Brimmer, Guillermo May and Logan Rogerson secured victory.</p>
        
            <p>The win was Auckland's first in three matches and, with second-placed Adelaide United losing 3-2 to Western Sydney Wanderers on Friday, the A-League debutantes overcame their mini-slump to increase their lead over the chasing pack.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to see how we were going to react from a loss and we saw it today," said Corica.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys have got great attitudes, they worked hard for each other.</p>
        
            <p>"We just took our foot off the pedal a little bit, got a little bit carried away with where we were in the league and we can't do that.</p>
        
            <p>"We've gone four points clear, that's clear progress for me and the boys' attitude was fantastic.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to be up top and everyone's enjoying it, but there's still a lot of hard work to go before the end of the season."</p>
