            <p>Superb performances from Damian McKenzie and Etene Nanai-Seturo led the Chiefs to a big win over the Brumbies in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs ran in six tries in a 46-12 rout, backing up their impressive first up win over the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was a late blight for the Chiefs in the form of a red card to Jared Proffit for an ugly headbutt tackle on Cadyn Neville.</p>
        
            <p>After McKenzie opened the scoring with a penalty, the Chiefs crossed for the first try as Nanai-Seturo broke through the line and linked with his halfback Xavier Rowe.</p>
        
            <p>Corey Toole struck straight back for the Brumbies with a piece of individual brilliance, a deft chip and chase giving the speedster a third try of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Nanai-Seturo then crossed for one of his own, a superb long ball by Stevenson finding the wing unmarked on the corner.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs should have extended their lead but butchered what would have been a stunner.</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Stevenson sliced through the defence and Roe was again looming in support, but threw the final pass too late, with Noah Lolesio knocking the ball free.</p>
        
            <p>It wouldn't cost the Chiefs much, as McKenzie went under the posts, taking a long lineout throw and turning it inside to Nanai-Seturo, staying in support for a well deserved five pointer.</p>
        
            <p>A blistering first forty saw the Chiefs take a 25-7 halftime lead, but Toole's second try early after the break brought the Brumbies right back.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Chiefs responded straight away, Josh Ioane finishing off some brilliant interplay.</p>

            <p>Replacement Cortez Ratima then bagged back to back tries running great halfback support lines, each set up by his locks, the first Naitoa Ah Kuoi and the second Manaaki Selby-Rickit.</p>
        
            <p>Proffit's indiscretion took some gloss off the victory, but Nanai-Seturo told Stan Sports it was a satisfying result nonetheless.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a good start, in the second half we started a bit slow, coach gave us a bit of a tune up to put the foot on the throat, but the boys who came off the bench did the job for us."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Hurricanes have survived a Jordie Barrett red card to celebrate his 100th cap with an extra time win over the Reds.</p>
        
            <p>A thrilling conclusion to the Super Round in Melbourne, a golden point was required to separate the two teams.</p>
        
            <p>The hero for the Hurricanes was Pasilio Tosi who won the crucial penalty to set the Hurricanes on attack and then scored the match winner as the Canes took the win 38-33.</p>
        
            <p>He told Stan Sport that lungs were busting for the Hurricanes in the Melbourne heat.</p>
        
            <p>"It was tough, the boys had to dig deep, so stoked for the boys staying composed."</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes took less than five minutes to get on the board, Ruben Love sneaking in from the base of the ruck.</p>
        
            <p>Harry Wilson replied for the Reds off the back fo a strong lineout maul to take the lead.</p>
        
            <p>It wouldn't last long, the Canes scoring a somewhat sloppy second. Kini Naholo scooped up a poor final pass from Love, but Naholo had an acre of space to wait for the bounce.</p>
        
            <p>The ledger was evened as the Reds cashed in from another lineout drive, this time prop Zane Nonggorr crashing over.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenlanders then took the lead, as halfback Tate McDermott managed to grass the ball with little room in the left corner.</p>
        
            <p>However, his opposite number struck back right on the stroke of halftime, the All Black opting for a quick tap and proving too hard to stop at close range to send the side to the shed all square at 19-all.</p>
        
            <p>Some strong defence right after the resumption led to Asafo Aumua burrowing over, before replays showed the All Black hooker was held up.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds made the Cane pay, Josh Flook streaking away for his side's bonus point try.</p>
        
            <p>A Braden Iose powerful bust off the back of the scrum, put Love over to once again even the honours at 26-all.</p>
        
            <p>Disaster then stuck for the Canes, with Barrett initially yellow carded for his hit, later upgraded to red reducing the Hurricane to 14 for the next twenty minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds took immediate advantage, scoring through prop Matt Faessler, but as was the theme of the game, the Hurricane struck straight back as Roigard scored his second to make it 33 apiece.</p>
        
            <p>An incredibly intense final ten saw both sides with the chance to steal it, but neither could convert, leaving things to golden point for the first time this season.</p>
        
            <p>It took six minutes of added time, but Tosi eventually barged his way over the line as the Hurricanes stole a stunning win.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 46 (Ratima 2, Nanai-Seturo, Roe, McKenzie, Ioane, tries, Mackenzie 2 pens, 5 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies 12 (Toole 2, tries, Lolesio, 1 con)</p>
