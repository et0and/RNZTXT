            <p>Wellington Phoenix conceded a late goal to draw 1-1 with Western United at home in their opening match of the men's A-League season.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran forward Kosta Barbarouses put the Phoenix in front on the stroke of halftime but they they couldn't hold out the determined visitors, who drew level in the 76th minute through a bullet strike from Angus Thurgate.</p>
        
            <p>A Phoenix side missing a handful of their key players had the slight edge in an even contest but their Melbourne-based opponents were never out of the contest and merited returning across the Tasman with a point.</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses, who scored a club-high 13 goals last season, came closest to scoring a second goal on a warm afternoon in Wellington but his side showed signs of early season rust for many of their attacking forays.</p>

            <p>The Phoenix reached the semi-finals last season on the back of a patient gameplan under coach Giancarlo Italiano and there were signs that would be the approach again.</p>
        
            <p>Clear chances were limited in the first half, although Barbarouses made no mistake as captain Alex Rufer cleverly looped a header towards goal and the sprightly 34-year-old got his foot to the ball in front of Western United goalkeeper Matthew Sutton.</p>
        
            <p>Thurgate's goal came when the midfielder pounced on space at the top off the box and drilled his low shot into the corner after Wellington's defence failed to effectively clear a cross.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix were without Marco Rojas (leg fracture), Paulo Retre (groin strain), Lukas Kelly-Heald (hamstring strain) and Gabriel Sloane-Rodrigues (knee strain) and it is unclear of their availability for the round two match away to Perth Glory on Saturday.</p>
