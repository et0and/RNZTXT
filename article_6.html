        <h2>'There's a lot more fight in them' â€“ Blues praise improved Australian showing</h2>
        <p>
Blues coach Vern Cotter and skipper Patrick Tuipulotu have been impressed with what they've seen so far from across the ditch.
</p>
        
            <p>Blues v Brumbies </p>
        
            <p>Blues coach Vern Cotter is under no illusions about the challenge his side faces from the Brumbies on Saturday night at Eden Park. Both sides come in with a six-win, one-loss record and Cotter praised the top-ranked Australian side's organisation and culture.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all well-balanced team, they're a smart team, they're a hard team to break down because they've got some good players and good playmakers," Cotter said at Blues training on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Cotter has named a strong side as the Blues come off their bye week, welcoming back Bryce Heem into the midfield to pair up with Rieko Ioane. Sam Darry makes his return to the rugby field after injuring his knee in preseason, named on the bench.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies certainly have weapons across the park, with the likes of Corey Toole and Tom Wright in fantastic form so far this season. Cotter said it was indicative of the general improvement in the Australian sides overall, with the Brumbies currently sitting in third position on the Super Rugby Pacific ladder and the Rebels in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot more fight in them, and a lot more belief in what they're doing. It's human nature and I think they're a little bit upset with the World Cup, and I think Rugby Australia wants to show another look of itself around the place."</p>

            <p>The Wallabies were sent packing after the Rugby World Cup pool stage last year, their worst result ever in the tournament that marked the end of a disastrous Eddie Jones coaching regime.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Patrick Tuipulotu shared Cotter's sentiments, pointing to some big upsets so far this season that have seen the Australian sides already match their number of wins over New Zealand counterparts in 2023. So far the Blues have won both their trans-Tasman clashes, although in polar opposite circumstances: scraping by the Waratahs 12-10 in round four, then easily defeating the Force 50-3 in round nine.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, you see other results: Chiefs going down to the Reds, the Waratahs and the Crusaders. So, you can't take them lightly," Tuipulotu said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they've improved a lot in the last couple of years. And, you see most of those players playing for the Aussie squad having a real big impact in that squad."</p>
        
            <p>Tuipulotu said the difference was the Australians' hunger to be better.</p>
        
            <p>"You always want to improve. And for them, they probably haven't performed where they probably see themselves in this part of the driver for them to gain success and work hard. And they're trying everything they can. So, they're leaving no stone unturned. When you get that sort of attitude, you're going to improve."</p>
