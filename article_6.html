After heading to the United Kingdom on her OE without much of a plan, Meg Lay has ended up as a groundskeeper at Lord's - the first woman to work in the role in the ground's 200-year history.

            <p>Like many young people heading away on an overseas experience, Meg Lay did not know what she wanted to do for a career.</p>
        
            <p>Now, Lay is the first woman to be a groundskeeper at Lord's Cricket Ground in London since it opened in 1814.</p>
        
            <p>She told Susana Lei'ataua it had been "a bit of a whirlwind" since she moved to England three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Lay grew up on a farm in Canterbury and had played cricket her whole life.</p>
        
            <p>"For some reason I never connected the dots until I went over to England", she told Summer Weekends.</p>
        
            <p>It began in Bristol, where Lay had first moved, while she was living with professional cricket players.</p>
        
            <p>"They came home from training one day and said the ground staff were really short.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought if they're that desperate then maybe they might want me to give them a hand, and yeah, they didn't ask me to leave, so I was there for a couple of years before getting my job at Lord's."</p>
        
            <p>Lay said she was a "massive fan" of cricket and loved working on the farm where she grew up in Irwell.</p>
        
            <p>"To be able to combine those two things, I thought it would be the dream job.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know what I was going to do over in England, I just knew that I needed a change.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought I might have ended up working behind a bar or something, but for something so perfect and so well-suited to me to just pop up like that, it was an opportunity that I definitely couldn't miss out on."</p>
        
            <p>Lay said she had "never had a bad day at work".</p>
        
            <p>"I love the people I work with, I love the job, I love cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish I knew about it sooner. I'm 28 now, I wish I'd known when I was 18 leaving school that this was a career path."</p>

            <p>However, she admitted there was a "lot of pressure".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there's a more scrutinised 22 yards in world sport, to be honest, than the pitch at Lord's."</p>
        
            <p>Lay said all 10 people on the team work seven days a week over summer: "It's full on, big hours."</p>

            <p>As for what the future holds, Lay hoped to be able to come back home to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, ultimately, how can you go past Lord's? It's the home of cricket and I absolutely love it.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'd love to come home one day. Hagley Oval is certainly on my radar. That would definitely be the dream.</p>
        
            <p>"But I wouldn't say no to doing a quick six months in Barcelona or something on the way home."</p>
