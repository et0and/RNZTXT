            <p>The new Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche has joined coalition voices in criticising a health official as "unprofessional" for characterising some ministerial work as "crap" in an internal email.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the Director-General of Health Diana Sarfati emailed all ministry staff stressing the need for professionalism in all communication.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party responded with outrage on Wednesday, accusing them both of caving to coalition pressure and throwing public servants under the bus.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement issued to RNZ, Sir Brian said the Ministry of Health was right to apologise to the government for "the unprofessional nature of the [staffer's] comments".</p>
        
            <p>"We must always, regardless of the circumstances, be professional and politically neutral and think carefully about how our behaviour might be perceived.</p>
        
            <p>"What happened is a lesson for all of us in the public service to reflect on and learn from."</p>
        
            <p>In a ministry-wide email on Tuesday afternoon, Sarfati invited staff to reflect on "what it means to be a good public servant". She said they had a "duty to uphold high standards of integrity and conduct" to maintain New Zealanders' trust and confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to take this time to remind all kaimahi about the importance of professionalism in all our communication. This includes emails, text and the way we speak to our colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>"We are privileged in our roles to, at times, be given access to sensitive or confidential information and it's vital that each of us behave in a way that retains the trust of Ministers, Parliament and people of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Trust is hard earned and easily lost."</p>
        
            <p>The email follows strong criticism of the ministry's recent conduct from the coalition: Associate Health Minister Casey Costello accused officials of undermining her work, and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said they had not served Costello well.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party public services spokesperson Francisco Hernandez told RNZ that the message being sent by both Sir Brian and Sarfati was deeply worrying.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the top bosses are caving," he said. "Instead of standing up for their employees, they're standing up for their ministers."</p>
        
            <p>Hernandez said public servants should be able to speak frankly in internal emails - and there was no need for the director-general to apologise.</p>
        
            <p>"If anything, they should be apologising to the staffer for the way that they've handled things, in the way that they've left her out to dry."</p>

            <p>Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall, on Tuesday, also said an apology was unnecessary.</p>
        
            <p>"When did it become wrong, in internal emails, to call something that is crap, crap? That's what free and frank advice is," Verrall said.</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Association national secretary Kerry Davies told RNZ the staffer was simply doing her job in calling out substandard work.</p>

            <p>Davies said Costello's response was outrageous and unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"It ends up having a chilling effect on all officials. It sends a message that if you provide free and frank advice, then you're likely to be called out by your minister and, dare I say, the prime minister, publicly."</p>
        
            <p>Davies said the PSA would write to the Public Service Commissioner to lay out its concerns. On Wednesday morning, the Commission told RNZ it had yet to receive a letter.</p>
        
            <p>In a further statement to RNZ on Wednesday, Davies said the PSA looked forward to its discussions with the commissioner: "There are important issues at stake here".</p>
        
            <p>Ministry correspondence, first revealed by 1News, showed a top health advisor criticised the quality of information provided by Costello to justify cutting tax on heated tobacco products.</p>
        
            <p>The official wrote: "It's not so much that all of the studies are crap... [but that they are] selective... not up to date... and don't represent current evidence".</p>
