            <p>The White Ferns' T20 World Cup success has given young spin bowler Eden Carson a healthy dose of confidence just at the right time.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders are now hoping to top off the World Cup title with an ODI series win against India in the decider, starting in Ahmedabad at 9pm Tuesday (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old Carson proved to be one of the stars in the team's shock T20 World Cup win in the United Arab Emirates and success was timely for her, after fighting to have a full-time berth in the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It gave me a bit of a confidence boost, also (after) being in and out of the squad over the last year as well depending on conditions,'' Carson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming over to India where conditions usually suit spinners has really helped as well. I've been able able to back up performances, both in the field and bowling.''</p>
        
            <p>Carson was named as 12th player for the T20 World Cup tournament team after regularly making an impact with her off-spinners.</p>
        
            <p>She took nine wickets for 147 runs at an average of 16.33 and economy rate of 6.39. She and left armer Fran Jonas served as great back-ups to legspinner Melie Kerr, who finished took 15 wickets, the tournament's best.</p>
        
            <p>Carson has followed that up with two wickets in both ODI internationals in India. Her team lost the first match by 59 runs but struck back in the second with a 76-run victory.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders had a quick turnaround after the T20 tournament and looked tired in the first match in India, but showed plenty of ticker to rebound in the second.</p>
        
            <p>"Mentally we were all tired, but I think being able to push and support each other has been really good,'' Carson said.</p>
        
            <p>The swap to ODI mode was also a tricky adjustment for the Maniototo player.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a shock to the system. In the first game I kinda still had my T20 cap on." But the players had truly switched on for the second match.</p>

            <p>Now they are keen to finish their six weeks away from home with another trophy.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely hungry. It would really top off the last six weeks we have had, coming off the World Cup win and then being able to finish off a series win against India in India would be really good."</p>
        
            <p>Once the series is over, the White Ferns will look forward to celebrating their success at home.</p>
        
            <p>"Going into the [World Cup] tournament I don't think a lot of people really saw us winning or even getting out of the group phase, so to be able to do that for New Zealand, our family and friends has really meant a lot and something I am really proud of.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns' next assignment after India will be taking on Australia in a three-match ODI series, starting in Wellington on 19 December.</p>
