            <p>Shooting athletes Chloe Tipple and Owen Robinson have been named in the New Zealand team for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>For skeet shooter Tipple, Paris will be her third Olympic Games following Rio and Tokyo, while trap shooter Robinson will make his Games debut.</p>
        
            <p>"It never gets old, my goodness I'm fighting back the tears. It's such a joyous moment," Tipple said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got an amazing village behind me so I'm forever grateful to my family and to my Dad ...it's a huge honour to represent the sport that I love, my family and New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Tipple and her father David, who has coached her for several years, have travelled the world together competing as various events.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old said she had matured as an athlete after attending two Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in your first Olympics there's a lot of noise about what you should be doing. Over three Olympic cycles what you learn is what serves you rather than what you should be doing. I think we've really refined that and I'm so excited to expand that maturity and really explore that in this games."</p>
        
            <p>Does Tipple believe she could bring home a medal?</p>
        
            <p>"It's who can pull it out on the day so 100 percent both Owen and I are very competitive and I think that it's whoever can perform on the day."</p>
        
            <p>Shooting has flown under the radar since Natalie Rooney won a silver medal at the Olympic Games in Rio and Tipple said she loved any opportunity to put shooting in a positive light on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Shooting as a whole can get a pretty bad rap considering it's related to guns. So I think the greatest privilege for me personally with representing the sport is bringing a positive shining light to it. We both have so much passion and love for [shooting] so I just love any opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said it had been a long journey to finally be selected for an Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"I've qualified for the last two or three Olympics but just haven't quite gained that quota spot ...gaining that spot is very difficult," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been such a long journey to make this happen ...I've been trying to make the Olympic team for 12-years and I've been so close to making it previously but just missed out. For it to finally be happening is pretty special."</p>
        
            <p>Waikato based Robinson credits his family for helping him to make his first Olympic team. "My old man and my wife have been extremely supportive so I can't thank them enough.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got three daughters under five so it's been a busy time. My first day of Olympic competition is on the day my twin girls turn two so hopefully that's good luck!"</p>
        
            <p>2024 has also been a big year for Tipple. She's juggled Olympic qualification with a wedding to her partner.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been crazy, I'm also meant to be moving house which I've actually delayed. It's been a lot but I'm so happy to be here. This season has been all about balance!" said Tipple.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that I get to represent New Zealand on the world stage is so surreal. If you could tell 15-year-old Chloe that she'd be going to her third Olympics she wouldn't believe you."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson and Tipple head to Italy next week for competition and training ahead of the Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>The Paris 2024 shooting competition will be held at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre (250km south of Paris). The selections are conditional on confirmation of an Olympic quota place.</p>
