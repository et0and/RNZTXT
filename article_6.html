            <p>New Zealand golfer Daniel Hillier has birdied four holes in an outstanding third round at the British Open at Royal Troon.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old Kiwi jumped 39 places on the leaderboard to a tie for 15th after carding a three-under 69 third round.</p>
        
            <p>Hilliler's comeback sees him at two over par, six shots off leader American Billy Horschel ahead of tomorrow's final round.</p>
        
            <p>And Hillier, in his third visit to The Open, was one of only two players to make a second-round eagle yesterday on the par-five 16th hole.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Fox's third round of five-over in wet and windy conditions saw him slip further off the pace at nine over par in 70th.</p>

            <p>Billy Horschel's record at the British Open is not a flattering one for a player of his stature, but he moved into prime position to change that with a stellar display in third round.</p>
        
            <p>Five shots off the pace overnight, the American world number 62 fired a gutsy two-under 69 in rainswept conditions at Royal Troon to end up with a one-stroke lead at four under par.</p>
        
            <p>It was an impressive performance by a player who has missed six cuts in nine British Opens - including the 2016 tournament at Royal Troon where he opened with a 67 before slumping to an 85 in howling rain and wind.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a pretty good round," said the 37-year-old Horschel, an eight-times winner on the PGA Tour. "This one's by far my best round in really tough conditions in an Open Championship.</p>
        
            <p>"I've worked my entire life to be in this position. I've been in the lead many times going into a final round. Obviously, this is a major. I know what it means to my legacy in the game of golf and what I want to do and accomplish."</p>
        
            <p>As heavy rain swept in from the Irish Sea, Horschel reeled off four birdies to reach the turn in four-under 32 - in a tie at the top with Ireland's Shane Lowry.</p>
        
            <p>He bogeyed the par-four 11th but, as the winds strengthened, parred the next six holes before dropping another shot at the last.</p>
        
            <p>"When we got to 13, the wind really picked up," said Horschel, who wore his cap turned around to prevent water from running off the brim into his eyes.</p>
        
            <p>"We played five par-fives on the back side, and that's not even including No. 16. It was a tough one out there today. I just knew going into the back side that it was going to be a grind no matter what."</p>
        
            <p>Horschel held the clubhouse lead at that point but England's Dan Brown was one ahead of the field as he teed off on 18 before running up a double-bogey to hand the American a one-stroke advantage.</p>
        
            <p>"I've learned a lot about the game of golf playing 15 years professionally," Horschel said of his quest to win a first major title.</p>
        
            <p>"I've learned how to handle my emotions. I've learned how to embrace a lot of things... I'm never afraid to fail.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's my time tomorrow, I'm going to be ecstatic. If it's not, then we'll get on the horse again, and we'll work hard to get back in that position again."</p>
        
            <p>Horschel's best British Open finish was a tie for 21st at St Andrews in 2022. He looks set to improve that record on Monday.</p>
