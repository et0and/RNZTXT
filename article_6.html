            <p>Auckland FC have remained unbeaten in the A-League after a thrilling 2-0 win over the Wellington Phoenix, with Jake Brimmer scoring both goals late in the all-Kiwi derby.</p>
        
            <p>The score was locked at 0-0 in the 88th minute in the first ever match between the two teams when in a momentous blunder, Phoenix goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi kicked a soft ball straight to Brimmer just a metre or so away.</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer made no mistake and the deadlock was broken in what was an intense, exciting match before a record regular season crowd at Sky Stadium in Wellington of 26,252.</p>
        
            <p>Luis Toomey set up Brimmer with his second goal in the 96th minute to give Auckland FC a remarkable three wins from three matches in their inaugural season, maintaining their position at the top of the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington crowd had been boisterous throughout, booing their former goalkeeper Alex Paulsen as he took the field for the Aucklanders. They booed him again, especially when he gratefully accepted a half-volley from Kosta Barbarouses in the 17th minute.</p>

            <p>It was an even first half, with Auckland starting strongly, before Phoenix stepped up their act in the middle of the spell, and then the visitors finishing the stronger, with Oluwayemi making a great save from scorching strike by Liam Gillion, one of Auckland's best players.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams had scoring chances in the second half, and the game became more expansive late in the piece, before it was Wellington who faltered.</p>
        
            <p>It was not the result that Phoenix skipper Alex Rufer wanted. He had been involved in drama before the match. Ruled out on Thursday with a knee injury, he passed a fitness test on Saturday morning, clearing him for his 150th game for the Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was determined to play.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't want to let the team down. You can fight through the pain and play through pain in these games." he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Rufer said he was "extremely disappointed" with the late fade from his team.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't take our chances and we were very naive towards the end, we made some very poor mistakes and it cost us the game."</p>
        
            <p>There was delight though from Auckland FC captain Hiroki Sakai, who said he was ''very happy'' with the win as a noisy contingent of Auckland supporters celebrated.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to both supporters, it was an amazing atmosphere for the first ever derby. I really enjoyed the game, it was an exciting match'' Sakai told Sky.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Steve Corica had taken the pressure off his players, telling them it was a derby match and not a final.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not so nervous, we are like normal. We just enjoy the match."</p>
