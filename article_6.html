            <p>New Zealand's Ryan Fox conceded golf from a great height is "not me" after the World Tour's latest dizzying promotion in the UAE.</p>
        
            <p>Fox and Tour rivals Padraig Harrington and Thorbjørn Olesen took part in the what was labelled the "Extreme Hole-in-one Challenge", taking aim at an island green from a 110-metre drop in elevation.</p>
        
            <p>After scaling the 22nd floor of a hotel on Al Marjan Island near Dubai, the trio teed off in turns at their target 260m away, floating in the Persian Gulf.</p>
        
            <p>"You wouldn't want to be scared of heights up here, would you?" Fox said, before his first shot, which found the green.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand No.1's form slipped from that point - with decorated Irishman Harrington and Dane Olesen advancing to a play-off.</p>
        
            <p>"Should I feel hard done by that I'm coming last in this? I just can't hit it, it's not me ay," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>Harrington won the event - labelled the world's highest of its kind, from which one million dirham ($480,000) was donated to charity.</p>
        
            <p>Fox is no stranger to golf promotions.</p>
        
            <p>He has hosted the annual "Chasing the Fox" event for several years, attracting celebrities and prime time television coverage.</p>
