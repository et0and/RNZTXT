            <p>New Zealand-raised British tennis star Cameron Norrie is hoping a return to the ASB Classic will help reignite his career.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old, who grew up in Auckland before moving to the UK, has confirmed his entry for January's ATP men's tournament as he works his way back following the first significant injury lay-off of his career.</p>
        
            <p>Norrie, who has been ranked as high as No.8 in the world but is currently ranked 56th, comes into his ninth ASB Classic after being sidelined with a forearm injury for nearly three months from the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"It was obviously frustrating at the beginning to miss all those big tournaments, that was tough," Norrie said.</p>

            <p>However, he believes there were some initial benefits to the enforced break.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a good time to rest. After six, seven years on the Tour, I didn't really miss one week through injury. To enjoy time with my girlfriend and be a normal person for a little bit was something I haven't done for a very long time, maybe since college."</p>
        
            <p>Though he always wanted to return to playing at the highest level.</p>
        
            <p>"I missed tennis a lot, I missed competing, the emotions of winning or losing. I feel ready to compete, ready to battle on the court."</p>
        
            <p>Norrie has finished runner-up twice at the ASB Classic, in 2019 and 2023, after first competing in qualifying in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Tournament director Nicolas Lamperin is delighted that Norrie has returned to the game fully fit and is again supporting the ASB Classic.</p>
        
            <p>"Cam is a class player and a class person who has been a massive supporter of the ASB Classic for many years," Lamperin said.</p>
        
            <p>"He is hugely popular here in Auckland, especially from members of his old club at Bucklands Beach where he learned the game. I am sure the club members will be out in full to support him.</p>
        
            <p>"He will have plenty of fans eager to see him start his 2025 season on an encouraging level as he looks to push back to the top levels of the game."</p>
