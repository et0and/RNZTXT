            <p>Pakistan have kept their T20 series against the Black Caps alive with an extraordinary nine-wicket win in the third match in Auckland on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>While New Zealand won the first two matches in Christchurch and Dunedin easily, the Pakistan side turned up with much more intent and grit at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>They restricted the Black Caps to 204 off 19.5 overs, with Mark Chapman easily the best of the Kiwi batters with 94 off 44 overs and skipper Michael Bracewell scoring 31.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-two year old Hasan Nawaz scored his maiden T20 international century at just his third outing with a brilliant batting display as Pakistan cruised to victory with four overs to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Mohammad Haris (41) and skipper Salman Ali Agha (51 not out) gave Hasan (105 not out) excellent support as the Black Caps bowlers just could stem the flow of runs.</p>
        
            <p>Two matches remain in the series, with the next match at Tauranga's Bay Oval on Sunday.</p>
