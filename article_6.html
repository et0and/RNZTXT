            <p>The Australian cricketers have completed the first part of the equation the White Ferns need to qualify for the semi-finals of the women's T20 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Australia beat India by nine runs in Sharjah to finish unbeaten at the top of group A.</p>
        
            <p>After deciding to bat first the defending champions scored 151 for eight with opener Grace Harris top scoring with 40.</p>
        
            <p>India were on track for an upset win going into the last over needing 14 runs with five wickets in hand.</p>
        
            <p>However they lost four wickets in the last over to finish on 142 for nine.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Harmanpreet Kaur top scored with 54, while Annabel Sutherland and Sophie Molineux took two wickets each for Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Australia finished group play with four wins and eight points, while India remain ahead of New Zealand in second place on net run-rate with both teams on four points.</p>
        
            <p>However a win for New Zealand over Pakistan on Tuesday morning will secure them a place in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Afterwards India captain Harmanpreet was asked about still having a chance of qualifying.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever was in our hands, we were trying to do that. But that is something which is not in our control. If we get the opportunity to play another game, that will be great. But otherwise, whoever deserves to be there, that team will be there," Harmanpreet told the ICC.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's stand-in captain Tahlia McGrath was asked about finishing group play unbeaten.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to win every game we play. We knew it was going to be a really big challenge for us today. They came really hard at us. I am just really proud of the group. We held our nerve at the end there.</p>
        
            <p>In group B England beat Scotland by ten wickets to remain unbeaten at the top of the table.</p>
