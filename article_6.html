            <p>Melbourne Cup-winning horse trainer Darren Weir's penalty for using an electrical device on horses will not be backdated, meaning he will be disqualified from racing until 2026.</p>
        
            <p>In July the Victorian Racing Tribunal issued a two-year ban on the renowned trainer after a five-month hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Weir admitted to using a banned electrical device known as a jigger on three horses at his Warrnambool stables in 2018, a week before the Melbourne Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Since the tribunal determined that Weir should be banned, there was some debate as to whether the penalty should be backdated to 2019.</p>
        
            <p>During the hearing there was a debate on the issue between the Victorian Racing Tribunal, counsel for Racing Victoria stewards and legal representation on behalf of Weir.</p>
        
            <p>The tribunal decided Weir would serve his two-year ban from 9 September.</p>
        
            <p>Tribunal member Ian Hill noted the lengthy time deliberations took.</p>
        
            <p>Weir's use of jiggers on the three horses has been described as "abhorrent".</p>
        
            <p>He previously received a four-year ban from racing after being found in possession of the banned electrical device.</p>
        
            <p>That ban expired in February last year.</p>
        
            <p>Weir trained Melbourne Cup winner Prince of Penzance in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>He was cleared of allegations that the use of the jigger corrupted the outcome of the 2018 Melbourne Cup, won by Cross Counter.</p>
        
            <p>Under the ban, Weir can no longer train horses in an official capacity.</p>
