        <p>

            <p>The injury curse that's plagued this year's ASB Classic has once again struck, this time meaning the men's doubles final has been called off.</p>
        
            <p>The silver lining is that it's a win for Kiwi Michael Venus and Croatian partner Nikola Mektic, however not the way they probably wanted.</p>
        
            <p>One of their opponents, American veteran Rajeev Ram, pulled out through injury. It's understood he broke the news to the tournament organisers earlier this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Ram, who was paired with Christian Harrison, suffered the injury in the semi-final win on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The walkover is Venus' second title in Auckland. He is also the last New Zealander to claim a trophy at the ASB Classic after winning in 2016 with Mate Pavic.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd will still get a full final's day of tennis though, with a hastily arranged doubles exhibition to be played with Kiwi Isaac Becroft stepping in to partner Harrison against Venus and Mektic.</p>
        
            <p>Becroft was knocked out in the first round of singles by today's finalist Zizou Bergs of Belgium.</p>
        
            <p>French veteran Gaël Monfils will take on Bergs in the final, which should begin around 2pm.</p>
