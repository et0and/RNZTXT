            <p>FIFA World Cup 2026 - OFC Qualifier</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7.30pm Monday, 18 November (NZT)</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Stadium, Auckland</p>

            <p>As expected, New Zealand are through to the next stage of FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers, and almost certainly as group winners. They followed October's 3-0 win over Tahiti with an 8-1 pumping of Vanuatu in their second fixture to secure safe passage.</p>
        
            <p>However, there is still the small matter of taking on Samoa before the All Whites can start preparing for the semi-finals and final in Wellington and Auckland in March.</p>
        
            <p>So what can we expect from New Zealand's final group stage fixture?</p>
        
            <p>You can likely expect a few changes from head coach Darren Bazeley, with qualification for the next round of qualifying confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The likes of Liam Gillion, Francis de Vries and Nando Pijnaker will hope to be rewarded for their good form at Auckland FC. Meanwhile, Joe Bell and Sarpreet Singh will no doubt be looking for a start, after a difficult period both internationally and domestically for the gifted midfield pair.</p>
        
            <p>In saying that, Bazeley will also want to send a message about New Zealand's standing at the top of the Oceania mountain - so it won't be a surprise to hear Chris Wood starts at Mount Smart, with hopes of adding more goals to his current record haul.</p>

            <p>New Zealand were expected to beat Vanuatu on Friday night, but the manner of that triumph will have sent chills down Samoan spines. The 8-1 win at Waikato Stadium was New Zealand's biggest in two decades, a firm reminder of the All Whites' standing in the region. It's likely they will want to keep up their recent momentum, so do not expect them to take it easy on their world ranked 186th opponents.</p>

            <p>Samoa were effectively eliminated from World Cup qualifying with a 3-0 defeat to Tahiti last week. That followed a 4-1 loss to Vanuatu in October but in the grand scheme of things, just reaching this phase is a huge achievement for the Pacific Island nation.</p>
        
            <p>Remarkably, considering they are in the same FIFA confederation, this will be the first time the two teams have met since Western Samoa became Samoa in 1997.</p>
        
            <p>But there will be plenty of familiar faces for the All Whites, with 10 of this Samoa squad currently playing their football in Aotearoa. In fact, there will even be the odd childhood or school reunion out on the Mount Smart turf.</p>
        
            <p>In terms of a dangerman, Pharrell Trainor will be the player Samoa look for to score a shock goal. The 18-year-old is one of the few players currently looking to make a name for himself in Europe and the German-based Australian-born striker will be relishing the chance to test himself against Oceania's best.</p>
        
            <p>7 November 1987 Western Samoa 0-7 New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>13 November 1987 New Zealand 12-0 Western Samoa</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's record victory is currently a 13-0 riot over Fiji back in 1981. Samoa will undoubtedly fear that this record could be in jeopardy, following the emphatic manner of New Zealand's crushing win over Vanuatu on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>However, with qualification for the next round confirmed and Bazeley likely to do some tinkering, New Zealand are less likely to hammer their rivals so unceremoniously this time around.</p>
        
            <p>That's not to say it will not be a thrashing, but for all involved, hopefully it retains a decent amount of respectability.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 5-0 Samoa</p>
