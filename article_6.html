            <p>Katelyn Vaha'akolo scored a hat-trick of tries as the Black Ferns broke their run of losses at the WXV 1 tournament with a 39-14 over France in Vancouver.</p>
        
            <p>It was the final test match of the year for the New Zealanders, who responded brilliantly after staring in the face of a drop to fourth in the world rankings had they lost to France.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns had already lost to Ireland and England at this tournament and needed a big boost in their last test match of the year, ahead of next year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>They started strongly, chalking up two tries before the French hit back, impressing with their physical approach and getting to within a point of the Kiwi side on the verge of halftime.</p>
        
            <p>But an audacious decision to turn down a penalty shot in front of the posts saw Vaha'akolo score the second of her two tries to enable New Zealand to take a 20-14 lead at the break.</p>
        
            <p>There were areas of fragility in the Black Ferns game up until this stage, with them lacking cohesion and their kicking game askew.</p>
        
            <p>But they were a different side in the second half, charging into the forward exchanges with venom and looking slick and inventive in the backs.</p>
        
            <p>France, the world number four ranked team, could not find an answer to the Ferns' extra zest and failed to add to their score in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Vaha'akolo was brilliant on the left wing, getting involved in general play with surging runs and being a clinical finisher on the end of some dazzling team moves.</p>
        
            <p>In the forwards, hooker Georgia Ponsonby and No 8 Kaipo Olsen-Baker took on the French defence with bruising runs all games, while backline general Ruahei Demant sparked the backs' resurgence in this match.</p>
        
            <p>Demant was pleased with the form turnaround, saying their running and kicking was well balanced.</p>
        
            <p>"We played to the obvious spaces, and were really decisive in our kicking game,'' she told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"On top of that I thought we showed a lot of heart in our tackles and our defence, especially our outsides this week.</p>
        
            <p>"You never know what France team is going to turn up on the day and it was a lot harder than what the scoreboard shows, but I'm really proud of our team today.</p>
        
            <p>Score: Black Ferns 39 (Katelyn Vaha'akolo 3, Ayesha Leti-I'iga, Alana Bremner, Kaipo Olsen-Baker, Tanya Kalounivale tries, Hannah King 2 con) France 14 (Emeline Gros, Manae Feleutries, Lina Queyroi 2 con). Halftime: 20-14.</p>
