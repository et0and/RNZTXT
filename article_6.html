            <p>The Football Ferns have been beaten 4-1 by FIFA Women's World Cup quarter-finalists Japan in the second of their two-match series in Murcia, Spain.</p>
        
            <p>During the second-half, the Asian No. 1 scored three goals in a 15-minute spell to turn the tide of the match after the Ferns led at the break through Milly Clegg's debut senior goal.</p>
        
            <p>Acting head coach Michael Mayne made five changes to the side which suffered a 2-0 defeat in the first game of the series.</p>
        
            <p>In defence, Ali Riley was ruled out through injury and Rebekah Stott rested seeing Grace Neville and Meikayla Moore come in to replace them.</p>
        
            <p>Kate Taylor replaced Katie Kitching in the centre of midfield to form a double pivot with Malia Steinmetz.</p>
        
            <p>Ally Green replaced Mickey Foster on the left wing and up front Milly Clegg replaced the injured Indiah-Paige Riley.</p>
        
            <p>Japan fielded a full-strength side with all but one of the starting line-up being part of their FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 squad and seven of the 11 playing at top European sides.</p>

            <p>The Ferns opened strongly, having the better of the opening exchanges against the world number 7 and looking much more dominant around the Japanese goal than in the first match.</p>
        
            <p>On the 22nd minute, the Ferns made their strong start count with 18-year-old Milly Clegg opening the scoring with a brilliant solo goal.</p>
        
            <p>Found on the right of the box by Ally Green, Clegg turned, beating two Japanese defenders in a strong run into the box before smashing it high into the roof of the net past Ayaka Yamashita in the Japanese goal.</p>
        
            <p>Just after the 30-minute mark, Clegg nearly turned provider, turning her marker on the wing before firing in a pinpoint cross which was centimeters away from Grace Jale making it two.</p>
        
            <p>Despite Japan upping the pressure, the Ferns held firm to take a 1-0 lead into the break.</p>

            <p>Japan had the better of the second-half, with the talent and experience in the side coming to the fore.</p>
        
            <p>They turned the tide of the game in a 15-minute spell, scoring three goals without reply.</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea's Maika Hamano, substituted on at half-time, got the first two, with a stunning long-range volley and a well-taken finish from a quick free kick.</p>
        
            <p>Aoba Fujino scored the third after seizing on a short past and catching the Ferns defence off guard.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns pushed to fight back with substitutes Claudia Bunge, Daisy Cleverley, Gabi Rennie, Mackenzie Barry, Mickey Foster and Katie Kitching coming on to add fresh legs.</p>
        
            <p>But 10 minutes from full time, Japan made it four after a neat finish from Remina Chiba following a clever headed through ball.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns are set to face other highly ranked teams in just under two months at the Paris Olympics.</p>
