            <p>Hockey New Zealand say there have been some positive developments in the establishment of three franchises as part of a new Premier Hockey League.</p>
        
            <p>There hasn't been a national league since 2019.</p>
        
            <p>In October Hockey New Zealand called for Expressions of Interest to invest in teams from North of the Bombays, south of Taupo to Wellington and the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Investment has already been secured for the fourth team.</p>
        
            <p>The deadline for interest was December the 1st.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson says the process is progressing well but wouldn't give any further details.</p>
        
            <p>The national body says they're targetting an April 2024 public announcement of the league and teams.</p>
        
            <p>The league is intended to consist of four entities with each having both a men's and women's team.</p>
        
            <p>It is hoped that the League will be launched in November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Hockey New Zealand says the PHL will include New Zealand's best players (and some from abroad), providing an opportunity to develop talent while serving as an aspirational player pathway for athletes.</p>
        
            <p>Hockey Players Association Executive Manager Glen Sulzberger recognises the key part that the PHL will provide by improving the foundation of high performance outcomes for NZ's top hockey players.</p>
