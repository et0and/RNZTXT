            <p>A gritty effort from boxer Mea Motu was not enough for her to become New Zealand's first ever unified world champion.</p>
        
            <p>She lost her bantamweight title fight in Nottingham on Sunday morning (NZ time) to Britain's Ellie Scotney, by unanimous points decision, with the judges awarding just one of the 10 rounds to Motu.</p>
        
            <p>There was excitement in the Kiwi camp early in the first round as the two undefeated fighters got going, with a cut surfacing above Scotney's eye, but the cause of the injury was from a head clash rather than a Motu punch.</p>
        
            <p>From there Scotney got into her work nicely, displaying a super solid skillset.</p>
        
            <p>She got stronger as the 10-round contest progressed, with Motu struggling to find a way to unsettle her opponent.</p>
        
            <p>Scotney's best round was arguably the ninth, even though the tough Motu didn't wobble from being struck by a couple of strong uppercuts.</p>
        
            <p>In the end, all three judges scored the fight 99-91.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a tough girl," Scotney said to broadcaster DAZN after being confirmed as the winner.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got so much respect for her, and she was 20 and 0, I've never fought anyone easier," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The loss is the first of Motu's career, with her record now 20 wins and 1 loss, but DAZN analyst and former WBC cruiserweight title holder Tony Bellew was impressed with what the New Zealand brought to the fight.</p>
        
            <p>"Motu's a problem for anyone in and around that division, she does not stop, she's relentless, so she will come again,</p>
        
            <p>"But for now, Ellie Scotney, for me, is the queen of the division."</p>
