            <p>The troubled Las Vegas Formula One Grand Prix has been hit with a class action lawsuit on behalf of the 35,000 people who bought tickets for Thursday's practice session which was cancelled when Carlos Sainz's Ferrari was damaged by a loose drain cover.</p>
        
            <p>The highly-anticipated first action on the neon-lit circuit, which includes a section along the famed Las Vegas Strip, lasted a little over eight minutes before coming to a halt.</p>
        
            <p>What followed was a five-and-a-half hour break while crews removed all 30 covers along the 3.8-mile layout and filled the holes with sand and asphalt.</p>
        
            <p>A second 90-minute practice session began in front of empty grandstands at 2:30 a.m. on Friday morning, long after fans had been cleared out in a move officials said was a necessary safety precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Las Vegas Grand Prix officials attempted damage control, offering $200 merchandise vouchers to single-day ticket holders.</p>
        
            <p>The compensation did not extend to those who had purchased three-day passes.</p>
        
            <p>Dimopoulos Law Firm and co-counsel JK Legal & Consulting said they had filed a class-action lawsuit against the Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix (LVGP) in Nevada state court on Friday on behalf of the people who purchased tickets for the practice run.</p>
        
            <p>The lawsuit named Formula One owners and race promoters Liberty Media Corporation, DBA Formula One Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix and TAB Contractors Inc as defendants.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a number of issues with that (compensation)," Steve Dimopoulos told Reuters in a phone interview on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"Clearly that ($200 merchandise voucher) is not a refund that is sufficient.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of fans probably don't even want that, they want their money back.</p>
        
            <p>"There are also peripheral issues of what about the people that came in from out of town and paid for substantial air fare and hotels."</p>
        
            <p>The decision to send fans home was made out of concern for public safety and security officials who had been on duty for a long time, LVGP CEO Renee Wilm and F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali, said in a joint statement.</p>
        
            <p>Qualifying took place on Friday and was completed without incident.</p>
        
            <p>Formula One did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
