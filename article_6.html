            <p>The Black Caps have slumped to a shock 84-run loss to Afghanistan in their opening game of the T20 World Cup in Guyana.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 160 to win, the New Zealand side lost Finn Allen to the first ball of their innings and lost wickets regularly after that.</p>
        
            <p>They were all out for 75, with Glenn Phillips topscoring with 18.</p>
