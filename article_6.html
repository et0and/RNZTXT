        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific: Rob Penney and Vern Cotter, how the tables have turned</h2>
        <p>
Watch: This time a year ago the two rival coaches' situations were diametrically opposed to where they find themselves now.
</p>
        
            <p>You didn't need to be a body language expert to tell the difference between Rob Penney and Vern Cotter after the Crusaders' comprehensive 42-19 win over the Blues at Eden Park. Cotter, lauded last year as 'Stern Vern', the man who finally made sense of the Blues' consistently un-joinable puzzle parts, has had the effects of five losses noticeably redefine his demeanour.</p>
        
            <p>"We couldn't construct, we couldn't build," said Cotter about arguably the most disappointing of all the losses this season, one that felt like a bridge too far even before halftime with the score 20-7 to the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>"We were chasing and so we went at half time, we just basically said just do simple thingsâ€¦ but it was a game where we didn't have control of it, and we needed to get control of it. So that's just really simple stuff."</p>
        
            <p>Despite an early try to Dalton Papali'i, things went south very fast for the Blues. Ball was given up far too easily, Crusaders counterattacks gained far too much ground and defence was just far too passive once the Blues were forced back into their 22.</p>

            <p>"I thought we seemed a little lethargic in and around reacting. We weren't reacting as quickly as we could have been. We scored early and probably too easily," admitted Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, it's not hard to immediately bring up last season when talking to Rob Penney. He's certainly in a better mood facing the media this time around, with his team not only winning but doing it in style. The Crusaders have now scored 140 points in their last three games, a far cry from this time last year when the main talk was about how quickly Penney could be sacked.</p>
        
            <p>"All you're ever after as a coach is for the boys to express themselves and feel as though they getting something out of the game and and loving their time in the jersey," said Penney.</p>
        
            <p>"What made it hard last year was we were searching for things to try to get it to turn, but it was just not happening."</p>
        
            <p>To his credit, Penney isn't acting smug about the colossal turnaround in fortunes, but it's certainly a far more comfortable environment to be talking to him in. Especially since even though the Crusaders have been struck by injuries, the toll is nowhere near as bad as last year and it's reflected in their results.</p>
        
            <p>"What's a real pleasure to have the depth," said Penney.</p>

            <p>We've got a group that's really, really talented. Like we moved Chay (Fihaki) to the side to give Macca (Springer) an opportunity and he took his opportunity. So Chay's come back in and he took his opportunity again. It's a joy to have the depth and the attitude of the boys is they're just supporting each other 100 percent. Whoever gets the opportunity, they're just so focused on doing the right thing."</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders captain David Havili echoed his coach's delight at how much firepower the Crusaders suddenly possess.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's just a lot of rugby knowledge in that backline, you've got James O'Connor who's been to multiple World Cups and played around the world," said Havili.</p>
        
            <p>"And then you put him with Will Jordan. Then you got guys like Sevu Reece with finishing power, and you just want to give him one on ones. Certainly the prep that goes in during the week is really, really thorough."</p>
        
            <p>The win moves the Crusaders up into second place on the table. The Chiefs are in first place but Penney's side can leapfrog them next weekend with a big win over Moana Pasifika. However, the Blues' bye week will be a pretty sorry occasion, they may well come out of it in last place if Moana just get a bonus point in Christchurch.</p>
