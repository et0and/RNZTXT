            <p>World Cup finalists New Zealand embark on a new journey under Scott Robertson in Dunedin on Saturday when they meet an England side sensing a rare chance to upset the rebuilding All Blacks in their own backyard.</p>
        
            <p>Much has changed since the World Cup decider last October when Ian Foster's team fell a point short of South Africa, and a slew of greats called time on their test careers.</p>
        
            <p>One constant, however, is the intense scrutiny Robertson finds himself under as the new man in charge of New Zealand's favourite team.</p>
        
            <p>Rival rugby nations may chop and change their head coaches, but Robertson is only the fourth All Blacks boss in the past 20 years and the first without any experience coaching at senior international level.</p>
        
            <p>He will be under pressure to keep the good times rolling, even if by the sky-high standards of some local fans the World Cup near-miss was a disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson has already ruffled feathers by appointing lock Scott Barrett to lead in the post-Sam Cane era, relegating loose forward and World Rugby Player of the Year Ardie Savea to a vice-captaincy role.</p>

            <p>Robertson's first match-day squad named on Thursday was a decisive break with the past, with 33-year-old Beauden Barrett, one of the country's most assured performers, shunted to the bench in favour of three-cap fullback Stephen Perofeta.</p>
        
            <p>"He took it like a true pro," Robertson said of Barrett's demotion.</p>
        
            <p>"He's covering a couple of positions and can slot in at any time, so he was great."</p>
        
            <p>Only 12 remain from the match-day squad that all but won a fourth World Cup for the country in France.</p>
        
            <p>Injuries and departures have given several players a chance to nail down starting slots, including first five Damian McKenzie and Dalton Papali'i, who replaces Cane as openside flanker.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs flanker Samipeni Finau gets a second test cap when he starts on the blindside while TJ Perenara succeeds Aaron Smith at halfback as Cam Roigard nurses a knee problem.</p>
        
            <p>England will hope to tear up Robertson's best-laid plans over the course of the two-test series, however unlikely it might seem given their record in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Since a 15-13 win in Wellington in 2003, England have lost all seven tests across their last three tours.</p>
        
            <p>Hope springs eternal, though, and optimism abounds in Steve Borthwick's squad only months after they appeared in crisis with an insipid Six Nations defeat to Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>The World Cup semi-finalists bring a fresh attacking mindset, with Marcus Smith retained at first five and boosted by a big warmup win over Japan and former coach Eddie Jones in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>The roofed Forsyth Barr stadium invites running rugby, and England will hope for a fast start against a team that can be rusty in season-openers after a long international break.</p>
