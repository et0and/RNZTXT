        <h2>Football round-up: The â€˜Nix and Black Knights are making club football cool again</h2>
        <p>
The war has already started between the two A-League sides months before a ball is due to be kicked, Mathew Nash writes.

            <p>The Wellington Phoenix are back on top of the A-League Men as they signed off from Eden Park as hometown favourites unbeaten, following a 2-1 win over Sydney FC.</p>
        
            <p>But with their final game as the 'home' team in Auckland, they shone a hopeful look into the future of professional football in Aotearoa - with tongues genuinely wagging in anticipation of a future Aotearoa derby.</p>

            <p>In the office, I usually have to instigate the soccer chat. Not this week. Because amid marvelling at Xavier Coates' winning try against the Warriors and revelling in another Crusaders loss the water cooler yarning turned to football.</p>
        
            <p>The Nix's result was secondary to the altogether more interesting story in the eyes of the uninitiated. A pitch invader, adorned with the underwhelming new home kit of New Zealand's latest football team Auckland FC, trespassed onto the hallowed turf of Eden Park. The initial speculation that this was a publicity stunt, jointly conspired by the Black Knights and Eden Park's operators, has been vehemently denied by all relevant parties. Organised or not, it has had the desired effect - with a visible uptick in media coverage for an important victory.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, club football in New Zealand is interesting again. The 18,000 people packed into Eden Park to see a Kosta Barbarouses-inspired 'Nix reclaim top spot in the league was already a testament to that. The addition of a new team and an increasingly spicy rivalry can only throw kindling on the fire. That blaze has been sizzling since an absorbing men's World Cup in Qatar 16 months ago, the women's version being on our soil last year and the increasing worship of stars like Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland among young Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>But the Phoenix's role in all this cannot be forgotten. Today marks 16 years exactly since the club was founded. For over a decade-and-a-half, the 'Nix have ploughed a lone furrow for professional football in New Zealand with, at times, little to no reward.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the pre-season favourites for the wooden spoon, top the league with a team made up largely of youth products with the odd smacking of quality foreign talent. The latest of which, Youstin Salas, was pivotal in both of Phoenix's goals this weekend. The Costa Rican already looks like an assured presence in midfield and the Phoenix recruitment team rarely misses, with Oskar Zawada and Bozhidar Kraev two of the league's best imports. Long gone are the days of Jeffrey Sarpong and Leilei Gao.</p>
        
            <p>Times are changing for the better. This version of the Phoenix is a more polished and organised beast and they will need to be to capitalise on what appears to be a brief window of opportunity to make domestic football in New Zealand cool again.</p>

            <p>The Wellington Phoenix's women's team lost a thriller in Porirua. After falling 3-0 down Paul Temple's side fought back to within a goal of opponents Sydney FC. However, the table-toppers continued their fine form, eventually winning 4-2.</p>

            <p>Auckland's current local footballing powerhouse, Auckland City, will be back to defend their regional crown after beating newfound rivals Wellington Olympic in the OFC Champions League play-off. A 4-3 aggregate win assures the Navy Blues of a place in Tahiti this May where they will look to claim a 12th continental title.</p>
        
            <p>The FA Cup was once the global beacon of professional football. However, in recent years, up against behemoth juggernaut competitions like the Premier League and Champions League, its significance has waned. But not this weekend. Four quarter-finals produced three of the more entertaining games you will see all season.</p>
        
            <p>Chelsea overcame a potentially turning fanbase and resurgent Leicester City to advance to the semi-finals 4-2. Championship promotion hopefuls Coventry City stunned Wolves with two goals deep in stoppage time after the Premier League side's own late double looked to have sealed things. Then, Manchester United got the better of their fiercest rivals Liverpool 4-3 after extra time. Amad Diallo scored the winning goal before being shown a record card after a second yellow for ripping his shirt off in celebration - in what must be one of sport's dumbest rules.</p>
        
            <p>The only ominous factor about the Cup's weekend fixtures was the routine manner of the other fixture, as the all-conquering Manchester City swept aside Newcastle United 2-0.</p>
