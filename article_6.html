            <p>Sri Lanka has won the one day series against New Zealand after scoring a three wicket victory in the second game in Pallekele.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka chased down their target of 210 with an over to spare in a game that was reduced to 47 overs because of rain.</p>
        
            <p>It gave the home side a 2-nil lead in the three match series.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always a challenge when you're defending a low score," Black Caps captain Mitchell Santner said in the after match interviews.</p>
        
            <p>Santner admitted they needed to set a higher target.</p>
        
            <p>"Kusal (Mendis) played the situation very well, we were trying to get the run-rate up but it never got above five so we knew we had to keep taking wickets.</p>
        
            <p>"We probably left a few runs out there."</p>
        
            <p>After being put into bat, New Zealand were dismissed in the 46th over for 209.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lankan spinners Jeffrey Vandersay and Maheesh Theekshana took three wickets each.</p>
        
            <p>Will Young made 26 at the top of the order, while Mark Chapman gave the side some momentum with 76 and wicketkeeper Mitchell Hay added 49.</p>
        
            <p>But with their last five batters all failing to get into double figures their total was a bit light.</p>

            <p>In reply it was Kusal Mendis who played the rock for Sri Lanka with a player of the match performance.</p>
        
            <p>Mendis came into bat in the second over and then guided his side home with an unbeaten 74.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Bracewell produced his best bowling figures in ODI's with four for 36.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Santner, Glenn Phillips and Nathan Smith grabbed one wicket each.</p>
        
            <p>It was Sri Lanka's first ODI series win over New Zealand since 2012.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka won the rain-affected first ODI by 45 runs.</p>
        
            <p>The third and final game is in Pallekele Tuesday night.</p>
