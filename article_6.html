            <p>The showpiece event of the Aupiki season is upon us, with the two top sides ready to battle it out on Eden Park. There has been plenty to talk about in women's rugby this year, not all of it exactly great news, but it is fair to say the Blues Women certainly deserve their home ground advantage after a five-win, one-loss campaign so far.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa are coming in off the back of a last gasp loss to Matatu last weekend, which meant the pre-tournament favourites gave up a chance to win back their Aupiki title on home ground. Still, they pose a formidable threat with a much-vaunted set piece.</p>
        
            <p>Here is a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Blues Women: 1. Chryss Viliko 2. Grace Gago 3. Aldora Itunu 4. Eloise Blackwell 5. Maama Vaipulu 6. Maiakawanakaulani Roos (cc) 7. Niall Williams-Guthrie 8. Liana Mikaele-Tu'u 9. Melanie Puckett 10. Krysten Cottrell 11. Jaymie Kolose 12. Ruahei Demant (cc) 13. Daynah Nankivell 14. Katelyn Vahaakolo 15. Patricia Maliepo</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Nijiho Nagata 17. Maddi Robinson 18. Cheyenne Tuli-Fale 19. Charmaine McMenamin 20. Elizabith Moimoi 21. Kahlia Awa 22. Kerri Johnson (Angelica Mekemeke Vahai) 23. Renee Woodman-Wickliffe</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa: 1. Kate Henwood 2. Luka Connor 3. Tanya Kalounivale 4. Charmaine Smith 5. Chelsea Bremner 6. Mia Anderson 7. Kennedy Simon (Captain) 8. Chyna Hohepa 9. Arihiana Marino-Tauhinu 10. Hazel Tubic 11. Reese Anderson 12. Grace Steinmetz 13. Mererangi Paul 14. Ruby Tui 15.Renee Holmes</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Vici-Rose Green 17. Krystal Murray 18. Bitila Tawake 19. Grace Kukutai 20. Victoria Edmonds 21. Ariana Bayler 22. Chelsea Semple 23. Azalleyah Maaka</p>

            <p>The Willie Walker coached side come in at full strength, with a mobile forward pack and very effective backline. Katelyn Vaha'akolo is joint top try scorer with six, unstoppable when she gets a bit of space and links well with Patricia Maliepo at fullback. Up front veteran Eloise Blackwell will provide experience at lock, while Maiakawanakaulani Roos will be a key part of winning ball at the lineout.</p>
        
            <p>On the bench, the match might provide one last victorious twist in the career of Renee Woodman-Wickliffe. The three-time World Cup winner came out of retirement to take her place in the wider squad, and now finds herself back up for the exciting Blues back three.</p>

            <p>The player who Vaha'akolo is tied with on the try scoring chart, Luka Connor, has had a very different path to her six tries. The Manawa lineout has been their main weapon this season, thanks to strong work at the set piece by the experienced Charmaine Smith and Chelsea Bremner.</p>
        
            <p>Hazel Tubic has got the nod over Chelsea Semple at first five, which suggests Manawa are going to favour a kick heavy game plan. However, this one may well be decided by the strength of the benches, and Manawa can call on some serious talent when they need to ring the changes.</p>
        
            <p>Blues Women 10 - 17 Chiefs Manawa</p>
        
            <p>Blues Women 40 - 26 Chiefs Manawa</p>
        
            <p>The score stands at one apiece in two very different games so far this season. Manawa's win in round two was a messy affair, in which they took their chances by playing tight and aggressive rugby. The next time they met was easily the Blues' best performance of the season, in which they shot out to a decent lead that Manawa threatened but could not overtake.</p>
        
            <p>You get the feeling that this really comes down to how many lineout drive opportunities Manawa will get, which is completely dependent on the Blues' discipline. It has not been the home side's strength this season, but if they can control field position and play the game at their pace, they should be able to wrap this one up. Last year's final was an absolute thriller, will this one live up to its standard?</p>
