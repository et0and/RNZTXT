            <p>A treble of tries to winger Salesi Rayasi has given the Hurricanes a splendid end to the Super Rugby Pacific regular season with a 41-14 victory in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The win put them at the top of the points table heading into the playoffs - though they could be joined tonight by the Blues if they, too, score a bonus-point win against the Chiefs at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>It was an emphatic performance from the Hurricanes, as they ran in seven tries to two, earning themselves a home quarterfinal next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Jordie Barrett, who made some telling breaks in the midfield, said they not only had to overcome a ''tough, resilient, gritty" Highlanders side, but also swirling, gusting winds that made kicking and long passes difficult, but they were determined to finish the regular season strongly.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing we spoke about during the week was that [over the] last few seasons all we wanted was a home quarterfinal and I guess the great thing was that it was in our control tonight, and we managed to get a bonus point win, so again it's out of [our] control now," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders started with a hiss and roar, scoring in just the third minute as Matt Whaanga charged over, but the Hurricanes soon found their rhythm.</p>
        
            <p>A charging Asafo Aumua, making an impactful return after injury, set up Rayasi for his first try, talisman flanker Du'Plessis Kirifi scored and then Aumua sent TJ Perenara away for another before Rayasi nabbed his second.</p>

            <p>It's a mark of the Hurricanes form this season that after the Highlanders got themselves back into the game, with a Fabian Holland try in the 33rd minute, they responded immediately with Kirifi taking three defenders over the line.</p>
        
            <p>Things got worse for the Highlanders with Connor Garden-Bachop then marched with a yellow card for an unsightly head clash with Will Tucker.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Gilbert later suffered the same fate with time in the bin after a head clash, again with Tucker.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders needed to score first in the second half, but Rayasi showed skilful touch to finish off a sustained attack from the Hurricanes and the southerners had no chance after that.</p>
        
            <p>Brayden Iose followed up with another try.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders finish the regular season in sixth place.</p>
        
            <p>They were far from full strength, with coach Clarke Dermody making seven changes after saving some of their best players for the quarterfinal next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 41 (Salesi Rayasi 3, Du'Plessis Kirifi 2, TJ Perenara, Brayden Iose tries, Brett Cameron 3 cons),</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders 14 (Matt Whaanga, Fabian Holland tries; Sam Gilbert 2 cons).</p>
