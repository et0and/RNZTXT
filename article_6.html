            <p>A survey has shown NRLW players receive twice as much online abuse as their male counterparts in the NRL and two in three do not report incidents.</p>
        
            <p>The survey, conducted by the Rugby League Players Association, claims 8 percent of NRLW players have received targeted abuse and 4 percent have experienced racism.</p>
        
            <p>However, the survey showed 67 percent of players chose not to report the incidents and one-third believed they would not be supported if they spoke out.</p>
        
            <p>The figures show that of those who have experienced abuse, all had received that abuse online.</p>
        
            <p>One-quarter said they had experienced abuse from fans.</p>
        
            <p>Another quarter said they experienced abuse from the general public, and the same amount cited abuse from the media.</p>
        
            <p>The figures back up research released this year by Deakin University in Geelong, which examined online harm experienced by women in Australian sport.</p>
        
            <p>The research showed 81 per cent of athletes had experienced personal insults and 62 percent had endured hate speech.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-nine percent experienced sexual harassment.</p>
        
            <p>The RLPA's survey is contained in The Players' Pulse, an annual snapshot of player attitudes and work conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The survey found that in general, NRLW players had a less favourable experience of the workplace than men in the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>It showed NRLW players gave their clubs a D mark for culture via a scaling system of A (the highest) to F (the lowest).</p>
        
            <p>The rating means between 50 and 65 per cent of players gave the club a ranking of six or more out of 10 (on a scale from 0-10).</p>
        
            <p>The women gave their head coaches, medical staff, assistant coaches and CEO an average score of a C, while the men gave their high-performance staff an average rating of a B.</p>
        
            <p>The top-performing club in the NRL was South Sydney, which scored Bs and As across a range of criteria.</p>
        
            <p>The criteria included coaching, support, workplace environment, training facilities, family support facilities, cultural safety, workload and balance, match-day facilities and travel.</p>
        
            <p>The best-performing club in the NRLW was Parramatta, which scored As and Bs, apart from a D for psychological safety.</p>
        
            <p>The RLPA said it planned to engage with leaders at all the clubs to review the results of workplace satisfaction.</p>

            <p>The meetings would provide an opportunity to look deeper at the reason behind the players' sentiments.</p>
        
            <p>A stark difference between the men's and women's games is the part-time nature of the NRLW, which operates across a much shorter season than the NRL and was causing financial strain, according to the RLPA.</p>
        
            <p>Ninety-two per cent of the female players said they worked during the off-season, which dropped to 83 per cent in the active season.</p>
        
            <p>The player's Collective Bargaining Agreement has established protected hours from 8am to 4pm to give women time for external commitments.</p>
        
            <p>However, the RLPA said "frequent violations" of the protected hours were forcing players to prioritise NRLW without compensation.</p>
        
            <p>The RLPA said that was leading to "financial strain and increased mental and physical stress".</p>
        
            <p>"Effectively, this unpaid encroachment on the time that a player would otherwise be earning income from is a form of wage theft," the RLPA survey said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly common in part-time professional sports and particularly women's sports and is an issue that must be addressed."</p>
        
            <p>The survey found 35 per cent of NRLW players were relying on casual work, an increase of 8 percentage points since 2021.</p>
