            <p>The Wellington Phoenix's A-League season has come to an end with a extra time 2-1 loss to Melbourne Victory in their semi-final second leg game in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The Victory went ahead against the run of play in the 61st minute, and were set for the win until Phoenix substitute Oskar Zawada grabbed the equaliser with the last kick of regulation time.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors then went ahead again in the first-half of extra time, and while the Phoenix continued to press and have shots on goal, they couldn't find a second goal.</p>
