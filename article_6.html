            <p>Opinion - It has been an incredible season for the Wellington Phoenix but, ultimately, one which ended in crushing disappointment in front of a sell-out crowd at Sky Stadium in Wellington last weekend. Melbourne Victory's extra-time triumph in the Finals Series semi-final will have only temporarily dampened the spirits in the 'Nix camp, with attention now turning to next season.</p>
        
            <p>Last off-season saw seven key players move on, as well as the manager, necessitating a rejig which has paid off beyond anyone's wildest expectations.</p>
        
            <p>So, what ducks do the Phoenix need to get in a row for 2024-25?</p>

            <p>One player who won't be with the Phoenix next year is Oskar Zawada. Head coach Giancarlo Italiano confirmed in the semi-final post-match that the 28-year-old was heading for pastures new, with his contract expiring. The rumour mill is churning, with suggestions Zawada could head to the upstart Auckland FC, in what would be an early Luis Figo-like move to the new rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Zawada's exit would have seemed catastrophic this time last year but he spent much of this season on the sidelines and Kosta Barbarouses stepped into the void with aplomb. He is also reaching the end of his current deal but Italiano and the club are confident the 34-year-old will remain. There has been chatter of interest from clubs in Melbourne, where he previously spent two successful spells with the Victory, with Melbourne City in particular needing a new striker now Jamie Maclaren has moved on. Fingers crossed Barbarouses does stay put.</p>
        
            <p>Another player on his way out is Youstin Salas. Club sources have confirmed there are currently no plans to turn the Costa Rican international's loan deal into a permanent transfer in the off-season. The club are currently working on new deals with Bulgarian attacker Bozhidar Kraev, midfield lynchpin Nicholas Pennington and back-up goalkeeper Jack Duncan - all of whom are currently off contract.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the biggest challenge the Phoenix will face is hanging on to the young talents Italiano is so keen to build this side around. Namely, the trio of Alex Paulsen, Finn Surman and Ben Old, will be the toughest to cling to.</p>
        
            <p>The good news is that all three are tied down to contracts at the club - Surman until 2025 while Paulsen and Old recently inked deals until 2027. In reality, those contracts only ensure the Phoenix will receive a fee for any transfer. Ben Waine, Libby Cacace, Sarpreet Singh. All moved on to Europe when the price was right. Surman seems attainable, given his contract has one year remaining and he holds British citizenship - making any move to Europe, especially the UK, much easier. The Phoenix hierarchy are confident about keeping their young guns, but impressive performances at this year's Olympic Games would only add to their appeal with other parties.</p>

            <p>Continuing to embrace the academy system at the Phoenix is undoubtedly going to be a huge part of Italiano's plans going forward. There are those who established themselves in the first-team picture last season, such as Lukas Kelly-Heald, Isaac Hughes, Oskar van Hattum and Fin Conchie, who will be looking to continue their progress. Some would even relieve the pressure felt by any of the potential off contract departures.</p>
        
            <p>Then there is the next cohort coming through. Matt Sheridan, Fergus Gillion, Luke Supyk and Gabriel Sloane-Rodrigues all made A-League appearances this season and will hope for more next term.</p>

            <p>The new kids on the block, the noisy neighbours from up north, and the Phoenix's newest rivals - Auckland FC's arrival on the A-League stage must be embraced by the club. So far, it seems that is the case, as the two sides have already been trading light barbs online and in the media. Which is great, as it can only help drum up interest in both teams. Talk of a Waitangi weekend clash in Wellington should already have New Zealand football fans drooling.</p>

            <p>Visa players, inherently, come at a premium cost but, with Zawada and Salas going and Kraev still an uncertainty, the Phoenix could have three visa slots available next term. It could even be more, with David Ball potentially viable for a New Zealand passport some point this year (dependent on how his time spent in Australia during the Covid-19 seasons is viewed by INZ). Filling at least a couple of those slots with the right players would undoubtedly help the team take the next step in 2024-25, and finally put some silverware in the Phoenix trophy cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a large pool of off-contract players across Europe, South America and Central America, recent happy hunting grounds for the Phoenix, to target so whittling those down to affordable and desirable options will be the tough process for the recruitment team.</p>
        
            <p>However, doing so, and utilising visa slots on another striker and a central midfielder for example, would no doubt be welcomed by the Yellow Fever faithful.</p>
