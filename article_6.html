            <p>World No 1 Nelly Korda fired a final-round 69 to win her LPGA record-tying fifth straight event - and second major title - at the Chevron Championship on Sunday in The Woodlands, Texas.</p>
        
            <p>Korda, 25, who finished with a 13-under 275 and defeated Sweden's Maia Stark by two strokes, had to play 25 holes on the final day to make up for a weather delay on Saturday, but still captured her 13th LPGA Tour event win.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Lydia Ko finished tied for 17th... 11 shots behind the winner.</p>
        
            <p>Korda, who won her first major in 2021 at the Women's PGA Championship, joined Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) as the only players in LPGA Tour history to win five straight starts.</p>
        
            <p>Korda also earned $2 million for her latest victory.</p>
        
            <p>"I can finally breathe now," Korda said. "That back nine felt like the longest back nine of my entire life. It was a little bit of a grind on the back nine, but happy to get the win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a major. It's everything that I've always wanted as a little girl, to lift that major trophy."</p>
        
            <p>Korda will compete next week at the JM Eagle LA Championship Wilshire Country Club in Los Angeles, and with a win, she would break the record she now shares with Sorenstam and Lopez.</p>
        
            <p>Korda trailed by a shot when play was called off on Saturday due to weather but wrapped up her third round by making par to keep her at 10-under for the week.</p>
        
            <p>After making three birdies on her front nine, Korda led Canada's Brooke Henderson and South Korea's Hae Ran Ryu by three shots. Korda upped the lead to four with a chip-in on the 10th.</p>

            <p>Despite two bogeys, Korda managed to hold on, sinking a birdie on 18 to seal the win after nearly acing the par-3 17th.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a key in the simplicity that I have when I play," Korda said. "I honestly just take it a shot at a time, and we pick a game plan when we get to the golf course and we work and we stay in our own little bubble. It's been working so far.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like maybe sometimes golf can get overcomplicated, and it's just - there's a key to the simplicity of it."</p>
        
            <p>Stark finished alone in second at 11 under with a birdie on the final hole, one ahead of Lauren Coughlin (68) and Henderson (72). Ryu shot a final-round 74 to finish fifth at 9 under.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely not my best stuff, which is a little disappointing, but Nelly played amazing, and what she's doing is pretty incredible," Henderson said. "Congratulations to her, and I feel like I learned a lot this week."</p>
