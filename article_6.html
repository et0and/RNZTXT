            <p>The Blues have hammered the Brumbies 46-7 at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Billed as the game of the round, it was far from a contest as the Blues routed the Brumbies 46-7 in an absolute demolition job.</p>
        
            <p>It was a meeting of second and third on the points table, but the Blues showed a chasm in class between the two teams, running in seven tries in the wet at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Blues number eight Hoskins Sotutu bagged a brace in the win and told Sky Sport that after eight rounds they were building momentum.</p>
        
            <p>"From the beginning of the season we have been building, and after that bye we knew we could pick up where we left off."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was crucial they fronted up physically.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that we can carry well and with the wet weather it was a point we needed to go to."</p>
        
            <p>Blues skipper Patrick Tuipulotu said they knew they had to respect the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>"We were a bit lumpy in the last quarter but we knew if we backed ourselves and our physicality, we would get that result."</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies enjoyed some early territory as a strong Ollie Sapsford run resulted in Taufa Funaki being sent to the bin for a professional foul with the Brumbies held up over the line.</p>
        
            <p>They couldn't cash in, however, and the Blues would string multiple phases together at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>The pressure proved too much, as Sotutu powered over for the opening try.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies turned down an easy three points and went to the corner, only to knock on at the lineout.</p>
        
            <p>They again opted for the sideline shortly after - this time a Sotutu turnover thwarting the attack.</p>

            <p>With a penalty inside the 22, the Blues put down a scrum and Caleb Clarke rocketed on to a flat Taufa Funaki pass, monstering his way through several Brumbies defenders to score.</p>
        
            <p>Harry Plummer pushed the Blues ahead by another three points before a Sapsford error gave the Blues a chance for more points before halftime.</p>
        
            <p>It would seem they survived when Ricky Riccitelli was held up on the siren, but Noah Lolesio put his line drop out on the full.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts punished the error as Sotutu scored his second from the ensuing penalty to take a commanding 24-0 at the break.</p>
        
            <p>It took less than five minutes for the Blues to strike after oranges as Dalton Papali'i went in off the back of a strong rolling maul.</p>
        
            <p>James Slipper was then binned for head contact on Blues lock Laghlan McWhannell.</p>
        
            <p>It went from bad to worse for the Brumbies as Ryan Lonergan fumbled the ball at the base of a scrum just five metres from his own line and Funaki pounced for the Blues' fourth.</p>
        
            <p>It was made to look easy when Riccitelli rumbled over from another unstoppable lineout drive.</p>
        
            <p>It took 64 minutes, but the Brumbies finally cracked the Blues' defence through replacement Luke Reimer.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues would respond through substitute hooker Kurt Eklund, who was driven over the chalk for a seventh.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues head to Brisbane next weekend for a clash with the Reds, who are fresh off hammering the Highlanders 31-0.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Brumbies get a visit from the table-topping Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers </p>
        
            <p>Blues 46 (Sotutu 2, Clarke, Papali'i, Funaki, Riccitelli, Eklund tries, Plummer 4 cons, 1 pen)</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies 7 (Reimer, try, Lolesio 1 con)</p>
