            <p>Liam Lawson has reiterated his hardline approach to wanting to succeed in Formula 1 after coming under fire at last weekend's Mexican Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously my goal is not to go out and make enemies of anybody," Lawson said on the eve of the Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not trying to cause any issues or anything like that. At the same time, I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win - that's what I'm focused on doing."</p>
        
            <p>In his two races back in Formula 1, the RB driver has managed to upset a couple of veterans.</p>
        
            <p>Fernando Alonso got upset with the 22 year old Kiwi in the US and last weekend Sergio Perez called him an idiot on the Red Bull team radio as he struggled to overtake him.</p>
        
            <p>Perez is under pressure to retain his seat next season and Lawson is one of those likely to be considered as a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson admitted that there are things he "could have done better" at the Mexico City Grand Prix following his clash with Perez.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, in every race, there's so many things you go over, so many things you can do better.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, yes, for sure, there's obviously stuff in there that could have been better, but I'll take those things and learn from it going into this weekend."</p>
        
            <p>However Lawson said he's also fighting for his survival.</p>
        
            <p>"In this situation, we're fighting very hard for P6 in the constructors' (championship), and I'm fighting for my future in F1 as well, so that's what I'm focused on."</p>

            <p>Lawson was seen to give Perez 'the finger' near the end of the Mexican race and apologised afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"In the moment things are very heated and obviously I apologise for what I did last week," he commented. "It's not something I should have done, and it's something I won't be doing again."</p>
        
            <p>After taking over from Daniel Ricciardo in the RB car for the last six races of the season, Lawson is driving for his future.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just focused on having the best possible race each time I get in the car. Honestly, that's all I'm trying to do at the moment. Maybe I'm aggressive, but I'm here for one reason."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson picked up two points for his ninth place finish in Texas.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix has a sprint race on the Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It is a course he knows little about.</p>
        
            <p>"Another knew track and a sprint weekend so it's going to be a tricky one."</p>
        
            <p>The following Brazil the F1 circus heads to Las Vegas and then Qatar before the season finale in Abu Dhabi.</p>
