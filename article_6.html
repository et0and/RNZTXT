            <p>The Blues have pulled off a last-gasp win over the Reds in Brisbane to climb within a point of the Super Rugby Pacific competition lead.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland-based outfit stole the 41-34 win with a sweeping try to reserve halfback Sam Nock after the final hooter on Saturday night, having trailed by 11 points entering the closing stages.</p>
        
            <p>Tries to Hoskins Soturu and Kurt Eklund levelled the scores before they created space for reserve winger Caleb Clarke in the final action of the game, with Nock finding himself in space for a 20m run to the line.</p>

            <p>The Blues led the Reds 13-7 after a first half dominated by brutal collisions, but could not halt a surge from the home side midway through the second half as 20-year-old Reds winger Tim Ryan scored three tries in the space of 14 minutes to cap a remarkable debut.</p>
        
            <p>It put the home side 31-20 ahead but they could not close it out, leaving them sixth in the standings.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues once again fielded a dominant scrum, while loose forwards Sotutu and Dalton Papali'i furthered their All Blacks selection prospects with impressive all-round games.</p>
        
            <p>Halfback Taufa Funaki enjoyed another lively game and Clarke made an explosive impact off the bench.</p>
        
            <p>It was the sixth straight win for the Blues, who boast the same 8-1 record as the competition-leading Hurricanes, but one less bonus point.</p>
        
            <p>The two New Zealand teams meet at Eden Park in two weeks in a match that could determine the all-important home advantage for the playoffs.</p>
