            <p>Two-time New Zealand Amateur champion Daniel Hillier can push for a matching crown at the New Zealand Open, following a blistering second round at the New Zealand Open in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>A breakthrough winner on the DP World Tour last year, Hillier showed his class on the more difficult Coronet Course on day two, making birdie on each of his final four holes for a round of 6-under 65 to climb into a tie for second.</p>
        
            <p>Australian veteran Scott Hend fired a second round of five-under-par 66, moving him to 12-under, two shots clear of the field.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi Josh Geary is also in a share of second at 10-under par after he too shot 6-under 65.</p>
        
            <p>Four shots separate the top 20 players at the halfway stage including New Zealand's Nick Voke, Kieran Muir and Ben Campbell.</p>
