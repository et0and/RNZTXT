            <p>With a rusty performance from tall target Amelia Walmsley, the Central Pulse opened their ANZ Premiership campaign with a nervy 58-51 win over the Northern Stars.</p>
        
            <p>The under-strength Wellington side capitalised on a late tactical move by Stars coach Kiri Wills, which backfired for the home side in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>With the Stars having done the hard work to make a dent in the Pulse's big eight-goal halftime lead and reduce the deficit to four goals, Wills sent assured goal attack Amorangi Malesala to the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Fern Malesala went off the court in the final quarter as Melbourne Vixens newcomer Rahni Samason came on at goal shoot, with Maia Wilson moving out to goal attack.</p>
        
            <p>That Stars shooting switch had not paid off earlier in the night - and failed for a second time.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the usually assured Walmsley had an off night under the post, missing 13 of her attempts as she secured 45 goals for her side.</p>
        
            <p>To her credit, she kept putting up goals and taking superb feeds from Pulse speedster Maddy Gordon, as well as a couple of spectacular long balls from goal defence Parris Mason.</p>
        
            <p>Walmsley finished strongly with 14 from 16 in the critical final quarter as the Pulse sailed to victory.</p>
        
            <p>She was supported by rookie goal attack Kiana Pelasio who came in for the injured Tiana Metuarau.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse captain Kelly Jackson told SkySport it was hard for her team to maintain their composure.</p>
        
            <p>"We got in front early, [then] it got a bit scary in that third quarter when it was going back and forth a little bit and the gap was closing.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just got to keep getting ball for our attacking mates down court there. They've got lots of pressure on them; we've got to just keep working hard."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson paid tribute to the chemistry with her talented defensive partner Mason, who is also a Black Ferns basketballer.</p>
        
            <p>"I love working with Parris - she has a great netball brain on her and lots of energy to burn.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to be able to go out there with some decent minutes with her."</p>
        
            <p>Stars captain Maia Wilson said the loss would be felt keenly.</p>
        
            <p>"We had opportunities to take that game, so I'm really disappointed. We still could have won that game towards the end.</p>
        
            <p>"We were playing musical bibs in our attacking end but I think at the end of the day, it's [about] shot selection and pass placement."</p>
        
            <p>Stars newcomer Khanyè-Lii Munro-Nanoa copped a two-minute suspension in the first quarter for a dangerous late challenge on Gordon.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars were stacked with international players across the court, including Mila Reuelu-Buchanan, Wilson, Malesala and defender Kate Burley.</p>
        
            <p>Their best performer, however, was talented newcomer Lili Tokaduadua, who was awarded player of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Tokaduadua produced a breakout performance with four gains, one intercept and seven total deflections in a high-octane first outing at the elite level.</p>
