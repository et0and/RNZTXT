            <p>What began as a means for self-defence has led to a chance for Olympic gold for kiwi wrestler Tayla Ford.</p>
        
            <p>Ford is set to make history as the first woman from Aotearoa to wrestle at the Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I still haven't processed it. I'm still on a bit of a high. It's quite surreal because to me, I'm a normal person, I bleed red like everybody else, so to know that I'm capable of doing it just proves to me just how capable a lot of people really are."</p>
        
            <p>She did have another path to the Games as a promising rugby player, but opted to leave the field for the mat.</p>
        
            <p>"I was playing rugby and I was given an ultimatum to either pursue wrestling or give up and do rugby. Obviously, it's a lot of focus to put into one sport, let alone two, so I tried to dedicate as much as I could towards wrestling and I gave up rugby. I haven't regretted that."</p>
        
            <p>It has been a long path for Ford, paved with pitfalls.</p>
        
            <p>Ford came agonisingly close to her Olympic dream in Rio in 2016, only to be pipped by just two points to finish third at qualifications.</p>
        
            <p>More heartbreak followed four years later when her qualifier for the Tokyo Games was cancelled due to Covid.</p>
        
            <p>However, her determination never wavered.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew I had the potential to do so, just as long as I kept believing in myself."</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately, it was a change in coach and self-belief that set her towards success.</p>
        
            <p>"Growing up my first 12 years with the coach I had, he was very good at coaching, but on the mental side and motivating, he wasn't there, so I never really thought I would be able to get here."</p>
        
            <p>She said a move across the Tasman to Adelaide would be the catalyst for her ascent up the wrestling ranks.</p>
        
            <p>"As I progressed through the years and evolved with the sport, I pushed through a lot of barriers that I had before me. The people I surrounded myself with were really supportive and actually brought out a lot of belief in myself."</p>
        
            <p>As an amateur sport, funding was difficult for Ford.</p>
        
            <p>"Since June last year, it's cost me close to $20,000. So just to have a fraction of that funded would mean a lot and then I wouldn't have to work so many jobs, and I'd be able to train and recover properly."</p>
        
            <p>She made numerous sacrifices to support her dream.</p>
        
            <p>"I have two to three jobs as well and then I do coaching in the evening as well as do my own training amongst the coaching. So it makes it a little bit difficult in that sense."</p>
        
            <p>Her wrestling journey began when her father found out women's wrestling was included in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"That was his encouragement to make me go for self-defence, not necessarily to learn wrestling, but as I got better, he obviously encouraged me to stay."</p>
        
            <p>Ford said she hoped her selection for the games would inspire more women to take up the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a minority sport in this corner of the world just due to a lack of appearance."</p>
        
            <p>She said no other sport compared to the gladiatorial nature of wrestling.</p>
        
            <p>"I do this because I really love and I enjoy wrestling, the life lessons that it has taught me and the friends that it has brought me. Also the sort of person I am, it's an individual sport and that's what I like. I'm the one to blame for my failures and I'm also the one to be proud of when I do achieve things."</p>
