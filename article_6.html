            <p>The Black Caps bowlers struck three times in the second session to knock off Australia's top order and leave the visitors 147-4 at tea in the first Test in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Australia lost three wickets for 24 runs as New Zealand took control of the session.</p>
        
            <p>In his first Test in New Zealand Marnus Labuschagne did not last long.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Kuggeleijn had an out-of-form Labuschagne caught in the slips by Daryl Mitchell for 1 run off 27 balls in the fourth over after lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Opener Usman Khawaja was the next to go as Matt Henry was rewarded with his second wicket when he bowled him for a cautious 33.</p>
        
            <p>Travis Head barely troubled the scorers getting out for 1 off six balls as Will O'Rourke got his first wicket of the series.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Australia were 62-1 for at lunch after being sent in to bat on a green pitch in overcast conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Some inaccurate bowling to start the day gave openers Steve Smith and Khawaja an opportunity to capitalise.</p>
        
            <p>Smith was New Zealand's first wicket of the day when he edged a Henry delivery to wicketkeeper Tom Blundell in the 25th over be out for 31.</p>
        
            <p>Khawaja survived an LBW review in the 21st over and New Zealand lost a review.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps bowled 15 overs of pace in the first hour of the day headed by captain Tim Southee who took the new ball alongside Henry.</p>
        
            <p>Newcomer O'Rourke and Kuggeleijn in his second Test were the other bowlers used in New Zealand's all-out pace attack in the first session.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opted to include Kuggeleijn in the playing 11 in place of spinner Mitch Santner.</p>
        
            <p>Australia are playing with the same 11 that lost to the West Indies in Brisbane in January.</p>
        
            <p>This the first test series between the Black Caps and Australia in New Zealand since 2016.</p>
