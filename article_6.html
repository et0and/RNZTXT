            <p>Wellington Phoenix women's coach Paul Temple admits his team are on the brink of missing the A-League playoffs after a 2-0 home loss to the Central Coast Mariners.</p>
        
            <p>The fifth-placed Mariners delivered a blow to the eighth-placed Phoenix at Porirua Park, winning via a penalty and a goal from former Wellington midfielder Isabel Gomez either side of halftime.</p>
        
            <p>With three matches remaining, the Phoenix are just two points outside the top six, although the sixth-placed Brisbane Roar still have five games to play.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Temple conceded they've reached the point where other results must go their way it they're to qualify for the post-season for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if it's completely over but it obviously means we've got to win the next three games in a row to stand any chance," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're down to must-wins and cup finals now. We'll keep going until it's mathematically impossible. We'll keep going until we can't go anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"We won't be resting people or rotating people. It'll be the strongest team, get out there and try to win the games."</p>
        
            <p>Temple felt they lacked quality against a good Central Coast side and struggled to create enough chances.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the start was really positive and we played well, without really having the moments of quality that we needed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The penalty definitely took the wind out of our sails but we regrouped, and we've come from one-nil down a few times so we didn't feel like it was all over or anything.</p>
        
            <p>"We were pretty positive we'd get back into it. It's just disappointing. We work hard on the set pieces and unfortunately we left Gomez free on the edge of the box, which is not the plan, and she made us pay for it."</p>
