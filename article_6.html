        <p>
This was sporting theatre of the highest quality, and the sold-out crowd appreciated every point the two women fought over, writes Jamie Wall.

            <p>The ASB Classic got a classic last night at Stanley Street. As the sun set over Auckland, Elina Svitolina and Emma Raducanu blazed away on centre court, with the Ukrainian second seed finally triumphing 6-7(5) 7-6(3) 6-1.</p>
        
            <p>This was sporting theatre of the highest quality, and the sold-out crowd appreciated every point the two women fought over. The main question at the end was how much a contender it is for the best match ever played at the women's tournament in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It began with the underdog Raducanu forcing a string of break points, but more importantly looking an awful lot more like the player that won a US Open before succumbing to a wretched run of injuries over the past two years. She stunned Svitolina in the first set to lead 5-1, before the second seed came roaring back to lead 6-5 to send the set to a tie break.</p>
        
            <p>By that stage, both players were showing off a dazzling array of skills and determination.</p>
        
            <p>The second set was almost a reverse of the first, with Svitolina breaking Raducanu early to lead 3-1. Raducanu held her nerve to break back and force a second tie break, but Svitolina coolly closed it out and pumped her fist on the way to her chair at the end change knowing she'd struck a massive psychological blow.</p>

            <p>To be fair, the match didn't get the dramatic finish it deserved. In the third set Svitolina stepped on the gas while Raducanu looked like she'd completely run out, which was no surprise really given her first match was a hefty three-setter as well.</p>
        
            <p>Svitolina paid an ultimate compliment to Raducanu after the match, rating it among her best matches in her entire career.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it was maybe my second best-ever level-wise," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Emma played so well. She didn't miss one ball until 5-1 and I am happy that I could be there. I was really surprised at her level second match and after the surgeries. It's good to see her healthy. I am sure this match will bring a lot of confidence for her and really great to see her back in such a high level."</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu was a mix of emotions post-match: disappointment at losing but also clearly happy with putting in an excellent performance against a high quality opponent.</p>
        
            <p>"My level was really high for the two sets that lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes," Raducanu said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am proud I was able to get my level up to be able to compete with Elina. She gives you nothing - you have to win them. I went for my shots later in the game that won me the first set, but I just missed them."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the loss, it's fair to say Raducanu leaves Auckland feeling a lot better than the last time she was here.</p>
        
            <p>"I loved the atmosphere today. It was pretty insane. We had some good points those first two sets and it was amazing to have the support here in Auckland but also back home," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Coco Gauff was in no mood to waste any time in her second round match, as she crushed Czech Brenda Fruhvirtova 6-3 6-0 in a rare match in which she was the older player.</p>
        
            <p>The top seeded American plays eighth seed Varvara Gracheva in Friday's quarterfinals, while it doesn't get any easier for Svitolina when she faces the in-form fifth seed Marie Bouzková. The other two quarters sees fourth seed Emma Navarro take on seventh seed Petra Martić in one, while the unseeded duo of Wang Xiyu and Diane Parry meet in the other.</p>
        
            <p>It's unfortunately all over for both New Zealand's official and tenuous representations at this year's women's tournament. Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan were beaten in straight sets by Bouzková and Bethanie Mattek-Sands, while Jade Otway and Kiwi-born Swiss Lulu Sun met the same fate at the hands of Jessika Ponchet and Anna Siskova.</p>
