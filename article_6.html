        <h2>'We’re a better team than last year’ – Boks sound ominous warning</h2>
        <p>
The Springboks consider themselves to be a superior product to the side that beat the All Blacks in last year's World Cup final.

            <p>Springboks v All Blacks</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 3am Sunday 1 September (NZT)</p>
        
            <p>Ellis Park, Johannesburg</p>
        
            <p>Live blog coverage on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>Jesse Kriel believes his Springbok side are even better than when they lifted the World Cup last year in France. Speaking to media on Monday, the 67-test midfielder said that the team was confident heading into this weekend's rematch of the final, against the All Blacks at Ellis Park.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe so, if you're not better now than you were last year you've got a bit of a problem," said Kriel at the Springboks' hotel in Johannesburg.</p>
        
            <p>"The big thing for us is that we want to stay ahead of the curve, keep working on our game and individual skillsets. But I definitely believe we're a better team than where we were last year."</p>
        
            <p>Kriel showed his verbal sidestepping was as adept as his on field prowess when asked if the same logic applies to the All Blacks, who have ushered in a new coaching regime this season.</p>
        
            <p>"They're definitely up there. They've got class players all around the field…great leaders and a great coaching staff. They're on their way to becoming a better team," he said.</p>

            <p>Kriel, arguably the form centre in test rugby right now described the influence of new attack coach Tony Brown as "massive".</p>
        
            <p>"He's brought a great energy and a great way of seeing attack, I think he's got the guys in the room really excited. He's got us playing a really exciting brand of rugby…it's really important to get on the field and be excited about how you want to play."</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks have an identical four win, one loss record to the All Blacks this season, after starting out with a tough 1-1 series against Ireland. Kriel said the style they're playing is a mixture of new ideas and the traditional Springbok power game.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you can see a bit of change. But you keep the core of what you've built on for the last couple of years."</p>

            <p>Just what All Black combination Kriel ends up facing is an interesting question. Rieko Ioane started the two tests against England, was dropped for the loss against the Pumas then retained for the return match at Eden Park. Anton Lienert-Brown took his place for the loss in Wellington and was ironically the All Blacks' best back that night.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Jordie Barrett hasn't exactly hit the heights we've come to expect of him so far this year, and David Havili is waiting in the wings as a Scott Robertson favourite.</p>
        
            <p>"Whoever plays there they've got so many people to pick from that are world class players. Regardless of who plays, you know you've got a big test match on your hands."</p>
        
            <p>Kriel also singled out first five Damian McKenzie for praise.</p>
        
            <p>"He's one of the most exciting players with ball in hand. Given the chance to run the New Zealand team at flyhalf, he must be doing a really good job. It's an exciting challenge for us."</p>
