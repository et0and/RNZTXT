            <p>The medal count continues to grow for New Zealand at the Para Athletics World Championships in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Danielle Aitchison took the silver medal in the women's 100m T36 final behind gold medallist Yiteng Shi of China, who ran a world record time.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old Hamilton-based athlete clocked 13.48secs - within 0.07 of her world record time set at the New Zealand Track & Field Championships in Wellington in March.</p>
        
            <p>However, the imperious Shi would not be denied a fourth successive Para World 100m T36 title as she lowered the Kiwi's world record mark from two months ago by registering a blistering 13.35.</p>
        
            <p>Veronica Hipolito of Brazil clinched bronze in 14.35.</p>
        
            <p>Following an outstanding day for the New Zealand team on Sunday - when Will Stedman surged to men's 400m T36 gold and Anna Grimaldi clinched women's 100m T47 bronze - the New Zealand team now has three medals.</p>
        
            <p>Competing in trademark long socks, Aitchison made a solid start, but it was the fast-starting Shi who quickly establish an early lead. As the race progressed the two main protagonists accelerated clear of the field and while the gutsy Kiwi desperately pursued the Paralympic champion, she could not quite get on level terms and had to settle for the silver medal.</p>
        
            <p>"My performance wasn't exactly how I wanted it to go but I know I can make some improvements and I'm excited to see what I can do at the Paris Paralympic Games," said Aitchison.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel a bit conflicted on winning silver, but I know exactly what I need to work on for the 200m, which is my start. I hope to get into that really good flight zone and hopefully run a quick time in the 200m."</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison will defend her Para World 200m T36 title on Thursday night.</p>
