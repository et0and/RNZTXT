            <p>Sri Lanka spinner Praveen Jayawickrama has been banned from all forms of cricket for one year, with the last six months suspended, for breaching the sport's anti-corruption code, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said.</p>
        
            <p>In August, the ICC charged Jayawickrama for failing to report an approach to fix matches and obstructing an investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The governing body said the 26-year-old was approached to fix international matches and was asked to approach another player to fix matches in the 2021 season of the Lanka Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>The ICC said Jayawickrama had admitted to being in breach of the anti-corruption code.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of the admission, Jayawickrama has accepted a sanction of a one-year period of ineligibility, of which the last six months are suspended," the ICC said.</p>
        
            <p>Jaywawickrama made his international debut in April 2021, taking 11 wickets in his first test against Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>He played five test matches, five one-day internationals and five Twenty20 internationals, but has not played for Sri Lanka since June 2022.</p>
