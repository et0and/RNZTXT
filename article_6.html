            <p>The Blues have got themselves in the winner's circle after a tight victory over the Hurricanes last weekend, but not without controversy. The dying stages of the game saw a controversial substitution situation and a lucky penalty that got the Blues home, but it all counts and the defending champs will take a lot of confidence out of the stuff they did right in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile the Brumbies are coming in having won only one of their first three games, despite scoring 108 points along the way. They went down to the Chiefs last weekend in Hamilton and are looking to get their season back on track.</p>

            <p>Hoskins Sotutu's return from injury only lasted one match as he's now been suspended for three more, Cam Suafoa moves into number eight in a fresh looking loose forward trio. Cam Christie and Anton Segner join him as Dalton Papali'i and Adrian Choat are out, other than that the big talking point in Beauden Barrett moving into first five and Harry Plummer dropping to the bench. Cole Forbes gets a start at fullback.</p>

            <p>There's five changes to the side that lost to the Chiefs last weekend, with Lachlan Lonergan, Lachlan Shaw, Tom Hooper and Harrison Goddard moving into the starting team. David Feliuai, who joined the Brumbies from the Melbourne Rebels during the off-season, will debut at second five inside Len Ikitau.</p>

            <p>The Blues have won eight of their last 10 Super Rugby Pacific games against the ACT Brumbies, conceding more than 20 points in a game only twice in that stretch. They've won each of their last two meetings by a combined score of 80-27.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies have won only three of their last 26 Super Rugby games against New Zealand teams in New Zealand and have lost their last three in a row since a 27-21 win against the Highlanders at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Round 4, 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Blues hooker Ricky Riccitelli has scored one try in each of his last two Super Rugby Pacific games after scoring just two tries across his previous eight appearances, he's also scored one try in each of his last three games against the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>"It's made a huge difference not to have to do two trips back and forth from Canberra. We spent a few days in Hamilton after the game on Saturday, so the boys were able to recover before making the short trip to Auckland yesterday." - Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham.</p>
        
            <p>"Anton Segner will do a great job - he'll step up, and the game is collective. Josh Beehre is in there and I thought he played well, Paddy is in there ... we'll set the platform through the tight five and everything else should follow." - Blues coach Vern Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>Blues 34 - 20 Brumbies</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies came in with high hopes in last season's semi final at Eden Park, but they were washed away on a rainy night as the eventual champions simply held onto the ball for most of the game. Tries to AJ Lam, Ricky Riccitelli, Sam Darry, Caleb Clarke and Hoskins Sotutu saw off the challenge and set them up for another resounding win a week later to claim the title.</p>
        
            <p>Beauden Barrett's going to be a bit happier, for a start. The 134-test veteran clearly prefers playing 10 at this level and has a decent backline outside him to use, who all clicked into gear at the right time last weekend. If the Brumbies are going to have a chance they'll need to strike early, they have some firepower out wide in Tom Wright and Corey Toole, but they can't afford to get into an arm wrestle with the Blues.</p>
