            <p>British diver Yasmin Harper says her Olympic bronze medal is showing signs of "tarnishing" after American skateboarder Nyjah Huston criticised the quality of his medal.</p>
        
            <p>Huston, who finished third in the men's street skateboarding on 29 July, posted a video of his medal appearing to look discoloured and chipped.</p>
        
            <p>Harper won Team GB's first medal of Paris 2024, claiming bronze with partner Scarlett Mew Jensen in the women's 3m synchronised springboard diving.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been some small bits of tarnishing," said Harper after finishing fifth in the 3m springboard final on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's water or anything that gets under metal, it's making it go a little bit discoloured, but I'm not sure."</p>
        
            <p>However, Harper, 24, said she was not bothered by the situation "because it's still a medal".</p>
        
            <p>Paris 2024 organisers said any damaged medals would be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>In a series of Instagram stories, Huston said: "These Olympic medals look great when they're brand new.</p>
        
            <p>"But after letting it sit on my skin with some sweat for a little bit and then letting my friends wear it over the weekend, they're apparently not as high quality as you would think."</p>
        
            <p>Huston, 29, then showed the medal on both sides, saying it is "looking rough" and "even the front is starting to chip off a little".</p>
        
            <p>He added: "Olympic medals, you've maybe got to step up the quality a little bit."</p>
        
            <p>The medals were designed by French luxury jeweller Chaumet and are set with a piece of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower during renovation in the 20th Century.</p>
        
            <p>Paris 2024 organisers said they were aware of Huston's comments.</p>
        
            <p>A Games spokesperson added: "Paris 2024 is working closely with the Monnaie de Paris, the institution tasked with the production and quality control of the medals, and together with the national Olympic committee of the athlete concerned, in order to appraise the medal to understand the circumstances and cause of the damage.</p>
        
            <p>"The medals are the most coveted objects of the Games and the most precious for the athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"Damaged medals will be systematically replaced by the Monnaie de Paris and engraved in an identical way to the originals."</p>
