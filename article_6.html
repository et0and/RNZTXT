            <p>NZ Warriors assistant coach Richard Agar admits the decision to play Taine Tuaupiki out of position on the wing in their NRL season-opener was "quite an easy one".</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland club will kick off their 2025 campaign against Canberra Raiders in Las Vegas on Sunday NZT, part of a doubleheader showcase of the Australian competition in one of the world's most lucrative sporting markets.</p>
        
            <p>Their season got off to a disastrous start, when star winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak dislocated and broke a wrist in the opening moments of their first trial game against Cronulla Sharks, leaving coach Andrew Webster with a gaping hole that needed filling.</p>
        
            <p>Rather than opt for Ed Kosi, who has played plenty of first-grade in the position, the Warriors have taken a chance on Tuaupiki, whose previous 11 outings at that level have been at fullback, but who has impressed with his opportunities during the pre-season.</p>
        
            <p>He replaced Watene-Zelezniak to score a try against the Sharks and then scored a double in his start against Melbourne Storm seven days later.</p>
        
            <p>"Given our roster changes at the moment, outside backs, last year were a position where we had a lot of depth," admitted Agar. "This year, we haven't got as much depth in the outside positions.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just an opportunity for Taine in a trial game, we really believe in his ability, he's a really smart player and we felt he could make a good fist of it."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Tuaupiki deputised for Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad in the No.1 jersey, with Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, who a Dally M Medal in that position, preferred in the centres, after his return from rugby union.</p>
        
            <p>The high point of his season came against defending champions Penrith Panthers during Magic Round in Brisbane, where Nicoll-Klokstad was shifted to the halves and Tuaupiki scored a late try that tied the scores, then coolly kicked the winning conversion.</p>
        
            <p>On the basis of that showing, Webster probably needed to find ways to get him more involved, rather than simply waiting his turn in reserve grade, so this injury crisis could not have come at a better time.</p>
        
            <p>"There is some difference in fullback and wing, but in terms of the work they do in the backfield, that's what he does as a fullback anyway," said Agar. "He's a smart player and has always performed well in first grade for us."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors' wing stocks took a hit in the off-season, when the club agreed to release Marcelo Montoya early from his contract, but that void has been covered by shifting Tuivasa-Sheck back to his original position.</p>
        
            <p>They could have moved Adam Pompey from the centres, but an injury to Rocco Berry has delayed his start to the season, leaving that position vulnerable as well.</p>

            <p>With the retirement of club scoring leader Shaun Johnson, Webster has handed the keys to former understudy Luke Metcalf, who has flashed his ability, but been hampered by injury during his time at Mt Smart.</p>
        
            <p>He has won the No.6 jersey from Chanel Harris-Tavita, who will line up outside him, and Te Maire Martin.</p>
        
            <p>"I think three or four of them asked for the role," said Agar. "People are overlooking the fact that Shaun has been at halfback for a while, but the guys fighting for his position - apart from Tannah Boyd, who is injured - have been in our system for at least three seasons now, so there is some continuity and cohesion.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not like coming to a new club and learning a new system, but it's been up to us to work out what are Luke's strengths and not try to make him a carbon copy of Shaun Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had to adapt to allow Luke to use his speed and his strengths, but we've always been really confident, whichever guys we pick, they probably have a little more to showcase too.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all of a good age, with the sweet spots of their careers are probably around the corner, They're young and hungry, and have an amazing opportunity to become really top halfbacks in the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>"We've certainly seen signs that Luke is more than capable of filling that breach."</p>
