            <p>Rachin Ravindra has no desire to sit out New Zealand's dead rubber against India after returning to the side with a rousing century against Bangladesh at the Champions Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>With New Zealand already qualified for the semi-finals, selectors have the luxury of resting players for the final group match against India in Dubai on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Batsman Ravindra sat out the Black Caps' opener against Pakistan while recovering from a blow to the head and does not want to miss another match at the ICC tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"Conversations haven't really been had around that. But in a tournament like this, I guess you want to play as many games as you can," the 25-year-old lefthander said.</p>
        
            <p>"And the nature of my injury before is meaning I've missed some games.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'll do whatever the team wants but I'd be keen to get out there and hopefully do my thing."</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra's preparations for the tournament were disrupted when he was struck on the head by the ball in a fielding mishap, forcing him to go through concussion protocols.</p>
        
            <p>He scored 112 against Bangladesh on his return to the team batting at number four in place of Daryl Mitchell, who was ruled out due to illness.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra said all-rounder Mitchell was "definitely progressing well" on his way back to full health and the team were glad to have a couple of rest days.</p>
        
            <p>Come game day against India, though, players would be raring to go for the dead rubber.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess you don't really want to take games for granted ever," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we can treat it like a game in an international tournament, right?</p>
        
            <p>"So there's still a lot to play for, the first spot in the semi-finals."</p>
