            <p>Accor Stadium, Sydney</p>
        
            <p>Live updates on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>James Slipper will become the most-capped Wallaby of all-time when he runs out for his 140th Test at Accor Stadium in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Slipper made his debut in 2010 against England and will surpass George Gregan's record on Saturday after being named as the replacement loosehead prop against the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>He is one of just three Wallabies to feature in four Rugby World Cups and earlier this year broke the record for the most-capped test prop ever.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Queensland Reds pair Fraser McReight and Hunter Paisami return to the starting side after fully recovering from injury. The openside flanker is yet to feature in the 2024 Rugby Championship, while Paisami's knee injury kept him out of the tour to Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>Nic White will start at halfback, partnering with Noah Lolesio who returns at first five, while Tom Wright has overcome an ankle complaint to earn his spot at fullback.</p>
        
            <p>Wright's return sees Andrew Kellaway shift back to the right wing, with Marika Koroibete remaining on the left. Len Ikitau pairs up with Paisami in the midfield.</p>

            <p>Apart from McReight, the starting forward pack is unchanged from the side that was thumped 67-27 by Argentina a fortnight ago. Angus Bell, Matt Faessler and Taniela Tupou start in the front row, Nick Frost and Jeremy Williams will continue their partnership at lock, with blindside flanker Rob Valetini and skipper Harry Wilson joining McReight as the loose forward trio.</p>
        
            <p>Brandon Paenga-Amosa will pull on the gold jersey for the first time since 2021after returning to Australian Rugby from France earlier this year. He joins Slipper and Allan Alaalatoa in an experienced replacement front row.</p>
        
            <p>Lukhan Salakaia-Loto has also overcome injury to be selected as the substitute second rower, with Langi Gleeson to cover the loose forwards.</p>
        
            <p>Reds duo Tate McDermott and Tom Lynagh are the replacement halves for the second straight test, with Dylan Pietsch rounding out the matchday 23.</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt said: "The players have reconnected well this week for our last game on home soil this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We've acknowledged the poor finish to our time in Argentina and we're keen to turn that around on what will be a particularly special day for James and his family."</p>
