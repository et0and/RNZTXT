            <p>Two tries by winger Cheslin Kolbe helped South Africa to a 29-20 victory over England at Twickenham and though the home crowd was treated to a good match, it meant a fifth successive defeat for Steve Borthwick's men.</p>
        
            <p>It was 19-17 to the world champion Springboks at the break after a breathless, five-try first half full of attacking intent from both sides.</p>
        
            <p>Ollie Sleightholme put England ahead, but three tries in 10 minutes by Grant Williams, Pieter-Steph du Toit and Kolbe silenced Twickenham, only for Sam Underhill to power over for the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>A penalty for Marcus Smith briefly had England ahead but a Handre Pollard penalty and winger Kolbe's explosive second try made it 29-20.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa showed all their usual doggedness to keep the hosts at arm's length in the final 15 minutes with lock Eben Etzebeth in the sin-bin.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile winger Darcy Graham equalled the record for the most tries for Scotland as they ran in a total of nine in a dominant 59-21 victory over Portugal at Murrayfield.</p>
        
            <p>Graham scored the third of Scotland's five first half tries to bring his total to 29 in 41 international appearances and equal Duhan van der Merwe's record.</p>
        
            <p>There were also tries for Arron Reed (2), Will Hurd, captain Stafford McDowell, Josh Bayliss, Jamie Bhatti, Jamie Dobie and a penalty try for a second-string Scottish side, who took four minutes to open the scoring in a sometimes chaotic spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>Flyhalf Adam Hastings put over five conversions and Tom Jordan one.</p>
        
            <p>Portugal, whose play at times seemed without structure and blighted by loose passes, tightened up after a frenetic opening period and scored three tries in an impressive show of determination despite being outgunned by their powerful hosts.</p>
        
            <p>The win makes it two out of three for Scotland in their four-match November international schedule at Murrayfield, after beating Fiji but losing to South Africa last weekend. The Scots host Australia next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>And the USA ran in five tries to three as they beat Tonga 36-17 in ChambÄ“ry in France.</p>
