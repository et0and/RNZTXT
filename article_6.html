            <p>In the Australian Open, Coco Gauff made light work of Poland's Magdalena Frech to seal a 6-1 6-2 victory on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>The 19-year-old, who won the Auckland Open earlier this month, wrapped up the match in just over an hour.</p>
        
            <p>It's the first time Gauff has made it past the fourth round of the first Grand Slam of the season.</p>
        
            <p>With Australian great Rod Laver watching on, Gauff was delighted to win on the court he gave his name to.</p>
        
            <p>Gauff will now play Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk who stormed into her first Grand Slam quarter-final with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Maria Timofeeva of Russia.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no better court in Australia than Rod Laver Arena and it was an honour to play in front of you, so thank you for coming to my match," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Reigning champion Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus also reached the quarter-finals when she swept past American Amanda Anisimova 6-3 6-2 on Margaret Court Arena.</p>
        
            <p>Anisimova, down to 442 in the world after an eight-month break from the game, had held a 4-1 lead in career meetings with Sabalenka but found the 2024 version of the 26-year-old a much tougher nut to crack.</p>
        
            <p>In the opening set, the former French Open semi-finalist was unable to win a single point off Sabalenka's first serve, which on occasion was clocked at the 195km/h mark.</p>
        
            <p>Top seed Novak Djokovic delivered a master class to defeat Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in straight sets, the 36-year-old wrapping up the match in an hour and 44 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The Serb won the first two sets to love (6-0 6-0) and was on course to record a rare triple bagel score, till the 20th seeded Mannarino provided some belated but ultimately futile resistance in the third set, to lose that by 6-3.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic now faces either seventh-seeded Greek Stefano Tsitsipas or American 12th seeded Taylor Fritz in the last 8.</p>
