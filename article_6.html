            <p>Canberra Raiders pair Hudson Young and Morgan Smithies have apologised for a Las Vegas hotel "scuffle" that briefly saw them both kicked out of the premises.</p>
        
            <p>The two international stars became involved in an altercation with each other after a night out last week, when a hotel mix-up left one of them without a room.</p>
        
            <p>Hotel security was called and briefly removed the duo.</p>
        
            <p>Young and Smithies have fronted the media in Las Vegas to explain the incident and offer apologies.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to apologise for the actions on Thursday night. It wasn't good enough," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"The NRL invests so much time and effort into this game. It's such a great space to be a part of here in Vegas and a great spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>"We came back after a night out on Thursday and there was an issue with the room.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a scuffle in the elevator, nothing in the hallways.</p>
        
            <p>"We came back as a team and one of the boys had got a toy baseball bat somewhere. That was mistaken as a weapon in the elevator but it played no role."</p>
        
            <p>Young and Smithies have been sanctioned by the Raiders but will not be stood down for the weekend's game.</p>
        
            <p>"Things got a bit out of hand on Thursday night," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy to move on. I'm embarrassed for myself, our teammates and the NRL."</p>

            <p>"We've dealt with it internally as a club. Sticky's [coach Ricky Stuart] been on the front foot and everything has been dealt with."</p>
        
            <p>Young explained he and Smithies are close friends, as are their respective partners who are currently travelling through the US together.</p>
        
            <p>"I spoke to my partner but there was nothing to say because we're best mates. It was honestly nothing," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was at mine for Christmas and our partners are travelling America at the moment, so there's no issues there.</p>
        
            <p>"We're so close as a team and me and Morgan are really good mates. Everyone knows that.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel awful, especially for my family as well. It's a massive thing for them coming over here and they have to deal with this as well."</p>
        
            <p>The Raiders play the Warriors in Las Vegas on Sunday afternoon to kick off their 2025 NRL season.</p>
