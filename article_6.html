            <p>New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra pumped his fists and flashed a big smile to acknowledge the loud applause that followed his century in the first test against India, as adoring Bengaluru fans celebrated like he was one of their own.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old had every reason to soak up the adulation after almost single-handedly defying India with a wide array of strokes in his knock of 134, helping New Zealand post 402 for a lead of 356 after they skittled the hosts for 46 on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>When his milestone came, it was a rare display of emotion from the usually reserved Ravindra, whose 137-run partnership with Tim Southee threatened to take the game away from India before the hosts reached 231-3 at stumps.</p>
        
            <p>"Very uncharacteristic," Ravindra told reporters about his effervescent celebration after sweeping Ravichandran Ashwin for a boundary to get to his ton.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know, the fist pump doesn't happen often with me but I guess scoring an overseas 100 in India is always nice but also in the context of it, we had lost a few wickets and we built a pretty cool partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"To me that's special, more than just the milestone but being able to do it with teammates ... when the game is in the balance meant a lot and it felt really good to share with my mate Timmy."</p>
        
            <p>Born in Wellington to parents hailing from Bengaluru, the mop-haired left-hander emerged as a big crowd favourite in India when he played for the Black Caps in last year's 50-overs World Cup and for Chennai in this season's Indian Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra said it was especially rewarding to get his hundred with his dad watching from the stands.</p>
        
            <p>"It's massive. A lot of my family were watching the match, probably at the stadium and at home on TV," Ravindra said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know they're very proud and it makes me happy that they were able to watch a relative play in their hometown. It's just very cool. I know Dad and Mum will be very proud.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm 100 percent Kiwi but it's nice to have that Indian heritage here in Bengaluru."</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra, who made 108 against Pakistan at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium at last year's World Cup, said his familiarity with the conditions had helped him handle the pressure.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely settled the nerves," Ravindra added.</p>
        
            <p>"You're always going to be nervous when you come out to bat, especially in a test in India against India. But having success here in the past definitely helped me a lot."</p>
        
            <p>At stumps on day three the Black Caps have a 125 run lead.</p>
