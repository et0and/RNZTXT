        <h2>Paris Olympics: Confidence boost for kayaker Finn Butcher</h2>
        <p>
Stepping on a World Cup podium is nice, but in the long run is doesn't mean a lot to New Zealand Canoe slalom paddler Finn Butcher.

            <p>Stepping on a World Cup podium is nice, but in the long run is doesn't mean a lot to New Zealand Canoe slalom paddler Finn Butcher.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher is in Europe preparing for his first Olympics and last weekend took the opening World Cup event by storm by picking up two medals.</p>
        
            <p>The 29 year old from Alexandra grabbed silver in the men's K1 kayak event in Germany and then followed that up with a bronze in the kayak cross final.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always known I can be in the medals, but it's good to see it in the flesh," Butcher told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably doesn't do too much as I'll still approach every race wanting to do the best run I can and see where that puts me. It's just confidence really, and it can only be good."</p>
        
            <p>Butcher won a silver medal in the kayak cross at the 2021 World Championships, but hasn't regularly contended for medals.</p>
        
            <p>Last year in slalom he just missed the finals at a couple of World Cups, but did manage second place in the cross event in France in October.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew I had the pace to be in the finals. I put in plenty of work over the summer and did well in the local comps.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just been working hard on everything, really. Not a lot has changed, but I now have the confidence that I can do it."</p>

            <p>"I'm just really enjoying it and have a great team around me," Butcher said.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher will only race the K1 slalom at the second World Cup event in Prague this weekend, but will compete in both in the third event in Poland.</p>
        
            <p>While those next two events are important, Butcher says they're firmly set on Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"Our training and the programme is aligned to build up to that, so we're not really peaking for these. However, they are a really good opportunity to practice both the mental and tactical strategies that we need when we get to Games time.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be my first Games, so I'm trying to create as many scenarios as possible and make sure that when I get to Paris I know what to expect and have a lot of trust in what we're doing."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow New Zealander Luuka Jones will also compete in Prague this weekend.</p>
