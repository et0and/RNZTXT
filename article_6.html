        <h2>Black Caps on the ropes against Australia</h2>
        <p>

            <p>The Black Caps are in serious strife at the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Trailing by 217, New Zealand was dismissed for 179 in their first innings on day two of the first test against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Australia opted not to enforce the follow on and build on their 205-run lead.</p>
        
            <p>Some late strikes for the kiwis offered some hope for the hosts, though a dropped catch form the last ball of the day summed things up for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee clean bowled Steve Smith for a duck before sending Marnus Labuschagne back to the pavilion for 2.</p>
        
            <p>Southee had the chance to seal the final session with a third, but spilled the opportunity at slip off the bowling of Matt Henry.</p>
        
            <p>It was only an entertaining Henry cameo and a fighting fifty from Glenn Phillips which ensured the Black Caps avoided a complete calamity in their first turn at bat.</p>
        
            <p>The explosive middle order batter plundered 13 fours in his innings of 71 from 70, with Tom Blundell also offering some resistance with 33 and Henry chipping in with a quick-fire 42.</p>

            <p>However, the damage had well and truly been done, every Australian bowler used getting in on the wickets, with Nathan Lyon claiming four for 43.</p>
        
            <p>Losing eight wickets in less than two sessions and surviving only 43 overs against the Aussie attack is a huge concern for the kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips told TVNZ he and Henry reassessed the situation in the middle.</p>
        
            <p>"It was about understanding that the pitch was moving around, they were hitting really good areas and we just needed to put pressure back on them. So</p>
        
            <p>to be able to come out and counter attack and give ourselves some momentum was good."</p>
        
            <p>It's been a rough day for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing Australia's first innings total of 383, New Zealand were soon reduced to 12-3 with Tom Latham out for five and Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra both dismissed for ducks.</p>
        
            <p>In trying to get off the mark Williamson had a mid-pitch collision with teammate Will Young and was run out from a direct hit.</p>
        
            <p>In the first session Australia posted a record tenth wicket partnership against New Zealand in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Resuming on day two at 279-9, Cameron Green and Josh Hazelwood put on 116 for the last wicket with Hazelwood the last batter out making 22 and Green finishing unbeaten on 174 - his highest test score.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Henry was the most successful of the New Zealand bowlers with 5 for 70.</p>
        
            <p>Will O'Rourke and Scott Kuggeleijn took 2-87 and 2-70 respectively while Rachin Ravindra took 1-24.</p>
        
            <p>There were 41 extras in Australia's total which will be of concern to the Black Caps with 20 of these being wides.</p>
        
            <p>Day three gets underway at 11am tomorrow.</p>
