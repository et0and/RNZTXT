            <p>A directive from dad, encouragement from a Black Ferns legend and a bit of sibling rivalry have helped Maama Vaipulu fast track her transition from a volleyball player to a Black Fern.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old lock is one of five players to secure their first Black Ferns' contract this year.</p>
        
            <p>In the span of four years Vaipulu has gone from wanting to play volleyball at the Olympics to picking up an oval ball with purpose to becoming a professional rugby player.</p>
        
            <p>It is a sequence of events she didn't anticipate and is still coming to terms with.</p>
        
            <p>Others identified Vaipulu's talent before it clicked with her.</p>
        
            <p>Vaipulu's dad was one of the first to push her towards the rugby field rather than the volleyball court.</p>
        
            <p>"My dad kind of forced me to keep playing. I wasn't really looking to make this a career; I just did it for the fun of it in high school and then in club but I took more interest in volleyball because I really love that sport and my sisters were playing as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It just came down to a decision for me to pick which one I should just focus on and I talked about it with my parents and my coaches and they said there are more opportunities in rugby so I should choose that and I didn't mind leaving volleyball because I really enjoy playing rugby right now."</p>
        
            <p>She knows now her dad was on the right track.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so glad that he kept telling me to keep going and the things that you hate you'll learn to love."</p>

            <p>Vaipulu is among a new generation of Black Ferns who have been exposed to the Super Rugby Aupiki pathway to the black jersey.</p>
        
            <p>Women's Super Rugby has been around as long as the sport has been on Vaipulu's radar - which isn't long.</p>
        
            <p>She struggles to comprehend that her mentors, like four-time Rugby World Cup winner Anna Richards, would have been selected for national honours from their club or provincial side.</p>
        
            <p>Vaipulu won the Super Rugby Aupiki final this month but she hasn't always been a locked in starter for the Blues women.</p>
        
            <p>She made her debut for the Blues in 2023 after a standout season with the Auckland Storm in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year I got a few minutes [in Aupiki] but I didn't get much and I'd been trying to work on my game to get better so that I got more minutes this season and I've been playing nearly a full game."</p>
        
            <p>Richards, who works with the Storm, has played a key role in Vaipulu sticking with rugby when she was unsure what her future in the game would be.</p>
        
            <p>"She noticed me in my under-18s' trial for Auckland and she's been one of my biggest supporters ever since and she's been encouraging me to keep going she saw potential in me and I [wondered] what does she see.</p>
        
            <p>"She's always been there telling me you're working so hard and they see you."</p>

            <p>Black Ferns coach Allan Bunting did see her last season when she played in a Black Ferns XV side against Samoa. He pinpointed Vaipulu's physicality as something that would be of value to the national side.</p>
        
            <p>Before Vaipulu arrived at College Rifles where she has been cemented in the forward pack, she played rugby for Aoere College and featured across the park.</p>
        
            <p>"My first position ever playing in school was centre which was weird and then Year 12 I went to the forwards so I was playing in the back and the forwards at the same time. That's how school rugby was; it was so all over the place and then when I came to club lock was my position and it has been ever since.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still learning [lock] and how to execute it but I'd also love to learn what the loosies do because you never know, maybe if I get even fitter I could probably transition into that."</p>

            <p>When it comes to club rugby her older brother Kali also plays lock in a College Rifles side and they train together.</p>
        
            <p>"We kinda compete with each other to see who is better. He's bigger but I think I'm fitter than he is.</p>
        
            <p>"We always butt heads I think that's just sibling rivalry."</p>
        
            <p>Vaipulu only gave up volleyball this year and says she "low key" misses it. "I had to let it go."</p>
        
            <p>But her future as a Black Fern is where her focus is now.</p>
        
            <p>Shifting north to Wellington to pursue Super Rugby for the season, paid dividends for Hurricanes Poua first five-eighth Hannah King.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old thrived in the Hurricanes Poua environment and became a notable standout for the side before picking up her first Black Ferns' contract.</p>
        
            <p>With a dominant performance in the Super Rugby Aupiki final, Blues halfback Kahlia Awa has made every post a winner in the past 12 months and will be hoping to add to her highlights reel in a black jersey. Alongside Awa, diligent halfback and first five-eighth Maia Joseph, also secures her first contract having been on the radar of Black Ferns' selectors for some time.</p>

            <p>Joseph's Matatū teammate, hooker Atlanta Lolohea, is also set to make the step up.</p>
        
            <p>Bunting was impressed with the competitiveness and potential of the five newly contracted players.</p>
        
            <p>"It is exciting to be able to see the growth we have building in our game at the moment. While it makes for a tough selection, it gives us an opportunity to expose more talent to the international stage in specific areas we are looking at moving into the future and towards Rugby World Cup 2025. These new players have really stood out consistently in their own way across Sky Super Rugby Aupiki that has been apparent in the way they hold themselves on and off the field.</p>
        
            <p>"It is an exciting opportunity for them to come on this journey and look to continue their growth both on and off the field. The future of our internal competition is exciting to see."</p>
        
            <p>While there is a youthful look to the 2024 contracted group, a talented group of experienced players who have already had the privilege of wearing the black jersey also return to the contracted group. Prominent Blues prop Aldora Itunu, newly converted prop Marcelle Parkes (Matatū), loose forward Kaipo Olsen-Baker (Matatū) and powerful midfielder Monica Tagoai (Hurricanes Poua) all return to the Black Ferns' environment.</p>

            <p>"We are pleased to be able to welcome back these experienced players into our environment. Their perseverance, physical presence and ability to impact games has been evident. They have been standouts for their respective teams during Super Rugby Aupiki and we are excited to see what they bring to the environment," Bunting said.</p>
        
            <p>Phillipa Love, Liv McGoverne and Mia Anderson will join the Black Ferns squad on interim contracts as injury cover. One additional full-time contract is still be confirmed.</p>
