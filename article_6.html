            <p>The Wellington Phoenix are losing an "ultimate pro" as Michaela Foster chases an opportunity overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Foster played two seasons in the women's A-League competition with the Phoenix after first joining on a scholarship contract.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns fullback made a total of 38 appearances for the Phoenix, scoring two goals and setting up six others.</p>
        
            <p>Foster starred during the 2022-23 season, starting all 18 matches and she dominated the club's end of season awards night; named the women's player of the year, players' player of the year, members' player of the year and media player of the year.</p>
        
            <p>She was again one of the team's best performers last season and showcased her versatility by playing as a centre back, wing back and midfielder as well as her usual fullback spot.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Paul Temple had mixed emotions about Foster's departure.</p>
        
            <p>"Selfishly I'm disappointed Mickey won't be playing for the Nix this season," Temple said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm also excited because I know she's ready to take the next step in her football career.</p>
        
            <p>"Mickey's established herself as one of the best fullbacks in the A-League in just two years. She's reliable, smart and composed, I've never actually seen her flustered, and she's the ultimate pro.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure she'll be a success wherever she lands and her new team will be better for having Michaela Foster in their XI."</p>
