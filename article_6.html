            <p>UFC 313</p>
        
            <p>Chama. No two syllables have ever evoked more fear throughout the combat sports world. It's the war cry of Poatan, the UFC light heavyweight champion, Alex Pereira.</p>
        
            <p>The Brazilian has been on a war path since his entry into the UFC, leaving a trail of carnage in his wake, winning gold in two divisions and currently seeking a fourth successive defence at 205.</p>
        
            <p>However, a destructive Dagestani force now awaits him in the form of Magomed Ankalaev at UFC 313's main event, a Russian wrestler who prefers to put opponents to sleep with his fists.</p>
        
            <p>Unbeaten in 13 fights, his sole loss came by way of a miracle final second submission seven years ago. It's the toughest test to date for the champion, as the most feared fighter in the game meets the boogeyman of light heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Alex 'Poatan' Pereira - champion</p>
        
            <p>Fighting style - A kickboxer, with ungodly striking power, Pereira utilises leg and body kicks to break down opponents before hunting for the killer shot, more often than not, his vicious left hook.</p>
        
            <p>Magomed Ankalaev - challenger</p>
        
            <p>Fighting style - An exceptionally well-rounded fighter with a dangerous stand up game, boasting ten knockouts in his career, though as with most Russian fighters, his base is in elite wrestling. Ankalaev has vowed however not to shoot for a takedown, and promises to knockout the Brazilian phenom.</p>
        
            <p>The rivalry - When Pereira's last title defence was booked against 'the War Horse' there was a collective groan from the MMA community questioning why Ankalaev was not next in line. Meanwhile, Ankalaev was sure to remind Poatan he was waiting. "Alex, stop running away from me."</p>
        
            <p>Poatan is proving one of the most active champions in recent history, his last defence, a cerebral and destructive dismantling of Kahil Roundtree Jnr. Roundtree was game for a stand up war throughout four rounds, but he would eventually crumble under the relentless pressure from Poatan.</p>
        
            <p>Ankalaev's last bout was a unanimous decision victory over Aleksandar Rakić in October, peppering his opponent with crisp straight lefts to cruise to a comfortable 29-28 win following an emphatic knockout of Johnny Walker earlier in the year.</p>
        
            <p>Pereira - "Ankalaev talks to much, I'm focussed on what I have to do."</p>
        
            <p>Ankalaev - "I'm going to punish him for ducking me. He knows it's not an easy fight for him. He knows it. he feels it. No more talking. Just fighting"</p>
        
            <p>Both men possess tremendous fight ending power in their hands and should Ankalaev stay true to his word and keep things on the feet, one perfect shot could shut either man's lights off. With the surge of momentum at his back, the champion should eventually overwhelm Angalaev.</p>
        
            <p>Prediction - Perira by round three TKO.</p>
        
            <p>An exhibition of violence is all but guaranteed in the co main as Justin Gaethje and Rafael Fiziev do battle at lightweight. Kiwi Dan Hooker was initially scheduled to fight Gaethje, but was forced to pull out after suffering a broken hand in training. Fiziev steps up on short notice for his first fight in 18 months after suffering a gruesome knee injury, to meet the man who edged him by majority decision in their first meeting in 2023. Their first fight was fireworks and we are no doubt set for another banger between these brawlers on Sunday.</p>
