            <p>Golfer Lydia Ko goes into the LPGA Tour season-ending tournament with a new attitude having failed to qualify for the event last year.</p>
        
            <p>The $11 million (NZ$18.7m) Tour Championship is the richest event on tour with the top 60 qualifiers entered.</p>
        
            <p>Ko had a remarkable 2024, winning Olympic gold, claiming her third major title and becoming eligible for the Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>However 2023 didn't go so well for the Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>She won the Saudi Ladies International in Saudi Arabia early in the year but didn't have any success on the LPGA tour and her low ranking meant she failed to qualify for the Tour Championship.</p>
        
            <p>She did team up with Australian Jason Day to win a teams event in December.</p>
        
            <p>"Before not making it into this event last year I think I took for granted that I always finish the season at the CME Tour Championship," Ko said in her pre-event media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year I thought the level of competition is so much higher and I literally need to work my butt off to make sure I'm qualified.</p>
        
            <p>"So my mindset is a little bit different that it's not automatic entry into this event just because you won the year before."</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old started 2024 with a win, but wasn't entirely happy with her form until the Canadian Open in July, just before she headed to Europe for the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"It was never super easy for me (this year) but I think the Canadian Open was a big help as I hadn't had a top ten in a couple of months.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt a lot more comfortable (with my game) and it was probably just one event or one round that puts that confidence back.</p>
        
            <p>"I just got fortunate that I peaked at the right time."</p>

            <p>The rest is history as Ko went on to complete her Olympic medal set with victory in Paris and then two weeks later won her first (British) Open Championship title.</p>
        
            <p>That meant she then became eligible for the Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a fairy tale season."</p>
        
            <p>Ko is now hoping to peak again this week after having a good weekend at the last tournament where she finished tied for 14th.</p>
        
            <p>"I love playing in Florida, it would be great to finish strong.</p>
        
            <p>"It's special to be able to play well in front of your sponsors and hopefully my solid stuff last weekend translates well into a few good rounds this week."</p>
