            <p>Gaël Monfils has once again put on a display of his almost peerless experience on the ATP tour, winning the first ASB Classic men's singles semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>His 7(7)-6 6-4 win over Nishesh Basavareddy was a clinical one, as the French veteran's incremental improvements through the tournament were paying off in a big way.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this being Basavareddy's first ever ATP semi-final in only his second tournament, the 19-year-old presented a serious challenge to Monfils.</p>
        
            <p>The American world number 133 had been incredibly impressive after coming through qualifying, knocking out defending champion and number two seed Alejandro Tabilo in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>So it was no surprise that both men held serve throughout the first set, with Basavareddy intent on making the 38-year-old Monfils run as much as possible.</p>
        
            <p>He found good success with his drop shot, however it wasn't enough to get a crucial break, by the tie breaker Monfils had become wise and was anticipating it beautifully.</p>
        
            <p>All it took was one slip up by Basavareddy in the tie break for Monfils to pounce and take the set.</p>
        
            <p>The second set was just as close, although again Basavareddy left the door open at 4-4 and Monfils needed no further invitation to take the break and before the American knew it, the match was done.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody knows I'm a warhorse on the court, I don't give up easy," Monfils said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very pleased with the way I got through today, it wasn't easy. His service game was good…I think the turning point was when I was 0-40 and I hit five great returns. Today was crazy tough."</p>
        
            <p>He had certainly won a lot of respect during the week, and it was safe to say his name could be added to the list of exciting new American players rising up the ranks.</p>

            <p>"It's super cool to be playing against a guy like Gaël in my first semi, and in front of all these fans," Basavareddy said post-match.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a lot of looks in the first set…he came up with some good shots and was just better on the bigger points. I'll learn from that."</p>
        
            <p>It was a great run so far for Monfils, who at 38 became the second oldest ATP finalist ever after Croatian Ivo Karlović who made the Mahastra Open final in 2019 aged 39.</p>
        
            <p>Karlović lost that final, so Monfils could make history as the oldest winner on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The ASB Classic had certainly got their money's worth out of Monfils's family lately, with wife and world number 23 Elina Svitolina making the final of the women's singles last year.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils will face the winner of Zizou Bergs and seventh seed Nuno Borges in Saturday's final, which will take place at around 2pm.</p>
