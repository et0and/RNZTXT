            <p>The Black Caps have won the first One Day International against Bangladesh by 44 runs in a rain reduced match in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were put in to bat first but rain interruptions meant the match was reduced to 30 overs and the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method came in to play.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps were five for two at the end of the first over but recovered well to build a strong platform for some big hitting in the final overs.</p>
        
            <p>Will Young made 104, his third ODI century, which went a long way towards New Zealand's 239 for 7.</p>
        
            <p>Young later took a spectacular catch on the boundary and earned player of the match honours.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand bowlers were able to pick up Bangladesh wickets at regular intervals and the equation got too tough for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh were searching for their first ODI win against the Black Caps in New Zealand in 17 attempts.</p>
        
            <p>The second ODI is in Nelson on Wednesday.</p>
