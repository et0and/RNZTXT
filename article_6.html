            <p>Black Caps opening batter Devon Conway will miss the first test against Australia starting tomorrow in Wellington having not recovered from a thumb injury.</p>
        
            <p>Conway suffered the injury while wicketkeeping in the second T20 against Australia at Edern Park on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to rule Conway out was made following additional scans which revealed damage to his left thumb.</p>
        
            <p>He'll have further treatment over the week to ascertain the extent of the injury and the final diagnosis.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury batter Henry Nicholls has been called into the squad as batting cover however Will Young is likely to replace Conway in the lineup as he's already part of the test squad.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Gary Stead said the team was feeling for Conway.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disappointing for Devon to be ruled out on the eve of an important match," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a class player batting at the top of the order for us and I know he was really looking forward to this series."</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to have a player of Henry's calibre to call on He has plenty of Test experience and covers a number of positions in our batting order."</p>
