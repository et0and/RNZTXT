            <p>Today is 70 years since New Zealand set an unwanted record in men's test cricket - one the country can't shake.</p>
        
            <p>Against England, at Auckland's Eden Park, the home side was bowled out for just 26.</p>
        
            <p>Teams have threatened to go lower since, but nobody can match the depths New Zealand reached on 28 March 1955.</p>
        
            <p>Radio listeners who tuned into the NZBC later in the day were greeted with the rounded vowels of British broadcaster Corbet Woodall, who said the New Zealanders covered themselves in glory for most of the match.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a good match in many more ways than one, although this extremely unexpected and dramatic finish has robbed New Zealand of a good deal of credit for which they certainly earned themselves during the first two days."</p>
        
            <p>
The Press newspaper didn't seem to hit the New Zealanders too hard the next day. They even inserted a random reference to the West Indies.

            <p>At that stage, New Zealand had never won a test but for most of the day - the third of the test - cricket supporters would have thought they were in with a shot as England gained only a slender lead on the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's team included all-time greats such as Bert Sutcliffe and John R Reid, but the amateur team was no match for England's professionals and their expert bowling attack.</p>
        
            <p>Reid, who died in 2020, spoke to RNZ in 2015 about the match.</p>
        
            <p>"We played top-rated players all the time so we got used to coming second, probably, but you've got to do as well as you can, and you just try," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't think we'd be bowled out for 26. Can I whisper that?"</p>
        
            <p>The English team was full of famous names of the time, such as captain Len Hutton, Colin Cowdrey, Frank Tyson, Godfrey Evans and more.</p>
        
            <p>Up against them, New Zealand didn't cope well, batsman Matt Poore told Sky TV in the early 2000s.</p>
        
            <p>"All out for 26, second innings - a dreadful exhibition of batting by myself. I think four of us, or five, got pairs."</p>
        
            <p>A pair is zero in each innings.</p>
        
            <p>Wicket keeper Ian Colquhoun was part of that club. Twice out first ball, he never played for New Zealand again.</p>
        
            <p>Nobody from the match is alive today, but for respected long-time cricket broadcaster Bryan Waddle, the test stands out.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it's one of my earliest memories of test cricket as a young boy that New Zealand has an unwanted record and it has stood for that length of time.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been tested on a couple of occasions. New Zealand dismissed England for 58 in a test match in Auckland and at one stage they were 24 for the loss of 8, so that record was in danger of going at that stage."</p>
        
            <p>In danger, yes, but it's something New Zealand can't shake, despite the country's success through the 1980s and in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Waddle isn't sure we'll ever get rid of it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a possibility but it seems unlikely, but the way games have been going it is a possibility. New Zealand had India out for 46 in a recent test match.</p>
        
            <p>"There are occasions when sides have really been struggling to get their innings under way."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand made 200 batting first, England replied with 246 and then New Zealand collapsed.</p>
        
            <p>There were even reports of fans flying from other parts of the country to see a fight, only to arrive when it was all over.</p>
        
            <p>Reid said in 2015 the team had a tough time in the press after the defeat, and among themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"[We were] depressed like you wouldn't believe, because we knew we were better than that. Bert Sutcliffe was the only one who got any runs, I still remember that.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't remember much else and I don't want to remember much else."</p>
        
            <p>Sutcliffe top scored with 11.</p>
        
            <p>Waddle said team members had to live with the defeat in coming years.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew John Reid very well and also had plenty of time with Bert Sutcliffe over the years when he was playing in the international game here. They were embarrassed by the situation, but it was something they couldn't do anything about."</p>
        
            <p>A year later, there was quite the turnaround.</p>
        
            <p>Also at Eden Park, under Reid's captaincy, New Zealand beat the West Indies, the country's first test win after 26 years of trying.</p>
        
            <p>During his post-match speech Reid was drowned out with a rousing three cheers.</p>
