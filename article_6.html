        <h2>Wellington Phoenix ready to bounce back from costly error</h2>
        <p>
Wellington Phoenix players are "massively" disappointed an uncharacteristic defensive error contributed to loss that knocked them off the top of the A-League.

            <p>The Wellington Phoenix's fight to get back on top of the A-League table starts at home on Friday against third-placed Melbourne Victory but there is a lingering disappointment among the players that they are in this position to begin with.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix had lost four of their 24 games played so far this season, however, the 2-1 defeat to the Central Coast Mariners on Saturday hurt the most according to midfielder Ben Old.</p>
        
            <p>The Mariners scored the winner in the 91st minute of the top of the table clash to drop the Phoenix back into second place. The goal came from an "uncharacteristic" defensive error by the Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>Old scored for the Phoenix in the 78th minute and wished he could have done more.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have loved to be able to draw that game or I thought we could even have won it after scoring that goal I thought we had a bit of momentum for a bit but to their credit they scored a very good goal and we've reflected on it and there were many ways we could've stopped that goal from going in but that happens in football and we haven't had that this season where we've conceded late on so it obviously hurts a lot especially because it is against Central Coast."</p>
        
            <p>Fullback Tim Payne said it was "massively" disappointing to finish his first game back from injury in that manner.</p>
        
            <p>"To lose in the final minute is never enjoyable... we'll learn from that mistake by a collective in the defending group to not block that shot and hopefully not make those mistakes towards the important part of the season."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix have three games remaining in the regular season, including two at home in Wellington. The Mariners - who shape up as their biggest rivals for the Premiers Plate awarded to the top side after the regular season - have a tougher run which also includes a trip to Kyrgyzstan to play in the AFC Cup.</p>

            <p>Both the Phoenix and Mariners are on the same A-League competition points but the Mariners take top spot courtesy of an additional win this season.</p>
        
            <p>Old saw the Mariners extra AFC Cup games this month as an advantage for a Phoenix side chasing their first piece of silverware.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got a lot of games coming up with not a lot of time to rest so obviously going to be hard [for] them, they're playing against teams which are very on-form even if they're down lower on the table."</p>
        
            <p>Old was confident the Phoenix would get back to winning ways against Victory.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard coming off a loss but I think this team is very resilient and we haven't lost two games in a row and I think that is a credit to our resilience to be able to bounce back from mistakes."</p>
        
            <p>Payne has warned the Mariners should the two sides meet again this season that the Phoenix will not have forgotten how their last match-up ended.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably fuels a little bit of fire if we come against them in the Finals Series to get one back on them.</p>
        
            <p>"But hopefully leading into the rest of the season we can learn from winning games and making mistakes that don't cost us points."</p>
