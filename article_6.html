        <h2>No cold feet for Shaun Johnson after emotional farewell</h2>
        <p>
Asked if he had any second thoughts about retiring, he said, "F*** no. I am so sore right now. I can't remember being this busted".

            <p>Shaun Johnson's daughter Millah exclaimed she wanted to go home as he gave his final interview as a Warrior on Friday night in the Mount Smart changing sheds.</p>
        
            <p>She was done with the emotional farewell, ready for dad to walk away, and so was Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he had any second thoughts about his retirement decision, the Prince of Penrose didn't hesitate.</p>
        
            <p>"F*** no. I am so sore right now. I can't remember being this busted."</p>
        
            <p>The final chapter of the Johnson story was scripted like much of his 10-year-career with the Warriors - beginning with promise, but ending in heartache with a 34-18 loss to the Bulldogs.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson conceded that it had been a tough year.</p>
        
            <p>"People can say what they want about the decision, but ultimately I'm so content with it. I would have loved to win tonight and that's probably the only disappointment that I feel, it sucks not winning, but it is what it is. I've still got so much to smile about, that's certainly what i'll focus on."</p>
        
            <p>'Magic' Johnson was given an entrance worthy of his nickname, emerging to near 25,000 fans on their feet as he fought back tears with his family by his side.</p>
        
            <p>"Emotional, f*** it hit me aye, I didn't know what was going on as you could tell because I dropped the ball in the first set. But having all the people who have played such a massive part in my career here, it's meant the world to me."</p>

            <p>The adoration for Johnson embarrassed him at times, with the stadium temporarily named after the Warriors wizard for last night's match.</p>
        
            <p>"They said it enough, like man, you can calm down with it now, we get it," he joked.</p>
        
            <p>"We never play this game thinking you will have things like that happen to you. It's just surreal, something I will never forget."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson admitted he did not feel anywhere near the player he was capable of, which made the decision to walk away an easier one.</p>
        
            <p>The former Golden Boot winner was still coming to terms with the impact he has had on so many.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually don't know what to say about it, it's a crazy position to be in when you get people so passionate about you. I wish I could have got to everyone around the whole stadium."</p>
        
            <p>In another touching tribute, a starstruck little girl gifted her hero a children's book she had helped write and illustrate.</p>
        
            <p>"It's little things like that, I just still can't believe people feel the way they feel about me. I will read that to my daughters, and hopefully they remember moments like this, if not I will be pulling up YouTube and reminding them that daddy was once cool."</p>
        
            <p>But no cold feet for Johnson, though they may have been slightly chilly as he walked off Mount Smart for the last time having given his boots to a young fan.</p>
