        <h2>Bledisloe II: What you need to know</h2>
        <p>
Why this one is so important for Scott Robertson's All Blacks.
</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks v Wallabies</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7.05pm Saturday 28 September NZT</p>
        
            <p>Sky Stadium, Wellington</p>

            <p>It is fair to say that things did not quite go according to plan last weekend in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Yes, the All Blacks locked up the Bledisloe Cup with a 31-28 win, but everyone in attendance at Accor Stadium and watching the game on TV knew full well it shouldn't have been that close.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks were up 21-0 after only 15 minutes, so the eventual margin said a lot about the Wallabies' heart and attacking ability that they were able to pull back the score. But it also said a lot about the All Blacks' worrying inability to get points at the back end of test matches.</p>
        
            <p>That's the main talking point going into the weekend at Sky Stadium. Here's a few more:</p>
        
            <p>It's unlikely Scott Robertson will roll the dice at all, because it was all looking fantastic for the first part of the Sydney test. He just needs to get the message through that rugby games go for 80 minutes, or at least the need to keep scoring points generally does.</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure, though: Jordie Barrett is out, which will necessitate a straight swap with Anton Lienert-Brown and a call up for hometown boy Billy Proctor on the bench you'd think.</p>

            <p>One selection that's already been foreshadowed thanks to his media appearance on Tuesday is that of Sam Cane.</p>
        
            <p>The former skipper will play his 100th test at Sky Stadium, after a surprise recall and large role in the All Black season so far in 2024. It'll be an emotional one for Cane, whose career seemed likely to have finished with a red card in last year's World Cup final.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, it's unlikely wholesale changes are coming for the Wallabies either, although it is understood that Joe Schmidt is set to axe Marika Koroibete and give impressive Waratahs wing Dylan Pietsch a start.</p>
        
            <p>There was plenty to like from their forward effort that garnered an astounding 80 percent possession in the last 15 minutes, most notably from exceptional flanker Fraser McReight.</p>

            <p>Much was made about the 25,000-strong crowd at Sky Stadium for the Pumas' shock 38-30 win in the opening Rugby Championship test, unfortunately most of it by people that don't know much about rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Sky Stadium put up the sold out signs weeks ago for this Bledisloe Cup match, so it seems that Wellington's current economic issues are a bit more complicated than simply pointing to some empty yellow seats.</p>
        
            <p>There is quite a bit on the line now, results-wise. With a tough end of year tour coming up, Robertson simply can't afford to drop this one or he's going to start getting compared to the last man in his job.</p>
        
            <p>Ian Foster's reign saw a four loss, one draw season in 2022 - enough to effectively cost him his job.</p>

            <p>Another loss can't really be tolerated for Wellington itself, because the tongue-in-cheek comments about not holding tests there will definitely become more serious.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks haven't won at Sky Stadium since 2018, with another loss the season before, making it easily the worst venue for results ever over that period of time the All Blacks have ever played at.</p>
