            <p>Despite three late tries to flatter the scoreline, the Chiefs have held off a late Highlanders surge to survive 28-21 in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Almost letting the game slip in the final quarter, the Chiefs repelled the last minute attack to pick up their fourth win of the season.</p>
        
            <p>It took just five minutes for the Chiefs to strike through a slick backline move, Shaun Stevenson sucking in three defenders and flicking it on to Daniel Rona to finish strongly in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>A dangerous Chiefs attack, set up by a storming run by prop Reuben O'Neill was illegally halted at the ruck, Timoci Tavatavanawai sent to the bin.</p>

            <p>The hosts took immediate advantage and backpedaled the Highlanders maul, Bradley Slater rumbling over the line.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders enjoyed a sustained period on attack but were unable to cross the chalk, Billy Harmon pushed into touch trying to score in the corner and Folau Fakatava knocking on at the back of a ruck in prime attacking position.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie eventually relieved the pressure, forcing a line drop out which created a chance for Cortez Ratima to score from a deft chip ahead by Lachlan Boshier, only for some desperate Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens defence preventing the livewire halfback.</p>
        
            <p>Things went from bad to wore for the southerners, Tanielu Tele'a yellow carded for shoulder to head contact and Rameka Poihipi exploiting the gap left at centre to score under the sticks as the Chiefs took a 21-0 half-time lead.</p>
        
            <p>Tele'a's yellow was upgraded to red leaving the visitors short a man for the next twenty minutes, while Naitoa Ah Kuoi made a strong impact off the bench with a pilfer and line break in quick succession.</p>
        
            <p>His locking partner appeared to have created the fourth with a barnstorming break up the centre of the back to send Bohier in, only for the try to be scrubbed due to an earlier knock on.</p>
        
            <p>They wouldn't need to wait long though, McKenzie setting off down the blind and finding Cortez Raima inside who stood up his opposite Folau Fakatava to score.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders would finally get on the board in the 60th minute, Tavatavanawai making up for his earlier indiscretion as he muscled his way over the line.</p>
        
            <p>They went back to back following some superb work from Jona Nareki, setting away Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens for the visitor's second.</p>
        
            <p>A dubious third followed, Nikora Broughton as the Highlanders flanker appeared to knock on but the TMO awarded the try to bring the Highlanders to give them some late hope.</p>
        
            <p>They would hammer away in the final moments, only for another error to cost them a chance at golden point and an end to their derby drought.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 28 (Rona, Slater, Poihipi, Ratima, tries, McKenzie 4 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders 21 (Brougthon, Tavatavanawai, Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, Gilbert 3 cons)</p>
