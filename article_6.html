            <p>Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has secured another major snowboarding win, soaring to victory at the season-opening Snowboard Big Air World Cup event in Canada on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old from Wanaka headed off a high-qualify field in Edmonton, and pronounced herself "super stoked".</p>
        
            <p>"It's the first comp of the season for me so it feels good to go into the first one and come away with the win," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The spectacular finals took place under floodlights on a scaffold jump inside the Edmonton Commonwealth Stadium, with the crowds and entertainment creating an exciting vibe.</p>
        
            <p>The Big Air three run format requires the athletes to successfully throw down two different tricks in two different directions to be awarded a combined score out of 200.</p>
        
            <p>Reigning Big Air Olympic silver medalist Sadowski-Synnott was the top qualifier, almost 20 points ahead of her nearest rival.</p>
        
            <p>After an uncharacteristic fall in her first finals run, she calmly produced an excellent second run which secured 97.25 points - the highest of the day in both the women and men's competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been working on the switch backside 1260 for the last six months, it's a super technical and scary trick so I was super happy to put it down in competition." she said.</p>
        
            <p>Her third run scored 86.00 points, enough to clinch overall victory and provide evidence Sadowski-Synnott will be hard to topple on the World Cup circuit.</p>
        
            <p>"Managing the pressure going into run two, I knew I could land the switch back 1260 and just had my fingers crossed for the back 1080. I have done that trick a lot of times, all the girls were riding so well, and it motivated me to put it down when it mattered."</p>
        
            <p>Reigning snowboard slopestyle World Champion, 16-year-old Mia Brookes of Great Britain, finished in second place while two-time Big Air Olympic champion Anna Gasser of Austria rounded out a power-packed podium.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott has finished on the podium at every event she has contested for the past three seasons, including an Olympic slopestyle gold in Beijing last year.</p>
        
            <p>Compatriot Lyon Farrell of Arrowtown placed ninth in the men's event.</p>
