            <p>Queenstown's Alice Robinson has secured New Zealand's first alpine ski world championships medal, winning silver in the giant slalom in Austria.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old could barely contain her joy after finishing within a second of Italian winner Federica Brignone on the challenging slopes of Saalbach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing, my first world champs medal, it's so specialâ€¦ I just really wanted to go for it today, I just tried to treat today like any other race and I am really happy to have executed," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's previous best world championships results were fourth placings - to Robinson at the 2021 giant slalom in Italy and slalom skier Claudia Riegler in 1996 in Spain.</p>

            <p>Robinson was among the favourites to claim a medal, coming off victory at the most recent World Cup giant slalom race in Italy, which propelled her to the top of the World Cup series standings.</p>
        
            <p>She said conditions didn't suit her style, with clear warm, conditions creating spring-like snow conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a bit worried today because these conditions, I usually struggle with the spring snow a bit, so I am really proud of myself."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson was second after her first run, quicly finding her rhythm down a physically demanding course, 0.67 seconds behind Brignone.</p>
        
            <p>The second-last skier to complete the second run, she opened up a 1.72sec lead over the rest of the field, with just Brignone to race.</p>
        
            <p>The Italian responded brilliantly to win Italy's first gold in the event for 28 years, finishing with a final combined time of 2min 22.71sec, eclipising Robinson's 2:23.61.</p>
        
            <p>Paula Moltzan of the United States was third with 2:25.33.</p>

            <p>"In the second run I just tried to go for it and not think too much, and honestly, it didn't feel good," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was rough and I think I was pushing it so much that I felt a bit out of control so I didn't know if it was fast or not. When I saw the green light I thought maybe it was good enough for gold but Federica was amazing today."</p>
        
            <p>Brignone added gold to her silver in the super-G earlier in the championships.</p>
        
            <p>It was a sweet moment for the 34-year-old after finishing second at last year's event and also bagging silver at the 2022 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"Gold in the giant slalom is something I dreamed of throughout my career, I managed to stay calm after the first run, I knew I had a good lead," Brignone said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the world championships we know it's all or nothing, I had the opportunity to go full throttle, today I was fine, I was focused on skiing.</p>
        
            <p>"So much so that in the second run for a moment I was falling asleep and I said to myself 'move'. I'm out of breath but I was fine, I arrived at this event relaxed and at my best. I have to enjoy it as soon as it sinks in."</p>
        
            <p>Reigning champion Mikaela Shiffrin didn't compete, the American great announcing on Tuesday that she was not mentally ready, having returned to racing in January two months after a crash the left her with a puncture wound in her abdomen.</p>
