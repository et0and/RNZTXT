            <p>The Black Caps' struggles in Sri Lanka continued as they returned to earth with a four-wicket loss in the opening Twenty20.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off their historic 3-0 test series sweep of India in India, a much-changed New Zealand side struggled from the outset in Dambulla as the home side coasted to victory with an over to spare.</p>
        
            <p>It was a sharp reminder of how difficult Sri Lanka are to beat in their home conditions, with the Black Caps having been swept 2-0 in tests there before embarking on their remarkable form reversal in India.</p>
        
            <p>Their chances of opening the two-match T20 series victory slumped when Sri Lanka's spinners claimed six wickets between them to skittle New Zealand for 135 in the 20th over.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Bracewell scored 27 before Zachary Foulkes provided some late impetus with an unbeaten 27 off 16 balls after spinners Dunith Wellalage (3-20) and Nuwan Thusara (2-14) proved difficult to handle.</p>
        
            <p>On a turning track, Sri Lanka were largely in control throughout the chase, reaching 140-6 with an over to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Charith Asalanka provided a steady hand with 35 not out off 28, arriving at the crease when the chase teetered slightly at 55 for three.</p>
        
            <p>Foulkes completed a good return in just his third T20 international, taking 3-20 off three overs with his medium pacers in what were conditions far better suited to slow bowlers.</p>
        
            <p>The second and final game is also at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium on Monday morning before the teams play three ODIs.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are fielding a largely second string side, with many of their most proven players having returned home to prepare for the three-test series against England.</p>
