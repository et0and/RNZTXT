            <p>The Black Caps were looking to seal the three match ODI series with Pakistan after a high-scoring victory in Napier on Saturday, and now have an unbeatable 2-0 lead.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand reached 292/8 in their 50 overs, with Mitchell Hay scoring 99 not out, and Muhammad Abbas racking up a useful 41 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan's top order failed to fire, with none of the first five batsmen making double figures, and the visitors 72 for seven at one stage.</p>
        
            <p>Faheem Ashraf brought some respectability to the score with his 73 runs, with Naseem Shah also scoring 51 runs in the final stages.</p>
        
            <p>But Pakistan were all out for 208, giving NZ the victory by 84 runs.</p>
