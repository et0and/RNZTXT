            <p>Former Silver Ferns shooter Aliyah Dunn is returning to her southern roots to bolster the Southern Steel's attack in 2025, though the franchise will be without English star George Fisher next season.</p>
        
            <p>Dunn completes the Steel shooting trio which is spearheaded by Silver Fern Georgia Heffernan ,24, and also includes 18-year-old Summer Temu who has been promoted to a full contract after serving as a replacement player this season.</p>
        
            <p>While Dunn's signing is a boost for the Steel they have been dealt a blow with England shooter Fisher not returning to the side.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher, who has 22 Test caps for the England Roses, joined the Steel in 2021 and proved to be a lynchpin for them in the shooting end.</p>

            <p>However, she has been unable to play for the Steel for the past two seasons after a horrific knee injury ruled her out in the 2023 pre-season.</p>
        
            <p>Heffernan said she was "very excited" to continue with the Steel for a seventh campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"This franchise means a lot to me - it is home and I love being able to represent the south. I'm very excited for 2025 and the new and old faces it brings into our team," she said.</p>

            <p>Since making her ANZ Premiership debut for the Steel as a replacement player in 2017, Dunn, 24, has plied her netball trade further north, winning three titles in five years with the Pulse before switching to the Tactix in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Family proved the catalyst to finally return home to Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>"Family was definitely a big draw card for me. Both of my nans are getting older so being closer to them was important to me. I also fully understand the obsession over the first grandchild as my brother now has a one-year-old daughter and being able to see her every day is going to be the best part," Dunn said.</p>
        
            <p>She had confidence the Steel would make an impact in the league.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely excited as we have the potential to be extremely competitive next season. Steel already have a strong core group of players so I'm hoping to add what I can to the team and environment," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been involved in two high performing franchises so I'm hoping to take what I've learnt from both and add it to the Steel environment. After being out of for most of the 2024 season due to injury I'm just looking forward to actually playing some good netball, being a solid target at the back and doing whatever I can do to get better.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to working with the new shooters given I've only worked with a few and hopefully we can all learn and teach each other a few things too.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be really important to get the connections going early in pre-season as we will be a fairly new attacking end. I think once the connections and combos get there it will just be about keeping it basic - get ball and score ball."</p>
        
            <p>For Temu, it was a deserved promotion after some stellar performances when called upon.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't be happier to continue wearing the Steel colours. This franchise has already done so much for me and I can't wait to represent it again. The support from the coaches and my teammates has been incredible, and I feel like I can grow and develop my skills here," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Staying with the Steel was an easy decision for me. I've built great relationships within the team in only a short amount of time, and I love the environment. The franchise has such a rich history and a passionate fan base, and I want to be a part of that legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait to hit the court, work hard, and contribute to the team's success. The thought of being fully contracted, competing at a higher level and challenging myself excites me and I'm ready to give it my all."</p>
