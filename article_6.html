        <h2>Injuries, unavailability force White Ferns to look to future</h2>
        <p>
Missing a captain and the world's best player, the White Ferns will lean on young talent for Sri Lanka series.

            <p>While the White Ferns have gone back in time to find a captain, they are also focussing on the future with four potential debutantes named in the squads to take on Sri Lanka next month.</p>
        
            <p>Injury and unavailability has forced coach Ben Sawyer to look deeper into the New Zealand talent pool for the three ODI and three T20s.</p>
        
            <p>The recently named ICC women's cricketer of the year Amelia Kerr is unavailable for the series due to her Women's Premier League commitments with the Mumbai Indians, as the revised tournament dates coincided with the series.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Devine, who stepped down from T20 captaincy following the Women's T20 World Cup, is on a well-being break. A season-ending injury to Molly Penfold (torn meniscus) and injuries to Lea Tahuhu (hamstring) and Rosemary Mair (elbow) have ruled them out of fully participating in the Sri Lanka series.</p>

            <p>Former White Ferns captain Suzie Bates will step in to be interim captain for the series while Devine's successor is found.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Sparks captain Hayley Jensen has been named in her first White Ferns squad since 2023 after finishing as one of the Sparks top wicket-takers.</p>
        
            <p>Eighteen-year-old Central Hinds allrounder Emma McLeod, Canterbury Magicians batter Izzy Sharp (20), and Auckland Hearts seamer Bree Illing (21) have earned their maiden call up.</p>
        
            <p>The trio of talented youngsters are all former New Zealand Under-19 representatives, with McLeod having recently returned from her second ICC U19 Women's T20 World Cup, and Sharp the former captain at the inaugural tournament.</p>
        
            <p>McLeod has been selected fresh off a strong one day campaign for the Hinds averaging 42 in the Hallyburton Johnstone (HBJ) Shield, and is the among the top run-scorers in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Left-arm seamer Illing comes off a breakout domestic season following her inclusion in the New Zealand A side last year. She was the third-top wicket-taker in the HBJ Shield and had an economy rate of less than six in the domestic T20 competition despite often bowling through the powerplay.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Sparks wicketkeeper-batter Polly Inglis receives her second call up to an international squad following her inclusion in last year's ODI squad to India.</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Plimmer is set to make her return to international cricket after sustaining a bone stress reaction in her hip which has kept her sidelined since November.</p>

            <p>Otago Sparks batter Bella James, New Zealand's fourth-highest run scorer during December's Rose Bowl series, retains her ODI place and is named in her first T20I squad.</p>
        
            <p>Sawyer said the new faces were talented prospects who had been identified as having the "desired competencies and skillsets to be effective in international cricket".</p>
        
            <p>"Emma's been in good form in the HBJ Shield and her ability to hit through the off-side and run well between the wickets is really valuable.</p>
        
            <p>"Izzy impressed us with how she attacks spin, which is something that will come in handy this series.</p>
        
            <p>"The way Bree attacks the stumps and swings the ball back into the right-hander is really important in the international game."</p>
        
            <p>Sawyer stressed the importance of utilising the series to gain experience against spin with an eye to the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup in India.</p>
        
            <p>"Sri Lanka's a tough opposition with a number of world-class spinners. Facing their spin unit is always a challenge but it will be great prep for us ahead of the World Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Sawyer said he expected all players in the squad to get an opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"We will try different combinations this series, and I'm looking forward to seeing players adapt to different roles. It's an opportunity to test batters in different positions, and try different bowlers opening up and at the death."</p>
