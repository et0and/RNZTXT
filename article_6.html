        <h2>US Open becomes first major to create LIV Golf exemption</h2>
        <p>
The USGA said it was creating a direct route into the US Open for well-performing LIV Golf players in a bid to ensure the world's best players compete against each other.

            <p>The USGA has created an exemption category for LIV Golf players to compete in the US Open, making the tournament the first of golf's four majors to introduce a formal pathway for golfers on the Saudi-backed circuit.</p>
        
            <p>One spot in the 156-player field for the June 12-15 US Open in Oakmont, Pennsylvania would be awarded to a golfer who was not otherwise exempt and in the top three of the LIV Golf Individual Standings as of May 19.</p>
        
            <p>The access would increase to two players for next year's US Open at Shinnecock Hills in Southampton, New York, with leading LIV Golf players from the final 2025 individual standings and the May 18, 2026 list gaining entry.</p>
        
            <p>In both cases, the spots were for players not already exempt and among the top three in the standings.</p>
        
            <p>"The USGA continues to evaluate the pathways that exist to ensure those playing their best have the opportunity to compete in our national championship," USGA chief championships officer John Bodenhamer said.</p>
        
            <p>"Consistent with our historical approach, we continuously evaluate talent levels on professional tours and in amateur events, which has led us to add a new exemption category."</p>
        
            <p>While LIV Golf players had been eligible to play in golf's majors, there had previously been no direct pathway for them into the blue-riband events, which meant qualification was more difficult for those without previously existing exemptions.</p>
        
            <p>But last June the USGA said it would consider creating a direct route into the US Open for well-performing LIV Golf players in a bid to ensure the world's best players compete against each other.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement on Wednesday was applauded by LIV Golf.</p>
        
            <p>"Every golf fan in the world longs to see the greatest players in the world competing on golf's biggest stages at the majors," LIV Golf CEO Scott O'Neil said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"LIV Golf is committed to working hand in hand with golf's governing bodies to elevate the sport in all corners of the world."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, LIV Golf formally withdrew its application to have its 54-hole, no-cut events recognised by the Official World Golf Ranking, which played a key role in deciding entry into golf's four majors.</p>
        
            <p>LIV Golf's Bryson DeChambeau - who won last year's US Open - Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson, Jon Rahm, Cam Smith and Richard Bland were currently exempt into the year's third major through other exemption categories.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year Augusta National said it had given Joaquin Niemann a special invitation to the April 10-13 Masters but made no mention of the Chilean's involvement with LIV Golf.</p>
        
            <p>Niemann and fellow LIV Golf player Sergio Garcia had also already received invitations to the May 15-18 PGA Championship being held at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
