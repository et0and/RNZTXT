        <h2>Netball: Tactix deny Stars first win of the season</h2>
        <p>
The Stars were on course to get their first win of the season before the Tactix found another gear to steal victory and jump to the top of the ladder.

            <p>The Stars were on course to get their first win of the season before the Tactix found another gear to steal victory and jump to the top of the ladder.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars were leading by five goals heading into the final spell, but the Tactix went on a 17-11 fourth quarter blitz to win 58-57 in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The Stars, who are anchored at the bottom of the ANZ Premiership ladder, led by one goal after the first quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Club stalwart and former Silver Ferns captain Gina Crampton brought up her 150th national netball league appearance in the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Crampton took time away from netball at the end of last year, having finished her third season with the Stars on 147 national league appearances, with 98 of those coming with the Southern Steel since her debut in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>Now based in Sydney, Crampton jetted across to New Zealand as injury cover for Stars midcourter Emma Thompson to play the opening two games of this season for the Stars.</p>

            <p>The game saw the return of Silver Ferns development squad member Amorangi Malesala, who had not been seen since round one, due to injury.</p>
        
            <p>Malesala shared court time with Stars shooter Monica Falkner.</p>
        
            <p>The scores were tied at half-time but the Stars put their foot down in the third quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Stars centre Mila Reuelu-Buchanan pulled off some plucky intercepts and her efforts were rewarded with MVP honours.</p>
        
            <p>With the home side was on the back foot, the Tactix brought more energy in the final quarter and started playing to their potential.</p>

            <p>Greer Sinclair had good impact at wing defence and fired the ball into shooter Ellie Bird when she saw any openings.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns defenders Jane Watson and Karin Burger, who had been quiet by their standards, brought oppressive pressure in tandem with Sinclair.</p>
        
            <p>With the scores locked at 54-all, Burger took a critical intercept which was ultimately the decider.</p>
        
            <p>Ellie Bird's 47 goals at 96 percent accuracy was crucial to the home side's eventual triumph.</p>
        
            <p>Stars shooter Maia Wilson was strong for her side too, finishing with 42 goals at 91 percent.</p>
