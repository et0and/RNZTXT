            <p>Black Fern and Paramatta Eels star Rosie Kelly will make the shift to Chiefs Manawa for the 2025 Super Rugby Aupiki season.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly was a standout for Matatū the last two seasons, playing every game for the side in that time. Following Matatū's 2023 title-winning season, she was named in the Black Ferns squad and made her debut against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>This year, Kelly switched to league and was on the park for every minute of the Eels' five-win, four-loss season. She earned a place in the Kiwi Ferns wider squad for the current Pacific Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly said she was "super excited" to be moving north.</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to embracing the team culture, creating new connections and growing as a player both on and off the field. Super Rugby Aupiki is growing every year and I can't wait for the 2025 season to begin," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa head coach Dwayne Sweeney said: "We are stoked to have a player of Rosie's calibre join us here at the Chiefs. She is an experienced first five at this level with a huge drive to compete and grow as a player.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking forward to what she will add to our squad in 2025 and can't wait to see her in a Chiefs Manawa jersey."</p>
        
            <p>A standout talent from early on, Kelly captained the Christchurch Girls' High School First XV and made her representative debut for Canterbury Sevens while still at school.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017 she was a member of the region's Farah Palmer Cup winning side and was selected in the NZ Barbarians squad.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second big Aupiki news of the week, following the Blues announcement of the signing of Black Ferns Sevens and fifteens legend Portia Woodman-Wickliffe.</p>
