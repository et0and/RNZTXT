            <p>Depth. It's the hallmark of some of football's greatest ever teams.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester United won the treble in 1998-99 thanks to two super subs. Liverpool fans wax lyrical about the importance of regular replacements Divock Origi and David Fairclough to major glories. Meanwhile, it was the much-lampooned Swansea City flop Eder, not the colossal Cristiano Ronaldo, who earned Portugal a first major international trophy in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC demonstrated just how important having strength throughout the roster can be at the weekend, as they swept aside then-league-leading Melbourne City 3-0 at Mt Smart.</p>
        
            <p>Three key players for Auckland were absent through injury - captain Hiroki Sakai, centre-back Dan Hall and playmaker Jake Brimmer. That's their marquee player, a title-winning defender and a Johnny Warren medal winner. That's quite the chunk to take from any team, let alone one younger than the expired hummus burning a hole in the back of my fridge.</p>
        
            <p>In their place came Callan Elliot, Tommy Smith and Max Mata.</p>
        
            <p>Elliot stepped into the unenviably big boots of Sakai with aplomb, yet again. He has recaptured the form which made it so baffling that the energetic full-back found employment so hard to come by after his exit from the Wellington Phoenix in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Smith has so far been used as 'The Closer' - sounding like the eponymous character from a straight to streaming Jason Statham punch-em-up. The 34-year-old initially looked like the man Auckland boss Steve Corica was going to turn to when looking to see out victory, but Hall's ankle fracture has necessitated a more prominent contribution from the veteran.</p>
        
            <p>That plan A for Smith might distract from his impressive CV, including nearly 250 appearances in England's second-tier and over 50 caps for the All Whites. He was immense at the weekend, borderline bullying City forward Medin Memeti into withdrawal.</p>
        
            <p>Then there's Mata. The striker, without a goal since March, missed a sitter against Perth Glory in Auckland's Western Australia setback a week prior. However, he played completely unburdened by such mishaps, leading the line with power, intensity and speed in a throwback centre-forward display Shane Smeltz would have been proud of.</p>
        
            <p>His tap-in was his first in Auckland since he netted as a 17-year-old for Eastern Suburbs in February 2018. Seven years later, after a young career which has seen him step foot in Switzerland, Estonia, US, Ireland and England so far, Mata finally got to enjoy some home comforts in Tāmaki Makaurau. His position leading the line also allowed Guillermo May to drop into the pocket where the Uruguayan looked more comfortable, as evidenced by his sumptuous opening strike.</p>

            <p>The other goals came from corner kicks, with Auckland sticking on trend in doing so. Much like the mullet, Adidas Sambas or baggy jeans, the in-swinging corner has cycled its way back in vogue recently - with Arsenal making it a major weapon in their bid to lift silverware in England.</p>
        
            <p>Francis de Vries' wicked left-foot deliveries took advantage of City sweeper-keeper Pat Beach's clear aversion to dealing with crosses and Auckland happily took the chances that followed.</p>
        
            <p>It's a testament not only to Corica's tactical acumen to get the best from a depleted unit but also the recruitment of director of football Terry McFlynn for cultivating such an impressive roster in such a short period of time. The reward, a mouth-watering top-of-the-table clash with Adelaide United on Wednesday night.</p>
