            <p>The Highlanders are quickly fashioning a reputation as a team that will take games the entire distance, the problem is they're not winning them. The latest was a 34-27 defeat to the Brumbies in Canberra, and while Len Ikitau looked to have sealed the result for the home side with a 78th minute try, form winger Caleb Tangitau struck back immediately for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>The game ended with the Highlanders hot on attack but ultimately coming up short - the same scenario that's seen them lose consecutive games to the Hurricanes and Reds. Even their last win was in similar fashion, holding off a late charge by Moana Pasifika back in round three.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Brumbies winger Corey Toole was given the fastest yellow card this season after colliding with Tangitau on the opening kick-off. Tangitau, who is arguably the competiton's breakout star after moving south from the Blues last year, then hit back with the opening try.</p>
        
            <p>Allan Alaalatoa and Billy Pollard scored for the Brumbies, giving them a 15-5 lead at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Highlanders launched a comeback after the break, scoring two classy tries to Sam Gilbert and Jona Nareki. The back and forth battle resumed with Toole and Andy Muirhead wrestling the lead back for the Brumbies.</p>
        
            <p>Ikitau then scored what many thought to be the last act of the match, before Tangitau nabbed his second and it was all on for four extra minutes before the Highlanders eventually knocked on in the Brumbies' 22.</p>
        
            <p>The eighth-placed Highlanders now travel to Perth to face a dangerous Force side, the Brumbies head into their bye week comfortably holding fourth place on the table.</p>
