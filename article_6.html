            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson had a busy day at the Formula 1 post season test in Abu Dhabi.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson drove 159 laps in his RB, the most of any driver on the day, and almost three times the race distance at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The young Kiwi was 13th fastest, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fastest on the day.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson admitted it was the most driving he had done done in the car at once, but it was worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"You always learn more on these days as you effectively do three race distances.</p>
        
            <p>"With the limited number of races I've done, it's helpful to do a day like this.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not often that you get through the full programme you plan on doing, so credit to the Team today, they were very organised.</p>
        
            <p>"When you get to run as many tyres as we have today, it's always exciting. It was a nice way to end the season and head into the winter break."</p>
        
            <p>The testing involved both regular team drivers and rookies with each team running two cars over a nine hour period.</p>
        
            <p>Leclerc's former team-mate Carlos Sainz made his first appearance for Williams, Estaban Ocon got into his new Haas and Kick Sauber had their new pairing of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda got behind the Red Bull for the first time and was 17th fastest.</p>
        
            <p>Sainz was second quickest followed by George Russell in a Mercedes.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull junior driver Ayumu Iwasa of Japan was in the other RB and was sixth fastest.</p>
        
            <p>The day of testing was also important for tyre manufacturer Pirelli to help with picking compounds for the opening few races next year.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 season finished at the weekend in Abu Dhabi with McLaren claiming the constructors' championship.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen had previously wrapped up his fourth drivers' championship.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's future in F1 is expected to be known in the next week.</p>
        
            <p>The opening race of the 2025 season is in Melbourne on 16 March.</p>
