            <p>Auckland is the latest city to throw its hat in the ring for a new NRL franchise, proposing the new team to be called Mana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>The team behind the bid said they hope to create a Pasifika powerhouse, "representing the vibrant culture, heritage, and values of Pasifika and Māori athletes."</p>
        
            <p>"The franchise has garnered widespread support from across the Pacific region and New Zealand, standing as a beacon of unity and pride for the people of Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau," the team said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Bid lead Paepaetele Geoff Brown said Mana Pasifika would be more than a Rugby League team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a movement that celebrates the culture, resilience, and shared history of our Pacific people. With the support our Iwi, Pacific nations, and Auckland's leadership, we are confident that this franchise will bring a fresh and vibrant dimension to the NRL."</p>
        
            <p>Also endorsing the bid is former Aucklander, NZ Maori and Kiwi Fred Ah Kuoi who said Mana Pasifika is exactly what the NRL needs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an opportunity to embrace the incredible talent and passion of the Pacific and Māori communities in the city of sails. This franchise has the potential to become a powerhouse in the game and inspire the next generation of players."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown has also thrown his support behind the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"Mana Pasifika embodies the heart and soul of Auckland - our diversity, our heritage, and our love for sport. This franchise will not only strengthen rugby league in the region but also serve as a symbol of unity for all our communities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park chief executive Nick Sautner also said they would welcome the opportunity to be Mana's home ground.</p>
