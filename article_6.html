While the club is riding high the players are ready for any lows in the A-League.

            <p>Each week Auckland FC tick off records and mini-milestones as the club builds a solid foundation in their first season in the A-League - but they know the streak will inevitably end.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC now hold the record for most consecutive wins by a new A-League club with four victories from their first four games.</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeeper Alex Paulsen is yet to concede a goal despite being one of the busier keepers in the league.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old All White has made 14 saves to date, only Wellington Phoenix goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi has been busier in goal this season making 17 saves.</p>
        
            <p>In front of Paulsen, fellow All Whites defender Nando Pijnaker leads the league in clearances with 29 of his 39 clearances coming from headers. Pijnaker's seven blocks are also the most by an Auckland player.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC are targeting a fifth clean sheet against the Newcastle Jets at home on Saturday; if they are successful they will break a 17-year-old record.</p>
        
            <p>Central Coast Mariners set the record through their first five games of the 2007-08 season before going on to win the Premiers Plate for being the number one side on the table after the regular season.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland coach Steve Corica wanted to get the clean sheet record as part of the internal goals he set the squad throughout the 29-round regular season.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously we want to be at the top at the end of the season but there's little goals and that's one goal we've set for this weekend but other teams know that as well and because we've kept so many clean sheets other teams want to try and break that down so it's going to get harder and harder."</p>
        
            <p>Corica could not be happier with the start to season but was realistic that the bubble could burst.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not going to be like this I don't think the whole way. You're going to go through some tough times as well but I think as footballers they expect that and it's how we respond when we have a little bit of disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now the players are extremely happy and really focused."</p>
        
            <p>One thing Corica wanted to see improvement in was goal-scoring chances. He liked what he saw in the first three games but said against Macarthur the chances had been down on previous weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland had scored six goals this season - three of which have come in the 88th minute or later.</p>

            <p>The team's latest goal-scorer Guillermo May, who scored in the 34th minute against Macarthur on Sunday, is just one of four Auckland players who has found the back of the net this season and is the first striker to get on the scoresheet.</p>
        
            <p>Scoring goals was the best moment in football, the Uruguayan said, so he was eager for more.</p>
        
            <p>"As a striker you always need to score goals because it is one of the main parts of being a striker so now [the goal scoring account] is open so I hope more are coming."</p>
        
            <p>May, who played in South America before the A-League, said adapting to Auckland's style of play despite his late arrival with the team had been easy but he had been working on his fitness.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a different league than the other ones that I played in. Here you have more transitions and you need to be running all the time."</p>
        
            <p>May thought more of the same from Auckland would keep the winning streak going.</p>
        
            <p>"If we work as we are working, we press, we keep the ball, sometimes we need to be a little bit better with the ball, we just need to keep working."</p>
        
            <p>A sentiment that Corica will be pleased to hear from one of his visa signings as he plans to stick with the same players who have been gaining success in the first four games.</p>
