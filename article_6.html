            <p>It's going to take something special from the Black Caps to avoid an increasingly inevitable defeat in the first test against England in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>With a single digit lead and just four wickets in hand, the English are odds on to go 1-0 up in the series on day four tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>It was a dominant day from the tourists, their tail wagging to pile on a first innings total of 499.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors started the day on 319 for five, the Black Caps finally dismissing Harry Brook for 171 after dropping the centurion four times on day two.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Stokes kept things ticking over, Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse heaping further misery on the hosts, each combining with Stokes to add a further 100 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Atkinson in particular punished the Kiwis with some late fireworks, a blazing 36-ball 48.</p>
        
            <p>England were finally dismissed for 499 shortly after lunch, taking a first-innings lead of 151.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Henry mopped up the final two wickets to finish with figures of 4 for 84, debutant Nathan Smith also picking up three scalps.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Woakes struck first for the English, removing skipper Tom Latham for just one while fellow opener Devon Conway fell soon after, caught at mid-on for eight off the bowling of Carse.</p>
        
            <p>Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra consolidated to take the Kiwis past 50, taking them to tea at 62/2.</p>
        
            <p>That became 64/3 shortly after the break, Ravindra sending short ball from Carse skyward to be caught at deep square leg.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell joined Williamson and the pair put a half century partnership together in quick time, Williamson also notching yet another test fifty.</p>
        
            <p>Then came the double blow.</p>
        
            <p>First, the crucial wicket of Williamson, trapped in front to the bowling of Woakes for 61 just as the hosts were eying parity.</p>
        
            <p>The dismissal left Williamson stranded on 999 test career boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell lasted just one ball as he nicked Wokes behind, leaving the Kiwis with just half their wickets in the shed and still 18 runs behind.</p>
        
            <p>Smith joined Mitchell who had grinded his way to 31, the two surviving to stumps on155/6, but with plenty of work to do.</p>
        
            <p>Day four resumes at 11am.</p>
