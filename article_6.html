        <h2>Are the All Blacks bound for Qatar? Nations Championship concept takes shape</h2>

NZR boss doesn't confirm but certainly doesn't deny a potential trip to cash in on the Middle East's expanding sporting investment. Audio

            <p>Analysis - Rugby in the desert might sound like an uncomfortable way to play, and it's certainly proving to be that sort of topic to talk about this week. NZ Rugby (NZR) chief executive Mark Robinson fronted media in Auckland on Friday and didn't rule out rumours first published by the Daily Mail about the Nations Championship concept's hosting being held in Qatar.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the world of rugby as opening up," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a small country and relatively isolated, so we think that having stronger connections with other parts of the world, where there are new fan bases, is really important as well."</p>
        
            <p>Qatar has been accused of human rights violations and was heavily criticised when it hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Neighbouring Saudi Arabia has also come under fire for 'sports washing', having become boxing's epicentre in recent years as well as funding the breakaway LIV Golf tour.</p>

            <p>The long gestating Nations Championship will pit the Six Nations teams against the Rugby Championship teams, as well as the next two strongest test nations. The concept has been criticised for effectively ring-fencing the sport's wealth to its traditionally strongest unions, however NZR have been one of its strongest proponents.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson wasn't keen to go much further on the issue but said that NZR are "always looking at ways we can connect into different markets and what possibilities are there. It's more than simply commercial".</p>
        
            <p>"The prospect of future fan base is really important as well. So, all of those things are part of the consideration of new markets."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson did point out that the potential of rugby being involved with a potentially problematic country was "not a new topic" and he's certainly correct there, although in a much broader sense than he probably meant. This is the All Blacks, after all - their greatest rivalry is built on the most problematic sporting relationship since Berlin hosted the 1936 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>It might seem like a bit of an about face for NZR, given their commitment in the last decade and a half to get the All Blacks in front of an American market. That's seen mixed results: an iconic game against Ireland in Chicago in 2016 as well as a shambolic mismatch against the USA in Washington DC, but if the Nations Championship gets going in Doha, then the match ups will be far more in line with the business end of a World Cup than a one-off test.</p>
        
            <p>A far less controversial and much more official fixture was announced as well, with the Black Ferns set to return to Twickenham in September to face England. Robinson was happy to embrace the challenge of setting a record crowd for a women's test match at the 82,000-seat stadium, however given the momentum the Red Roses have right now in England, it's fair to assume the RFU have seized the initiative with women's rugby.</p>

            <p>"Due to the size of the country and the nature of the market, they have to invest more," Robinson said, before making a valid point that the English and French high-performance programmes weren't affected anywhere near as much by Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"We've talked openly about trying to build year on year on what Super Rugby Aupiki looks like. That's a really critical part of the High-Performance Pathways and Professional Player Pathways for the future. We're not sitting on our hands as it relates to looking to try and grow the women's game. And we'll probably just have to take a slightly different approach to what England are because of the of the size scale and the isolation of New Zealand. The reality is us to be able to gain these fixtures."</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure: the potential situation in Qatar and Twickenham women's test highlight the fact that the next phase of professionalism is about to dawn. It's going to be an interesting ride for the All Blacks and Black Ferns to navigate, both on and off the field.</p>
