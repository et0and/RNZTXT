        <h2>‘It's awkward’ - Blues facing must-win territory this weekend against Canes</h2>
        <p>
To say things haven't gone according to plan for the Blues in their title defence season is putting it mildly.
</p>
        
            <p>Blues v Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm Saturday 5 April</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park, Auckland</p>

            <p>To say things haven't gone according to plan for the Blues in their title defence season is putting it mildly. Vern Cotter's side comes out of their bye week in a joint share of last place in Super Rugby Pacific, with only one win out of six games so far in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The good news? They get to play the only team they've beaten again on Saturday night at Eden Park. The bad? Their opponents the Hurricanes look like they've finally shaken off some serious deficiencies of their own and look a lot better than they did in round three.</p>
        
            <p>"I just think we needed to tighten up, become a real tight team again around some simple stuff," said Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>"And then obviously a game plan that suits us and something that we can do put in place without too much difficulty."</p>
        
            <p>The Blues' much-discussed game plan that worked so well last year has failed to reap the same rewards, however the reasons why go deeper than simply other teams knowing what to expect. It didn't take a genius to figure out what the Blues were doing since Cotter came on board, it's just that last year there wasn't anything anyone could do about it.</p>

            <p>That's clearly changed. One that the wrecking ball style attack relied heavily on, Akira Ioane, has moved on while another, Hoskins Sotutu, has played a minimal role due to injury and suspension.</p>
        
            <p>"The things start to mount up when you lose a few," said Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awkward, but it's all part and parcel of sport at high level. So being able to push that aside and then focus on what you can do to make a difference, not worrying about the bits and pieces around it."</p>
        
            <p>Cotter has some fresh legs coming back for this weekend, with Beauden Barrett and Patrick Tuipulotu making it through contact training on Thursday. Barrett confirmed his broken hand had healed and was ready to go.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing holding me back from being back to 100 percent is probably holding a golf club. But in terms of rugby, I'm feeling really good," said Barrett.</p>

            <p>However, he acknowledged the frustration the defending champions are feeling but said the Blues are ready to turn a corner.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident that what we've spoken about at the start of this week, has been right on the money. We've addressed what we needed to, and now it's all about action. So, yeah, of course we want to be higher up the ladder, but we've still got to quietly work away and improve because, it is a long way to go in this competition."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett definitely gave a 'here we go again' look in response to being asked about how it feels to play the Hurricanes, given he's had to talk about it for five straight seasons. However, he paid tribute to Clark Laidlaw and the role the current Hurricanes coach played in his development.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a team I'm very proud about. You know, playing over 100 games for. And I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the coaches I've had, I started with Clarky Laidlaw actually going back in the Taranaki sevens days. So, of course, there's a lot of fond memories. [But] a lot of my former teammates have moved on. But my old mate Brad Shields on the bench this week, so it'll be good to catch up with him after the game."</p>
