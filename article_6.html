            <p>New Zealand golfer Steven Alker will go into the final round of the season opening PGA TOUR Champions event in a share of the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Spanish golfer Miguel Angel Jimenez shot a 4-under-par 69 in the second round to vault into a tie with Alker at 7-under 139 at the historic Royal Golf Dar Es Salam in Rabat, in Morocco.</p>
        
            <p>Alker, who is bidding for his ninth career Champions Tour victory, shared the first-round lead with Englishman Simon Griffiths.</p>
        
            <p>Alker had three bogeys to offset three birdies on the front nine before carding three more birdies to close his second round.</p>
        
            <p>The reigning Charles Schwab Cup winner finished with a 70 to join Jimenez with a two-stroke lead over Tim O'Neal.</p>
        
            <p>Last year Alker swept the 2024 season awards, earning the prestigious 2024 Jack Nicklaus Award as Player of the Year for the second time in three seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lydia Ko has made up some ground after a horror opening round at the latest LPGA Tour event, the Founders Cup, in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>The world number two was tied for 97th after the first round but is now in joint 50th place and has survived the cut after a second round 3-under 68.</p>

            <p>South Korean golfer Jin Young Ko leads at 12-under.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Fox has also shot up the leaderboard at the PGA's Phoenix Open to recover from his 1-over par opening round.</p>
        
            <p>Fox hit a 5-under 66 in the second round to sit in a tie for 33rd place.</p>

            <p>Adrian Meronk of Poland remains atop of the leaderboard at 16 under.</p>
        
            <p>Meronk, 31, has won four times on the DP World Tour but is in position for his first LIV title after joining the circuit ahead of the 2024 season.</p>
