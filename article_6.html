            <p>It's business time in the NRL as we approach the long-awaited conclusion of what has been one of the hardest fought seasons of rugby league in recent memory. Will we see one of the big three contenders in the Storm, Panthers or Roosters take out the competition? Or is it time to see a new champion crowned?</p>
        
            <p>Join us as we preview all of the weekend's NRL finals fixtures.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9:50pm, Friday 13 September</p>
        
            <p>BlueBet Stadium - Sydney</p>
        
            <p>The finals series kicks off with what is quite possibly the most anticipated game of the weekend; defending champions Penrith Panthers take on the Sydney Roosters. In the last ever game at Penrith's sanctuary BlueBet Stadium before they knock it down and rebuild, the question on everyone's minds will be whether Panthers' hero Nathan Cleary will take the field one last time after three weeks on the sidelines.</p>
        
            <p>The Roosters welcome back a small army of players as Dom Young and Nat Butcher return from injury, and Daniel Tupou and Lindsay Collins are back in the starting line up after being rested last week. Having not won in Penrith since 2017, the Roosters will be looking to spoil the party tonight in the hunt for premiership glory.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 6:05pm, Saturday 14 September</p>
        
            <p>AAMI Park - Melbourne</p>
        
            <p>All eyes will be on premiership favourites Melbourne Storm as they take on the Cronulla Sharks at AAMI park on Saturday. Whilst the Minor Premier Melbourne Storm have once again waltzed their way through another NRL season - downing serious opponents left, right and centre - the boys from the Shire are no easy targets.</p>
        
            <p>Cronulla have taken fans on yet another roller coaster, with their 2024 campaign reaching some of the highest of highs and lowest of lows. But they finished the regular season in a respectable fourth place. For a club that's been running red hot the last few years only to fall short when it comes to finals football, halfback Nico Hynes will be looking to make his mark and prove he is a big game player.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9:50pm, Saturday 14 September</p>
        
            <p>Queensland Country Bank Stadium - Townsville</p>
        
            <p>In what might be the most curious game during the first weekend of the NRL Finals series, two teams that have found themselves down and out at various points throughout the year now find themselves only a handful of games away from winning a premiership. The Cowboys will consider themselves in the driver's seat especially performing at home in front of what's sure to be a sell-out crowd in Townsville.</p>
        
            <p>Newcastle didn't quite repeat their 10-win streak run into the finals like last season - but they have found themselves scraping into the top eight by the skin of their teeth once again. The Novocastirans will be looking to right the wrongs of last year's horrible preliminary final match against the Warriors that saw them absolutely decimated in front of a record Mt Smart crowd. This weekend's big match against North Queensland away from home will be the making or breaking of the Knights with serious questions to be asked of key figures at the club if they don't come up trumps.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 6:05pm, Sunday 15 September</p>
        
            <p>Accor Stadium - Sydney</p>
        
            <p>After the club's first seriously decent season in over almost a decade; the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs find themselves unlucky to be sitting outside of the top four come finals time after flying high all season. Unfortunately, it all came undone last weekend against the Cowboys, where the Bulldogs found themselves on the end of a 44 - 6 hiding. With questions hanging over the club as to whether they've peaked too early, Sunday's showdown against the Manly Sea Eagles will be one for the ages.</p>
        
            <p>Old school rivalries flare up this weekend as Manly find themselves in a do-or-die scenario in the first weekend of finals football. Halfback Daly Cherry-Evans has entered the conversation around achieving legendary status in the NRL, and a second premiership with his beloved Sea Eagles would propel him to instant G.O.A.T. status with the club. This game has instant classic written all over it already.</p>
