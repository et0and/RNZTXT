            <p>Defender Mackenzie Barry and forward Kosta Barbarouses have claimed the supreme honours at the Wellington Phoenix awards.</p>
        
            <p>Barry was also named the players' player of the year for the Phoenix women who - like the men - enjoyed their best-ever regular season finish, placing eighth, five points outside the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old was a consistent performer at the back in her third A-League season, missing just two of their 22 matches.</p>
        
            <p>She became the first women's player to play 50 matches for Wellington in the team's final match of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm stoked. I'm a bit lost for words," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super proud of everyone in the team and I'm really happy to be receiving this award.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an amazing honour. Unexpected, but I'm really happy with it."</p>

            <p>Barbarouses led the record-breaking men's team with 13 goals to claim the golden boot award.</p>
        
            <p>It had been the 34-year-old's second most prolific goalscoring season, taking his career tally to 93, which was fourth all-time in the men's A-League and the most by a New Zealander.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very, very proud," Barbarouses said.</p>
        
            <p>"I won this award last time I was here after a pretty disappointing season. It feels a lot better to do it when the team's going well.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a proud Wellingtonian as well so it means â€¦ a hell of a lot to me to win this award. I just want to keep helping the club achieve what it deserves to achieve."</p>
        
            <p>Members voted Macey Fraser's stunning free-kick against Western United in round four the women's goal of the season, while Alex Paulsen's peers named the young goalkeeper the men's players' player of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Venezuela international Mariana Speckmaier received the women's golden boot after finding the back of the net 10 times in her maiden A-League season.</p>
        
            <p>Attacking midfielder Ben Old collected the men's goal of the season award for his thunderous strike against Adelaide United in round 19.</p>
