            <p>Warriors coach Andrew Webster is standing by assistant Richard Agar in the wake of his suspension.</p>
        
            <p>Agar has been charged with breaching the NRL code of conduct, relating to an alleged altercation with a journalist at Las Vegas earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>He became the subject of an Integrity Unit probe over allegations that he physically assaulted English journalist John Davidson in the media box at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The breach notice issued Monday proposes a $10,000 fine (half-suspended) and a three-game suspension, along with a requirement for appropriate education and training.</p>
        
            <p>The ban would prohibit him from any gameday activities with the team and he would be unable to travel for road games.</p>
        
            <p>Agar has five days to respond to the notice.</p>
        
            <p>The club had no comment when contacted for reaction by RNZ, but Webster did address the sanction when speaking to media on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got a lot of support around him, when you've done what he is done in the game, this is never easy, I don't think on anyone, especially when it affects your reputation. But we love him, what he brings for us, I'd rather just let the powers to be address it."</p>
        
            <p>Webster insisted there would be little disruption to the side.</p>
        
            <p>"When your best players are out, you always look to what's next. Rich is a really experienced assistant coach. He's a great coach. He's done a lot in the game and I'd rather have him sitting next to me every week. He's not, but you have got to move on and go from there."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will not be looking to an interim assistant during Agar's suspension.</p>
        
            <p>"It will just be business as normal. We've got enough experienced coaches, it's just like when you lose a good player, we've got a plan and we'll be fine."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said the club will comment in due course.</p>
        
            <p>"You're never too reactive and stupid. You've got to deal with things in the right manner, everyone will have clarity and fully supportive of the way the clubs handle it and the process."</p>
