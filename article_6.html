        <h2>Basketball: Getting girls court time comes with unique spin</h2>
        <p>
Basketball New Zealand hopes to get girls picking up a ball in summer and sticking with it in the winter months.

            <p>Thousands of young New Zealanders will play basketball for the first time this summer as Basketball New Zealand tries to breakdown the barriers that keep females off the court.</p>
        
            <p>Basketball is the fastest growing sport at youth level in New Zealand and women's basketball is one of the fastest growing sports in the world.</p>
        
            <p>A nationwide Summer of Basketball programme promoting the 3x3 version of the game aimed to boost the numbers even further.</p>
        
            <p>The events will not look like a traditional basketball training with organisers opting for outdoor festivals, glow-in-the-dark games, park tours and indoor games played in dress up.</p>
        
            <p>Basketball New Zealand's participation lead Meaghan Wilby said as much as possible they were "trying to bring basketball to the girls where they already are".</p>
        
            <p>"It's about trying to reach those girls who maybe used to play basketball and have stopped or who haven't played it's not excluding the girls who have been playing all season already but we also know that they need to have a bit of a break and rest for their bodies so they can come back next season so it's really about fun social opportunities to play basketball."</p>
        
            <p>Wilby said the timing of the programme was on purpose and would be tailored to what local girls wanted.</p>

            <p>"Over summer when potentially girls who are super busy during the winter with other sports or school or work maybe have a little bit more time to try something new.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice and relaxed and fun so that maybe it inspires them to then keep playing basketball, or sport, come winter season next year or in the future."</p>
        
            <p>The Summer of Basketball was backed by 2degrees and supported by the Tauihi franchises with some of the country's top players involved in trying to get more girls playing their sport.</p>
        
            <p>"It's allowing us to create a real sense of connection across basketball from the very top from our Tall Ferns to Tauihi teams right into the community and girls who may just be picking the ball for the first time and I think being able to create that level of connection at a national level is really exciting."</p>
        
            <p>Boys still out numbered girls in picking up a basketball in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Girls definitely still face barriers and challenges one of which is time particularly if we think about our teenagers there are so many things, not just in sport, that are competing for their time</p>
        
            <p>"But then also within our sport struggling to access venues and court hire to be able to create opportunities for them to play is still a battle and we know that sport's expensive and life's getting more expensive as well I'd say those are the top three [barriers to playing]."</p>

            <p>Wilby said they were not intentionally trying to scout the next elite player with the summer programme but they were trying to open people's eyes to what pathways were available through basketball.</p>
        
            <p>"Once you're in there is so many opportunities of what you can do and where it can take you so if we can get more girls in the game we can get more girls knowing about the opportunities and more girls being able to take them up."</p>
        
            <p>The programme was launched in Auckland at Mt Albert Grammar School on Wednesday where 60 girls and 15 coaches ran some drills with players from the Tokomanawa Queens and the national champion Northern Kahu.</p>
