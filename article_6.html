            <p>In a surprise appearance, All Black Beauden Barrett has played his first game for his Taranaki rugby club in 14 years.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett came on for Coastal in the second half of their Taranaki premier club competition match against Ōkato on Saturday, playing a key hand in their 52-12 win.</p>
        
            <p>He had last donned the green and white colours of Coastal in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>It was 33-year-old Barrett's first game in New Zealand since his return after playing for Toyota Verblitz in Japan's premier club competition.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues had hoped he would be able to play in the Super Rugby Pacific playoffs but he was ruled ineligible because of his stint in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to be back," Barrett told Sports News Taranaki after the match.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't get the chance to play for Coastal a lot but it's great to see club rugby is still strong in Taranaki."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett was guest speaker at Francis Douglas Memorial College's new gym fundraiser in New Plymouth on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>While he was not listed in Coastal's 22 for the match, local rumours about him playing ensured there was a big crowd at the match at Ōkato Domain on Saturday, the website said.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett is expected to be in the mix for All Blacks selection for the two-test series against England in July. Scott Robertson will name his first New Zealand squad for the series on 24 June.</p>
