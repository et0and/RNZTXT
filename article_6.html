        <h2>What is in the boxes winning athletes receive at the Paris Olympics?</h2>
        <p>
It is not just medals that Olympic champions have been receiving on the podium during the Paris Olympics.

            <p>It is not just medals that Olympic champions have been receiving on the podium during the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>In lieu of things such as flowers or wreaths, athletes are being handed long cardboard boxes with no markings on them.</p>
        
            <p>So what is in them? A very thin bottle of French champagne? Maybe a freshly baked baguette?</p>
        
            <p>Of course not. It is the work of this guy â€¦</p>

            <p>Inside the box is the official Olympic poster of Paris 2024, designed by Ugo Gattoni, showing a cartoon version of Paris with a picture of a big red Eiffel Tower and the Seine, surrounded by sports taking place.</p>
        
            <p>It also has the words XXXIII Olympiade, referencing the fact that Paris 2024 is the 33rd edition of the Games.</p>
        
            <p>Athletes also get this summer Games' mascot as a cuddly toy - and of course their medals, which all include a part of the Eiffel Tower in them.</p>
