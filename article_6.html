        <h2>Ref clanger! Assessing the blown calls in the All Blacks loss</h2>
        <p>
The referee team missed a handling error that led to a try in first half - but did it ultimately cost the All Blacks? Video
</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks are ruing an officiating error in the wash-up of their 31-27 loss to the Springboks at Ellis Park on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Bongi Mbonambi powered over in the 16th minute after peeling off the back of a lineout drive; however, replays clearly showed the Springbok hooker had knocked the ball on in a tackle by Jordie Barrett.</p>

            <p>Despite the partisan, 62,000-strong crowd groaning in frustration when the big screen showed the ball coming loose, TMO Brian MacNeice did not check and the try stood.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Scott Barrett appeared to remonstrate with referee Andrew Brace after the replay was shown on the Ellis Park big screen, but it was to no avail.</p>
        
            <p>To make matters even murkier, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu's subsequent conversion attempt was ruled out as he had taken too long - although there was no shot clock visible to the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>All Black coach Scott Robertson could only offer a joke when asked for his thoughts on what had transpired.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe? Pardon? Oh OK, I'm just checking if it was a try or not," he said, which drew a few laughs from the assembled media.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw what you saw. I can't say any more. It's a dangerous area if you start talking about referees."</p>
        
            <p>That's a standard response from coaches after a crucial call goes against their side, but it was obvious from Robertson's tone he clearly wasn't happy.</p>

            <p>But really, did it ultimately cost the All Blacks?</p>
        
            <p>There was still a great deal of the match to play. When Codie Taylor's opening try came after a sustained period of All Black pressure, the momentum swung back to the home side, and they seemed destined to score at some point.</p>
        
            <p>The real issue is the game was lost at the end, not the start. A disjointed last 15 minutes saw the Springboks go from 27-17 down to 31-27 ahead with two very similarly built tries, which should be far more of a worry than one refereeing blunder.</p>
        
            <p>Besides, the luck with the refs wasn't just with the Springboks.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks committed six first-half penalties in their own 22 and weren't shown a card, and a dubious call when a Springbok kick-off was adjudged to have gone out on the full went in their favour, too.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi was the unlucky player penalised when Brace finally had enough of the All Blacks' infringing, and his yellow card sparked the Springbok comeback.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides now move to Cape Town for the second test next weekend.</p>
