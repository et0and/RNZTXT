        <h2>Watene-Zelezniak to bring up 200 NRL games</h2>
        <p>
The cult hero winger will reach the mark against one of his former clubs at NRL's Magic Round this weekend.
</p>
        
            <p>Dallin Watene-Zelezniak is gearing up for his 200th match in the NRL, but revealed that he came close to retirement a few seasons ago after a run of challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a time when I wasn't doing so well," said the Warriors wing this week.</p>
        
            <p>"I was going to give the game up. So, to get here is pretty special…it's a big occasion for my wife and kids. My wife's been there for every single match, well she was my girlfriend at the start but she's been there since day one. My family's been there too, so it's a big occasion for all of us."</p>
        
            <p>Watene-Zelezniak was looking forward having his family involved in the occasion at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday, when the Warriors meet the Panthers.</p>
        
            <p>"Having three kids, a lot of preparation goes into game day, it's a big blessing in my life. Getting them to run out with me, that's going to be the proudest."</p>
        
            <p>He was now into his fourth season at the Warriors, off the back of a massive season in 2023 in which he scored 27 tries and was named in the Dally M Team of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>However, his tenure with the team started under much different circumstances, being thrown a lifeline by the Warriors after a move to the Bulldogs in 2019 resulted in two disappointing seasons where the club finished 12th and 15th.</p>

            <p>However, Watene-Zelezniak looked back on his entire career with pride.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite cool when all you dreamed of was playing one. Playing 200 hasn't sunk in yet, but I guess it will closer to the game," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A more pressing issue was how the Warriors were going to be able to reverse a four game loss streak, but Watene-Zelezniak had faith in the way the team was preparing for a tough match against the defending premiers.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Webby (coach Andrew Webster) and the coaching staff do a pretty good job of keeping it the same, in terms of the energy around the joint…there's a lot of positivity and a clear way of how we're going to get better and win games," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Watene-Zelezniak was on the end of a reshuffled backline after Shaun Johnson was ruled out with a pectoral injury. Charnze Niccol-Kloktad comes into the halves, Taine Tuaupiki comes back in at fullback, while Ali Leiataua gets his first start at centre. Watene-Zelezniak was not fussed by the changes.</p>
        
            <p>"Not too much, I don't really want to change anything (about his own game). I just gotta understand their strengths and weaknesses and do my best for them."</p>
        
            <p>On the whole, he said the assignment on attack was straightforward.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to keep adapting to what defences are doing, we haven't probably been at our best. These are the sort of games you get up for, backs against the wall."</p>
