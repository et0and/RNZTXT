            <p>Chess great Magnus Carlsen will return to the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York after initially quitting following governing body FIDE's decision to bar him from a round for wearing jeans.</p>
        
            <p>Carlsen, world champion between 2013 and 2023, decided to leave the tournament on Friday when FIDE barred the Norwegian from participating in a round at the tournament due to his</p>
        
            <p>breach of dress code regulations.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with the YouTube channel of the Take Take Take app on Sunday, the 34-year-old confirmed he would be returning.</p>
        
            <p>"To make a long story short: I'll be playing at least one more day here in New York. If I do well, another day after that," Carlsen said.</p>
        
            <p>He added he had talks with International Chess Federation (FIDE) president Arkady Dvorkovich after the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Speaking to Dvorkovich and the main sponsor Turlov, it did feel we could have some fruitful discussions and in the end of the day I decided to play," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition, I love playing blitz chess. I want to give the fans the chance to see me play it. It could be the last time, who knows?"</p>
        
            <p>Dvorkovich expressed regret in a post on FIDE's X account later on Sunday over the situation escalating and acknowledged Carlsen's vital role in elevating the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"It is unfortunate that the implementation of dress-code rules, while being legally sound and consistent, has left some feeling this is disproportionate and caused the situation everyone would have preferred to avoid," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Dvorkovich added that he approved a trial of a more flexible approach to attire during the World Blitz Championships that would allow minor deviations from the official dress code.</p>
        
            <p>Carlsen pointed out that he would definitely not leave his preferred clothes at home.</p>
        
            <p>"As a principle, I will definitely play in jeans tomorrow," he said.</p>
