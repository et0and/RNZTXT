            <p>Liam Lawson is coming to terms with the rigours of being a Formula One driver.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand driver is three races into his return to the championship, and says the last month has been a whirlwind.</p>
        
            <p>Theoretically the RB team member is on a week off, but the 22-year-old admits in reality there is no such thing as time off for a new driver.</p>
        
            <p>"There is not that much time to think about anything else," Lawson told New Zealand media.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just forced to be focused on performance and driving, and on days off we're preparing for the next race (Las Vegas), learning the track and getting ready for the sessions.</p>
        
            <p>"I just have to think about driving the car faster."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson admitted it had taken a while to get used to being in the spotlight and the added interest from the global media. He said he learned quotes can be taken out of context, and that he also had to limit his time on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"There has always been a bit of a spotlight [on me] but F1 is on another level and it is very easy to get caught up in it."</p>

            <p>Lawson had grabbed headlines not just with his results, but also for a verbal run-in with Fernando Alonso in Texas and a war of words he had with Sergio Perez in Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>He said being a Red Bull reserve driver last year gave him a good introduction to being a part of one of the biggest sporting competitions in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"It is something you adjust to, but fortunately we're so well supported [by our team] for everything.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't expect to have that many people come around and make sure everything is taken care of and all we have to do is focus on driving the car."</p>
        
            <p>The one thing the team has failed to do, he said, was find him a decent mince and cheese pie.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson scored points in two of the three races he has started since replacing Australian Daniel Ricciardo in the RB car.</p>
        
            <p>While he has been linked with a move up to the Red Bull team alongside three-time world champion Max Verstappen next season, Lawson said his main priority was to drive well enough to just secure a seat.</p>
        
            <p>He said the talk about his future did not weigh on his mind each time he climbed into the cockpit.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, no - even if I had a contract locked in for next year, the sport is so performance-based that if I'm not performing then there is no point thinking about next year."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson did have performance clauses in his contract for these six races.</p>
        
            <p>Other than the required social media for the RB team, Lawson said he has cut back on everything else.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm completely off social as far as scrolling through my feed and responding to messages."</p>
        
            <p>F1 returns to action next week in Las Vegas, with the last two rounds in Qatar and Abu Dhabi.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's future in the sport is expected to be announced after the final round.</p>
