            <p>The clinical Kangaroos have scored four tries to beat the Kiwis 22-10 in Christchurch and book a place in the Pacific Championship final.</p>
        
            <p>The world champion Australians had the better of a physical contest to gain some revenge for their last meeting with New Zealand - the 30-0 drubbing in Hamilton 12 months ago which was the biggest defeat in their history.</p>
        
            <p>They played with more intent than a New Zealand side who were missing a number of key players, including standout Melbourne Storm halfback Jahrome Hughes, prompting veteran playmaker Shaun Johnson to come out of a short-lived retirement to wear the number seven jersey.</p>

            <p>Debuts were handed to Keano Kini, Will Warbrick, Phoenix Crossland, Naufahu Whyte and Jordan Riki.</p>
        
            <p>They will need to quickly recover for a test against Tonga in Auckland on Saturday, with the winners to face Australia in the Pacific Championship final in Sydney a week later.</p>
        
            <p>Tonga lost their opening match of the tournament 18-0 to the Kangaroos in Brisbane last week.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis captain James Fisher-Harris was disappointed his side couldn't notch victory in Christchurch, where they haven't played Australia since 1989.</p>
        
            <p>"Oz were too good tonight but I thought it was a step in the right direction," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a bit of a younger team this year but I thought everyone attacked it and there were some good signs.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm gutted we couldn't get the job done but we get another chance next week."</p>

            <p>The Kiwis - guided for the first time by head coach Stacey Jones - were bright at times on attack, they couldn't stay with the determined visitors who led 12-6 at halfftime on the back of hard-working pack and the kicking game of halfback Mitchell Moses.</p>
        
            <p>It could have been more if second-rower Angus Crichton had grounded the ball correctly after crossing in the opening minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Lindsay Collins busted through soon afterwards to score a spectacular Australian opening try but winger Jamayne Isaako levelled the scores 6-6 after quick hands from team-mates.</p>
        
            <p>Impressive winger Zac Lomax darted across to give the visitors a halftime lead and he bagged his second after the break to put daylight between the teams.</p>

            <p>Will Warbrick cleverly eluded Lomax to score a try and bring the Kiwis back within six points but Moses raced clear to seal the outcome with seven minutes remaining.</p>
        
            <p>Kangaroos captain Isaah Yeo told Sky Sport he was happy with his team's "resilience".</p>
        
            <p>"Our discipline probably put us on the back foot there a little bit but I thought we showed a lot of resilience and scored some good tries at the back end," Yeo said, also praising some desperate defence.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll get a lot of confidence at turning them away. They've got a lot of world class players all through there so the long we held, the more confidence we got."</p>
