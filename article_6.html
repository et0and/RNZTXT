            <p>New Zealand driver Shane van Gisbergen was unable to defend his title after crashing out of the NASCAR Chicago street race despite dominating early.</p>
        
            <p>Van Gisbergen was the first driver in Modern NASCAR history to win in their debut last year at Chicago.</p>
        
            <p>But Van Gisbergen's day ended when he was clipped by Chase Briscoe in the same wet conditions that made him unstoppable last year.</p>
        
            <p>As a downpour arrived on the 12-turn circuit, the New Zealander held the lead at the 20-lap mark and recorded his first career stage win.</p>
        
            <p>Van Gisbergen, who won the Xfinity Series race on Sunday, was the race favourite but on the restart on lap 25, there were two separate incidents caused by heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>In the second incident Briscoe lost control and slammed into the tire barrier and clipped van Gisbergen.</p>
        
            <p>The slight contact caused van Gisbergen to miss his corner and crash into the wall, knocking him out in 40th.</p>
        
            <p>"I turned in, and it looked pretty good, and then just got smashed by someone," van Gisbergen shared with NBC. "It's gutting ... we were in the lead for much of that race, and it felt good taking up in the rain.</p>
        
            <p>"That sucks; it's an unfortunate mistake by him," van Gisbergen added. "I'm sure he didn't mean it, but he clipped me, and there was nothing that I could do."</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand-born driver exited the vehicle; his race and chance to go back to back in Chicago was over.</p>
        
            <p>In the end Alex Bowman staved off Tyler Reddick's last-lap push to win the rain-shortened Grant Park 165 at the second Chicago Street Race.</p>
