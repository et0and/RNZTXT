            <p>Kiwi boxer Mea Motu has taken her record to 19 wins without a defeat after earning a dominant second round stoppage victory over 20-year-old Thai Noppaket Srisawas in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The referee mercilessly called time on the Friday night fight, potentially the last time Motu fights in Aotearoa, halfway through the second round as Motu peppered Srisawas with over a dozen unanswered shots.</p>
        
            <p>Srisawas had absolutely no answers for Motu's power, utilising her jab, uppercut and hook to completely overwhelm her.</p>
        
            <p>It was a one-sided rout for Motu who barely broke a sweat as she dispatched her far younger, and heavier opponent.</p>
        
            <p>Following the bout, Motu sent a stern warning to her fellow female fighters.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm coming Eli Scott, you better watch it, you ain't seen this MƒÅori girl."</p>
        
            <p>Motu absorbed almost no damage in a little over three minutes in the ring.</p>
        
            <p>She said she has no ceiling regarding what was next.</p>
        
            <p>"It takes me to the world, and I'm coming to collect all those damn belts, I'll show you what I'm made of."</p>
        
            <p>She credited coach Isaac Peach for her sensational rise.</p>
        
            <p>"They have invested in me so much, this is why I'm the champion. It means so much, I have the courage because of you, I want to show the world how bloody great New Zealand is."</p>
        
            <p>With the IBO Bantamweight champion now chasing super fights overseas, Friday's 19th career win may mark the end of Motu's fight career in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Motu's name was now able to garner super fights in Australia and Europe which she has spoken out about chasing.</p>
        
            <p>Friday marked a full circle in Motu's sensational four-year career, in the same venue, ABA Stadium, where she picked up the first of her 19 career wins over Wendy Talbot in 2020.</p>
