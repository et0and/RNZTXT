            <p>A relentless Guntaek Koh produced the shot of the day on his way to building a four-shot lead after the third round of the New Zealand Open at Millbrook Resort.</p>
        
            <p>The overnight leader's five-under-par 66 on Saturday was highlighted by an eagle at the short 12th hole, a blind wedge shot from 66m that took two bounces before spinning back into the cup.</p>
        
            <p>At 22-under-par after 54 holes, it will be Koh's tournament to lose on the final day on Millbrook's composite course as he tries to become the event's second consecutive Asian winner.</p>
        
            <p>The closest challenger to the four-time winner on the Korean Tour is West Australian lefthander Ryan Peake, who made up two shots on the leader with a 64 on Saturday and has the biggest day of his career ahead on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Japan's Kazumi Higa eagled the par-five first and 17th holes to climb to a share of third with a nine-under-par 62.</p>
        
            <p>The leading New Zealander is another lefthander, Sam Jones, who charged to a share of seventh, seven shots behind, thanks to a composite course record round of 10-under 61.</p>
        
            <p>He was close to finishing his round when Koh was getting his underway with a three-shot lead, the Korean quickly extended his advantage with birdies at the first, second and third holes.</p>
        
            <p>Although he had two bogeys, he turned in 3-under 33 and was as many as six shots in front before his lead dwindled slightly with six consecutive pars coming home after the eagle on 12.</p>
        
            <p>"I was concerned about how much backspin I'm going to have after the shot, but it just went perfectly," Koh said of his second hole-out in as many days.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great that I have a four-shot lead, but this course itself is very scoreable. I need to keep focused on what I'm doing and just make sure I just stay consistent to what I'm doing."</p>
        
            <p>Jones's brilliant 61 included eight birdies plus an eagle on the par-5 17th hole where his second shot with a seven-iron finished four metres from the cup and he rolled in the slightly uphill putt.</p>
        
            <p>He admitted his low round was something of a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a bit rough out there the first couple of days. Struggled a little bit on the greens, haven't been swinging it great but that's golf."</p>
        
            <p>"I was just pretty grateful to be teeing it up today. I was right on the cut-line yesterday."</p>
