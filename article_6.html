            <p>Team New Zealand have qualified for the Louis Vuitton preliminary regatta final, beating Alinghi by 75 seconds on day three of the event in Barcelona.</p>
        
            <p>The final day will see three more AC75 races, followed by the final.</p>
        
            <p>To complete the round robin, Team New Zealand have a much anticipated match up against American Magic before meeting Luna Rossa in the final early Monday morning (NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>A split tack start was seen for the first time at the regatta, with the Kiwis taking the right and the Swiss going left. When the two boats came back together, it was advantage New Zealand and they capitalised on every leg.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking afterwards, Team New Zealand skipper Peter Burling said his team had everything to play for as defenders of the Louis Vuitton 37th America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very much here to try and improve the performance and just check in across the range of conditions. It's obviously going to be completely different conditions tomorrow so that'll be exciting, and just trying to figure out a plan overnight."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he saw Luna Rossa as the closest competitor, Burling said it was too hard to say.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still going to stand by that teams are good in different wind strengths - we haven't seen Magic in too much breeze yet, and Ben (Ainslie, INEOS Britannia) in some conditions seems pretty fast as well, so yeah we have to wait to and see.</p>
        
            <p>"It just seems like whoever puts their best foot forward in a race and gets off the line well seems to win them, so it's all going to be about that tomorrow."</p>
