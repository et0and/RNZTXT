            <p>New Zealand Rugby League has confirmed that Michael Maguire is stepping down from his role as Head Coach of the New Zealand Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>He'd been in the role for six years.</p>
        
            <p>CEO Greg Peters released a statement this afternoon, saying, "The mana, history and whakapapa associated with the Black and White jersey mean any role in and around the Kiwi team is the ultimate privilege. Michael's dedication to the role and players has seen him achieve incredible things over the last six years."</p>
        
            <p>"Michael is the ultimate professional and has connected deeply with the NZRL whƒÅnau and playing group. We wish him nothing but success in his next career step."</p>
        
            <p>His departure comes less than a month after steering the Kiwis to an upset victory over Australia in the inaugural final of the Pacific Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Maguire has been heavily linked to the vacant coaching position with New South Wales for next year's State of Origin series.</p>
        
            <p>He had met with New Zealand board members to discuss juggling the Blues and Kiwis jobs.</p>
        
            <p>He also worked as an assistant coach to Ricky Stuart at the Canberra Raiders in 2023, having previously looked after the Wests Tigers between 2019 and 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Before that, he had a successful tenure with South Sydney, where he won the 2014 Grand Final, and a two-year stint with English side Wigan, winning the Super League title.</p>
