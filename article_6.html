        <h2>Lydia Ko eyeing major titles at career grand slam</h2>
        <p>
Dame Lydia Ko has given herself a hefty golf schedule in 2025 - but two tournaments in June stand above all others.

            <p>New Zealand's Lydia Ko will tee off her year on Friday morning as defending champion at the season-opening Tournament of Champions in her home base city of Orlando.</p>
        
            <p>It would be the first of 22 Tour events she plans to play this year, plus a possible appearance in the International Crown teams event in October.</p>
        
            <p>The newly-anointed Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit hadn't let her lofty status, nor her breath-taking 2024 achievements, dull her career aspirations.</p>

            <p>An Olympic gold medal in Paris last August unlocked entry to golf's Hall of Fame - one of her long-held targets - and she followed it with victory at the Women's British Open at the hallowed grass of St Andrews in Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>With three of the five majors under her belt, 27-year-old Ko took time out over Christmas to recalibrate her career goals, having always stated she wanted to retire before age 30.</p>
        
            <p>"I would love to do the career Grand Slam," she told a pre-tournament press conference in Orlando.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard winning one major championship. To win five, and they all be different ones, it's a very small group of players who have done it. If I could be alongside that small group, it would be amazing."</p>
        
            <p>So still on her to-win list was the US Women's Open in Wisconsin in early June, followed by the Women's PGA Championship in Texas three weeks later.</p>

            <p>Rather than adopt a light playing schedule to focus on the Majors, Ko had deliberately stencilled in a busy schedule.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to peak at the Majors and, for me, I think it's always good to have some sort of momentum, whether it's playing the week before or at least having some sort of play," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was constructing my schedule, I was adding more and more events and the International Crown was a cool surprise as well."</p>
        
            <p>Ko said she wouldn't place additional pressure on herself to win at the two June Majors, having learned about the importance of being relaxed.</p>
        
            <p>That mindset worked a treat in her two-shot triumph at the British Open, just a fortnight after climbing the Paris Olympic podium.</p>
        
            <p>"I had one of the biggest weeks of my career at the Olympics and I thought 'there's no way I can out-do that'," she recalled.</p>
        
            <p>"So I just played freely and enjoyed being in town, spending time with my family and I played some good golf on top of that."</p>

            <p>Ko said last year's opening win in Orlando was the "springboard" to a big year, coming off a disappointing 2023 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>She admitted home advantage should again give her an edge this week at the $US2 million ($NZ3.5 million) tournament at Lake Nona Golf & Country Club.</p>
        
            <p>"After having a very tough year in '23, to win the first tournament back last year gave me a lot more confidence and good momentum to a year that I knew was very important for me.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously this being my home club, I got a lot of home crowd support.</p>
        
            <p>"I've played this golf course quite a lot and it helped with the nerves and I almost took it as me playing on any other Sunday."</p>
