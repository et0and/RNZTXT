            <p>British boxer Daniel Dubois is not rescheduling his fight with New Zealander Joseph Parker, and will instead look to fight Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed heavyweight title.</p>
        
            <p>IBF champion Dubois withdrew from his title defence against Parker on 22 February after falling ill.</p>
        
            <p>Instead of rescheduling a Parker fight, Dubois' attention had turned to facing Usyk, who holds all the other major world heavyweight titles.</p>
        
            <p>Sky Sports in Britain reported that the Dubois' camp was hopeful the fight could be held in the UK and that Wembley was one of the options.</p>
        
            <p>Dubois' most recent loss was to Usyk in 2023, when he was stopped by the Ukrainian in Poland.</p>
        
            <p>Saudi Arabia had been the hub for recent big fights with Usyk and Tyson Fury meeting there twice.</p>
        
            <p>Dubois, 27, has a 22 and two record with 21 of his wins by way of knock outs.</p>
        
            <p>He beat Anthony Joshua in his last fight in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>Usyk is undefeated in 23 bouts, beating Fury twice, Joshua twice, Dubois and Derek Chisora in that time.</p>
        
            <p>The last British heavyweight to be undisputed was Lennox Lewis in 1999.</p>
        
            <p>Parker fought late replacement Martin Bakole in Riyadh last month, scoring a knock out win inside two rounds.</p>
        
            <p>There has been no news on when the Kiwi might fight again.</p>
