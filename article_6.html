            <p>The White Ferns wrapped up the ODI series against Sri Lanka with a 98 run victory in the third game in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand opener Georgia Plimmer scored her maiden ODI century to play a big part in the win.</p>
        
            <p>After winning the toss and deciding to bat first New Zealand scored 280 for six with Plimmer making 112 and Suzie Bates 53 with the pair putting on 108 for the first wicket.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Halliday, Maddy Green and Isabella Gaze all made contributions lower down the order.</p>
        
            <p>Sugandika Kumari took three wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Jess Kerr then made an immediate impact with the ball removing the top three batters all for singles figures with Sri Lanka falling to 23 for three.</p>
        
            <p>Kayisha Dilhari and Nilakshika Silva both scored 45 in the middle of the innings.</p>
        
            <p>However the tail added very little and the tourists were bowled out for 182 in the last over.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr and Fran Jonas both finished with three wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The first match was washed out and New Zealand won the second by 78 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Plimmer was named Player of the Match and Green Player of the Series.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides now meet in three T20 internationals with the first in Christchurch on Friday.</p>
