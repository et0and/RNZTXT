            <p>Spain overran Croatia 3-0, striking three times in a sublime first half to earn maximum points in their Euro 2024 Group B opener and confirm their status as title contenders.</p>
        
            <p>The Spaniards, seeking a record fourth Euro crown, struck twice in three minutes, with Fabian Ruiz setting up captain Alvaro Morata in the 29th minute before firing home himself.</p>
        
            <p>Dani Carvajal volleyed in from 16-year-old Lamine Yamal's assist, the teenager becoming the youngest player to appear at a European Championship.</p>
        
            <p>The Croats, desperate to replicate their World Cup success of recent years at the Euros where they have never won a knockout game, were no match for Spain's clever attacking play with coach Zlatko Dalic's plans going out the window after about half an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Spain, who beat Croatia on penalties to win the Nations League last year, next play Italy while Croatia take on Albania.</p>
        
            <p>Defending champions Italy recovered from the shock of conceding to Albania after 23 seconds to begin their campaign with a 2-1 win in front of a largely Albanian crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Nedim Bajrami pounced on Federico Dimarco's poor throw-in to smash the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma for the fastest ever European Championship goal.</p>
        
            <p>Italy equalised in the 11th minute through Alessandro Bastoni's towering header and Nicolo Barella put them ahead five minutes later, meeting a poor clearance with a superb strike from the edge of the box.</p>
        
            <p>Although Italy controlled the game after Bajrami's goal, they created few clearcut chances in the second half and coach Luciano Spalletti cut a frustrated figure as his side failed to kill the game off but they held on to move level with Spain at the top of Group B.</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland began their campaign in style with a 3-1 Group A victory over tournament dark horses Hungary with Kwadwo Duah, Michel Aebischer and Breel Embolo all on target.</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland resisted late Hungarian pressure and Embolo seized on a defensive error in stoppage time to seal the points and put the Swiss level with Germany on three points after the hosts thrashed Scotland 5-1.</p>
