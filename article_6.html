            <p>TJ Perenara could be set for an All Blacks recall in 2024 and he reckons a few of his young teammates might be making their test debuts next month.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes halfback is focused on this weekend's Super Rugby semi-final with the Chiefs in Wellington, which shapes as an All Blacks trial in all but name, but he was happy to discuss the players in his side who he thinks have done enough to earn higher honours.</p>
        
            <p>"I think a lot of boys have put their hand up," Perenara said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not my spot to say who should or shouldn't be in the All Blacks, but people that have played really well for us this year, the likes of Brayden Iose (loose forward), Peter Lakai (loose forward) have been amazing. Xavier Numia (prop) has played some of the best football of his career and then you've got Rueben Love (fullback/first-five) who's been solid for us at the back and when he touches the ball he often makes something happen.</p>

            <p>"Some other players in our environment who probably don't get as much credit, Josh Moorby (midfielder/back) has been one of our most consistent players this year. Billy Proctor (midfielder) has been probably our best player over the last two or three years and the glue that he is for our team is super important for us."</p>

            <p>Perenara would love to regain his place in the national side after last playing for New Zealand on the 2022 end of year tour, where he ruptured his Achilles in the 25-25 draw with England. It was an injury that would keep him sidelined until this Super Rugby season.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing for the Hurricanes and playing for the All Blacks is a massive driver for me. I love this club and to get back into the All Blacks is something that I really passionate about doing and I want to give myself the opportunity to do that," Perenara said.</p>

            <p>Perenara has 80 caps for the All Blacks and with his Hurricanes teammate Cam Roigard out of action with a long-term injury, it's expected the man from Mana College will be selected in new All Blacks coach Scott Robertson's squad to take on England in two-tests next month, which is named on Monday 24 June following the Super Rugby final, a game which Perenara wants to be in.</p>
        
            <p>He was part of the Hurricanes side that won the franchise's first title in 2016, what he describes as a career highlight.</p>

            <p>"Yeah definitely. Being able to win Super Rugby for the first time for the club I grew up supporting and the club I love is a massive thing that I look back on and I'm really proud of and it's something I want to achieve again with this club."</p>
        
            <p>The Porirua-raised 32-year-old, of NgƒÅti Rangitihi, has also felt the sting of being beaten in a final, with Perenara part of the Hurricanes side that lost the 2015 title decider to the Highlanders in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"Losing isn't a great feeling at any stage but to lose a final at home was really tough."</p>

            <p>Perenara hasn't talked about that contrast of feelings with any of the current Hurricanes. He said they're firmly focused on creating their own history.</p>
        
            <p>"People can get lost in what they're trying to achieve or what they're scared of not achieving and they forget about the detail that goes in to preparing to put yourself in a position to get what you want.</p>
        
            <p>"A big part of what we're trying to drive here is really just enjoying the journey and the opportunity we've got to play a semi-final at home and everything that comes with that. If our minds are focused on just winning on Saturday then we'll forget about the small details that go into the week that give us the best chance to win."</p>
