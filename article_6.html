            <p>Oleksandr Usyk's place as a future hall of fame inductee cannot be disputed.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old Ukrainian is a fighter who will be heralded as a boxing great in years to come.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday (Sunday 10am NZT), Usyk will look to further secure his legacy by becoming the first ever four-belt heavyweight champion when he takes on Briton Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        
            <p>"Oleksandr is a superstar," former opponent Tony Bellew tells BBC Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Usyk reigned supreme as an amateur, winning European, world and Olympic gold.</p>
        
            <p>In the paid ranks, Usyk won his first cruiserweight world title in just his 10th professional bout, before travelling to fellow champions' backyards and cleaning up the division within five fights.</p>
        
            <p>"If he beats Tyson, he can go down as one of the greatest fighters ever," says Bellew.</p>
        
            <p>After defending his undisputed cruiserweight crown against Bellew in November 2018, Usyk - with nothing left to achieve in the division - jumped to heavyweight.</p>
        
            <p>Quite remarkably, the 6'3" Usyk had previously fought as a middleweight in the amateurs.</p>
        
            <p>For all his natural talent and boxing prowess though, there were question marks over whether he had the size to compete with boxing's big boys.</p>
        
            <p>Only Evander Holyfield and Briton David Haye had won world titles in both divisions.</p>
        
            <p>But with a strong focus on strength and conditioning, swimming and full-body workouts, Usyk steadily built into the weight.</p>
        
            <p>He took 10 months out and added just over a stone - weighing 15 stone 3 lbs (96.62kg) - for his heavyweight debut against Chazz Witherspoon.</p>
        
            <p>Despite still giving up nearly two stone, Usyk eased to a stoppage win.</p>
        
            <p>He gained two more pounds for a harder-than-expected points win over British gatekeeper Derek Chisora in October 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"He wanted to stand there with 'Del Boy' and see how the power was and whether he could take the punch - which he did," Bellew says.</p>
        
            <p>Witherspoon and Chisora were far from elite-level contenders but Usyk felt ready for a huge step up in opponent against champion Joshua.</p>
        
            <p>Usyk - who missed the birth of his child while training for Fury earlier this year - is dedicated to his craft.</p>
        
            <p>Swimming forms a key part of his training. According to his manager, Egis Klimas, Usyk swam 10km non-stop as preparation and was able to hold his breath for four minutes and 40 seconds.</p>

            <p>Juggling and catching coins are Usyk's staple party tricks, but they too signify the importance he places on shaping his cat-like reflexes.</p>
        
            <p>The training and focus paid dividends against Joshua - Usyk's resilience and fitness levels were on full show when he outclassed the Briton for most of the 24 rounds they shared.</p>
        
            <p>Usyk came in at 15 stone 11 lbs (100.24kg) for both fights - which he seemingly feels is his optimal weight having tipped the scales around the same mark against Daniel Dubois in August.</p>
        
            <p>Joshua was 20 lbs (9.07kg) heavier and then 23 lbs (10.43kg) in the rematch.</p>
        
            <p>"I kept saying that Joshua was just too big, but the size was matched by just how good Usyk is," Bellew says.</p>
        
            <p>Still there are those who still question Usyk's heavyweight credentials.</p>
        
            <p>Bellew describes Usyk as a "novice heavyweight in some ways" having never been pushed to his "absolute limit".</p>
        
            <p>For Bellew, however, Usyk's superiority and ability to find an extra gear is key.</p>
        
            <p>"Usyk ticked all the boxes in the second AJ fight," Bellew says.</p>
        
            <p>"Going into round nine or 10, he is behind or it's level. Then going into the championship rounds, Usyk just finds another level."</p>
        
            <p>When negotiations for the Fury fight in April 2023 stalled, Usyk turned his attention to WBA mandatory challenger Dubois.</p>
        
            <p>Dubois landed a body shot in the fifth round, sending Usyk to the canvas. The punch was declared a low blow.</p>
        
            <p>"In my humble opinion, my guy delivered and landed the perfect blow on the beltline and he should be the one facing Tyson Fury," Dubois' trainer Don Charles tells BBC Sport.</p>

            <p>Regardless of the legalities of the punch, Charles says it exposed an Usyk vulnerability.</p>
        
            <p>"It was well documented prior to Daniel facing him that Usyk doesn't like being hit to the body," Charles says.</p>
        
            <p>"He has an old injury here. There were moments in the second AJ fight where he turned around citing a low blow but it wasn't."</p>
        
            <p>Usyk was dropped by body shots twice in the amateurs. On both occasions, Usyk rose to his feet and outpointed his opponent.</p>
        
            <p>Former world champion Hannah Rankin believes Fury might be "too big" for Usyk.</p>
        
            <p>"If he can target the body, it could be Usyk's undoing," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Bellew, however, dismisses this supposed weakness as a "myth."</p>
        
            <p>"I've had my ribs broken on numerous occasions. It hurts and it's not nice, but he's not weaker than anyone else in the body," Bellew says.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe he doesn't carry as much protection around the midriff than someone like Tyson Fury, but he takes a body shot like everyone else."</p>
