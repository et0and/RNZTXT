            <p>Kiwis v Tonga</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 8:05pm Saturday 2 November</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Stadium, Auckland</p>

            <p>Both sides have come up short against the Kangaroos in relatively low-scoring affairs to start off the Pacific Championships. So, their true standard of international football will be revealed on Saturday night when the Kiwis finally take on Tonga at a sold out Mount Smart Stadium, in front of a sea of red and black.</p>
        
            <p>It has always an explosive match-up when these two sides meet and with a spot in the Pacific Championship men's final on the line, expect both teams to leave it all out on the field.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis will be looking to bounce back from a clunky performance against Australia, one that showed plenty of promise but lacked serious cohesion. The 22 - 10 score line was reflective of the arm wrestle between the two teams.</p>
        
            <p>Tonga's 18 - 0 defeat to Australia also was not completely reflective of the effort on the field. Tonga displayed good resilience in defence, with the score only blowing out a little at the end.</p>

            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis: 1. Keano Kini 2. Jamayne Isaako 3. Matthew Timoko 4. Peta Hiku 5. Will Warbrick 6. Charnze Nicole-Klokstad 7. Shaun Johnson 8. James Fisher-Harris (C) 9. Phoenix Crossland 10. Joseph Tapine 11. Isaiah Papali'i 12. Scott Sorensen 13. Naufahu Whyte</p>

            <p>Tonga: 1. Lei Hopoate 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Mosese Suli 4. Paul Alamoti 5. Sione Katoa 6. Tuimoala Lolohea 7. Isaiya Katoa 8. Addin Fonta-Blake (C) 9. Siliva Havili 10. Felise Kaufusi 11. Haumole Olakau'atu 12. Eliesa Katoa 13. Jason Taumalolo</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Soni Luke 15. Sitili Tuponiua 16. Taniela Paseka 17. Siua Wong</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis have opted to field pretty much the same line-up they did against Australia last week, apart from a few minor changes.</p>
        
            <p>Leo Thompson comes in for Jordan Riki on the bench, while Griffin Neame is benched. Joe Tapine moves to prop with Naufahu Whyte starting in the 13 jumper.</p>

            <p>Tonga has made just the one change from their line-up against the Australian's two weeks back. Keaon Koloamatangi has left the squad to be with his partner who is due to give birth and is replaced by Roosters young gun Siua Wong on the bench.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis 34 - 14 Tonga</p>
        
            <p>In what was revenge for Kiwis after their shocking 28 - 22 loss to Tonga in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, the Kiwis returned serve by laying down a masterclass in attacking football.</p>
        
            <p>Storm hooker Brandon Smith absolutely tore the Tongan defence to shreds out of dummy half. But just as the rivalry was starting the build, this ended up being the last time the two nations have faced off due to the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams have gone down in tight arm wrestles against Australia that - despite the scoreboards - could have gone either way, had it not been for missed opportunities. Both will be looking to play with more attacking flair and cohesion.</p>
        
            <p>It will be interesting to see the game plans both sides lead with after both put relatively conservative efforts forward against the Kangaroos.</p>
        
            <p>It would serve the Kiwis best to not take this challenge from Tonga lightly and vice versa - if Tonga comes out to play with a serious and formulated game plan, they will threaten.</p>
