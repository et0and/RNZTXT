            <p>The Crusaders have been stung 37-24 by the New South Wales Waratahs in a massive upset in Super Rugby Pacific in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>The defending champions have lost their first two matches of the season for the first time since 2014.</p>
        
            <p>In their first match against an Australian side this season the Rob Penney coached side were coming off a first round loss to the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>But that didn't spark the Crusaders in the Super Round.</p>
        
            <p>The Canterbury side were in front for just 12 minutes on the night, as the Waratahs ran in four tries in a performance led by 23-year-old first-five Tane Edmed.</p>

            <p>Defeat leaves the Crusaders with a daunting task to get their first win of the year, with a trip to Lautoka next weekend to face Fijian Drua away from home.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Rob Penney said it's a big learning curve for his the new-look Crusaders side.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still a bit of work to do there...they're talented boys and we've got to make sure that they're not too badly affected by today," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"We started well and then we fell into a bit of a hole. We made a few errors and gave away a few penalties and we weren't able to build any momentum on the back of that.</p>
        
            <p>"When we built pressure we'd release it and they capitalised on their turnovers and got the maximum out of it.</p>
        
            <p>"The yellow cards were very frustrating given our inability to build momentum, it makes it very difficult."</p>
        
            <p>With the loss the Crusaders are 10th on the ladder.</p>
        
            <p>And Moana Pasifika beat Fijian Drua 39-36 in a thriller in Melbourne.</p>
