            <p>Auckland boxer David Nyika's Australian opponent Blake Caparello has failed a drugs test just over a week out from their cruiserweight fight in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Caparello, a former WBO title challenger, failed a test for elevated testosterone levels and was set to be pulled from the fight against Nyika on 14 September.</p>
        
            <p>The fight at Auckland's Viaduct Event Centre was billed as the feature bout on a card which also included former All Black Liam Messam and New Zealand heavyweight Hemi Ahio, and was set to be the toughest test so far of Nyika's fledgling pro career.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika, an Olympic Games bronze medallist and two time Commonwealth Games gold medallist, has had nine professional fights so far and won eight of them by knockout.</p>
        
            <p>Caparello's resume revealed an impeccable record against Kiwi opponents - with Robert Berridge, Daniel MacKinnon, Reece Papuni, Lance Bryant and Jordan Tai all having been dispatched by the Australian, who has won 32 fights, lost four and drawn one.</p>
        
            <p>Caparello's positive test will leave organisers scrambling to find a new opponent for Nyika.</p>
