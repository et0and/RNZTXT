            <p>The US Center for SafeSport has permanently banned Australian Olympic figure skater Brendan Kerry for sexual misconduct involving a minor, the body said in a ruling on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The ruling, which is subject to appeal, bans Kerry for life from any events or activities controlled by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).</p>
        
            <p>Kerry, 29, competed at three Winter Olympics and was one of Australia's two flagbearers at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Games, his last major international competition.</p>
        
            <p>Kerry was a registered coach with US Figure Skating in the 2016-17 season, when the misconduct was alleged to have occurred.</p>
        
            <p>Attempts to contact Kerry through Ice Skating Australia (ISA) were not immediately successful.</p>
        
            <p>ISA said in a statement it had been unaware of the investigation or the sanction until its release on Wednesday morning Australia time.</p>
        
            <p>"ISA is deeply committed to the safety and wellbeing of all athletes and considers this matter to be of the utmost seriousness," it added.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in the process gathering and considering all information available in relation to the determination by the US Centre for SafeSport."</p>
        
            <p>The US Center for SafeSport was established in 2017 with the aim of protecting athletes, particularly minors, from sexual abuse in Olympic sports programmes in the United States.</p>
