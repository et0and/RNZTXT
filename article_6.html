            <p>Auckland City have been beaten 3-0 by Saudi club Al-Ittihad at the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The home side dominated the game and were ahead 3-0 at half time following goals from Brazilian Romarinho and Frenchmen N'Golo Kante and Karim Benzama.</p>
        
            <p>The second half didn't live up to the excitement of the first 45 minutes although Al-Ittihad did continue to have scoring chances.</p>
        
            <p>The Saudis had 27 attempts on goal compared to Auckland's four.</p>
        
            <p>Afterwards Auckland City player Nathan Lobo said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an experience of a lifetime. We don't get to play in stadiums like this and play against stars like that. It's amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Al Ittihad now go on to meet African champions Al Ahly of Egypt in the second round.</p>
        
            <p>City goalkeeper Conor Tracey made a number of good saves to keep them in the game.</p>
        
            <p>South American champions Fluminense and European champions Manchester City join the competition at the semi-final stage.</p>
        
            <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is made up of the six Confederation champions plus a club from the host country.</p>
