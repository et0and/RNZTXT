            <p>The Warriors led from start to finish to post their second straight win of the NRL season with a 20-12 win against the Newcastle Knights in a repeat of last year's NRL finals clash.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland side scored three tries to two in the round four thriller with the Knights closing in on the home side at the finish.</p>
        
            <p>Despite losing speedy five-eighth Luke Metcalf in the early stages, replacement Chanel Harris-Tavita made an impact for the Auckland side.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors captain Tohu Harris told Sky Sport while there were lapses in the game there was plenty to like after they went to the break leading 12-6.</p>
        
            <p>"They came with a bit of intensity especially in that first half, it was a tough one out there," Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just happy we managed to put in the effort and get the two points."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors suffered a blow in the 10th minute with playmaker Luke Metcalf leaving the field with a leg injury.</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf's night came to an abrupt end after a heavy hit from Tyson Frizell in the tackle.</p>
        
            <p>After losing their five-eighth, the Warriors were the first team to put points on the board in the 16th minute when second-rower Jackson Ford received a pass from Shaun Johnson to slice through the gap over the line.</p>
        
            <p>Utility Chanel Harris-Tavita came onto the bench in a late line-up change and was called into action early as a substitution for Metcalf.</p>
        
            <p>He made his mark immediately after Wayde Egan made a clean break out of dummy half to score next to the posts as the Warriors chalked up back-to-back tries to lead 12-0.</p>
        
            <p>The Knights came back into the game on attack with a Tyson Gamble grubber kick which bounced perfectly for Tyson Frizell who gathered for the Knights first points, to take the score to 12-6.</p>
        
            <p>Some defensive lapses highlighted by a dropped ball from Roger Tuivasa-Sheck gave the Knights the chance to score again but some steady defence held the visitors approaching halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors produced a stunning moment to start the second half off a high kick from Chanel Harris-Tavita.</p>
        
            <p>Marcelo Montoya soared over the defence to collect the ball and score in the corner, with a wide conversion from Shaun Johnson taking the score to 18-6.</p>
        
            <p>A Shaun Johnson penalty pushed the lead out to 20-6.</p>
        
            <p>A Kalyn Ponga grubber was collected by Bradman Best allowing the Knights to close the gap in the 73rd minute, closing the gap 20-12.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors captain Tohu Harris also commended halfback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck for his performance at halfback as he covered for injuries to Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad and Taine Tuaupiki.</p>
        
            <p>"Our outside backs have been outstanding for the past year and a bit so adding Roger (Tuivasa-Sheck) to that only helps that," Tohu Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's exciting for us to have outside backs who can do some damage like that."</p>
        
            <p>Hooker Egan was a welcome return for the Warriors in the win.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors move to eighth on the standings, and next take on the South Sydney Rabbitohs.</p>
