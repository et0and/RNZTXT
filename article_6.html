            <p>A New Zealand basketball legend, a former Football Fern, a dual international, a New Zealand tennis representative and the founder of a women's sports media organisation have created history.</p>
        
            <p>The five women have come together to purchase the Kāhu basketball team, making the national champions the first all-women-owned sports team in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Kāhu coach and former Tall Fern Jody Cameron is part of the quintet that believe they are part of a world-first: the first time a sports team has been solely owned, coached, and managed by an all-female team.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to create environments where professional women athletes can excel, where women can be themselves, and where the foundation is there to support their growth," Cameron said.</p>
        
            <p>The Kāhu, which represents Auckland and Northland, are one of five teams in the rapidly growing Tauihi league, which enters its third season next month.</p>
        
            <p>Joining Cameron in the ownership group is former Football Fern and Olympian Rachel Howard; a World Cup winning former England rugby captain Paula 'Georgie' George who also represented Wales in netball; Jo Caird a former New Zealand junior tennis representative and the first official photographer for the All Blacks; and American Dani Marshall the founder of the award-winning womenzsports media outlet.</p>
        
            <p>"This purchase is about more than basketball - it's about reshaping the narrative of women's sports in New Zealand and globally," Caird said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now is the time to reimagine the possibilities for women's sport in New Zealand. We've seen how differently female athletes perform on the court/field; now, let's see what we can do as owners."</p>

            <p>Howard said the best time to invest in women's sports "is now".</p>
        
            <p>"We aim to prove that women's sports are commercially viable in New Zealand, and we plan to use that business model to elevate all women's sports across the country."</p>
        
            <p>The ownership group was bringing a fresh approach to sports franchises, Marshall said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen the traditional models and we know what needs to be done better. Women's sports fans deserve a purpose-built engagement strategy that welcomes overlooked communities who may not even consider themselves 'sports fans.'</p>
        
            <p>"We want to earn the trust of our community so they want to invest in the team - both figuratively and literally."</p>
        
            <p>George said the women wanted the ownership group to "reflect our society."</p>
        
            <p>"An integral part of our work is around creating pathways for young girls to see new opportunities."</p>
        
            <p>The Tauihi league was the first professional women's basketball league in New Zealand and it committed to pay parity with the men's league from the tip off.</p>
        
            <p>Player wages in the women's league would more than double for the upcoming season.</p>
        
            <p>The Kāhu start their title defence on 6 October against the Southern Hoiho.</p>
