            <p>A new Olympic glossary featuring new Māori words has been created to encourage te reo use during this year's games.</p>
        
            <p>Te Reo Māori ki Parī 2024 is the first Olympic Games glossary in Māori and English.</p>
        
            <p>The resource was crafted by Sky, the New Zealand Olympic Committee and the Māori Language Commission.</p>
        
            <p>It contains more than 1000 terms and phrases across 30 Olympic Games sporting codes.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Olympic Committee Māori culture lead Oriini Kaipara told Morning Report she was stoked with the glossary.</p>
        
            <p>The terms were initially crafted for sports commentators covering the event to increase use of te reo, Kaipara said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then we thought, you know, there's a large proportion of the general population here in New Zealand and abroad that actually don't know the Māori language, whether it's about sport or not."</p>
        
            <p>They designed the glossary with all types of speakers in mind, from beginners to advanced users.</p>
        
            <p>Some examples of the phrases and words are:</p>
