        <h2>Golfers in for a tough test at US Open</h2>
        <p>
This week's US Open course will be "tough but fair" tournament organisers insist, in the wake of concerns from players that the greens are already "borderline" out of control.

            <p>This week's US Open course will be "tough but fair" tournament organisers insist, in the wake of concerns from players that the greens are already "borderline" out of control.</p>
        
            <p>The 124th staging of golf's second-oldest major is at the notoriously tough Number Two course at Pinehurst.</p>
        
            <p>Only four players have finished under par in three previous US Opens held at the North Carolina track.</p>
        
            <p>Defending champion Wyndham Clark said on Monday the pace of the undulating greens was "borderline" in terms of being too quick, while on Tuesday three-time winner Tiger Woods said he and other players had "putted balls off the green" and he was expecting a "war of attrition" this week.</p>
        
            <p>In defence, John Bodenhamer of the United States Golf Association (USGA), said: "We're going to be the USGA. It's going to be the US Open.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to be tough but fair. The players know that. I think they want that. I think that they want to win something special.</p>
        
            <p>"We're tough but fair because when you win, it means what Bob Jones won, what Ben Hogan won, what Tiger won. It just means more.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about the score. It's about getting every club in a player's bag dirty, including the one between their ears.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not looking to be everybody's best friend, but we are looking to earn their respect."</p>
        
            <p>Germany's Martin Kaymer won with a score of nine-under, eight clear of the field, the last time the US Open was held at Pinehurst in 2014. Payne Stewart won on one-under in 1999, while level par was good enough for New Zealander Michael Campbell to beat Woods by two shots in 2005.</p>
        
            <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler is the hot favourite to finish top of the leaderboard. Since March the American has played eight events and won five, including the Masters.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Fox is the only New Zealander in the field this year.</p>
