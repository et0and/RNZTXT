        <h2>Bumbling Blues fall to brave Brumbies in Eden Park upset</h2>
        <p>
To add injury to insult, the Blues lost Beauden Barrett at halftime and couldn't score a point after.

            <p>The Blues are officially in crisis mode after a shock 21-20 loss to the Brumbies at Eden Park. The result leaves them with one win out of their four games and an uphill battle looming to defend their Super Rugby Pacific title.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement halfback Ryan Lonergan was the hero for the Brumbies, nervelessly knocking through a penalty from 35 metres out in the 79th minute. It came after the Blues had ample opportunity to close out what would've been an unsatisfactory victory but bumbled their way to giving up a free kick at a lineout and then the penalty from a scrum.</p>
        
            <p>The first half was more of an arm wrestle but still delivered a couple of excellent tries, with Beauden Barrett slicing through the defence to open the scoring. Angus Ta'avao finished off a fantastic move that started on their own 22 when Cole Forbes broke out and linked with Rieko Ioane. Not long after, Cam Christie pinched a Brumbies' lineout and Finlay Christie did really well to find a flying Cam Suafoa, who sent Ioane away to score his 50th Super Rugby try.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Brumbies just wouldn't give up, first Declan Meredith added a penalty to Alan Alaalatoa's first half try, then scored one of his own in the corner to close the gap up to an uncomfortable two-point lead for the Blues. From then on, the Brumbies simply did a better job of keeping the ball in the right part of the field, culminating in Lonergan's late heroics.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett didn't return after halftime with a hand injury, and despite a decent turn by Harry Plummer at first five, his absence was clearly felt.</p>
