            <p>The All Blacks' biggest success story of last season is set to potentially miss the entire Super Rugby Pacific campaign. It was confirmed on Thursday by the Chiefs that Wallace Sititi will require surgery for a knee injury, understood to have been picked up on the end of year tour.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Chiefs said that Sititi would undergo surgery on Friday. Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan will face media this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>While Sititi's debut test season grabbed the world's attention, it came as little surprise to anyone who had followed the Chiefs' run to the Super Rugby Pacific season. His performances led to many tagging him as a future All Black but Scott Robertson pulled the trigger early and picked the 22-year-old for his initial squad, with a debut against Fiji followed by outstanding starts at number eight against the Springboks.</p>

            <p>By the time the end of year tour rolled around, Sititi was a confirmed starter and played every test match.</p>
        
            <p>Sititi's absence is a blow, but the Chiefs do have ample depth in their loose forwards.</p>
        
            <p>Current captain Luke Jacobson and Samipeni Finau are both current All Blacks, while they have acquired Jahrome Brown from the Brumbies. Simon Parker, Kaylum Boshier and Malachi Wrampling are also on the books while locks Naitoa Ah Kuoi, Jimmy Tupou and Tupou Vaa'i are all capable of playing at blindside if a reshuffle is needed.</p>
        
            <p>McMillan will also be without Shaun Stevenson for the first four rounds as well, after the fullback confirmed a short term deal to play for Kubota Spears in the Japanese Rugby League One competition.</p>
        
            <p>... More to come</p>
