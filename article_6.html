            <p>A late goal from Central Coast Mariners has denied A-League competition leaders Auckland FC a win in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The teams drew 2-2 after Nicholas Duarte scored in the 90th minute for the Mariners.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland side had led twice, taking the early lead through a Guillermo May goal, and going ahead 2-1 via a Callan Elliot strike in the 79th minute.</p>
        
            <p>While they will be kicking themselves about missing out on three points that seemed theirs, the one point they get for the draw extends their competition lead over Western United FC by seven points.</p>
