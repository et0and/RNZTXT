            <p>Double Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner set his sights on mastering clay and grass courts to make himself a complete player after the Italian claimed his third hardcourt Grand Slam title.</p>
        
            <p>The world number one retained his Melbourne Park crown with an emphatic 6-3 7-6(4) 6-3 victory over Alexander Zverev in Rod Laver Arena, four months after his U.S. Open triumph, to further underpin his status as the hottest player on the surface.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner has reached the semi-finals at the French Open and Wimbledon in the last two seasons but the 23-year-old said he hoped to assert his authority on clay and grass this year.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to be a complete player, not only on one surface but on also the other two," Sinner told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe last year wasn't a bad season at all on clay and on grass. I can do better, yes, but let's see. I mean, these are questions that I can answer by playing."</p>
        
            <p>Sinner, who has won 37 of his last 38 matches on hardcourts, said he would dedicate his time and energy to going far in the other Grand Slams.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still young and I have time to adjust, especially on grasscourts, because I've never played the juniors. It was new when I arrived on the tour," Sinner added.</p>
        
            <p>"It's exactly that what I like; the difficulties trying to understand where I can improve. Hopefully I can show that when the season arrives."</p>
        
            <p>Sinner's latest triumph showed his ability to stay fully focused despite a doping case stemming from two failed drug tests in March last year that is hanging over his head.</p>

            <p>Cleared to continue playing by tennis anti-doping bodies, the Italian could face a ban of up to two years after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and a hearing is set to start on April 16.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very proud," Sinner said about his ability to shut out the noise and let his tennis do the talking.</p>
        
            <p>"It's tough to describe. Many things happen off the court, what you maybe don't know. When I go on court, even if sometimes it's very difficult to block these kind of things, I have the team and people who are close to me who trust me.</p>
        
            <p>"That for me is even more important because I can talk with them very openly. When I go on to the court, I try and focus on the match. I know the match can be three, four, five hours, but that's the gap of the day where I have to be very focused.</p>
        
            <p>"In the gym, trying to keep your routine, then you think a bit less about what's happening. Of course, it's still a little bit in the back of your mind. I know that I'm in this position now. So (there's) nothing I can change."</p>
