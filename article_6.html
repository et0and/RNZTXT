            <p>All Blacks loose foward Luke Jacobson has been named captain of the Chiefs for the upcoming Super Rugby season.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobson's played 63 matches for the Chiefs having made his debut in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>He'll be the side's sole captain, with the club dropping the co-captaincy roles it had last season with Sam Cane and Brad Weber.</p>
        
            <p>Cane won't turn out for the Chiefs this season as he's currently playing in Japan and will return home later in the year while Weber's now playing in France.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobson said it wasn't an honour he was expecting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not really a role I search for but one I'm bloody proud to fill. I'm looking forward to working with the team and doing everything we can to go that one step further this year."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Clayton McMillan said Jacobson had "always been viewed as a future Chiefs captain.</p>
        
            <p>"Luke is also no stranger to captaincy, having led the team with aplomb on several occasions over the last few years.</p>
        
            <p>"He will have learned plenty...but is his own man and will no doubt cut his own path."</p>
        
            <p>This week, Jacobson will travel with the Chiefs to Japan for their first pre-season games with the Chiefs first Super Rugby Pacific match of the season against the defending champions the Crusaders in Hamilton on February 23rd.</p>
