            <p>The New Zealand Sevens teams are still searching for their first tournament titles of the new World Series.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens finished third and the All Black Sevens fifth in the second round in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>Last week the women were beaten finalists and the men were third in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>Australia top the women's standings after winning both tournaments with France and New Zealand six points back in a share of second.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina top the men's standings after winning in Cape Town, while New Zealand are ten points back in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns were beaten 24-12 by France in their semi-final and they then beat the USA 19-7 in the play-off for third, while the All Blacks lost 36-21 to Ireland in the quarter-finals and then beat South Africa 31-7 in the fifth place play-off.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns Sevens player Stacey Waka told Sky Sport there's no need to panic for the defending series champions as they try to find some consistency.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a bit of a mindset," she said.</p>
        
            <p>We've changed our team around a lot which is good, the depth in the squad is awesome.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to start clicking and we've got time, Perth Sevens is a month away and we know what to work on and we'll go home and do that."</p>
        
            <p>The Perth round is on January 26-28.</p>
