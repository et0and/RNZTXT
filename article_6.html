            <p>The 31-year-old loosehead played four tests for the All Blacks in 2020 and qualifies for the Wallabies through his Fijian-Australian father after moving to the Queensland Reds this year.</p>
        
            <p>Hodgman will become the first player in the professional era to represent both New Zealand and Australia if he takes the field at Sydney Football Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Following Australia's 2-0 series win over struggling Wales, new Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt has made 10 changes to the starting 15 that beat the Welsh 36-28 in Melbourne last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>They include uncapped winger Darby Lancaster, who played rugby sevens for Australia before picking up a contract at the now-defunct Melbourne Rebels this year.</p>
