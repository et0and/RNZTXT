            <p>The New Zealand SailGP team has extended its lead in the series standings after finishing second at the latest round in Bermuda.</p>
        
            <p>Spain won the final to claim their second SailGP victory, with New Zealand second and Australia third.</p>
        
            <p>It means with three rounds remaining Peter Burling's crew has 77 points, Australia 67 and Spain 65.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealanders' hopes of making the final looked precarious after a sixth in the fourth round, but they edged out their rivals in race five to qualify.</p>
        
            <p>Spain and New Zealand quickly pulled ahead of Australia in the final, but despite staying within seconds throughout, the New Zealanders could not get past Spain.</p>
        
            <p>Black Foils wing trimmer Blair Tuke said Spain deserved its win.</p>
        
            <p>"As we know in the finals, it's often the boat that leads to mark one that wins. We gave them a good push and had an opportunity to sneak past on the first upwind, but they put together a perfect race from there."</p>

            <p>Tuke said the New Zealand team was delighted to have sneaked into the final after a tough weekend, with a struggle for form form on the opening day.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely not our best work, but the team showed a huge amount of skill around the racetrack - boat speed, positioning, manoeuvres were all really good and that enabled us to fight back when we were in the pack."</p>
        
            <p>The next round is in Halifax, Canada in early June, followed by New York and then the grand final in San Francisco.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has won four of the ten rounds so far this season with podium finishes in two others.</p>
