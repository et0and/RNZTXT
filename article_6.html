            <p>South Sydney's poor start to the NRL season has been compounded by fullback Latrell Mitchell's three-week ban for elbowing the Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson in the face last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell pleaded guilty to a grade-two dangerous contact charge following his side's 34-4 defeat in Sydney, which left the Rabbitohs last on the ladder with just one win from five games.</p>
        
            <p>He will miss the Rabbitohs' games against the Sharks, Storm and Panthers.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Roosters winger Dom Young has pleaded guilty to a careless high tackle charge and will miss two matches.</p>
        
            <p>Young was the first player sent off this season following the 27th minute high tackle on Blake Taaffe last Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The England winger will miss the next two games against the Knights and Storm before being available for the Anzac Day match against the Dragons.</p>
        
            <p>And the Dolphins utility Kurt Donoghoe has also copped a two-game ban after pleading guilty to high tackle on Wests Tigers player Fainu Samuela in his side's 26-16 win last Saturday in Brisbane.</p>
