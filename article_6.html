            <p>White Ferns captain Sophie Devine can see the green shoots of progress despite the disappointment of a 3-0 Twenty20 series loss to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were competitive for a third straight game but couldn't get past the defending world champions, who achieved their five-wicket win in Brisbane on the first ball of the final over.</p>
        
            <p>It was the White Ferns' 10th successive defeat in the T20 format, a record they'll mull over as they travel to Dubai for the World Cup in the UAE starting in just over a week.</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Plimmer scored 53 off 48 balls - her maiden international half-century - as New Zealand posted 146 for six before Australia responded with 148 for five, with offspinner Eden Carson taking 2-29.</p>
        
            <p>Devine wasn't downbeat following a third match in which they'd pushed the hosts hard in their home conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew the challenge we were up against, playing Australia, they're the world's best team for a really good reason," Devine said.</p>
        
            <p>"So plenty of positives for us to take out of this series. It would have been nice to get a win but I think we're really trending in the right direction.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll reflect and review quickly - it's about taking away the positives and moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>Devine was hopeful Plimmer had produced an innings that might propel her career forward.</p>
        
            <p>Always regarded as a talented batter, the 20-year-old opener has taken 38 innings in white ball internationals to reach 50.</p>
        
            <p>Devine compared her progress to young wicketkeeper/batter Izzy Gaze, whose maiden half-century also came this year, against England in March.</p>
        
            <p>"It was huge (for Plimmer) and we saw it with Izzy earlier this year when she scored that 50 - it's almost like the floodgates opened and she's got that belief," Devine said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen the potential in the nets, we've seen the hard work that she's put in behind the closed doors.</p>
        
            <p>"For her to get a reward against a top quality Australian side, hopefully that sets her on her way."</p>
        
            <p>Plimmer put on 45 for the opening stand with Suzie Bates (19) before a second-wicket partnership of 73 with Amelia Kerr (40)</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will play World Cup warmup matches in Dubai next week against South Africa and England before their opening pool game against India, on 5 October.</p>
