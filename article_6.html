            <p>Former All Whites Winston Reid, Tim Brown and Noah Hickey are backing A-League side Auckland FC by joining the investment group.</p>
        
            <p>The former players bring business nous and playing experience to the new football club.</p>
        
            <p>After a career that included more than 150 professional games and 30 as a New Zealand international, LA-based Brown has gone on to co-found sustainable shoe brand Allbirds.</p>
        
            <p>Hickey had a 10-year professional career in Auckland, Europe and for the All Whites. Now based in San Diego, since retiring from football Hickey has built a successful career helping startup businesses reach their potential, as an early investor in New Zealand fintech business, Pushpay and co-founded fashion business, Asuwere.</p>
        
            <p>For former All White and West Ham captain Reid, the chance to support the club in the city he was born in was a huge factor in his joining.</p>
        
            <p>Reid says he is passionate about helping the next generation succeed at the highest level and brings a huge amount of experience and expertise to Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>"Becoming a professional football player is one of the hardest things to achieve, it takes more than just talent. I'm humbled by the opportunity to give back some of my own experiences as a professional footballer, to the next generation," Reid said.</p>

            <p>Brown wanted to help boost the profile of football.</p>
        
            <p>"Considering the number of people locally who are playing it and its global appeal, football is massively under-represented in New Zealand. Auckland FC represents an opportunity to change that for the benefit of players as well as the wider NZ football community," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>Hickey also saw the potential for growing the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I've played football in Auckland, Europe and internationally. Being overseas you really notice the cultural behemoth football is and its ability to bring people from all backgrounds together," Hickey said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a great opportunity here to do that in Auckland, to unite the city and create better pathways for future players to make it professionally."</p>

            <p>The trio join existing local owners Ali Williams and Anna Mowbray. The club remains majority owned by American businessman Bill Foley.</p>
        
            <p>"The strength of our investor group continues to show that we are focused on long term success. We're not here to make up the numbers," Auckland FC chief executive Nick Becker said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are incredibly lucky that our owners recognise the growth trajectory that football is on in New Zealand and can see the opportunity that having a professional club in Auckland offers.</p>
        
            <p>"When I look at the calibre of the ownership team now in place I'm incredibly confident of what Auckland FC can offer; whether that be fans, players, staff, sponsors and Auckland at large. This is great news for us, but also great news for the city."</p>
        
            <p>The A-League season kicks off on 18 October.</p>
