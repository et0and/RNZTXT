            <p>World champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has reportedly been charged by police with causing the death of his wife after she was hit by a car on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>South Australia Police said a 32-year-old woman suffered serious injuries and died in hospital in Adelaide overnight.</p>
        
            <p>A statement added that a man, 33, had been arrested and charged with causing death by dangerous driving, driving without due care and endangering life.</p>
        
            <p>The driver was known to the woman and has been released on bail until March.</p>
        
            <p>It has been widely reported in Australian media that the man and woman are Dennis and his wife Melissa Hoskins.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskins was a world champion in the team pursuit in 2015 and raced at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>She and Dennis married in 2018 and have two children.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Dennis announced he would retire at the end of the 2023 season after a career in which he won stages at the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.</p>
        
            <p>A multiple world champion on both road and track, he won road time trial bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, having won team pursuit silver at London 2012.</p>
        
            <p>CPA Women, the worldwide association of women cyclists, said it was "shocked" by the news of Hoskins' death, adding: "We send our thoughts to those who love her, starting with her children, and were lucky enough to ride with her during an all too short life."</p>
