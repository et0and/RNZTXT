            <p>World Indoor champion Hamish Kerr is all set to compete alongside a star-studded high jump field in Doha on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The special one-off high jump spectacle, What Gravity Challenge, has been organised by Qatar high jump legend Mutaz Barshim, the reigning Olympic champion and three-time world champion.</p>
        
            <p>The event will be held at the Katara Amphitheatre.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr has been invited along with 11 other of the world's finest high jumpers which includes a trio of 2.40m plus jumpers and the reigning world and Olympic champions.</p>
        
            <p>However, despite the undoubted quality on show, given his recent form the 27-year-old Kiwi has nothing to fear from the opposition and will be seeking to maintain his excellent streak of results and pursue a first prize of $15,000USD (almost NZD$25,000).</p>
        
            <p>Winning the World Indoor title in Glasgow with a world leading jump and national record of 2.36m represented a huge breakthrough performance by the Christchurch-based jumper, who last month further cemented his status within the high jumping world by defeating Barshim to win the Suzhou Diamond League with a clearance of 2.31m.</p>
        
            <p>Barshim, the all-time world number two with a best of 2.43m, will look to avenge that defeat in front of a passionate home crowd, who will be desperate to see the Qatari claim top spot.</p>

            <p>Also entered is the reigning joint holder of the Olympic title - alongside Barshim - and current world champion Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy who competes in his first competition of the year.</p>
        
            <p>JuVaughn Harrison of the US, a 2.36m jumper like Kerr, and world silver medallist from last year is also entered as is Korean Sanghyeok Woo, a former world indoor champion who in Glasgow in March secured a World Indoor bronze medal.</p>
        
            <p>The experienced Ukrainian duo of Andrei Protsenko, the 2022 World Championships bronze medallist and 2013 World champion Bohdan Bondarenko, both 2.40m jumpers at their best, are also entered.</p>
        
            <p>"It is an amazing event to be a part of and outside of a major championship you are not likely to see a more stacked field," Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is credit to Barshim and his legacy that he has managed to put together such a quality event, which heralds a new era for our sport. Taking what is quite a traditional concept and putting it in a unique setting is a fantastic way to showcase high jump and our unique skillset."</p>
