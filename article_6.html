            <p>New Zealand, Australia, France and the US - the main contenders for gold in women's rugby sevens - all secured their places in the quarter-finals with a game to spare, chalking up two wins apiece on the first day of qualifying.</p>
        
            <p>All four are likely to finish first or second in their pools but even if they suffered surprise defeats in their final games they are already guaranteed to be at least among the two best third-placed finishers.</p>
        
            <p>After the extraordinary scenes of Saturday night, when France's men shocked Fiji 28-7 to win the country's first gold of the Games, there was another impressive near-capacity crowd on a sunny Sunday and they were in full voice when the hosts got underway with a 26-0 victory over 250-1 tournament outsiders Brazil.</p>
        
            <p>Tries by Joanna Grisez, Chloe Pelle, Seraphine Okemba and Ian Jason were greeted by deafening cheers, but at a higher pitch than on Saturday thanks to the huge numbers of female fans and youngsters in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The Tokyo silver medallists were then in total control from start to finish against Japan, with a hat-trick for Jason and six out of six conversions by Caroline Drouin the stand-outs in a 49-0 demolition job.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just crazy. It's crazy being here with all these crowds. We didn't expect such a crowd for the first day. It's unbelievable," said Okemba.</p>
        
            <p>"The men's win was just so inspiring to see. Being here in the same stadium pushes us to be better."</p>
        
            <p>Tournament favourites New Zealand were able to cruise through their first game as Michaela Blyde scored four tries in a 43-5 win over China.</p>

            <p>They were given a stiffer test by Canada in the final match of the day, but came through smoothly enough 33-7.</p>
        
            <p>Super-finisher Maddison Levi also got four as Australia opened with a 34-5 victory over South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The Aussies then clicked superbly into gear in the second half against Britain as Levi completed another hat-trick. Bienne Terita also got two as they came home 36-5.</p>
        
            <p>Levi, whose sister Teagan also scored a try in each match, was another to be blown away by the atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really special," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of surreal walking out into a stadium in front of so many people. They seem to know the sport and are really respectful when needed. It's awesome to see that, not only men's, but women's rugby sevens gets crowds like this."</p>
        
            <p>The sisters were presented with their match shirts by their parents in front of the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>"There wasn't a dry eye among the squad when it happened," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the defeat, Britain, having beaten Ireland in the first match of the day on Sunday, remain favourites to finish second in the pool.</p>
        
            <p>Britain have the unfortunate record of finishing fourth in both previous Olympic tournaments but will need to tighten their defence if they are to make a third successive semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>Ireland also put themselves in a strong position to potentially claim at least one of the best third-placed slots by pouring on 31 second-half points in a 38-0 victory over South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The United States, seeking to make the semis for the first time, secured their place in the last eight by beating Japan 36-7 then Brazil 24-5.</p>
        
            <p>Pool action continues on Monday afternoon, ahead of the quarter-finals in the evening and the semis and medal matches on Tuesday.</p>
