            <p>New Zealand driver Scott McLaughlin has put a tough week behind him by winning the latest Indycar race in Alabama.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, McLaughlin was disqualified from March's season opening IndyCar race, where he finished third.</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin and his Team Penske team-mate Josef Newgarden, who won the street race in St Petersburg in Florida, were both disqualified after an investigation showed they breached 'push to pass' parameters.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, McLaughlin said it was a simple mistake and he did not gain an advantage over his competitors.</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin, who also won the Alabama round last year, started on pole on Monday morning and led 58 of the 90 laps.</p>
        
            <p>He battled it out with team-mate Will Power, who finished second. Fellow New Zealander Marcus Armstrong was 9th and Scott Dixon 15th.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon has lost the championship lead to Colton Herta, while McLaughlin has jumped up to 9th overall.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just got to keep rolling, we know our job, we know what we need to do ... super proud of everyone ... execution that's our word and just get going," McLaughlin said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander said the win ranked high in his career.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good one, it's definitely one of my best drives in terms of just execution and just knocking out the laps and really happy we could advance to the checkered flag."</p>
