            <p>Oskar Zawada made a successful return from injury to help the Wellington Phoenix win 2-1 away to the Newcastle Jets and take the outright lead in the men's A-League.</p>
        
            <p>Polish striker Zawada emerged from six weeks on the sideline with a thigh injury to strike an 87th minute to secure their eighth win in 14 matches and climb two points clear of the second-placed Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Rufer's third goal in as many games had given the Nix the early lead, which they held until 10 minutes from fulltime when the Jets equalised.</p>
        
            <p>Zawada's winner off the substitute bench brought relief to coach Giancarlo Italiano.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we merited the three points. I think we had the bigger chances in the game and upon reflection in the first half we should have scored three goals," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately we conceded another soft goal off a set piece, which we need to get better [at and] not allow teams to come into the game I wasn't happy just taking the draw."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano is also happy to have some breathing space at the top of the ladder, but is refusing to get carried away.</p>
        
            <p>"I keep saying this and I know it sounds clich√©, but we take it game by game," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll reassess our goals probably in a month's time closer to the business end of the season. We've got a congested fixture list now with three games within 10 days and that'll be a big indication of where we're at."</p>

            <p>Italiano made two changes to the side which started last week's top of the table match against Victory, with Sam Sutton and Mo Al-Taay coming into the side in place of the suspended fullback Tim Payne and midfielder Ben Old, who has been nursing an ankle injury.</p>
        
            <p>Zawada and young defender Isaac Hughes returned on the bench.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix made a bright start and led inside five minutes after David Ball was fouled at the top of the Newcastle box, allowing Rufer to step up and blast home the penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Substitute Trent Buhagiar drew Newcastle level late in the second half when he deflected a shot from outside the box past wrong-footed Phoenix goalkeeper Alex Paulsen.</p>
        
            <p>The Nix made the Jets pay for the let-off when Ben Old, who impressed off the bench, slipped Zawada through on goal in the 87th minute and the striker thumped a left-footed shot past Ryan Scott and into the far corner of the Jets' goal.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix will head to the Gold Coast, where they will train in the lead-up to Friday night's match against the Brisbane Roar at Suncorp Stadium.</p>
