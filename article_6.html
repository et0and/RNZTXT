            <p>The White Ferns will be relying heavily on the experience of veterans Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates, who are set to play in their ninth women's T20 Cricket World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The duo have been named in a 15-strong New Zealand squad to compete in the tournament which gets underway in the United Arab Emirates next month.</p>
        
            <p>Devine, 35, who will step down as T20 captain at the conclusion tournament and Bates, 37, have played in every edition of the tournament since its inception in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Between them, the pair have played over 300 T20 international - Devine having chalked up 135 games and Bates, 162.</p>
        
            <p>"The T20 World Cup's been an important vehicle in the development and growth of the women's game and it's a real privilege to think I've played in it since it started," Devine said.</p>
        
            <p>Allround Amelia Kerr is the other integral member of the White Ferns setup having played 76 T20 internationals.</p>
        
            <p>Wicket-keeper batter Izzy Gaze is the only squad member not to have played at a T20 World Cup while pace-bowler Rosemary Mair returns to the side having recovered from a back injury she suffered in the T20 series against England in March, and subsequently ruled her out of the England tour in June-July.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Ben Sawyer said Mair had worked extremely hard to make her way back into the squad.</p>
        
            <p>"Rosemary's had an unfortunate run with injury over the past few months and she's worked hard to be fit for this tournament. She's proved herself as one of our key pace options and we're excited she's returning."</p>

            <p>The White Ferns have had a horror run of T20 results this year, having lost all but one of the ten internationals they have played - all of which have been against England.</p>
        
            <p>They will have a three match series against Australia in Mackay and Brisbane starting on Thursday week before heading to the UAE for two warm-up matches against South Africa and England ahead of their first group match against India on 4 October.</p>
