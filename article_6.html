            <p>Fifteen-year-old Tauranga runner Sam Ruthe is lining up a world record attempt this week.</p>
        
            <p>Ruthe is hoping to break the four-minute mile barrier, aiming to become both the youngest person ever and the first 15-year-old in history to break the iconic mark.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager has had a remarkable summer. He first shattered the 15-year-old world best for 3000m in November, then lowered it twice more, including running 7:56.18 in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>That victory also made him the youngest-ever senior national champion in any event.</p>
        
            <p>At the New Zealand Track & Field Championships in Dunedin earlier this month, he tied with two-time Olympian Sam Tanner in the 1500m senior final.</p>
        
            <p>Tanner will pace Ruthe in his mile attempt at Mount Smart Stadium on Wednesday night.</p>

            <p>Two-time Olympic champion and current three-time world record holder Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway ran 3:58.07 for the mile at the age of 16. Australia's Cam Myers set the current best for a 16-year-old at 3:55.44.</p>
        
            <p>Running faster than 4.05.28 will result in Ruthe holding the two best times in history for his age.</p>
        
            <p>Improving on his 4.01.72 set at the Cooks Classic in January will lower the age group best for a 15-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>Sir John Walker became the first man to break 3:50 for the mile in 1975, before claiming Olympic gold over 1500m the following year.</p>
