            <p>The Black Caps have called upon a promising all-rounder and an up-and-coming wicketkeeper-batsman for next month's white-ball tour of Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington bowling-allrounder Nathan Smith and Canterbury wicketkeeper-batsman Mitch Hay are the two uncapped players in the 15-man squad for the two T20s and three one-dayers starting in Dambulla on 9 November.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Santner has been named as interim captain for the tour, with a decision on the long-term ODI and T20 captains to be confirmed in the New Zealand home summer.</p>

            <p>Smith's maiden call-up continues a memorable 12 months for the 25-year-old who was crowned NZC's Men's Domestic Player of the Year at the New Zealand Cricket Awards in March, before receiving his first central Black Caps' contract last month.</p>
        
            <p>Smith claimed 24 wickets across both white-ball competitions for the Firebirds last summer, including career-best T20 figures of 4-5 against Otago in Alexandra in the Super Smash.</p>
        
            <p>Hay, who debuted for New Zealand A last year, has been a consistent performer across all three formats in recent seasons with the 24-year-old crowned Canterbury's male Player of the Year in April.</p>

            <p>The pair join a Black Caps squad made up several experienced internationals and a selection of newer faces who have made international debuts in the past two years.</p>
        
            <p>However, the squad is missing plenty of frontline players with Tom Blundell, Devon Conway, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O'Rourke, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Southee and Kane Williamson not considered for selection as they prioritise the upcoming three-Test series against England, starting in Christchurch on 28 November.</p>
        
            <p>Lockie Ferguson will spearhead a pace bowling group featuring Jacob Duffy and Canterbury's Zak Foulkes, alongside all-rounders Smith and Josh Clarkson.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington opener Tim Robinson earns his second call-up after excelling on his maiden international voyage to Pakistan in April, along with Clarkson who impressed in last summer's ODIs against Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi is the most experienced T20I player in the squad with 117 appearances.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips are the spin-bowling all-rounders, alongside Santner, while Dean Foxcroft offers some off-spin alongside his specialist batting skills.</p>
        
            <p>Six of the current Black Caps Test squad in India have been included and will relocate straight to Sri Lanka at the conclusion of the third Test against India in Mumbai.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell will join the white-ball squad from New Zealand, following his return home from India this week for the birth of his second child.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps selector Sam Wells said the mix of youth and experience in the squad reflected the planning for upcoming ICC tournaments.</p>
        
            <p>"This tour is the beginning of the build-up towards the ICC Champions Trophy in February 2025 and we also have an eye towards the 2027 one-day Cricket World Cup," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Building depth is of critical important due to the demands of the international schedule and the need to peak for pinnacle events.</p>
        
            <p>"For that reason it's particularly exciting to include a number of players that we believe represent the future of the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Sears (knee), Ben Lister (side-strain), Kyle Jamieson (back) and Adi Ashok (back) were not considered for selection due to injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury spinner Cole McConchie made himself unavailable for selection as he and his wife are expecting twins in early December.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Gary Stead will lead the coaching group alongside bowling coach Jacob Oram.</p>
        
            <p>Former England international James Foster will rejoin the group as batting coach, while full-time batting coach Luke Ronchi heads home to focus on the start of the New Zealand home summer.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand-based players depart for Sri Lanka on 4 November ahead of the first T20I in Dambulla.</p>
