            <p>The Chiefs and All Blacks XV coach Clayton McMillan will depart New Zealand at the conclusion of the Super Rugby season to take over as coach of Irish club Munster.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby (NZR) general manager professional rugby and performance Chris Lendrum said McMillan had requested and been granted an early release from his contract which ran through until the end of 2026.</p>
        
            <p>"Clayton has been open and transparent with NZR and the Chiefs about the opportunity to go to Ireland and his motivation to develop as a coach overseas and he goes with our collective blessing and our best wishes," Lendrum said.</p>
        
            <p>"His coaching record has been exceptional, and he has made a significant contribution to our national teams, including the New Zealand U20s, Māori All Blacks, New Zealand Barbarians, and All Blacks XV.</p>
        
            <p>"While we never want to lose a coach and person of Clayton's quality, we believe he will grow from his experience overseas and contribute to the New Zealand rugby environment again in the future."</p>

            <p>McMillan, who is contracted to Munster until 2028 and will join the club in July, said it had been a tough decision to leave the Super Rugby side.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been an absolute privilege to work with the Chiefs and NZ Rugby. I am eternally grateful for the opportunities I have been afforded, and for the support of those I have worked alongside," McMillan said.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to leave wasn't easy - I love my job, the people we represent, and what we value as a club. But I take real comfort in knowing the team is in great hands moving forward, with a talented playing group, coaches and staff.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst I look forward to the challenge at Munster, I am solely focused on giving everything I have to the Chiefs as we build on a promising start, with the goal of being genuine contenders at the business end of the season."</p>
        
            <p>McMillan has led the Chiefs to three Super Rugby finals since taking over as head coach in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs chief executive Simon Graafhuis said McMillan's impending departure comes with the full blessing of the franchise.</p>
        
            <p>"We're incredibly grateful to Clayton for everything he has done for our club since joining in 2021 and becoming head coach of the Chiefs," Graafhuis said.</p>
        
            <p>"Under Clayton's guidance we've not only enjoyed success on the field, but Clayton has also played a significant role in embedding a strong culture and values at the Chiefs Rugby Club.</p>
        
            <p>"We wish Clayton and his whānau all the best on their upcoming move and in the meantime look forward to having him lead us through the remainder of the Super Rugby Pacific season.</p>
        
            <p>"The club has a belief, 'Once a Chief. Always a Chief.' Clayton and his family will always be welcomed as part of the Chiefs environment."</p>
        
            <p>Graafhuis said the Chiefs were focused on the 2025 season are not planning to make any further comment on the head coaching position until the end of the season.</p>
