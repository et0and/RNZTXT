            <p>Jamie Joseph has named blockbusting winger Timoci Tavatavanawai and hard-working loose forward Hugh Renton as co-captains for the Highlanders in this year's Super Rugby competition.</p>
        
            <p>They succeed Billy Harmon, last year's captain, who is now playing in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph, who has taken over the Highlanders reins from Clarke Dermody, was head coach at the franchise from 2011 until 2016, before taking over the Japanese national side.</p>
        
            <p>He has named a forward and back as co-captain before with great success, when loosie Nasi Manu and fullback Ben Smith were the leaders of the Highlanders side that won the 2015 competition.</p>
        
            <p>Fijian-born Tavatavanawai was a big success for the Highlanders last year after having two seasons with Moana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>The hard-tackling Renton has been with the Highlanders since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"Jim (Timoci) and Hugh embody the qualities we are looking for in our leaders - passion, commitment, and the ability to inspire others with their actions or words," Joseph said in a team release.</p>
        
            <p>"They both bring unique strengths to the table, and I believe they will complement each other well as co-captains. I'm excited to see them lead the team through what promises to be an exciting season."</p>
        
            <p>Tavatavanawai said it was a privilege to be asked to lead the team with Renton.</p>
        
            <p>"I am looking forward to contributing to the team's growth and success in any way I can, and working closely with my co-captain, teammates and the coaches."</p>
        
            <p>Renton said he was humbled by the appointment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a role I take very seriously, and I am looking forward to the responsibility of co-captaining a team that means a lot to me".</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders' first pre-season game is against Moana Pasifika in Albany on 31 January, with a second game against the Crusaders in Invercargill on Waitangi Day.</p>
        
            <p>Their opening Super Rugby game is against the Waratahs in Sydney on 14 February.</p>
