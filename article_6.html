        <h2>Seven things we learned from the Warriors' win over Storm</h2>
        <p>
The Auckland side ran in seven tries and kept their rivals scoreless in the first half, but could not add to their score in the second.

            <p>After their scratchy draw with Cronulla Sharks last week, Warriors coach Andrew Webster will feel happier with a 36-12 win over Melbourne Storm, as his team jumped on the perennial NRL powerhouse early.</p>
        
            <p>Compared to their disjointed effort against the Sharks, the Auckland side seemed far more connected, despite a late line-up shuffle that significantly changed the backline and the spine.</p>
        
            <p>They now have two more weeks to tweak their gameplan, before taking on Canberra Raiders in their season-opener in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a few things we learnt from this latest performance:</p>
        
            <p>[h[ Melbourne Marshmallows</p>
        
            <p>Let's not get too exited about the one-sided scoreline - this Storm line-up was a million miles away from their strongest.</p>
        
            <p>Probably only halfback Tyran Wishart and front-row newcomer Stefano Utoikamanu are in coach Craig Bellamy's immediate plans, and Wishart had a howler, twice dropping the ball in prime attacking position during the first half.</p>
        
            <p>In summary, the Warriors were missing several stars, but the Storm were missing even more.</p>
        
            <p>Once both teams began injecting their reserves, the contest evened up and Melbourne wrestled back some momentum.</p>
        
            <p>The pre-game shuffle saw fullback Taine Tuaupiki replace Ed Kosi on the wing, Te Maire Martin shift from five-eighth to fullback and Chanel Harris-Tavita introduced to the halves.</p>
        
            <p>Webster may have wanted to see Harris-Tavita in combination with Luke Metcalf, but more likely, he hoped to give Tuaupiki another chance to impress out wide.</p>
        
            <p>With Dallin Watene-Zelezniak sidelined several weeks by a wrist injury, Webster needs to find a replacement. Kosi got his chance last week, when he stood in for Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, while Tuaupiki impressed, after subbing on for DWZ.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>He continued that form, running for 150 metres, making two linebreaks and scoring two tries, after grabbing one against the Sharks.</p>
        
            <p>His performance will have comforted Webster, who now seems to have his back three set.</p>
        
            <p>After his late scratching from the Sharks game, the former Dally M Medallist ran out on the wing and also scored a try double.</p>
        
            <p>His first touchdown came from a classic RTS jink that propelled him off the left touchline and past a couple of would-be tacklers with ease. He wasn't as impressive as Tuaupiki, but good enough to ease any concerns over his fitness.</p>
        
            <p>Webster has previously had trouble juggling three outstanding fullback candidates within his squad, preferring Chanze Nicoll-Klokstad in the No.1 jersey, consigning RTS to the centres and calling on Tuaupiki when required.</p>
        
            <p>There's now a good chance he will have all three in his starting line-up in Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>While the back three look more settled, the centre positions are still wide open, with Adam Pompey joining Rocco Berry on the injury list for this encounter.</p>
        
            <p>Ali Leiataua helped his cause with a performance that yielded two tries, two try assists, seven tacklebreaks, two linebreaks and two linebreak assists.</p>
        
            <p>He looked powerful with ball in hand, cutting through the fragile Storm defence, but the Warriors face an anxious wait, after he was placed on report for a high tackle that may yet deprive him of a seat to Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>Centre partner Eddie Ieremia-Toeava was the only Warriors starter yet to play first grade and he showed that can't be far off.</p>
        
            <p>Back-up hooker Sam Healey was also cited for a lifting tackle, but he probably more readily replaceable by incumbent Freddy Lussick.</p>
        
            <p>The flood of tries out wide augers well for the Warriors' trip to 'Sin City', where the field will be narrower than usual to fit inside an NFL pitch.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The home side ordered the FMG Stadium field to match those dimensions, but the reduced width certainly didn't seem to discourage their tryscorers at all.</p>
        
            <p>More than 23,000 turned up in Hamilton to watch this pre-season fixture, despite Chiefs fans heading north for their Super Rugby Pacific opener against the Blues at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>That support was rewarded with a pre-game announcement that the Warriors would take three NRLW home games to 'The Tron'.</p>
        
            <p>With the retirement of Warriors star Shaun Johnson, Martin and Metcalf had first chance to nail down the halves spots against the Sharks, and seemed ready to consolidate those claims this week, before the pre-game reshuffle.</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita was sidelined last week by a training niggle and enjoyed some extended run with Metcalf, showing he would not be out of place, if required.</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf has probably nailed down the No.6 jersey, kicking for another 40/20, after achieving one against Cronulla, and slotting conversions from wide out - bouncing two off uprights - before the wind began to play tricks.</p>
        
            <p>Martin was still pretty solid in a position where he previously played for North Queensland Cowboys and hasn't done anything to play his way out of the starting line-up..</p>
        
            <p>Luke Hanson and Jett Cleary enjoyed cameo apearances late in the game, but probably won't be called on, unless injuries hit hard.</p>
        
            <p>While there was some disquiet over the loss of powerful Zyon Maiu'u to Canterbury Bulldogs, in truth, the Warriors have local juniors coming out their ears.</p>
        
            <p>Even without co-captains Mitch Barnett and James Fisher-Harris, they have plenty of cattle to cart the ball up the middle of the park.</p>
        
            <p>Jacob Laban missed this encounter on MƒÅori All Star commitments, but Demetric Vaimauga, Tom Ale and Leka Halasima all have first-grade experience, and were prominent against the Storm, with Halasima (31) emerging as the team's leading tackler.</p>
        
            <p>Even Ieremia-Toeava played prop and second-rower for the Warriors Reserves last year, so he may yet make his first-grade debut in those roles.</p>

            <p>Veteran Bunty Afoa seems to have found a new lease on life, while Erin Clark's return to Mt Smart may see him step straight into Tohu Harris' vacated spot at the back of the scrum. He ran for 115 metres, 46 of which came after contact.</p>
        
            <p>Regular frontliners Kurt Capewell, Dylan Walker, Marata Niukore and Jackson Ford have made quiet starts to their campaigns, but the competition from those coming behind should ensure they find their speed quickly.</p>
