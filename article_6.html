            <p>New Zealand athletes competing in this year's Olympic Games in Paris will receive pendants made from a pounamu is described as extremely rare.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu hosted the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) and Paralympics New Zealand for a blessing ceremony in which 550 Tahutahi "snowflake" jade pendants were presented.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Māhaki carvers from Te Rūnanga o Makaawhio dedicated a year to creating the pieces.</p>
        
            <p>The pounamu is only found on the Cascade Plateau, south of Haast, and is described as a rich and intense green stone with a striking white snowflake effect.</p>
        
            <p>The iwi said it had never given permission to outsiders to collect and sell pounamu from this region. But the iwi has previously gifted the tahutahi pounamu pendant to athletes.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu kaiwhakahaere Justin Tipa said for the past 20 years, the iwi had crafted individual pounamu pieces for every Olympic athlete from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"These pieces are a special gift, and we wish the athletes all the best in Paris."</p>
        
            <p>NZOC Chef de Mission Nigel Avery said the pendants would connect the athletes to home while they competed overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"We are extremely grateful to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu for this special taonga," Avery said.</p>
        
            <p>"Presenting team members with a pounamu necklace is a meaningful and significant tradition for the New Zealand Team. It helps to unite and inspire our athletes and lets them carry a little piece of home with them as they compete for Aotearoa New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The pendants will travel to Paris with the Olympic and Paralympic teams, where they will be presented to each athlete and team support member as they are welcomed to the Olympic village.</p>
        
            <p>The Paris 2024 Olympic Games will be held from 26 July to 11 August, where about 190 athletes were expected to represent New Zealand across 22 sports.</p>
        
            <p>The Paralympic Games will take place from 28 August to 8 September, with up to 30 athletes set to represent New Zealand.</p>
