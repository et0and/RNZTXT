            <p>United States' Olympic bronze medallist and social media star Ilona Maher has joined Bristol Bears on a three-month deal starting in January, the Premiership women's rugby union club said.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Maher helped the US team clinch the Rugby Sevens bronze medal at the Paris Games after defeating Australia, with New Zealand later securing gold.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old is the most popular rugby player on social media with a following of 4.6 million on Instagram and 3.3 million on TikTok.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Maher finished runner-up on American reality TV show "Dancing with the Stars" with dance partner Alan Bersten, where she became the first female contestant to lift her male partner.</p>
        
            <p>The versatile back can play at centre and on the wing.</p>
        
            <p>"She's going to shock people when she plays 15s," Bears head coach Dave Ward told BBC.</p>
        
            <p>"I think she is going to be devastating. She is someone with the pace of (England winger) Abby Dow, the size of (England lock) Abbie Ward, and a step.</p>

            <p>"You've got a fantastic rugby player there. She is going to be a massive asset to our game and give us a completely different dynamic.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone knows about the social media following and that is all well and good, but, from my perspective, we saw a world-class rugby player who wanted to come and play 15s and was looking for the best league and hopefully the best programme.</p>
        
            <p>"That is what we wanted to represent."</p>
        
            <p>Maher, who appeared on US television show Dancing With The Stars, will return home for Christmas before starting training in earnest with Bristol in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>However, she was involved in a skills sessions with her new team-mates on Monday and, despite having had four months away from the sport, impressed Ward with her passing, conditioning and enthusiasm.</p>
        
            <p>"She was ripping the ball off her right and left hand just as well as [centre] Phoebe Murray," Ward added.</p>
        
            <p>Maher said in a statement: "I am excited to join the Bristol Bears and put myself in the best position to earn a spot to represent USA in the 2025 Rugby World Cup (in England) alongside such a talented and driven group as the Bears".</p>
