            <p>The Breakers new American import Freddie Gillespie does not want to be remembered for an on-court incident during pre-season - a move he believes was out of character.</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie was given a one-match ban for headbutting Sydney Kings veteran Shaun Bruce during a pre-season game at the NBL Blitz.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old will miss the Breakers first game of the NBL season on Saturday against the Brisbane Bullets in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>A remorseful Gillespie said it "breaks my heart" to miss the opening game of the season and he felt he had let his new teammates down.</p>
        
            <p>As soon as Gillespie had moved his head towards Bruce he said he knew he should not have done it.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely a poor decision in the moment ... if I could take it back I would but I can't so I'm dealing with the consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past I feel like I've kept a level head and we all fall short now and then. Something my Mum always said was the worst thing you can do from a mistake is not learn from it and the second worst thing is do it twice."</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie said he was trying to keep a positive attitude about the situation but the centre, who has played in basketball leagues around the world, said it hurt to be sidelined to start a six month season but he said he only had himself to blame.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>New Breakers coach Petteri Koponen did not want the incident to tarnish the club's image or Gillespie's.</p>
        
            <p>"It is something that we don't want to tolerate in this club and you are not only representing yourself you are representing the Breakers and that is definitely not something that we want to show and how we want to act.</p>
        
            <p>"He learnt his lesson and now it is a bigger problem for the team starting the season without him the next guys need to step up and fill his shoes."</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie wanted to prove to the Breakers fan base that he was not a bad guy.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the incident I'm a nice guy I promise it was an aberration.</p>
        
            <p>"Contrary to what you might know I try to lead by example and have positive energy."</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie's mis-step opened the door for second season Breaker Australian Dane Pineau and new Breakers' Sam Mennenga and Jonah Bolden to make their mark.</p>
        
            <p>"We all have different playing styles but one thing I know about each and every one of them at the end of the day they're competitive and competitors find a way no matter what it is," Gillespie said of his team mates stepping in to fill the void.</p>
        
            <p>Koponen said Pineau could expect more minutes as the Breakers chased their first win as a roster.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's practising really well throughout the pre-season and I think he's going to be ready for that game.</p>
        
            <p>"When we do the things we practice and we don't that both defensively and offensively we can compete with everybody we just have to take those bad moments and try and make them shorter and when we are not there try and stop the bleeding."</p>
        
            <p>The NBL season begins on Thursday with all 10 NBL teams playing their first round game at HoopsFest in Perth.</p>
