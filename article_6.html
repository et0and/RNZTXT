            <p>One-Test All Black prop Aidan Ross has signed with the Queensland Reds, but will play out one more season with the Chiefs before leaving New Zealand after next year's Super Rugby competition.</p>
        
            <p>Ross - who was born in Australia - will be eligible to play for the Wallabies from July.</p>
        
            <p>He has played 88 games for the Chiefs since making his debut in 2017. His sole Test for the All Blacks was against Ireland in Dunedin in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision hasn't been an easy one," said Ross, "but this year will be my last season with the Chiefs. This team has meant so much to me and my family. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've been provided while wearing the jersey.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys and management are a great group, and I am looking forward to kicking off the Super Rugby Pacific season with them."</p>
        
            <p>Former All Blacks Jeffrey Toomaga-Allen and Alex Hodgman are also at the Reds.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs head coach Clayton McMillan wished Ross all the best for his next adventure.</p>
        
            <p>"Aidan has given a lot to this team, and we support him and his family in making the move next season. He has been an asset to us, on and off the field, and I have no doubt he will be the same for the Reds."</p>
