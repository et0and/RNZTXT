        <h2>Fine margins: Canes overcome Chiefs, sold-out crowd</h2>
        <p>
The Hurricanes' 20-17 win over the Chiefs came down to a crucial call in the 79th minute.
</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes' 20-17 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton on Friday is one that has made coach Clark Laidlaw "very happy".</p>
        
            <p>"Coming here is a really difficult place to play," Laidlaw said, reflecting on the performance by his team in front of a sold-out, 23,000-strong FMG Stadium Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The game was decided by a 79th-minute penalty goal by Brett Cameron, who slotted it home from 45 metres.</p>
        
            <p>"The game was pretty 50/50, wasn't it? To get a penalty and kick it to win, I'm super pleased for BC [Cameron], he does a lot of work on his kicking … [It was] a big pressure kick, he really nailed it.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a young team ... we've not got a whole heap of All Blacks in the team, but we've come up here and played really well."</p>
        
            <p>Despite being a player down for most of the match, the Hurricanes still managed to put away a fast-finishing Chiefs side after being ahead 14-0 at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The home side found themselves on the wrong end of a 15-6 penalty count by referee Paul Williams, and the call on Luke Jacobson for not rolling away after a dominant tackle on Jordie Barrett for Cameron's winning kick was about as fine a margin as you can get.</p>

            <p>Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan lamented his team's lack of discipline.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is we gave away too many penalties. Every time it looked like we were about to poke our head through the clouds and start getting that momentum ourselves, we would do something a little silly. And then we'd release that pressure valve."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobson said the Chiefs were "getting a little bit keen".</p>
        
            <p>"You put yourself on the wrong side of the whistle … particularly in the first half, pushing things a bit too much. And obviously we were getting the brunt of the penalties, which is not what we want."</p>
        
            <p>However, it was the Hurricanes who spent 75 minutes with only 14 players - Raymond Tuputupu's direct head contact on Tupou Vaa'i meaning his initial yellow card was upgraded to red.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest in a string of setbacks for the team's hookers, however Laidlaw was confident Asafo Aumua would be available next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Jordie Barrett looked like he had been in a car crash post-match, with cuts on his eyebrow and nose; however he confirmed they were superficial.</p>
        
            <p>The third-placed Brumbies' 53-17 win over the Rebels in Friday's late game means that the Chiefs are almost certain to finish fourth, no matter what the result of their match against the Blues at Eden Park next weekend. They can pull level with a bonus point win, but will need the Force to pull off an upset and deny the Brumbies a bonus point.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Hurricanes will be keeping a keen eye on the Blues' match with the Crusaders tonight in Christchurch. A Crusaders win will keep Laidlaw's side in top spot heading into the final regular-season weekend, however he stopped short of pledging his support for Rob Penney's side, which has had only two wins from 12 matches.</p>
        
            <p>"Nah," was his replay when asked.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not fussed. I've been asked a few questions this week on things I can't lose energy on - opposition teams are one of them. We'll just play whoever we get."</p>
