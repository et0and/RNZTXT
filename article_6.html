            <p>When Andrew Webster came to the realisation he was not destined for Rugby League stardom, he set out to switch his career path in the most unlikely of places.</p>
        
            <p>So primitive was the game in the United States, the training fields did not even have posts.</p>
        
            <p>Webster would join the Connecticut Wildcats as a player/coach in 2005, helping guide the side to a grand final in the AMNRL.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a big book on how I wanted to coach when I landed in America and I threw it out after the first week. It just needed to simplify things then."</p>
        
            <p>Returning two decades on now head coach of the Warriors, Webster said he was slowly seeing Rugby League more embraced by Americans.</p>
        
            <p>His side will play one of two matches in Las Vegas to kick off the NRL season this Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>However, the game has still yet to develop a strong foothold in the fiercely competitive sporting landscape of the US.</p>
        
            <p>"I think events like this could get the game to take off here, the American fans would absolutely love it. They love contact collision, hard sports."</p>
        
            <p>Struggling to make progress as a player, Webster opted for the move to the states.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew rugby league was over for me professionally, it was a completely different experience, I realised how passionate they were about the game."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said he would have a cohort of at least ten former teammates in the stands for Sunday's clash with the Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just such a cool part of my journey and so grateful I got to do it."</p>
        
            <p>However, twenty years on, and Webster still finds himself having to differentiate the codes to Americans.</p>
        
            <p>"I always say the difference is rugby union is like softball and ruby league is like baseball."</p>
