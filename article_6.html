        <h2>All Whitesâ€™ North American tour: What we learned</h2>

            <p>The All Whites have finished their North American tour winless but with plenty of positives to take from a 3-0 loss against Mexico in California and a 1-1 draw with the United States in Ohio.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps not from the first game, where a seasoned Mexico outfit swept Darren Bazeley's men aside. However, a draw with the world-ranked 16 United States is impressive.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Waine's endeavour paid off with a fluke deflection skittling over Matt Turner in the USA goal to secure a share of the spoils with the soon-to-be Mauricio Pochettino-helmed side.</p>
        
            <p>With World Cup qualifiers awaiting in next month's international window, what key lessons will Bazeley and his team have learned from the All Whites' trip Stateside?</p>
        
            <p>At the start of last season, Max Crocombe was not even the number one goalkeeper at his club team, Burton Albion in England's third tier. Fast forward a year and he has firmly established himself at the League One club and as Darren Bazeley's first-choice between the sticks for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old seemed the forgotten man in the All Whites goalkeeping department. Before his return to the set-up last June, his previous appearance had been in a 2-1 loss to Kenya in 2018, and he remained best remembered for that time he was sent off for answering a call of nature mid-game.</p>
        
            <p>Now, his reputation is less for taking a leak as it is plugging them. After ensuring the scoreline remained respectable against Mexico he kept New Zealand in the USA game, long enough for the fortuitous late leveller to prove telling.</p>
        
            <p>There's prestigious competition behind him in Alex Paulsen and Oli Sail but wrestling the jersey from Crocombe at this stage will be tough.</p>

            <p>If Tommy Smith and Michael Boxall represented the centre-back partnership of the past against Mexico, then Kiwi football fans got a glimpse of the future against the USA.</p>
        
            <p>The aforementioned pairing are in the twilight of their playing careers while Nando Pijnaker (25) and Finn Surman (20) have many years ahead of them.</p>
        
            <p>The two complimented each other well before Surman's withdrawal through injury, with Pijnaker's raking long ball even leading to the goal. Hopefully, this can be the start of a defensive duo to last the next decade.</p>

            <p>Credit where credit is due for Bazeley, whose caution-impaired decision-making salvaged a draw with the USA. After Christian Pulisic's injection of quality seemed to have condemned New Zealand to defeat in Cincinnati the All Whites boss discarded risk aversion and made some bold choices.</p>
        
            <p>The introduction of goalscorer Waine, Kosta Barbarouses and Logan Rogerson late on was borderline reckless but it paid dividends with Waine's ricocheted equaliser.</p>
        
            <p>It was a bold choice and one which paid off.</p>

            <p>Chris Wood is undoubtedly New Zealand's marquee player as the only current English Premier League star among the ranks.</p>
        
            <p>But the nation's all-time top-scorer would admit himself that he was not at his best during this international break. In fact, he already has.</p>
        
            <p>What is more concerning is that Wood has not scored from open play against non-Oceania competition since a double against The Gambia in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Considering his strengths, Wood needs players around him, providing chances to utilise his imposing figure and uncanny nose for a chance to good use - much like he is currently being provided by Nottingham Forest's exciting wide talent at club level.</p>
        
            <p>Too often, the gap between Wood and the rest of the New Zealand team is a chasm and bridging it will be key if the captain is to provide Premier League-level performances for the All Whites.</p>

            <p>New Zealand find themselves in a quandary when it comes to their playing style. It is clear they want to play out from the back when possible and such a style will no doubt see them handsomely saunter past their Oceania rivals and qualify for the 2026 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>However, against their North American rivals - particularly Mexico, they struggled to keep possession against a team of players who have such a playing identity almost embedded into their DNA.</p>
        
            <p>It's no coincidence that New Zealand's best chances were from counter-attacks and that their goal came from a rasping midfield bypass.</p>
        
            <p>Settling on the right blend of both of these philosophies will be Bazeley's big challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Next three fixtures:</p>
        
            <p>11 October - All Whites v Tahiti</p>
        
            <p>14 October - All Whites v Malaysia</p>
        
            <p>15 November - All Whites v Vanuatu</p>
