            <p>The Tall Blacks face a monumental task to qualify for next year's Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will need to beat teams containing some of the top players in the NBA if they're to get to Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The side will need to win a qualifying tournament in Athens against Slovenia, Croatia, Egypt, Greece and Dominican Republic.</p>
        
            <p>Slovenia has Luka Doncic of the NBA champion Dallas Mavericks, Greece has Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Dominican Republic has Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p>
        
            <p>Slovenia is ranked 11th in the world, Greece 14, Dominican Republic 18th, New Zealand 21st and Croatia 30th.</p>
        
            <p>Both Greece and Egypt are well-known opponents for the Tall Blacks; the Kiwis falling to Greece 74-83 in their third game of the FIBA World Cup 2023, then fending off Egypt 88-86 in their final World Cup game - that win earning New Zealand an invite to next year's Olympic Qualifying Tournament.</p>
        
            <p>There are four final Olympic qualifying tournaments, to be played in early July, with the four winners to gain a place in the Olympic tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The Tall Blacks have qualified for the Olympics twice, in 2000 and 2004.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile the Tall Ferns will play their Olympic qualifying tournament in China in February.</p>
        
            <p>They need to avoid coming last in a tournament that includes China, France and Puerto Rico to qualify for Paris.</p>
