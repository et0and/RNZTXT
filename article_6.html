            <p>Lulu Sun has missed out on her chance of a first Women's Tennis Association title, losing to Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic at the Monterrey Open in Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>The unseeded Sun, who grabbed the attention of the tennis world in July [www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/521720/lulu-sun-s-wimbledon-run-ends-with-three-set-defeat-in-quarter-finals when she reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon], was beaten in straight sets, 7-6 6-4, to give sixth seed Noskova her first WTA title.</p>
        
            <p>Sun played dazzling tennis throughout the tournament and that was the case again in the final, but her inability to convert break points proved ultimately costly.</p>
        
            <p>Sun, who hails from Te Anau in Southland, started nervously, losing her first service game, but fought back soon after to break Noskova's serve and the players exchanged games in a tight first set.</p>
        
            <p>It went to a tie-breaker and at one stage Sun was two set points up, but couldn't ram home her advantage and Noskova came back to take the set 7-6.</p>
        
            <p>It was the break points that were damaging Sun, as she succeeded with one from six opportunities in the set.</p>
        
            <p>Noskova broke Sun's service early in the second set, and from there the Czech played the steadier tennis, despite some sizzling aces and ground strokes from Sun.</p>
        
            <p>Ranked 57th before the tournament in the WTA rankings, Sun will will rise to 41st in the world when the latest WTA rankings are released on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>She will contest the US Open in New York next week.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though I lost in the final it was still a great, great week," Sun told the crowd at the presentation.</p>
        
            <p>"Gracias, te amo (thanks, I love you) Monterrey."</p>
        
            <p>She beat third seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the semi-finals.</p>
