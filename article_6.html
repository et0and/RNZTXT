            <p>British tennis star Emma Raducanu believes her recent stalking ordeal "could have been dealt with better" and led to a "very emotional" few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking publicly for the first time since the incident a fortnight ago, she told the BBC she was followed to four tournaments by the same man.</p>
        
            <p>During a recent tournament in Dubai Raducanu became upset when she saw the man in the stands.</p>
        
            <p>He was removed and later given a restraining order by police.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security," Raducanu told the BBC.</p>
        
            <p>"I think all we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It could have been dealt with better, but now it is being dealt with better so for me that's important."</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu said the man had been at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha then approached her near her hotel in Dubai, giving her a letter and took a photo which unnerved her.</p>
        
            <p>She apparently reported the incident to her team but the information was not passed on to the WTA or the tournament until the following day leaving security staff with just a few hours to prepare.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they were very emotional weeks, because it had carried on for a few weeks before," said Raducanu.</p>
        
            <p>"It was quite tiring. I took a week break when I got home in England."</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu, who shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, told the BBC she is unlikely to invest in private security at tournaments, but added she is taking increased precautions.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more," she added.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm always with someone, and always being watched I would say."</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu is playing in California at the Indian Wells tournament one of the bigger tournaments out the grand slam events and feels much happier</p>
        
            <p>"Since being here in this environment - which is one of my favourite tournaments - I have felt a lot better," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The allure of Indian Wells was a big part of me coming. I wasn't sure if I was going to come and compete so soon. It's probably one of my favourite places on the calendar and I am ready to go."</p>
