            <p>Teen mile phenom Sam Ruthe has raised more than $11,000 for coach Craig Kirkwood and his Tauranga training group through an auction of his historic running shoes on TradeMe.</p>
        
            <p>After a week of bidding, the sale closed at 2.40pm Saturday, raising $11,408.35.</p>
        
            <p>The size 10.5 US spikes attracted 151 bids and 50,148 views, making them the most viewed auction on the website so far this year.</p>
        
            <p>"One young owner," declared the advertisement. "Can vouch for the faint whiff of achievement."</p>
        
            <p>Ruthe, 15, wore the bright crimson Nike Dragonfly 2 Elite when he became the youngest to break four minutes for the mile last week, recording 3m 58.35s at Auckland's Mt Smart Stadium. He was paced to the time by training mate and two-time Olympian Sam Tanner.</p>
        
            <p>The shoe brand is available on the Nike website at US$190 (NZ$332).</p>

            <p>"Sam just decided he wanted to auction of the shoes and donate that money to the group, the other kids we have in the squad," said Kirkwood, a former Commonwealth Games marathon representative.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll figure out ways to spend it wisely amongst them and do some things we wouldn't be able to do without that injection of cash.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty cool opportunity that we've got - really exciting and super generous of him."</p>
        
            <p>Ruthe has enjoyed a breakout summer on the track, setting world age-best times over 1500 metres, mile and 3000 metres, and becoming the youngest man to win a senior national title, when he captured the 3000m at Hastings and then deadheating with Tanner for the 1500m title at Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The auction drew some humourous banter among amateur runners, looking for a winning edge.</p>
        
            <p>"Will I run sub four if I wear these spikes?" asked one. "Current mile time would be around six minutes."</p>

            <p>"I can only say that so far everyone that has worn them has run sub four," was the response. "Maybe if you get some coaching from CK [Kirkwood] and pacing from Tanner, you could be dragged through."</p>
        
            <p>Ruthe winds up his southern hemisphere racing scheduled on Saturday night, when he faces his toughest competition yet over 1500 metres at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne.</p>
