            <p>The All Blacks and Wallabies will be out to restore some pride with Rugby Championship victories this weekend after chastening losses at the hands of Argentina and South Africa last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Pumas deservedly stunned the All Blacks 38-30 in the tournament opener in Wellington and this week Felipe Contepomi's team will take aim at New Zealand's 30-year, 49-test unbeaten run at Auckland's Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks have selected a weaker side for their second clash against the Wallabies in Perth but Australians will take little solace from that given the gulf in quality between the two teams in last Saturday's 33-7 demolition in Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks have won 20 of the 28 editions of the Southern Hemisphere test championship and the loss to Argentina - only a third in 38 meetings at test level - has likewise caused much soul-searching in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Scott Robertson on Thursday injected 95 caps of experience onto his bench in the shape of former captain Sam Cane and made three changes to his backline - most notably starting Will Jordan for the first time this season.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks have generally delivered a fierce response after losing test matches, particularly up front, and Robertson is hoping he has inherited at least that strand of the team's DNA.</p>
        
            <p>"Every All Black forward pack after a result like that gets a chance for a bit of redemption, another opportunity," the former test loose forward said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to move forward now, we looked at it, now here we go, Eden Park, let's get to it."</p>
        
            <p>Contepomi is also in his first season in charge and had already overseen a home win over France before the Wellington triumph.</p>
        
            <p>The former test first-five has brought back skipper Julian Montoya after injury but otherwise largely kept faith in the team that secured last week's famous victory.</p>
        
            <p>Flanker Pablo Matera loses the captaincy but will once more be the heart and soul of the Pumas, while unrelated backs Santiago and Mateo Carreras will again be ready to attack from anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>Australia coach Joe Schmidt has perhaps yet to find the heart and soul of his Wallabies team and the green shoots of recovery identified in three wins in July were scorched by the world champions in Brisbane last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Marika Koroibete will add a bit of genuine world class to his side for Saturday's test at Perth Stadium but there will need to be a vast improvement everywhere if Australia are to bridge the gap to the Springboks.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is that we need to be more combative and accurate this Saturday," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus has defended his decision to make 10 changes to his starting side, pointing out that there are still 14 World Cup winners in the team and only two new caps.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not something up in the air, we've picked a team that we think can win," he said after naming his side on Tuesday. "Hopefully the young guys can learn from the older guys and they can bring exuberance and excitement."</p>
