            <p>Auckland's Waitemata Harbour is once again hosting New Zealand's Sail GP regatta, and at this point, there are no marine mammals nearby.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation said there had been no sightings in the past few days of marine mammals in the area where Sail GP was taking place.</p>
        
            <p>The international sailing competition was pulled from Christchurch after last year's racing was marred in controversy after dolphins were seen on the course. The first day of racing had to be cancelled due to regulations that protected the Hector's Dolphin.</p>
        
            <p>DOC spokesperson Kirsty Prior said the Waitemata harbour - hosting the 2025 Sail GP - was also home to a wide range of protected wildlife including sea-birds, seals, whales and dolphins.</p>
        
            <p>She said the department had boats near the race zone with staff prepared to respond to any incidents involving protected wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>After the first day, Australia atop the event standings, with Great Britain second and Spain third.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were only a point adrift of the Spanish in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven teams from around the world will compete again tomorrow for the largest cash prize in the competition's history.</p>
