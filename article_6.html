            <p>Tom Walsh and Jacko Gill have both made short work of qualifying in the Paris OIympics men's shot put.</p>
        
            <p>Both New Zealanders advanced to Sunday morning's final at the Stade de France by meeting the automatic qualifying mark of 21.35m with their second-round throws.</p>
        
            <p>Gill, competing in group A, threw bang on the qualifying mark to secure his place in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Afterwards, he revealed he was still recovering from an ankle injury suffered while birdwatching during a hike a few months ago.</p>

            <p>Walsh, meanwhile, qualified with a throw of 21.48m.</p>
        
            <p>Italy's Leonardi Fabbri was the top qualifier with a throw of 21.76m, while gold-medal favourite Ryan Crouser of the US placed third in his qualification group after heaving the shot 21.49m.</p>
        
            <p>The qualifying rounds for athletics got underway on Friday night, NZ time. Sprinting hope Zoe Hobbs came second in her 100m heat with a time of 11.08 and progresses to the next round.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's 17-strong athletics team in Paris is its biggest ever and hopes are high for some podium finishes. It will be Walsh's third Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>The men's shot put final will be on Sunday morning from 5.35am. American Ryan Crouser is the two-time defending champion and world record holder and remains the man to beat.</p>
        
            <p>After qualifying, Walsh said his first-round throw of 20.65m was "a little bit short and tight".</p>
        
            <p>"So all I wanted to do [for the second round] was commit to the throw and stay long through it, and that's exactly what I managed to do on that second round throw.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is all about qualifying, so I managed to tick that off, and now onto the final."</p>

            <p>Asked how he would prepare, Walsh said: "Some kai, some treatment, some rest. A little bit of a warm-down, but my warm down is a walk round the track once, and that's about it really."</p>
        
            <p>The atmosphere was "amazing" at the Stade de France, he said: "I was saying to someone out there, my wife said to me, 'Imagine what little Tom would have made of all of this'.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes we can kind of get a bit scared of [the big crowds and pressure] and back away, and I wanted to make a point of taking it all in and going, 'Wow this is amazing'."</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with Sky Sport, Jacko Gill revealed his build-up had not been ideal after hurting his ankle on a hike a few months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I was doing some birdwatching and fell down the stairs, so I've had a high ankle sprain that's been really pesky for the last two or three months.</p>
        
            <p>"I've just been trying to manage that and my throws have dropped down, like, a metre.</p>
        
            <p>"So to get some of that distance back, I'm just really happy and it gives me so much confidence going into the final."</p>
        
            <p>The qualifying round throw was the furthest Gill had thrown in training or competition in about four months, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's annoying, [the ankle] hasn't got better so it's just a bit frustrating ... it's not really sore - it just affects the ... function of the ankle, so  can't quite drive up off it as much as I'd like ... but it's definitely feeling better."</p>
