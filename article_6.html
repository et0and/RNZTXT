            <p>England reached their third semi-final in four tournaments when Trent Alexander-Arnold slammed home the decisive kick to give them a shootout victory over Switzerland after the teams had drawn 1-1 in a tense quarter-final.</p>
        
            <p>Alexander-Arnold, dropped from the starting team after two disappointing performances in the group stage, came on as a late extra-time substitute to take the glory after Jordan Pickford had saved from Manuel Akanji.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third successive quarter-final to go to extra time, two of them to penalties.</p>
        
            <p>Breel Embolo had put Switzerland ahead after 75 minutes, with Bukayo Saka levelling five minutes later in a game of few chances.</p>
        
            <p>In Wednesday's semi-final in Dortmund, England will meet either Netherlands or Turkey, who play later on Saturday (7am NZT), after snuffing out Switzerland's dream of making a first major semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>The first 45 minutes did not do much to engage the fans, though England were at least more positive than in their last two matches.</p>
        
            <p>Three times Saka hit the byline, but on each occasion his poor cutback went straight to a defender and when he did find a white shirt just before halftime, Kobbie Mainoo's shot was superbly blocked by a sliding Granit Xhaka.</p>
        
            <p>Despite their relative improvement, England still failed to muster a shot on target, but nor did the Swiss, who were held at bay reasonably comfortably by a well-drilled England defence.</p>
        
            <p>Swiss coach Murat Yakin threw on Steven Zuber and Silvan Widmer after an hour but England's Gareth Southgate, as always, kept his powder dry. It was the livelier-looking Swiss who took the lead after 75 minutes when Dan Ndoye whipped in a deflected low cross from the right, with Breel Embolo stretching in front of Kyle Walker to poke it home.</p>
        
            <p>Southgate responded by immediately throwing on three substitutes Cole Palmer, Luke Shaw and Eberechi Eze - and five minutes later England were level as Saka cut in from the right wing and curled a brilliant 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post.</p>
        
            <p>The best early chance of extra time fell to England's Declan Rice, whose shot from the edge of the box was brilliantly saved by a diving Yann Sommer, while Xherdan Shaqiri clipped a post direct from a corner, before the penalties that had felt inevitable almost from the start duly arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Switzerland had lost three of their four major tournament shootouts, while England's famously uncomfortable record was seven defeats and two wins.</p>
        
            <p>That reads 7-3 now after Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka - who missed in the Euro2020 final shootout defeat to Italy - and Ivan Toney all scored confidently ahead of Alexander-Arnold.</p>
