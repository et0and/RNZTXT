            <p>Francisco Conceicao came off the bench to grab a stoppage-time winner as Portugal kick-started their Euro 2024 campaign with an edgy 2-1 Group F win over a dogged Czech Republic.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old Conceicao pounced on a mistake from Robin Hranac to fire home from close range in the third minute of added time, moments after Portugal were left crestfallen when a Diogo Jota effort was chalked off by VAR for offside.</p>
        
            <p>The Czechs had stunned the Portuguese fans packed inside the Leipzig Stadium when they took the lead out of the blue in the 62nd minute as Lukas Provod's superb curling effort threatened to cause an almighty upset.</p>
        
            <p>Yet the unfortunate Hranac scored an own goal seven minutes later to set up a frantic finish that saw Portugal claim the three points to leave them level in the group with Turkey who beat Georgia 3-1 earlier on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A stunning long-range strike from teenager Arda Guler helped lift Turkey to their win over debutants Georgia, as they slugged it out in the pouring rain at a raucous Dortmund BVB Stadion.</p>
        
            <p>Guler became the youngest player to score on his debut at a Euros aged 19 years and 114 days - beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record - in between goals for Turkey from Mert Muldur and Kerem Akturkoglu, with Georges Mikautadze replying for Georgia.</p>
        
            <p>Arguably the best game of the tournament so far had everything from great goals to shots flying off the woodwork to late drama in an intense atmosphere created by the deafening Turkish fans, thanks to Germany's large Turkish population.</p>
        
            <p>Turkey had more possession but were often exposed in defence and had to dig deep as Georgia gave as good as they got, threatening an equaliser with a flurry of attacks deep in added time that left Turkish fans desperate for the final whistle.</p>
