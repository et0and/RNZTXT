            <p>Highlanders v Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm Friday 14 March</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth Barr Stadium</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes hooker Asafo Aumua is sick of watching rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Sidelined since late last year the All Blacks front rower makes his Super Rugby return on Friday night when the Hurricanes take on the Highlanders in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>He's been named on the bench alongside All Blacks prop Tyrel Lomax, with the pair's inclusion a major boost for a Hurricanes side languishing in last place in the standings with just one win from four games.</p>

            <p>Aumua can't wait to get stuck in after a longer than expected recovery from a foot/calf injury.</p>
        
            <p>"Been a bit slow. Had a few hiccups along the way with other little niggles around my foot and leg. So, yeah, I've been frustrated watching rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably the most rugby I've watched. I've watched every game, every weekend so far," Aumua said.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes have made a poor start to the season, but Aumua is confident they're not far away from finding the winning formula.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been pretty tough for the boys. I think it's more on just executing those high pressure moments. Had a few of them so far and we haven't really nailed them," Aumua said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I feel like we've had a good week this week. A few old dogs back in the team."</p>
        
            <p>Aumua returns via the bench rather than starting but it won't change his approach.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing too different. Just probably a bit more energy coming on. Bring a bit of noise and a bit of physicality. I can't wait."</p>

            <p>Aumua is one of the Hurricanes four co-captains, but he concedes he's found it hard to help while sidelined and said he'd much rather lead through his actions on the field.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels it's a bit difficult sometimes trying to speak when you're not playing and you want to motivate the boys, but you don't know what they're feeling out there to what I'm seeing at home on the couch eating chips but I try where I can to keep the boys up."</p>
        
            <p>While he knows the Hurricanes need to start winning Aumua isn't overly concerned by their position at the bottom of the table heading into round five.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really care to be honest. It's the same thing every year. Some of the top teams started off at the bottom last year but made their way up. It's more around the middle and back end of the season. That's where we really need to hone in and nail those moments."</p>
        
            <p>After a strong 2024, Aumua is highly motivated to continue that form in Super Rugby and retain his place in the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"I sort of still feel like I'm on that roller coaster at the moment. Finished on a good high last year and now I just want to get back into it."</p>
        
            <p>That quest starts off the bench for the Hurricanes on Friday night.</p>
