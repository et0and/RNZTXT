            <p>The All Whites are heading to The Tron to serve up a special treat to Waikato football fans as they take on Vanuatu in a FIFA World Cup qualifier on Friday night. New Zealand's men have never played a full international in Hamilton. The last time a New Zealand XI played in the Waikato was a bizarre exhibition invitational against a Kevin Keegan XI at Porritt Stadium in 1985.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams enter the game with one win from one game in their respective qualifying group - meaning a win for either side should see them advance to the next stage of OFC qualifying.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC's impressive start to life in the A-League has clearly not gone unnoticed by All Whites head coach Darren Bazeley. Not only do the likes of Nando Pijnaker, Tommy Smith and Logan Rogerson all retain their places in the squad there is a first time call-up for the impressive wideman Liam Gillion. Francis de Vries is also back in the international fold, replacing Sam Sutton as the left-back alternative to Libby Cacace. The Auckland love-in ends there though, with Cam Howieson left at home - Joe Bell taking his place. Ben Old's unfortunate long-term injury opens the door for a returning Sarpreet Singh.</p>

            <p>New Zealand come into this World Cup qualifier double header in high spirits and on the brink of reaching the semi-final stages of OFC qualification. Following a sauntering win over Tahiti in their first qualifier and a rampant triumph over Malaysia in a friendly last October, confidence is at an all-time high in Bazeley's group.</p>
        
            <p>In Chris Wood, New Zealand have the reigning Premier League player of the month and he will be desperate to have an impact in the Waikato. The 32-year-old was half his age the last time he played football in Kirikiriroa - a March 2008 New Zealand Football Championship clash with YoungHeart Manawatu. That was with Waikato FC and Wood also had stints at Hamilton Wanderers and Cambridge FC before heading to England where he has become a regular goalscorer in one of the world's elite football divisions.</p>

            <p>On paper, this is New Zealand's biggest challenge of their World Cup qualifying group. A repeat of June's OFC Men's Nations Cup final, Vanuatu appears to have established themselves as the best of the rest in Oceania.</p>
        
            <p>Star player Brian Kaltak is no stranger to New Zealand shores having spent time playing in Wellington, Masterton, Nelson and, most memorably, a four-year stint at Auckland City. At Central Coast Mariners the 31-year-old has established himself as one of the A-League's best defenders and will relish the challenge of facing off against one of the world's most in-form strikers.</p>
        
            <p>Other than Kaltak, Mitch Cooper, Jared Clark and the enigmatic Bong Kalo will be Vanuatu's dangermen as they chase a first win over the Kiwis in 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>30 June 2024 Vanuatu 0-3 New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>21 June 2024 Vanuatu 0-4 New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>31 May 2016 Vanuatu 0-5 New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand can expect a high-energy approach from their game opponents but recent history suggests another win on the road to potential World Cup qualification for the All Whites.</p>
        
            <p>They faced Vanuatu twice, on home turf, at the Nations Cup earlier this year, winning 4-0 in the group stage before cruising to a sixth continental title with a 3-0 victory in the final.</p>
        
            <p>A similar, if not identical result, seems likely.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 3-0 Vanuatu</p>
