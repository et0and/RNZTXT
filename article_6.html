            <p>The White Ferns have levelled their T20 series against Sri Lanka, with a comfortable seven wicket win at Hagley Oval in Christchurch in the second of three internationals.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Suzie Bates was instrumental in the win, scoring 47 off 46, after her decision on winning the toss - to bowl first - proved the right one.</p>
        
            <p>The game was the opening match in the double-header at the ground, with the Black Caps playing Pakistan in the first of a five T20 match series.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns bowlers were on target, restricting the visitors to 113 for seven in their 20 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Bree Illing provided the early spark, bowling opener Vishmi Gunaratne with just the third ball of the match.</p>
        
            <p>The bowlers kept the screws on, and the Sri Lankans could not put together a big enough partnership to help them to a more competitive total.</p>
        
            <p>Youngster Manudi Nanayakkara top-scored with 35, while Illing took two for 18, bowling off her four overs.</p>
        
            <p>There was a big moment for the Ferns when spinner Flora Devonshire took her first international wicket on T20 debut, bowling Kavisha Dilhari.</p>

            <p>The White Ferns lost Georgia Plimmer and Emma McLeod early, but Bates and Brooke Halliday put them well on the way to victory before Bates fell to a brilliant catch by bowler Inoshi Fernando just short of her 50.</p>
        
            <p>Halliday played an assured innings, keeping the score ticking over with an unbeaten 46 off 40 balls, before Izzy Sharp hit the winning runs in just her second match for the side.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka had won the opening match, also by seven wickets, in Nelson on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>"We were really disappointed after the other night, just I guess the type of game we played and we were really determined to turn that around," Bates told Sky Sport after today's victory.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought our bowlers did an outstanding job in the power play and I just knew we had to take the game deep and kill it in the end."</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lankan captain Chamari Athapaththu said the White Ferns bowling, especially in the first six overs, had proved decisive.</p>
        
            <p>"We did not have enough runs on the board to defend."</p>
        
            <p>The deciding match in the series will be played in Dunedin on Tuesday.</p>
