            <p>If Tokyo was for the demons, Paris was for the love of it.</p>
        
            <p>When Emma Twigg took to the Vaires-sur-Marne course on Saturday morning (Paris time), it was with a lightness in her heart. She was determined to "put it all out there" and soak up the experience in the last race of her 16-year Olympic rowing career.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout the week Twigg spoke at length with her friend and mentor back home, double Olympic champion Mah√© Drysdale, about everything from race tactics and coping with the intense Olympic environment.</p>
        
            <p>When the pressure of regatta week threatened to overwhelm, Drysdale was the "calming voice" Twigg needed to regain perspective.</p>
        
            <p>His words were ringing in her ear as Twigg produced a stunning silver medal performance, pushing race favourite Karolien Florijn of the Netherlands with a bold surge as they approached the final 500m.</p>
        
            <p>But 200m from the line, Twigg's "creaky old body" had nothing left. She crossed the line in second, just ahead of Lithuania's Viktorija Senkute, who claimed bronze.</p>

            <p>"I can be proud that I emptied the tank and a silver medal is phenomenal," a delighted Twigg said after the race.</p>
        
            <p>The silver follows her gold medal win at the Tokyo Games three years prior - a regatta in which Twigg felt the oppressive weight of two near misses in the previous two Games after finishing fourth at the London 2012 Olympics and again in Rio four years later.</p>
        
            <p>Now 37, Twigg entered her fifth Olympic regatta with a different mindset. In the lead-up to the Games she spoke of wanting to soak up the experience and enjoy the parts of the Olympics "that I probably haven't in the past because I was so focused on trying to win medals".</p>
        
            <p>Sporting her newest Olympic prize, Twigg said each of the clunky pieces of precious metal meant something different to her.</p>
        
            <p>"Tokyo for me was I guess redemption of the fact that I believed I could be an Olympic champion, and that I always had it in me and the results in London and Rio were not me," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today was about racing for the pure love of it. I was super proud with how I executed when it counted and to have the race of my life and be there with Karolien, who I have been chasing for the last three years, was equally as special."</p>

            <p>Paris was different too in that it was Twigg's first Olympics as a mum. Sitting in the packed-out stands for the final day of the Olympic rowing programme - traditionally reserved for the blue riband events - was her two year-old son Tommy.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from a brief cuddle earlier in the week when he and Twigg's wife Charlotte arrived in Paris, she had not seen her family in six weeks. Twigg's mother, who has been assisting with childcare, picked up a bug on the way over, and it was decided it was best for the veteran rower to keep her distance.</p>
        
            <p>"I figure I've been away for six weeks, so what's another few days, you know. The detail is important at this point. It's been hard, for sure, but that is the nature of the beast. He doesn't know any different at this point."</p>
        
            <p>While much of Tommy's interest on race day was absorbed solely by his snack box, Twigg hopes one day he will be able to take pride in his mum's achievements.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, he did not give a shit [about the race]. He looked really confused that I was down there and he couldn't see me. I haven't seen him all week so I'm really looking forward to a cuddle.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully one day he will be able to look back and put on mama's medals and be really proud of what I've done and hopefully he feels like he can chase his dreams as well."</p>
        
            <p>Twigg's silver capped off a strong week for New Zealand rowing on the Vaires-sur-Marne course, following a magic hour on day four of the Games, when three Kiwi crews - the women's double, and the men's and women's fours - all secured medals.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Mackintosh, who made his rowing comeback only 14 months ago, could not add to the New Zealand medal haul on the final day.</p>
        
            <p>Racing last up in the programme following a bizarre delay after one of the athletes was late arriving to the course due to an issue with athlete transportation, Mackintosh finished fifth in a highly competitive men's final that came down to a thrilling sprint finish.</p>
        
            <p>The pace of the of the final 200m clearly took its toll on Mackintosh, who was slumped over his oars, gasping for breath as he crossed the finish line.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud that I took my body to that place today. As aerobic athletes you strive to be in races where you physically exert yourself to your limit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little bit gutting not to be in the medals, because coming here that was the goal, but at the end of the day I gave it everything I had and I'm very proud of that."</p>
