            <p>Australian spinner Nathan Lyon has expressed his gratitude for what Black Caps legend Daniel Vettori has been able to do for him and his side.</p>
        
            <p>Vettori, New Zealand's most successful spin bowler, has been a part of Australia's coaching staff for the last two years.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest on a long list of coaching assignments for Vettori since he retired from playing in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon is in Wellington to prepare for the first test against the Black Caps at the Basin Reserve, which starts on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The 36 year old, who is eighth on the list of all-time test wicket takers with 517, was full of praise for what Vettori has done.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been able to give us some really good insights in the way that the New Zealand batters think, which is amazing," Lyon said.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone who has done a similar craft to myself has been incredibly valuable for my career since he's jumped on board in the last couple of years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing to have a Kiwi legend in our changing room handing out all the secrets which is nice."</p>
        
            <p>Lyon is one of just five Australians on the current tour that last played here in 2016 when they won the test series 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>It is a battle between the first (New Zealand) and third (Australia) ranked teams in the World Test Championship standings and the winners of the last two Championship finals.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of excitement throughout the group.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously we respect the quality of the New Zealand side so it's going to be a great series."</p>

            <p>Lyon is likely to bowl into the wind in the capital, just like he did in 2016 when he took seven for 123 across the test.</p>
        
            <p>"Fond memories, a few of the big quicks didn't want to run into it ... so that's where I get my overs."</p>
        
            <p>There is a chance New Zealand will not select a specialist spinner for the Basin Reserve especially after Mitchell Santner was left out of the side for the second test against South Africa. However, Lyon said there is always a need for spin.</p>
        
            <p>"If it seams, it spins ... spin to win in my eyes.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to see what pitches are produced. But I dare say there'll be some spin in there."</p>
        
            <p>There are five members of the current Black Caps squad that were a part of the 2016 series; Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Tim Southee, Matt Henry and Neil Wagner.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are hoping to beat Australia in a test at home for the first time in 31 years.</p>
        
            <p>The 1993 series was drawn 1-all after New Zealand won the third test by five wickets at Eden Park.</p>
