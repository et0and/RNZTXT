            <p>A showdown between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and social media influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul on Saturday is the latest one-two punch from Netflix, as the media giant hopes to cash in on sports' sprint to streaming.</p>
        
            <p>The intergenerational showdown has all the makings of a crossover hit, with 58-year-old Tyson bringing in the old guard and 27-year-old Paul, who achieved early fame on YouTube, appealing to the younger, screen-toting social media junkies.</p>
        
            <p>Available to all of Netflix's more than 280 million subscribers for no additional fee, it could be a welcome change for American boxing fans accustomed to shelling out extra to watch marquee matches on long-time broadcaster HBO.</p>
        
            <p>"The trend in all sports right now is moving some of their properties to streaming," said Bob Dorfman, a veteran San Francisco-based sports marketing analyst.</p>
        
            <p>"This is two huge personalities - it does have the potential to be the biggest streaming sports event."</p>
        
            <p>The American subscription television network HBO announced in 2018 it was dropping live boxing from its programming, ending a 45-year relationship with the sport and leaving a broadcasting vacuum in its wake.</p>
        
            <p>Netflix has dabbled in sports content before, with exhibition golf and tennis events and the wildly popular docuseries Formula 1: Drive to Survive, which is credited with boosting the auto racing circuit's popularity in the US.</p>
        
            <p>The fight at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, its first live boxing event, works in favour of Netflix's strategy of providing proprietary content that viewers cannot find elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>While the fight will not have traditional advertising, it has sponsors whose messages will be part of the livestreamed event.</p>
        
            <p>Advertising is not a major contributor to the streamer's current revenue, though its ad-supported tier is quickly growing, with 70 million subscribers reported this week, up from 40 million in May.</p>
        
            <p>The mega-event is the sign of a lasting love affair between sport and streaming, said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports, though he predicts streaming and traditional broadcast will exist side-by-side for the foreseeable future.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a one-time-only event ... It's more as a novelty in my view. It doesn't change the industry," said Pilson, president of Pilson Communications.</p>
        
            <p>"The industry is still going to be driven by the league deals [like] MLS, NFL, Major League Baseball."</p>
        
            <p>Amazon Prime picked up Thursday Night Football in 2021 and MLS signed a 10-year mega-deal with Apple TV in 2022 worth a reported US$2.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Major League Baseball signed a deal with Apple for Friday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader, in 2022, as well.</p>
        
            <p>Leagues have been gravitating to streaming both because it reaches a global audience, including younger viewers, who are not watching traditional television.</p>
        
            <p>MLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Apple streaming platform allows MLS to better take advantage of the sport's global fanbase.</p>
        
            <p>"We were seeing the difficulty of getting an audience and getting the economics right with local and regional television - we saw that in 2018," Garber said this week at the Paley International Council Summit.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to go to the market with a global package ... We have a subscription that's global, every one of our 600 games is treated like 'Monday Night Football'."</p>
