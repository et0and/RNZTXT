        <h2>Tohu Harris gone: Who is the Warriors' next leader?</h2>
        <p>
The loss of their hardworking skipper is just what the club did not need as a huge season looms.

            <p>The Warriors have already found themselves on the back foot, and the season has not even started yet. Tohu Harris's announcement that he's done with the NRL came somewhat out of the blue this morning, with the 234-game veteran calling time due to an ongoing wrist injury.</p>
        
            <p>Out of all the players that the Warriors could have ill-afforded to lose this year, a fit Harris was certainly near the top of the list. There is already been enough of a shakeup with Addin Fonua-Blake and Shaun Johnson moving on, plus the fact that the Warriors slipped back into their usual role of also-rans last season after making it to a preliminary final in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>So who takes over as Warriors captain? A few names jump out, so here's the cases for each:</p>

            <p>Probably the first player to come to mind is Barnett, given that he made his New South Wales and Kanagroos debut last year. He was a shining light of consistency in an otherwise grind of a season, took over as leader when Harris was injured, plus has the sort of no-nonsense demeanour that Warriors fans have always craved from their Australian imports. Does it matter if the Warriors captain is an Aussie? As long as they win, certainly not.</p>

            <p>A serious case because he has done it before, but you would think first some certainty over Tuivasa-Sheck's position on the field would need to be established first. While he has been accepting of his spot at centre, it does not take too much reading between the lines to see he wants to be back at fullback, where Charnze Niccol-Klokstad stands in his way. The bigger question is whether Tuivasa-Sheck would even want the role, given the spotlight that has been on him constantly since his switch to union and back.</p>

            <p>This would make perfect sense if Fisher-Harris was not stepping off the plane and straight into the role of captain. The role he has got is tough enough anyway, having to fill Fonua-Blake's boots as the most productive forward in the Warriors, so it is likely he will just be left to run it straight for this season. Go forward though, watch this space.</p>

            <p>The Queensland Origin forward has not exactly lit up the pitch with ball in hand but does have the advantage of being someone Andrew Webster specifically brought in to play a role. That was very much to give the Warriors a strong defensive presence, which is something that can be translated into a captaincy role. Capewell is definitely a good public presence, however his injury record is not great so it is hard to see him being on the field for an entire season.</p>

            <p>Purely on experience, Watene-Zelezniak is in the conversation having played 212 NRL games. He will be on the park for 80 minutes a week, is a proven try scorer and extremely popular with fans. If nothing else, it means we will get to see him cracking more press conference jokes and talking about his glorious hair.</p>
        
            <p>Hey, they could always bring back Kane Evans or Matt Lodge.</p>
