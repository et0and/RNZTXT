            <p>The Crusaders have climbed back up the Super Rugby Pacific ladder with an impressive 43-19 win over the Reds in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Two tries each to All Blacks Sevu Reece and Will Jordan did the damage for the home side, although much of the credit has to go to a very good effort at the breakdown by the Crusaders loose forwards against the highly rated Reds trio.</p>
        
            <p>Flanker Cullen Grace was the first to cross the line after spotting a gap close to the ruck, with Reece following him soon after for his first after some brilliant lead up work off a halfway line scrum by Kyle Preston and Jordan.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds hit back with a lovely team try started by a surging run upfield by big lock Josh Canham and finished off by Filipo Daugunu, but Reece answered back straight away after a thumping tackle by Ethan Blackadders jolted the ball free. Jordan then scored his double, his second off a deft little kick through by Chay Fihaki and it looked like the game might develop into a high scoring shootout.</p>
        
            <p>However, only three more tries in the second half were added to the seven in the first. Christian Lio-Willie was well rewarded for a good game when he dotted down just after the restart, then Lachie Anderson answered back for the Reds 10 minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>From there the Crusaders simply shut up shop because they really didn't need to force anything with a big lead, the Reds simply ran out of ideas by about the hour mark anyway. A late try to Levi Aumua sealed the win for the home side, with Rob Penney a much happier coach than after their last outing, a decisive loss to the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>It was the Reds' first loss of the year, but they'll be looking to make amends next weekend against interstate rivals the Waratahs next weekend in Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders welcome the Force to Christchurch, this win lifts them off the bottom of the table all the way up to a share of fourth place in a very hotly contested Super Rugby Pacific competition.</p>
