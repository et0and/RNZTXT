            <p>Two big regional battles dominate this weekend's Super Rugby Pacific action, albeit at either end of the ladder. The Blues welcome the Hurricanes to Eden Park in a mouth-watering match-up on Saturday afternoon, before the Highlanders host the Crusaders in the Southern Classic later that night. Across the ditch, a couple of Aussie derbies will go a long way to shaping the playoff picture as well.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm Friday 10 May</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Mt Smart Stadium, Auckland</p>

            <p>The Chiefs have racked up just under 100 points in their last two games and will be looking to keep that sort of attacking heat going against Moana, who have dropped their last two. However, Tana Umaga's side is still very much in the hunt for a playoff spot as they hope to leapfrog the Drua and Highlanders if they can pull off an unlikely upset.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Nigel Ah Wong, 13 Pepesana Patafilo, 12 Lalomilo Lalomilo, 11 Neria Fomai, 10 D'Angelo Leuila, 9 Aisea Halo, 8 Lotu Inisi, 7 Alamanda Motuga, 6 Miracle Fai ªilagi, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Semisi Paea, 3 Suetena Asomua, 2 Sama Malolo (c), 1 Saketi Latu</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Tomasi Maka, 17 Abraham Pole, 18 Sione Mafileo, 19 Tom Savage, 20 Irie Papuni, 21 Siaosi Nginingini, 22 Otumaka Mausia, 23 Kyren Taumoefolau</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 14 Liam Coombes-Fabling, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 12 Quinn Tupaea, 11 Daniel Rona, 10 Josh Jacomb, 9 Xavier Roe, 8 Wallace Sititi, 7 Luke Jacobson (c), 6 Simon Parker, 5 Tupou Vaa'i, 4 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 3 Reuben O'Neill, 2 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 1 Ollie Norris</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Tyrone Thompson, 17 Jared Proffit, 18 Sione Ahio, 19 Hamilton Burr, 20 Kaylum Boshier, 21 Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, 22 Rameka Poihipi, 23 Gideon Wrampling</p>

            <p>Are the Reds the best team to watch in SRP right now? They've certainly put forward a couple of compelling performances in their last two games, including a landmark win over the Crusaders last weekend. Unfortunately for the Rebels, it looks like the very favourable draw they enjoyed has run its course, they now face an uphill battle to remain in the top eight.</p>
        
            <p>Reds: 15 Jock Campbell, 14 Tim Ryan, 13 Josh Flook, 12 Hunter Paisami, 11 Mac Grealy, 10 Lawson Creighton, 9 Kalani Thomas, 8 Harry Wilson, 7 Fraser McReight, 6 Liam Wright (cc), 5 Angus Blyth, 4 Ryan Smith, 3 Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, 2 Matt Faessler, 1 Sef Fa'agase</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Josh Nasser, 17 Peni Ravai, 18 Zane Nonggorr, 19 Connor Vest, 20 John Bryant, 21 Tate McDermott, 22 James O'Connor, 23 Suliasi Vunivalu</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Andrew Kellaway, 14 Lachie Anderson, 13 Filipo Daugunu, 12 Nick Jooste, 11 Darby Lancaster, 10 Carter Gordon, 9 Ryan Louwrens, 8 Rob Leota (c), 7 Vaiolini Ekuasi, 6 Josh Kemeny, 5 Josh Canham, 4 Angelo Smith, 3 Taniela Tupou, 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 Isaac Kailea</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Alex Mafi, 17 Cabous Eloff, 18 Sam Talakai, 19 Tuaina Taii Tualima, 20 Maciu Nabolakasi, 21 Jack Maunder, 22 Jake Strachan, 23 Glen Vaihu</p>

            <p>They don't get much bigger than this, both the Canes and Blues are in great form and are potentially playing for home field advantage through the playoffs. So there's plenty on the line in this All Black-laden match-up at the family friendly afternoon kick-off time.</p>
        
            <p>It's also a battle of two coaches at opposite ends of the experience spectrum, with first year revelation Clark Laidlaw up against Vern Cotter - currently into his third decade of professional coaching.</p>
        
            <p>Blues: 15 Zarn Sullivan, 14 Mark Tele'a, 13 AJ Lam, 12 Bryce Heem, 11 Caleb Clarke, 10 Harry Plummer, 9 Taufa Funaki, 8 Hoskins Sotutu, 7 Dalton Papali'i, 6 Akira Ioane, 5 Sam Darry, 4 Patrick Tuipulotu (c), 3 Marcel Renata, 2 Ricky Riccitelli, 1 Ofa Tu'ungafasi</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Kurt Eklund, 17 Joshua Fusitu'a, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Josh Beehre, 20 Adrian Choat, 21 Sam Nock, 22 Corey Evans, 23 Cole Forbes</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Ruben Love, 14 Josh Moorby, 13 Billy Proctor, 12 Jordie Barrett, 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Brett Cameron, 9 TJ Perenara, 8 Brayden Iose, 7 Peter Lakai, 6 Brad Shields (c), 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 4 Caleb Delany, 3 Tyrel Lomax, 2 Kianu Kereru-Symes, 1 Xavier Numia</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Raymond Tuputupu, 17 Pouri Rakete-Stones, 18 Pasilio Tosi, 19 Justin Sangster, 20 Devan Flanders, 21 Du'Plessis Kirifi, 22 Richard Judd, 23 Bailyn Sullivan</p>

            <p>Down south the Highlanders will be out to break their duck against the Crusaders at home, a fixture they haven't won since 2018. This is a real dance of the desperate, with the Crusaders crashing to a defeat at home last weekend, while the Highlanders have fared slightly better with two tough wins. The two under fire coaches, Clarke Dermody and Rob Penney, will be desperate to get a bit of heat off before a big last three weekends.</p>

            <p>The Brumbies are coming off a tough win against the Drua last weekend and will be keen to shut down their old rivals, while the Waratahs are simply trying to salvage something from another disappointing season.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>This is a big one for the Drua, if they can pull off their only away win of the season then it'll give them a decent foot in the door of the top eight before they have two crucial home fixtures in their last three games. The Force are still alive too but will need to win this one to have any chance heading into the last three weeks.</p>
