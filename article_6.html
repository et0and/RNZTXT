It says a lot that Scott Robertson has justifiably benched his two best players from last weekend for the test against France, writes Jamie Wall.

            <p>Analysis - It says a lot that Scott Robertson has justifiably benched his two best performing players from last weekend. Asafo Aumua and Damian McKenzie are in the reserves for Sunday morning's clash with France, two of five changes to the starting team that beat Ireland 23-13 in an often grinding test match in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>Aumua's lineout throwing and McKenzie's goal kicking were literally the difference between winning and losing, but with Codie Taylor and Beauden Barrett fit again, Robertson has rolled the two veterans back in.</p>
        
            <p>That's the luxury the All Blacks have right now. This tour was always going to have a high attrition rate, with six players ruled out of this test, but really this side isn't losing an awful lot with the injury-enforced changes.</p>
        
            <p>With the loose forward reshuffle, many social media comments sections should now be satisfied with Ardie Savea's shift back to openside and the subsequent switch for Wallace Sititi to the number eight position he starred in for the Chiefs. Really though, this is Samipeni Finau's chance to prove that he's not a flat track bully. Finau has only started one test since the England series and hasn't really translated his blockbusting Super Rugby Pacific reputation to test level yet, but in fairness it took a bit of perseverance with Shanon Frizell to do the same.</p>

            <p>Sevu Reece is pretty lucky to find himself back in the starting test side, having again been the last man standing when it comes to established wingers. It would be interesting to know how close Robertson was to pulling the trigger on one of his rookies, or indeed a back three reshuffle to accommodate Beauden Barrett at fullback and Will Jordan on the wing.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson outlined Cam Roigard's start over Cortez Ratima came down to prospect that there'll be a lot of kicking. But it's hard not to think Ratima's struggles against Ireland, basically the only thing the Irish managed to achieve effectively in the test, played a part in that selection. Ratima will certainly play a part in this test as a closer, however he may not be marking Antoine Dupont by the time he enters the field.</p>
        
            <p>That's because Dupont may well be playing at first five by then. The French have no backup for starting 10 Thomas Ramos, who usually plays fullback anyway, on the bench. In yet another sign that French rugby is sliding back into its comically bizarre ways, regular starter Matthieu Jalibert this week walked out of the team after coach Fabien Galthié indicated he'd be benched for this test. It comes after a dramatic year for the French, with Melvyn Jaminet currently serving a 34 week suspension for making racist remarks on social media and two players being charged with aggravated rape during the team's tour of Argentina in July.</p>

            <p>Of course, that's no reason to take France lightly at all. This is a side that sacked their coach halfway through a World Cup campaign and then came within a missed kick of winning the final, and that's just one of the most ridiculous yet brilliant moments in their history. The issue though is that for the last few years, they've managed to shelve most of their off field distractions, and it's paid off handsomely with the best patch of consistency France has ever enjoyed.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson knows that full well. He spent several years playing at Perpignan, can speak the language and understands French rugby culture in its full volatility. However, it's becoming clear that he has his own understanding of the All Black player depth, because while it's being tested this weekend in Paris, Robertson has managed to assemble a more than formidable squad.</p>
