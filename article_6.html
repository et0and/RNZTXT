            <p>Kiwi UFC star Carlos Ulberg is set for the biggest fight of his life.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off a spectacular 12-second knockout of Alonzo Menifield, 'The Black Jag' will take on former light heavyweight champion Jahmal Hill at UFC 303 on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>The event will be headlined by the return of the biggest name in the sport, Conor McGregor.</p>
        
            <p>Ulberg will step up as a replacement for Khalil Rountree Jnr who has been suspended for a doping violation.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old has been on fire inside the octagon since losing his UFC debut, riding a six-fight winning streak and finishing all but one opponent.</p>
        
            <p>Now ranked 11th in the light-heavyweight rankings, Ulberg will co-main event against American Hill, who made his first walk since dropping his title to Ale Pereira in April.</p>
        
            <p>With seven knockouts from his 12 career wins, Hill is also a seasoned striker which should result in an exciting stand up exchange with City Kickboxing's Ulberg.</p>
        
            <p>The event is poised to be one of the biggest PPVs in UFC history, marking the return of the 'Notorious' Conor McGregor from a three-year absence.</p>
        
            <p>His last fight against Dustin Porier in July 2021 saw McGregor snap his leg, but the Irishman is back to meet 'Iron' Michael Chandler in the main event in Las Vegas.</p>
