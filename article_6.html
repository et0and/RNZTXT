            <p>Tony Jones has issued an apology to Novak Djokovic after the tennis great boycotted an on-court interview over "insulting and offensive comments" by the reporter on Australian Open host broadcaster Channel Nine.</p>
        
            <p>Jones, during a live cross to Nine News Melbourne on Friday, turned around to vocal Serbian fans behind him and said Djokovic was "overrated" and "a has-been", adding "kick him out", apparently referencing the 2022 tournament when the Serb was not allowed to play due to his COVID vaccination status.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said he was joking but Djokovic did not take it kindly, saying he "made a mockery of Serbian fans" and describing the comments about him as "insulting and offensive" after eschewing the traditional on-court TV interview when he beat Jiří Lehečka to advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
        
            <p>The 10-time Australian Open winner said on Sunday the interview boycott would continue until Jones and Nine apologised.</p>

            <p>On Monday morning, Jones said he considered his comments "banter" or "humour" but that he contacted Djokovic's camp to apologise as soon as he found out he had struck a nerve, which he said happened 48 hours ago.</p>
        
            <p>"As I stand here now, I stand by that apology to Novak, if he felt any disrespect, which quite clearly he does," Jones told Nine.</p>
        
            <p>As far as "making a mockery" of the Serbian fans, Jones said he thought he had a rapport with them.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite clearly that hasn't been interpreted that way, so I do feel as though I've let down the Serbian fans," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not just saying this to try and wriggle out of trouble or anything. I genuinely feel for those fans. If I could turn back time … in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd: 'Kick him out'.</p>
        
            <p>"That has angered Novak, which I completely understand now. So look, it has been an unfortunate situation, it's been one of personal angst for Novak. It's quite clearly personal angst for me as well, but I just think the priority here now is to focus on the tennis again."</p>

            <p>Djokovic earlier this month claimed he was "poisoned" by the food he received in quarantine before being deported before the 2022 Australian Open.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Darren Cahill, who currently coaches top-ranked men's player Jannik Sinner, broke down the situation for US viewers on ESPN, which included trying to describe Jones's role hosting The Footy Show.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure Tony was trying to be funny, but it was inappropriate and I don't blame Novak for taking offence to that," Cahill said, to which former world number four James Blake agreed.</p>
        
            <p>It was not the first time Jones's name has been invoked unfavourably by a star at this year's Australian Open.</p>

            <p>American pantomime villain Danielle Collins was labelled a "brat" by Jones on radio station 3AW after Collins told the crowd to kiss her backside following her second-round win over Australian Destanee Aiava.</p>
        
            <p>"I love this old guy. Tony? Tony Jones? This old … sorry to everybody in the room that's over, like, 70. Sorry," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just loved how he called me a 'brat'. And, like, it's just so, like, Gen Z and Millennial right now. It's Charli XCX and I really want him to do the dance that she does. He has to do it. He has to."</p>
        
            <p>The treatment of Collins put the Melbourne Park fans' behaviour in the spotlight, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on ABC Radio Sydney after Djokovic's comments that "there is a place for more respect".</p>

            <p>"We need more kindness and generosity and respect, I think that's what people are looking for," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that someone booing a fault is wrong myself, but Australian fans are feisty, it's a great tournament."</p>
