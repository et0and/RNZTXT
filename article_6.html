            <p>The Blues have suffered a huge blow heading into the Super Rugby Pacific semi-finals with talisman skipper Patrick Tuipulotu ruled out for the rest of their campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Tuipulotu limped off 20 minutes into the Blues' quarter-final against the Fijian Drua on Saturday night. Dalton Papali'i stepped up to the captaincy role as the side beat the Drua 36-5.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues confirmed on Sunday that Tuipulotu had torn the medial ligament in his right knee.</p>
        
            <p>He is likely to be out of rugby for six to seven weeks, so will not only miss the Blues' semi-final against the Brumbies in Auckland on Friday and potentially the final, but will also not figure in All Blacks coach Scott Robertson's plans for the tests against England in July.</p>
        
            <p>Tuipulotu had been in imposing form for the Blues this season and Papali'i hailed him after the Drua match as an exceptional leader.</p>
        
            <p>Papali'i is likely to replace him as skipper and said on Saturday night he was ''comfortable" about taking over if Tuipulotu was ruled out.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues will be hoping to have Sam Darry and Laghlan McWhannell back to boost their locking stocks for the Brumbies semi-final after they missed the quarter-final because of concussion protocols.</p>
        
            <p>The Brumbies beat the Highlanders 32-16 on Saturday night and are the only Australian team left in the competition after the Chiefs eliminated the Reds on Friday night and the Hurricanes beat the Melbourne Rebels on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues beat the Brumbies 46-7 in April.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes will have home advantage over the Chiefs in the other semi-final on Saturday.</p>
