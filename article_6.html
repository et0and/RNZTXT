            <p>Bangladesh have beaten the Black Caps by nine wickets in the third and final one day cricket international in Napier.</p>
        
            <p>It's Bangladesh's first ODI win over the Black Caps in New Zealand, although the home side wins the series 2-1.</p>
        
            <p>Having dismissed New Zealand for just 98 - the Black Caps lowest ever total against Bangladesh- the tourists knocked off their target in just over 15 overs and for the loss of just one wicket, with skipper Najmul Shanto making an unbeaten half century.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists won the toss and opted to bowl and took wickets regularly on a pitch which offered the pace bowlers bounce and seam.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps opener Will Young (26) top scored while only three other batters made double figures - Tom Latham (21), Josh Clarkson (16) and Adithya Ashok (10).</p>
        
            <p>While conditions suited the bowlers the New Zealand batting line up failed to adjust to the side way movement the McLean Park pitch offered.</p>
        
            <p>Bowling for Bangladesh Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Soumya Sarkar each took three wickets.</p>
        
            <p>It's New Zealand lowest total against Bangladesh in an ODI, the previous lowest being 162 in 2014 in Mirpur.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's lowest total in an ODI is 64 against Pakistan in 1986.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh has never won an ODI against the Black Caps in New Zealand having lost all 18 games.</p>
