            <p>Erin Routliffe has made more tennis history for New Zealand and grabbed a lucrative payday by clinching the women's doubles title at the WTA Finals tournament in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe and Canadian partner Gaby Dabrowski marched to an emphatic victory in the final in Riyadh, beatig Taylor Townsend of the United States and the Czech Republic's Katerina Siniakova 7-5 6-3.</p>
        
            <p>It completed an unbeaten week for the pair at the season-ending tournament which brings together the best eight doubles combinations over the year.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first WTA Finals title for both New Zealand and Canada.</p>

            <p>The final was also sweet revenge for Routliffe and Dabrowski, who lost in the Wimbledon final to Siniakova and Townsend in July - denying the pair a second major title after they combined to win the US Open last year.</p>
        
            <p>During the trophy presentation, Dabrowski explained what this victory meant for her and Routliffe.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe that our doubles partnership is extremely special," the Canadian said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not often that you can play doubles with someone who you feel very supported by, someone who's not only an amazing player, but a great friend and who has beautiful family and friends around them as well.</p>
        
            <p>"They make me feel so included in their group. And I'm a little bit of an introvert, and so I really appreciate everyone bringing the best out of me. So yes, our partnership's been amazing, and we can't wait for next year."</p>
        
            <p>Routliffe, who is the world No.2 ranked doubles player, thanked the big crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awesome for you guys to come watch doubles, we love it." Routliffe said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait to play for you guys again, we've had the most amazing experience. I really cannot put into words how amazing this week has been.</p>
        
            <p>"Gaby, thank you for playing with me. She talked about our partnership a little bit, she's always a lot better with words than I am.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'm just going say thank you so much, Gaby, to our team and everybody, we're so excited to come back and thank you so much."</p>
        
            <p>As has been the case for many of their pool matches, it was a slow start for Routliffe and Dabrowski, with the latter having her serve broken in the opening game.</p>
        
            <p>However, they broke back quickly and nailed a crucial second break off Siniakova's serve in the 12th game to seal the first set.</p>
        
            <p>In the second set they again broke Siniakova to go 5-3 up before Dabrowski successfully served for the championship.</p>
