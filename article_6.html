            <p>Analysis - The smoke has cleared on the Super Rugby Pacific final, and attention is quickly turning to the upcoming test season.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Robertson names his squad for matches with England and Fiji over the next month - so what has he made of the last four-and-a-half months of rugby?</p>
        
            <p>Here are a few topics that have no doubt been rattling around in discussion with his coaching staff, before they hand their list over to be read out on Monday evening:</p>
        
            <p>The money seems to be on Scott Barrett to be named captain, but while he is undoubtedly an excellent player and first pick in his position, his disciplinary record will cast a shadow over his dealings with officials and foreign press.</p>
        
            <p>Given there are 14 tests this year, there will be at least three actual captains anyway.</p>

            <p>Codie Taylor showed just how good he is by slotting seamlessly back into the Crusaders and fixing their ineffective lineout drive singlehandedly.</p>
        
            <p>While it is highly likely he starts with Asafo Aumua behind him, who comes into the third spot if Samisoni Taukei'aho remains sidelined? Next cabs off the rank appear to be Ricky Riccitelli or one of the Bell brothers.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Barrett and the miraculously rejuvenated Patrick Tuipulotu are the starting test combo, with Tupou Vaa'i's impressive body of work seeing him a sure pick too.</p>
        
            <p>After that, it is looking pretty thin, but Sam Darry, Manaaki Selby-Rickit or even Jamie Hannah might get a nod.</p>
        
            <p>Given they surely won't get thrust into the English series unless there's an injury crisis, it is a chance to ease in some young talent.</p>

            <p>TJ Perenara, Finlay Christie and Cortez Ratima look like the likely trio to be picked, with Ratima almost certainly getting saved for the Fiji test.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara was exceptional for the Hurricanes on his return, while Christie is the incumbent All Black, so who gets the nod will likely depend on what sort of style Robertson is implementing.</p>

            <p>There are going to be a few very unlucky loosies, with every team having at least one serious contender for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>While Ardie Savea and Dalton Papali'i are definites, just who joins them to complete the best balance will be interesting.</p>

            <p>The usual story for the All Blacks is the number of wings who have put their hands up for selection, with the spots generally going to the ones that have scored the most tries.</p>
        
            <p>Which means Sevu Reece is in line for a recall, ironically off the back of a horrible season for the Crusaders, but one in which he dotted down 12 times.</p>
        
            <p>Caleb Clarke has been immense for the Blues, while Emoni Narawa and Etene Nanai-Sturo have put their hands up too.</p>
        
            <p>While Clarke has scored a bunch of tries, he and Mark Tele'a's play this year has been drastically different thanks to Vern Cotter's direct style for his championship team. Will that also affect the chances of some of the other Blues, or will Robertson see it as a challenge to mould them into his own role players?</p>
        
            <p>It's a buzzword used to describe the way New Zealanders play rugby right now, but what does that even mean to Robertson?</p>
        
            <p>His DNA as a professional coach simply comes down to winning, that's all he's ever done, so just how far outside the infamously conservative All Black square will he go to keep achieving that?</p>
