            <p>Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua has a big decision to make about her coaching future after New Zealand finished third at netball's Nations Cup in Leeds this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns clinched a hard-fought 62-57 win over Uganda before Australia beat England 69-49 in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline is contracted to the end of February and will decide whether she wants to continue as Silver Ferns coach after taking on the role in August 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"Now that we've finished this tournament I can go into that space really clearly about what those decisions are going to be moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't envisage I'll be taking long to pull it out and hopefully by the first week of February I'll be able to see where I'm at," Dame Noeline said.</p>
        
            <p>The popular coach was very happy with the three debutants during the series - Georgia Heffernan, Amorangi Malesala and Tayla Earle.</p>
        
            <p>Strike shooter Grace Nweke continues to go from strength to strength and delivered another standout performance with 51 goals today.</p>
        
            <p>"There's amazing talent and potential in this current squad and when you think of the next four years of what that would look like it's awesome."</p>
        
            <p>But the popular coach said that would not sway her decision whether to walk away or not.</p>

            <p>"I don't think it's about this as such it's once again I feel what's best for the Silver Ferns and am I the right person so we will go into those discussions. Good thing is we'll come out of a review here and we'll see what the next step looks like."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline said the series showed there were some familiar work-ons.</p>
        
            <p>"Basic turnovers that's something that's really costly, yesterday against England we had 23 turnovers and you can't do that.</p>
        
            <p>"We got a lot of ball and we were able to do something with it ...we still need to get more ball or turnover ball, when we work like a unit we're formidable but sometimes we get isolated.</p>
        
            <p>"We're nearly close to the likes of England and Australia but still far but we are ticking along and that's really pleasing."</p>
        
            <p>So how can New Zealand bridge the gap?</p>
        
            <p>"When we go back to the ANZ [Premiership] that's a place where we can improve ...the system in itself needs to see what we can do in regards to the development and growth and raise the intensity.</p>
        
            <p>"That's probably putting more expectation on the players as well to lead their own programme. When it comes down to it it's about skill-sets, our ability to secure the ball under pressure and deliver it as well. We do that in spasms but consistency-wise we're not that good."</p>
        
            <p>The introduction of experienced heads in the second half helped New Zealand this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Leading by three at the last turn, the Silver Ferns faced some anxious moments as Uganda closed to within one but the presence at each end of the court of defender Kelly Jury and shooter Grace Nweke, and Whitney Souness in the midcourt provided the winning finishing touches in the run home.</p>
        
            <p>"We came out with the win and once again, with this current group, the only way that we can learn is by being on the job," Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua said.</p>
        
            <p>"This group has grown massively. We had 150 caps less than England in yesterday's game and really pushed that game to the wire. Our ability to back up from one game to another is still a bit of a work-on and our ability to close the door when we need to is still a work-on.</p>

            <p>With co-vice captain Kate Heffernan ruled out with an Achilles tendon niggle and Maddy Gordon out as a precaution after suffering a head knock at training, the Silver Ferns introduced a new-look starting line-up.</p>
        
            <p>Mila Reuelu-Buchanan lined up at wing attack, Tayla Earle donned the centre bib and Michaela Sokolich-Beatson slotted in at wing defence.</p>
        
            <p>After making her debut in the previous match, goal attack Amorangi Malesala made her first international starting line-up and was in the thick of action, her scoring accuracy and defensive work helped the Silver Ferns sneak into a 16-14 lead at the first break.</p>
        
            <p>Uganda's shooters, the 2.01m Mary Cholhok and captain Irene Eyaru worked perfectly together without missing a shot but it was Nweke who notched a significant personal milestone when scoring her 1000th goal during the first stanza in just her 13 test.</p>
        
            <p>On the back of a Silver Ferns lapse, Uganda levelled up midway through the quarter before hitting the lead with five minutes to go.</p>
        
            <p>A buzzer-time shot from Malesala helped leave the scores all tied up at 30-all at the main break.</p>
        
            <p>The injection of fresh personnel and positional changes paid dividends for the Silver Ferns who took a firmer grip in the third stanza.</p>
        
            <p>The extra height of goalkeeper Jury combined with the mobility of Phoenix Karaka (goal defence) and Karin Burger (wing defence) slowed Uganda's impetus while the pace and quick ball release from wing attack Souness added extra spark and drive on attack.</p>
        
            <p>Pushing out to a six-goal lead, the Silver Ferns were unable to completely shut down the gritty presence of Uganda who trimmed the margin to three when the New Zealanders took a 46-43 lead into the last break.</p>
