            <p>Two-hundredths of a second is almost literally nothing.</p>
        
            <p>Over 400 metres, it represents less than 20cm… if you still deal in imperials, that's about eight inches.</p>
        
            <p>It's less than the length of Lex Revell-Lewis' size 11 foot. Maybe if he had just lunged a little earlier…</p>
        
            <p>Sprinter Revell-Lewis has fallen agonisingly short of a national record over a lap of a standard running track, clocking 46.11s at Wellington's Newtown Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Competing at the Capital Classic event, the two-time national champion finished 0.02s outside the existing mark set by Cantabrian Shaun Farrell in 1998, while shaving 0.01s off his own personal best and a full second off the previous meet record.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a pretty windy day as expected, but I narrowly missed the record again," reflected Revell-Lewis. "I'm still really happy with how I ran.</p>
        
            <p>"I went out really hard, which is what I wanted to do. The first 350 metres of the race was pretty much exactly what I wanted, but the last 50, I just couldn't get my legs under me fast enough, lost a bit of form and lost the record."</p>
        
            <p>Battling a big strong wind around the final turn, Revell-Lewis reached 300m in 33.0s, a little down on his target, but tied up in the home straight and could not take advantage of the breeze at his back.</p>
        
            <p>Drawn a lane outside fellow Aucklander Tommy Te Puni - another targeting the longstanding national mark - he never sighted his rival throughout the journey. Te Puni finished second in 46.96s, still inside the meet record he set last year.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't going to let him beat me to 300 metres," said Revell-Lewis. "I knew if I went out hard, he wasn't catching me."</p>
        
            <p>Their next chance will come on 9 February at the Sir Graeme Douglas International at his Waitakere home track.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's just more about lifting my knees in the last 100," he said. "If I have competition pushing me right to the line, that will give me just a little bit extra."</p>
        
            <p>Revell-Lewis, 20, will travel to Hastings for the Potts Classic on Saturday, where he will sharpen his speed over the shorter sprints.</p>
