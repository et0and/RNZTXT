            <p>The Chiefs have been handed their first loss in Super Rugby Pacific this season with a 25-19 defeat to the Reds in Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland side produced some heroic late defence, denying the Chiefs a late winner.</p>
        
            <p>Despite three minutes camped on their line, the Chiefs were unable to push over for what could have been the match winner.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds are now third on the standings and boast a 2-1 winning record after putting aside the heartbreak of last week's golden point loss to the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Queenlsland replacement first-five Harry McLaughlin-Phillips proved the standout for the Reds, getting the late penalty as the Chiefs attacked their line for 23 phases.</p>

            <p>The Reds jumped out of the blocks and took a 15-11 lead into the halftime with tries to Fraser McReight and Matt Faessler.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Chiefs rebounded and eventually hit the lead, only for Josh Flook to get the hosts back in front.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds came up with the match-winning points despite the absence of star playmaker Tom Lynagh, who copped a brutal late shot to the ribs that forced him to leave the field in the 53rd minute.</p>
        
            <p>Five-eighth Lynagh was steamrolled by Chiefs flanker Samipeni Finau just seconds after he'd been in the hands of the doctor with a shoulder complaint.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds' defensive intensity could not be questioned, surviving two spells late in the first half and only conceding a solitary penalty goal.</p>
