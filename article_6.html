            <p>Four players have been ruled out of selection contention for the upcoming Silver Ferns series against England after failing to meet fitness standards.</p>
        
            <p>The trials are under way in Wellington with a squad of 12 for the series against England to be announced on Thursday. Players underwent fitness testing on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The fitness targets include a mandatory 16.3 minimum yoyo test and it is not the first time that Silver Ferns' contenders have missed out on selection due to falling short of them.</p>
        
            <p>Given that as many as 28 players were invited to trial, including some who have only got one year of ANZ Premiership netball under their belts, perhaps it's not surprising.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua said it impacted their depth.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to think that those ones that are here are all potential Silver Ferns, so it lessens our pod so to speak and the people we can select but that's how it goes," Dame Noeline said.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall very pleased [but] there's a few that are unable to be selected because of not meeting the fitness standards ... they are still in the mix in regards to where they sit in the development squad or what needs to happen moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"These are the things that we have to put back onto not only the players themselves but also the clubs and it's very clear about what's required. And that has also been supported by the players as well. We put it back in the players' hands - 'do you want to keep this going?' and they've said that [they do]."</p>
        
            <p>Are there particular areas of the court that the Silver Ferns coach is concerned about?</p>
        
            <p>"The shooting end is one because of people who we can't select and also in-circle defence as well, whether just a bit of readiness or people need more court time at ANZ, we've got to see can we fast-track them. The midcourt we've got a lot of heroes in there and we can't pick everybody."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Silver Ferns starting shooter Grace Nweke announced she will play in the Australian league next year for the New South Wales Swifts, which will make her ineligible to play for New Zealand next year.</p>

            <p>In terms of how much impact that might have on the Silver Ferns as they build to the 2027 Netball World Cup, Dame Noeline focussed on the silver lining.</p>
        
            <p>"It opens up the opportunity for others so the door is wide open, it's just if they choose to go into these places."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline said Nweke had kept her well informed. "Her intent like always is to be the best Silver Fern and best netballer.</p>
        
            <p>"We support her when she does go over there and we support her to come back when she does decide that as well - as we do with a lot of other people depending on what's happening in their personal situation."</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns coach was pleased that England had picked a near full-strength squad to send to New Zealand for the Taini Jamison trophy, in stark contrast to the team picked for last year's series.</p>
        
            <p>England Netball sent a development side to play the Silver Ferns last year, with none of their World Cup players named.</p>
        
            <p>However, the young Roses side shocked New Zealand in test one, before the Silver Ferns won the next two tests.</p>
        
            <p>The only player of note, who the Silver Ferns will not meet is shooter Elle Cardwell, who also plays in the Australian domestic league.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really pleased about that in one way and very challenged by what that would like for us on court ...looking forward to those games."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline said she was pleased with the intensity players had brought to the trials.</p>
        
            <p>"Exciting to see what they can do here against each other, you know you're not in club land ... you see those ones who can contest mentally and being prepared to do that.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of them will have the potential to go towards 2027 ... we probably have another three or four that we haven't been able to select. The key is who can rise, who can do your job and be there in trial number four."</p>
        
            <p>The first of three tests against England is on 29 September.</p>
