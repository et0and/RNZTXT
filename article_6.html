            <p>The former England fast bowler Peter Lever has died aged 84.</p>
        
            <p>He played 17 tests and 10 one-day internationals - including the first-ever ODI played in 1971.</p>
        
            <p>He took 41 test wickets and another 11 in ODIs.</p>
        
            <p>Lever will be remembered in New Zealand as the bowler who struck Ewen Chatfield on the head with a bouncer in a test in Auckland in 1975.</p>
        
            <p>Chatfield who was making his test debut almost died, having swallowed his tongue but was revived by the England physio.</p>
        
            <p>Lever only played two more tests after that but Chatfield went on to play 43 tests in total for New Zealand - his last being 14 years later in 1989</p>
