            <p>The Breakers staved off a strong Cairns Taipans finish to win their lower-table NBL game 99-92 in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In the penultimate fixtures of the season for two teams out of the playoff race, the Breakers emerged on top through a superior offensive display through the two middle quarters.</p>
        
            <p>Up 79-64 going into the final stanza, the last-placed visitors closed the gap but couldn't deny the Auckland outfit their 10th win over a modest campaign.</p>
        
            <p>A balanced scoring effort and strong interior presence proved decisive for the Breakers, who were without injured guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Mooney led the scoring with 24 points while also dishing out eight assists and grabbing three steals.</p>
        
            <p>Mojave King added 16 points, including a pair of three-pointers, while Tacko Fall imposed himself inside with 14 points, hauling down nine rebounds in just 15 minutes on court.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts shot an impressive 61 percent from the field and 47 percent from beyond the three-point line in one of their more accurate outings of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Petteri Koponen applauded his side's performance.</p>
        
            <p>"We played with our heads and were under control most of the game. It was a solid 40 minutes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not always easy at this point of the season but the guys turned up, took care of business and played the right way.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to finish the right way in front of our home fans. Playing here at Spark is a really amazing experience and we are looking forward to doing it one more time."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers are at home for their final game of the season, against the league-leading Illawarra Hawks on Wednesday night.</p>
