            <p>Steve Borthwick has included six uncapped players in his 36-man squad for England's three-test tour of Japan and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Fin Baxter (Harlequins), Gabriel Oghre (Bristol Bears), Joe Carpenter (Sale Sharks) Tom Roebuck (Sale Sharks), Luke Northmore (Harlequins) and Ollie Sleightholme (Northampton Saints) -- the Premiership's top scorer this season and son of former England winger Jon -- were all named in the squad announced by Borthwick on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Newly-crowned Premiership champions Northampton have seven players in the squad, including six of their exciting backline.</p>
        
            <p>The squad, captained by Jamie George and made up of 20 forwards and 16 backs, will train at Twickenham on Tuesday before flying to Tokyo on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>England play Japan in Tokyo on 22 June then New Zealand in Dunedin on 6 July and again in Auckland on 13 July. "The summer series presents a valuable opportunity for the continued development of this squad and is a demanding challenge to conclude the season," said Borthwick.</p>
        
            <p>"With the changes in climate, playing conditions, and contrasting styles of rugby from the two opponents we face, we will be challenged on and off the field.</p>
        
            <p>"Historically New Zealand is not a place England have had much success, but we are determined to change that. The players know that they will need to be mentally strong and tactically smart if we are to get the result we want."</p>
        
            <p>George Ford will miss the tour through injury, leaving Marcus Smith and Fin Smith to fight it out for the flyhalf shirt, with fullback George Furbank also able to cover the position.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Spencer, whose impressive displays helped take Bath to the Premiership final, is one of three scrumhalves alongside Alex Mitchell and Harry Randall, as Jack van Poortvliet misses out.</p>
        
            <p>Flanker Tom Curry, who has played only 36 minutes this season after hip surgery, is included alongside twin brother and Sale team mate Ben.</p>
        
            <p>England play Japan on 22 June, followed by games against New Zealand in Dunedin on 6 July and Auckland 13 July.</p>
