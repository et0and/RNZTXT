            <p>Bunting said he was excited to see the growth in this squad.</p>
        
            <p>"We have taken some critical learnings from our game against Canada. This is now our opportunity to move on and take this next challenge against Australia. There is a great rivalry between our two nations, we know Australia are coming off some pain as well and know how well they played at the end of last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking to see change in our mental preparation this week. Alongside this, we have a refreshed starting fifteen, which is growing the depth in our squad, and offers them an opportunity to show their capabilities in what will be another intense battle."</p>
        
            <p>Bunting congratulated Bremner on her impending milestone.</p>
        
            <p>"Alana lives everything it means to be a Black Fern. She is a constant professional and leads by example. She has worked very diligently the last couple of weeks, and we are looking forward to seeing her play this weekend," said Bunting.</p>
