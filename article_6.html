            <p>Central Queensland city Rockhampton will host rowing during the 2032 Olympics, despite concerns from the sport's peak body and a recommendation they be held interstate.</p>
        
            <p>But a local crocodile expert dismissed any risk to competitors on the Fitzroy River course, saying though it was a habitat for the reptiles, competitors were more likely to be "hit by a bus" on the way to events.</p>
        
            <p>Premier David Crisafulli on Tuesday confirmed Rockhampton's role as he also announced other Queensland regions would host events.</p>

            <p>"In the last few weeks, we have seen reports that events would be moved to New South Wales and Victoria," Crisafulli said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the next breath, Queensland has been told that we can't move events to the regions.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government takes a different view. It is our position that if investment comes from across the state then the benefits and excitement should be spread across the state.</p>
        
            <p>"So what does that mean? It means that we'll be taking the 2032 Games to regional Queensland."</p>
        
            <p>The world's peak rowing body is concerned about the Fitzroy River after reports the course may not meet international standards.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue for us at this point is that we know that World Rowing and the [International Olympic Committee] have not yet been consulted in relation to that venue," Rowing Australia chief executive Sarah Cook said.</p>

            <p>She said a "key criteria ... is that on a standard international course there should be no stream".</p>
        
            <p>Cook said while the Rockhampton facility had been suitable for training, it had not undergone a technical feasibility study to confirm its suitability for national and international racing.</p>
        
            <p>She said water quality and weed management were also factors to be considered by the international federation.</p>
        
            <p>"Rowing Australia looks forward to working closely with World Rowing, the International Olympic Committee and Games organisers to work through that process in coming months," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Crisafulli said funding would be pumped into the regions to help support legacy venues for the 2032 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"It had been recommended to move the [rowing] event to Sydney, but I believe there is a legacy play and we must grab that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The people of Central Queensland have made it very clear. They are capable of hosting this famous sport and I trust them to be able to deliver it in style.</p>
        
            <p>"Rockhampton has already been the venue for training camps for the Australian Olympic rowing squad international squads and it's hosted Queensland schools rowing regattas."</p>
        
            <p>With the rowing moving to Rockhampton, the city will need an athletes' village to be built at the revitalised railyards precinct.</p>
        
            <p>Crisafulli said this would become vital accommodation for a growing region after the Games.</p>
        
            <p>"We have always said the Olympic and Paralympic Games must be more than just a sporting event," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It must deliver generational infrastructure to make this state a better one before, during, after the games."</p>

            <p>Crocodile farm owner John Lever, who has been working with the animals for more than 40 years, said the population in the river should not be a concern and could be managed.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we have to look at it sensibly. It's a great opportunity ... it's a fabulous river," Lever said.</p>
        
            <p>"Crocodiles are most active at night and there won't be night-time activities. Crocs are actively feeding at the water's edge and the rowing will be held over deep water."</p>

            <p>Lever is a long-time advocate of the government re-categorising the stretch of the river where rowing is held as an active removal zone to have crocodiles surveyed, trapped and removed.</p>
        
            <p>He said crocodiles were less active in winter when the Olympics were expected to be held.</p>
        
            <p>"You're more likely to get hit by a bus on the way to the boat ramp than you are to be taken by a croc," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the winter time when the water temperatures go right down, the crocodiles become lethargic and don't eat much because they can't digest food.</p>
        
            <p>Rockhampton Fitzroy Rowing Club president Sarah Black said the facility would be ready to host an Olympic-standard regatta but with "a regional take" by 2032.</p>
        
            <p>"We're close to the coast, we've got a very beautiful landscape around us where you have the Mount Archer ranges in the background," Black said.</p>
        
            <p>"We really want to enhance the natural features and really build on what Rockhampton already offers."</p>
        
            <p>Black said the announcement would inspire the next generation of athletes and cement Rockhampton as a rowing hub for years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just incredible that we're going to have this opportunity to be able to have the Games here and be able to show off our town and show off our facilities and have people rowing on the Fitzroy River," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</p>
