            <p>Two of the big names of the ASB Classic women's tournament both appeared refreshed and ready before the tournament begins on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Big names, but not exactly big ranking power, that is.</p>
        
            <p>Caroline Wozniacki and Emma Raducanu sit and 249 and 298 in the world right now, hardly the sort of numbers that would get the pulses racing normally. But in Wozniacki's case, she's earned the right to take it easy after being on tour since the age of 15, and can still pull plenty of interest.</p>

            <p>"I think for me, to be able to perform at my best and mentally fully ready, I need to give myself time to prepare my body…I need to pick the tournaments that I love playing, then aim to be at my peak at the big events," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Now 33, Wozniacki is enjoying motherhood and the ability to bring her family of four out on tour to places like New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I always have time for the kids because, you know, they need attention. They need their mom and their dad. I have a great schedule down now with them and with my training and with everything else. And I really enjoy that."</p>
        
            <p>For Raducanu though, it's more of a reset at the opposite end of a career. Still only 21, she's had a frustrating time with injury since her out-of-nowhere US Open win in 2021, struggling to repeat those heroics. However, she cut an upbeat figure at Stanley Street in front of media, despite completely missing Christmas Day due to being in transit from London.</p>
        
            <p>Raducanu said her goals for 2024 were all about staying injury-free.</p>
        
            <p>"And then tennis wise…it's really important for me to just like approach it with the identity of how I want to play tennis and not let anything else dictate that. I think I obviously want to be more consistent (results-wise) That's one of my goals and just improving my skill level and tennis level overall."</p>
        
            <p>Despite having a rough time last year, leading her to have a dig at the ASB Classic organisation and court quality that she believed contributed to a serious ankle injury, Raducanu was all class when asked about how she felt about being back in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember coming here last year, I think it's one of the best venues and sights on tour, honestly. The food here is great, the weather here - when it's on - is really, really nice.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland is such a great tournament, and the field is super-strong."</p>
        
            <p>Once again, Raducanu will have plenty of attention on her and she struck some early luck by drawing a qualifier in her round one match.</p>
        
            <p>Wozniacki, on the other hand, has been dealt the opposite by facing number two seed and this year's Wimbledon and French Open semi-finalist Elina Svitolina. Number one seed Coco Gauff plays fellow American Claire Liu, while the sole New Zealand representative, Monique Barry, is up against Russian Elina Avanesyan.</p>
        
            <p>The Wozniacki v Svitolina match up so early will probably be giving tournament director Nicolas Lamperin a headache, especially since on the other side of the draw there's one match that will be filled by two qualifiers.</p>
        
            <p>But at least it's looking like he won't have anywhere near the sort of weather issues that plagued his first tournament in charge back in January.</p>
        
            <p>While the forecast isn't perfect, it's looking like the rain will hold off for most of the week.</p>
