            <p>The Philadelphia Eagles have won Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, destroying the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs 40-22.</p>
        
            <p>The game was a total blow out from start to finish, with the score line threatening to be much worse had the Chiefs not tacked on a couple of touchdowns deep into the fourth quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagles were ruthlessly efficient on both sides of the ball in the first half, racking up a 24-0 lead that was always going to be too much for the Chiefs to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>Quarterback Jalen Hurts was 17/22 for 221 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Mahomes' stats were inflated by a couple of long completions well after the game was decided, finishing with 21/32 for 257 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions.</p>
        
            <p>Hurts also led his team with 72 rushing yards and a touchdown. In probably the only positive for the Chiefs, Xavier Worthy had good receiving stats with 157 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second Super Bowl title for the Eagles, who will be taking home the Lombardi Trophy to another huge reception in Philadelphia. Their last victory parade, in 2018, drew a turnout of over two million people.</p>
