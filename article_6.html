            <p>Clinical. Ruthless. Dominant.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs have sent a serious statement to Super Rugby Pacific sides after dispatching Moana Pasifika 68 -12 in Hamilton on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>An Emoni Narawa hat-trick and a record equalling nine conversions from Damian McKenzie helped the Chiefs well and truly bounce back from their loss to the Crusaders last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The win moves the Chiefs into third spot on the ladder behind the Blues and unbeaten Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>There was a special moment for replacement prop Sione Ahio who showed a clean pair of heel to score with his very first touch in Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd just got on the field and wanted to make an impact, there was no excuse for being tired," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs skipper Rameka Poihipi said he was incredibly proud of his side.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been searching for an 80 minute performance for a while, the intensity during the week was high and to put it out on the field. It doesn't matter who steps in, we expect them to do a role and the players who stepped in tonight did exactly that."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a huge privilege to captain.</p>
        
            <p>"But with the calibre of players around me, my job doesn't change too much."</p>
        
            <p>Simon Parker put first points on the board with his first Super Rugby try as the Chiefs maul sent Moana back-pedalling 20 metres towards their own line.</p>

            <p>After missing touch, a powerful return run from Melani Malimali put Moana's defence in disarray, and as the Chiefs shifted it wide, Nanai-Seturo got the final pass and waltzed over.</p>
        
            <p>Narawa picked up the Chief's third on the back of another Moana error.</p>
        
            <p>Building nicely, a Moana loose pass was kicked ahead by Narawa who showed impressive patience and skill to toe it ahead two more times, scoop it up and score.</p>
        
            <p>A fourth came before the break, as the Chiefs worked a slick set move and Daniel Rona sliced through the defence.</p>
        
            <p>The centre was tipped over five metres out, but quickly regained his footing and slid over the chalk to take a 28-0 halftime lead.</p>
        
            <p>Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi kept the tries coming after oranges, the halfback taking an offload from Parker as he showed great speed and footwork to evade three tacklers on his way to the line.</p>
        
            <p>Moana managed first points soon after on the back of a great burst in the midfield from Julian Savea with Matavao sneaking over from the base of the ruck.</p>
        
            <p>Ahio then went in after McKenzie, chipped ahead, and Narawa turned it inside to the replacement prop who still had 20m to sprint.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs began to run riot, Sititi exploding through the Moana defence, as the Chiefs recycled quickly and Malimali found himself unmarked on the left flank.</p>
        
            <p>Narawa brought up 50 up for the hosts as he took it with room on the left, nonchalantly kicking ahead and regathering to score his second.</p>
        
            <p>The All Black winger was in scintillating touch, gliding through a gap into an acre of space and linking with replacement halfback Cortez Ratima.</p>
        
            <p>Moana picked up a late consolation in dubious fashion, Nanai-Seturo seemingly holding Miracle Fai'ilagi up over the line, but the on field call was try and the TMO could find no evidence to overrule it.</p>
        
            <p>Narawa capped a stunning performance with a third try right on full-time, giving McKenzie the chance to set a new Chiefs record for conversions in a match, only to push his tenth attempt wide.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 63 (Narawa 3, Parker, Rona, Nanai-Seturo, Malimali,Tahuriorangi, Ahio, Ratima, tries, McKenzie 9 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Moana 12 (Matavao, Faiilagi tries, Havili 1 cons)</p>
