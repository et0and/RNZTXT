            <p>Australian spin bowler Matt Kuhnemann has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action, following his terrific series against Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>The left-arm spinner took 16 wickets in Australia's two Tests in Galle, at an average of 17.18.</p>

            <p>"The Australian team was notified of the match officials' referral following the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle and will support Matt through the process of clearing this matter," Cricket Australia said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Matt has played 124 professional matches since his debut in 2017, including five Test matches and four one-day internationals. He has played 55 Big Bash League games since 2018.
