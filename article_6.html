            <p>TJ Perenara will miss the second test against England this weekend at Eden Park, after scans have revealed the extent of a knee injury in the All Blacks' 16-15 win in Dunedin on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>It is a cruel blow for Perenara, who was playing his first test since November 2022. Ironically, that was against England as well, in which he suffered a serious knee injury which saw him miss the entire 2023 season.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks assistant coach Jason Holland said they were "not sure" yet exactly what the injury was.</p>
        
            <p>"It's around his knee, I suppose the specialist's report will let us know in a couple of days," said Holland, before confirming it was not anywhere near as serious as Perenara's last injury.</p>
        
            <p>"It's way better than expected and hopefully it's not too long."</p>
        
            <p>Perenara did not return to the field in the second-half of the tense first test, after a cleanout at a breakdown saw captain Scott Barrett land awkwardly on his halfback's leg. He continued playing until the break, when he was replaced by Finlay Christie.</p>
        
            <p>Holland confirmed Crusaders halfback Noah Hotham had been called into the squad. One of the few positive stories of their wretched season, Hotham's call-up comes as little surprise as he was in the conversation to make the squad initially.</p>
        
            <p>The situation does clear the way for Cortez Ratima to make his debut this weekend with Christie starting.</p>
