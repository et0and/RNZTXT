            <p>Queenstown skier Alice Robinson has continued her strong run of podium finishes with victory in the Winter Games giant slalom race at Coronet Peak.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-four skiers from 14 nations competed in the FIS Australia New Zealand Cup race.</p>
        
            <p>The Giant Slalom course differed slightly from previous editions of Winter Games NZ, with the athletes starting higher up at the mountain which meant the skiers came in at pace to the big left-hand bend that launched them onto the formidable Hurdle, widely recognised as one of the steepest GS slopes in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson attacked the course and put down a blistering first run, taking the run one lead by -0.92 seconds with Australia's Madison Hoffman and German teenager Romy Ertl third.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson, who has achieved 10 top three finishes in World Cup events so far in her career, extended her lead on the second run to -1.67 seconds with Ertl moving into second place overall ahead of Hoffman.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I skied smart and solid for the conditions. It's so nice to race at home at Coronet Peak and have my friends and family here. I enjoy having this pre-season warm up race, it's good to go through the motions and it's special to be at home and sleep in my own bed," Robinson said.</p>
