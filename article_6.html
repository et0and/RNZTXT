        <h2>'Fairytale ending' - Golden Sevens team lands home</h2>

The Black Ferns were aware of heavy expectations going into the Olympics and feel a heavy burden has been lifted, Michaela Blyde says.

            <p>The Black Ferns were aware of heavy expectations from Kiwis going into the Olympic Games, Michaela Blyde says.</p>
        
            <p>So when they sealed a 19-12 win over Canada at the Stade de France in Paris it lifted "a huge weight off our shoulders", she says.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the squad arrived home in Auckland on Friday morning and were met by family, friends and a large media contingent.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very proud obviously. We've worked very hard for the last three years for this achievement ...I don't know when it will sink in but when it does I'll definitely hold onto those emotions as long as I can. It's not very often that you bring home a gold medal for your country," Blyde said.</p>

            <p>Blyde is due to be married in five months and has stitches in a wound above her eye.</p>
        
            <p>She said the seven stitches should heal before her wedding but there was no way she would have cut short her Olympic campaign to protect the wound.</p>
        
            <p>The match gained the highest attendance ever for a women's rugby match and that was an honour and a sign of the growth of the sport around the world.</p>
        
            <p>It was incredible that a lot of funding was going to be poured into the USA's game after their bronze medal win, however, she hoped all teams could get this kind of money.</p>
        
            <p>Blyde said the USA deserved their win over co-favourites Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Stacey Waaka said she has just a few days rest before heading to join her rugby league team, the Brisbane Broncos, in Australia.</p>

            <p>"I leave on Sunday," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really quick turnaround. It will be exciting and a new journey.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to go and see Mum and Dad, show them the medal, go for dinner, a lot of washing, unpacking, then repacking ...and then we go again."</p>
        
            <p>Waaka said she was very tired and has little voice left.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a little bit of disbelief, still," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the moment she realised they had pulled off the gold, Waaka said she remembered throwing her hands in the air and running to her teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"We spoke a lot about envisioning the moment, and when it came it was everything."</p>
        
            <p>The crowd in the Stade de France had been noisy, boisterous, passionate and excited as they cheered on their own team, France, and every other team.</p>
        
            <p>Her hope was that the sevens win would continue to grow the game here and overseas.</p>

            <p>Black Fern Tyla King says she is finishing her career on a high with a gold medal and being met by her young niece and nephew when she arrived home.</p>
        
            <p>There were touching scenes as King draped her medal around her nephew's neck.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ it was good to be back home and she couldn't wait to return to Tauranga to see her husband who couldn't make it to Paris.</p>
        
            <p>King told RNZ she's happy to have gone out on a high.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been so honoured to wear this black jersey for the last 13 years.</p>
        
            <p>"So the win was the best result. It was a fairytale ending.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking up in that packed stadium and seeing all the fans and all the crowd, was insane moment."</p>
        
            <p>King said Paris, the French and, indeed, all the visitors to the Games had contributed to an extraordinary event.</p>
