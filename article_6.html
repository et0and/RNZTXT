            <p>Addin Fonua-Blake has been dropped from the Warriors' side for Sunday's fixture against the Dolphins.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Andrew Webster said Fonua-Blake had removed himself from the dressing room after the 22-20 win over Penrith and wasn't present for the post-match team address or the team song, according to a statement released by the club late on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"This doesn't meet our standards and Addin accepts full responsibility for his behaviour," Webster said.</p>
        
            <p>Fonua-Blake only spent 49 minutes on the field in the team's 22-20 win over the Panthers on Sunday, around 15 minutes less than usual.</p>
        
            <p>Webster has named a replacement for Fonua-Blake in the initial 23-man squad, however, the most logical replacement would be bringing Tom Ale onto the interchange and move Mitch Barnett to prop.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors are welcoming back Marata Niukore this weekend. He can move into a starting second row spot.</p>
        
            <p>Fonua-Blake was named in the Dally M Team of the Year in 2023 and subsequently asked for an early contract release. He eventually signed with the Sharks and agreed to play out the 2024 season.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have acquired James Fisher-Harris from the Panthers to replace Fonua-Blake next season.</p>
