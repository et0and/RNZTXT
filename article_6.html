            <p>Will Stedman feels his gold medal 400m win at the Para athletics world championships was close to a perfect performance.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old Christchurch-based athlete surged ahead in the final five metres to beat world record-holder, Australian James Turner.</p>
        
            <p>It was New Zealand's first gold medal of the world champs in Kobe, Japan, with Anna Grimaldi later completing a memorable day with bronze in the 100m T47.</p>
        
            <p>Stedman has mounted the 400m T36 podium four times at global championships but his win on Sunday was his first gold medal, and in a national record time of 53.35 sec.</p>
        
            <p>Stedman was fourth with 200m to go, but timed his finish brilliantly to claim Turner with a huge lunge, before crashing to the ground after the finish line.</p>
        
            <p>Stedman, who won bronze at the world champs in 2019 and then silver in 2023, trimmed his national record by 0.19sec.</p>
        
            <p>"It was as close as its going to get to a perfect race. I got out well and ran a good first 200m, staying nice and relaxed. Then started pushing around the bend and in that last 100m just focused on being relaxed.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't until 50m to go when I saw Jimmy (Turner) getting closer and I thought something could happen here. Then in the last ten metres, although my legs were completely shot, the momentum managed to carry me through.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really happy with the way I ran that race, in those conditions and to run a PB - is really cool.''</p>
        
            <p>Grimaldi defied the wet conditions to claim back-to-back world champ bronzes in the 100m, in a time of 12.72sec, behind Kiara Rodriguez of Ecuador, while Saska Sokolov claimed silver just head of Grimaldi.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so stoked. My immediate thought is I know I can run faster, which is exciting for the Paralympic Games. I'm content with where I am at now, but excited by where I can get to.</p>
        
            <p>"The conditions out there were like back home in Dunedin. We do a lot of sprinting in the rain it probably was an advantage to me."</p>
        
            <p>Grimaldi will compete in her speciality event, the women's long jump T47 on Friday, while Stedman will line up in the long jump T36 final on Saturday.</p>
