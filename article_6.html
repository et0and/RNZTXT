            <p>The Phoenix may have to wait until the start of next month to find out if they have won an historic A League premiership plate.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix currently sit at the top of the competition ladder, one point clear of Central Coast Mariners with one regular season game to play.</p>
        
            <p>They have won 14 of their 26 games, while the Mariners have 15 wins from 25.</p>
        
            <p>The Mariners however have two games to play, after their match against Adelaide United on Sunday was postponed when they were delayed in returning to Australia from Kyrgyzstan for an AFC playoff match. That match will now be played on Wednesday next week.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix play fourth-placed Macarthur on Saturday, while the Mariners play the 10th-placed Newcastle Jets.</p>
        
            <p>There are still a variety of permutations which could unfold. If the Phoenix win and the Mariners lose this weekend, the Phoenix will win the Premiership plate.</p>
        
            <p>However if the Phoenix lose and the Mariners at least draw, then Central Coast will be guaranteed the minor premiership, as they will be ahead on points difference by virtue of having more wins during the season.</p>
        
            <p>If both teams win, the title race would go down to the final game of the season - the Mariners' rescheduled match against Adelaide on 1 May, the former needing at least a draw to take the minor premiership.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams are already guaranteed semi-final berths.</p>
