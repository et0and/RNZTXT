            <p>All White Chris Wood scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as third-placed Nottingham Forest beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux Stadium, keeping them on course for an unlikely title challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Morgan Gibbs-White and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi were also on target for the visitors as they won their sixth top-flight game in a row, the first time they have managed that feat since 1979 under then manager Brian Clough.</p>
        
            <p>Forest have 40 points from 20 games, six behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Forest's tally is the same number as Leicester City had accumulated by the same point of the 2015/16 campaign when they went on to become shock Premier League champions.</p>
        
            <p>"It is about consistency and doing what we have been doing extremely well already this season. Not letting up halfway through. We need to keep going," Wood said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is all about confidence, belief and responsibility, and a team that works to all of our strengths. It is not the same every week, we try to tweak things to get better.</p>
        
            <p>"It is well and truly too early (to talk about a title challenge), we are not thinking about that."</p>
        
            <p>Wolves had their chances, not least striker Jorgen Strand Larsen who might have had a hat-trick but was wasteful in front of goal. They have 16 points from 20 games and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.</p>
        
            <p>Former Wolves player Gibbs-White gave the visitors the lead inside seven minutes. A lightning counter-attack saw the midfielder feed Anthony Elanga and when he took the return pass, Gibbs-White fired low into the bottom right corner of the net.</p>
        
            <p>Wolves should have gone level when Strand Larsen had a tap-in three metres from goal, but the forward saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo with the goal gaping.</p>
        
            <p>Strand Larsen had another excellent chance with a header that was saved from point-blank range by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime with an almost inevitable Wood goal. Callum Hudson-Odoi made a storming run down the left wing and, after holding off Matt Doherty, pulled the ball back for a side-footed finish from the New Zealand striker.</p>
        
            <p>Strand Larsen forced another good save from Sels but the chances dried up for Wolves.</p>
        
            <p>Awoniyi completed a perfect night for the visitors when he got his first goal since February after he was teed up by fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse.</p>
