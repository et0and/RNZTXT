            <p>Black Cap veteran Tim Southee has been reprimanded for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during their T20 World Cup match against the West Indies on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Having suffered a shock first up defeat to Afghanistan, the Black Caps crashed out of the World Cup when they lost to the West Indies in Trinidad.</p>
        
            <p>A stuttering performance with the bat saw the Black Caps fall to a 13-run defeat. New Zealand play Uganda this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Southee was found to have breached Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to "abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an International Match".</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred in the 18th over of New Zealand's innings, when after his dismissal, Southee smashed a hand sanitiser dispenser on his way back to the dressing room.</p>
        
            <p>One demerit point has been added to Southee's disciplinary record. It was Southee's first offence in a 24-month period.</p>
        
            <p>Southee admitted the offence and accepted the sanction, so no formal hearing was required.</p>
        
            <p>On-field umpires Ahsan Raza and Alex Wharf, third umpire Richard Illingworth and fourth umpire Michael Gough levelled the charge.</p>
        
            <p>Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 percent of a player's match fee, and one or two demerit points.</p>
