            <p>In-form Hurricanes hooker Asafo Aumua will be out of action for up to two months after suffering a knee injury in last weekend's Super Rugby Pacific game in Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>Aumua sustained an isolated MCL tear in his left knee with the club saying he would be sidelined for approximately six to eight weeks.</p>
        
            <p>He was assisted from the field in Lautoka just 10 minutes after coming on as a second-half replacement in the game against Fijian Drua.</p>
        
            <p>It means that he is likely to miss the rest of the Super Rugby Pacific season with the final scheduled for 22 June.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes are unbeaten at the top of the Super Rugby standings with Aumua playing a big part in the club's form this season.</p>
        
            <p>His form would have him in consideration for a return to the All Blacks this year.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks' first test of the year is against England in Dunedin on 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>Aumua, 26, has played six tests. He debuted in 2017 with his last test in 2021 against Italy in Rome.</p>
        
            <p>James O'Reilly is the other hooker the Hurricanes have used this year, while Jacob Devery is also out with an injury.</p>
        
            <p>Raymond Tuputupu is now likely to be the backup rake.</p>
        
            <p>Club legend Dane Coles ended his time with the club last year and is currently playing in Japan.</p>
