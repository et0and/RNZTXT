            <p>The Black Caps have history against them as they attempt to record a rare victory over Australia in the first test starting in Wellington today.</p>
        
            <p>Australia are back in New Zealand for a test series for the first time in eight years. In 2016 they won the series 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has only beaten Australian once in 29 matches over the last 30 years, in Hobart in 2011. That side contained just two players that will take the field today, Kane Wiliamson and Tim Southee.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps last test victory in New Zealand was at Eden Park in 1993 when Martin Crowe's side beat the tourists by five wickets.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian side then was legendary; David Boon, Mark Taylor, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Steve Waugh, Allan Border, Ian Healy, Merv Hughes, Paul Reiffel, Shane Warne and Craig McDermott.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 Australian team has a similar feel about it and are clear favourites to win the tests in Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead knows the enormity of the task.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very big, Australia are a settled side, they have been for a long time," Stead said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when you have that you have confidence in the people around you.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no doubt it's an enormous task but that's why we play the game as well, it's to go in there and to make surprises and I think we've seen a number in test cricket recently that gives us that hope as well."</p>

            <p>New Zealand tops the World Test Championships standings from India and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Australia have named the same side that beat the West Indies recently with Steve Smith remaining at the top of the batting order, while their bowling attack is the same for the sixth consecutive test; Pat Cummins, Mitch Starc, Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood;</p>
        
            <p>With Devon Conway's injury, Will Young will open the batting for New Zealand, while captain Tim Southee said the only decision they have to make on the morning of the game is whether to pick spinner Mitchell Santner or seamer Scott Kuggeleijn.</p>
        
            <p>While the Basin Reserve wicket looked a little green earlier this week, it is expected to be a good batting pitch.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's as scary as perhaps what it looks. Seems like there's been plenty of first inning scores that have been big," said Australian captain Pat Cummins.</p>
        
            <p>If New Zealand win the toss they're likely to bowl, while a correct call for Cummins is likely to result in them batting.</p>
        
            <p>Play starts at 11.</p>
