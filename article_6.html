            <p>A goal from veteran Kosta Barbarouses has given the Wellington Phoenix a 1-0 victory over A-League competition leaders Melbourne Victory in the Unite round in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>It was Barbarouses' 96th A-League match, all the sweeter as it was against his former club - and indeed the club that denied the Phoenix a place in the 2023 final with a late goal in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The win sees the Phoenix go to the top of the table, usurping the Victory there, but Auckland FC's match against Macarthur later on Sunday could see the new club back in the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses' left-footed strike after a nice set-up from Marco Rojas in the 82nd minute was all the more satisfying for coach Giancarlo Italiano, given that he had to start without regular fullbacks Tim Payne and Sam Sutton, who were out injured. Matt Sheridan and Nathan Walker were the replacements with Oskar Van Hattum taking up a wing back role.</p>
        
            <p>Melbourne had two opportunities to equalise after the goal, but a diving save from goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi took care of the free kick by Bruno Fornaroli, while they could not convert from another Fornaroli attempt with two minutes to go.</p>
        
            <p>The Victory had by far the better of the first half, with 10 shots at goal - though only two were on target - to the Phoenix's two, with Daniel Arzani looking particularly threatening for them.</p>
        
            <p>It was the Phoenix's sturdy defence that frustrated Melbourne in the second half in the Sydney heat and Barbarouses, one of the game's best players, made them ultimately pay.</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses said he was very proud of the team.</p>
        
            <p>"We just get on with it," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>It was hard work in the hot conditions but the team was very adaptable, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're probably a bit rusty at times but we just hang in there.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always room for improvement, but look we get the three points and we are happy."</p>
