            <p>New Zealand Cricket has confirmed skipper Kane Williamson will miss the remainder of the T20 series against Pakistan with a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps coach Gary Stead indicated yesterday Willamson was unlikely to play again in the series after suffering a minor hamstring tear while batting during the second T20 in Hamilton at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was due to be rested for game three in Dunedin on Wednesday but will now also miss games four and five in Christchurch on Friday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Batter Will Young has replaced Williamson in the squad.</p>
        
            <p>A timeline for Williamson's return to the field is now being established but it is hoped he will be fit for the test series against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The first test in the two-match series is in Tauranga, starting on 4 February.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, tomorrow's third T20 against Pakistan at University Oval in Dunedin is a sellout.</p>
        
            <p>The capacity at the venue is 4000 spectators.</p>
        
            <p>A win will give the Black Caps an unassailable 3-nil series lead.</p>
