            <p>The unthinkable happened last weekend when the Kiwis went down to Tonga in one of the greatest league test matches of all time. Now they are in the Pacific Cup relegation zone facing off against Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>It's tough to say whether the Kiwis underestimated Tonga or if the men in red have finally just hit their international stride. Either way, New Zealand's fall from grace almost rivals the last time they lost to Tonga. Papua New Guinea are not a side to be underestimated after taking down the Cook Islands 42-20 last weekend in Port Moresby. They have proven talent on their side in Lachlan Lam, Nene Macdonald, Robert Mathias and Sylvester Namo.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis: 1. Keano Kini 2. Jamayne Isaako 3. Matthew Timoko 4. Peta Hiku 5. Will Warbrick 6. Charnze Nicole-Klokstad 7. Shaun Johnson 8. James Fisher-Harris (C) 9. Phoenix Crossland 10. Joseph Tapine 11. Isaiah Papali'i 12. Scott Sorensen 13. Naufahu Whyte</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Kodi Nikorima 15. Griffin Neame 16. Marata Niukore 17. Leo Thompson</p>

            <p>Interchange: 14. Judah Rimbu 15. Koso Bandi 16. Sylvester Namo 17. Ila Alu</p>

            <p>The Kiwis have opted to field the same starting lineup as last weekend's game. Naufahu Whyte has been moved into the starting side with Leo Thompson shifting to the interchange bench.</p>
        
            <p>Kumuls captain Rhyse Martin comes back into the team after missing last week's match against the Cook Islands. Dan Russell has been named 18th man with Morea Morea dropping out of the side.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis 56-10 PNG - Rugby League World Cup 2013</p>
        
            <p>Believe it or not, it's been 11 long years since the Kiwis have taken on the Papua New Guinea Kumuls. The last time the two sides met was in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, where the Kiwis easily proved too fast and powerful. This will be the 18th meeting of these two sides, 17 of which the Kiwis have won and the one they famously lost in Port Moresby in 1986.</p>

            <p>The Kiwis will be hurting after last week's loss against Tonga, if they weren't already still hurting from the week before when they went down to Australia in Christchurch. They haven't played an overly bad season of international football to be fair, as they've stayed in the fight in every game they've played. It simply comes down to a classic case of other sides stepping up and simply wanting it that little bit more.</p>
        
            <p>So don't be surprised if they come firing out of the blocks looking to right the wrongs of the past couple of weeks and go out on a high note.</p>
        
            <p>Alongside all the drama of the past two weeks, this game also marks the final ever professional rugby league match of Shaun Johnson's illustrious career. For someone plagued with injuries and form issues over the past year, he's played remarkably well for the Kiwis in 2024 - being one of the most influential players ever to be on the field for New Zealand.</p>
