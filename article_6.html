            <p>The Warriors have suffered a gut-wrenching last minute loss to the Melbourne Storm thanks to one of the most spectacular finishes the game has ever seen.</p>
        
            <p>They looked dead and buried with just two minutes remaining and eight points down, before Xavier Coates leapt into the heavens and came down with an absolute miracle.</p>
        
            <p>With one last shot to snatch victory, the Storm fired it wide to Coates who defied gravity with his incredible dive in the corner, managing to grass the ball within inches of hitting the sideline after seemingly floating in the air.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors continue to be haunted by their Melbourne demons, suffering a 12th straight loss to the side and their second on the trot to start the season.</p>
        
            <p>Down by 12 at halftime, the Warriors mounted a stunning comeback, and looked to have done enough when Luke Metcalf pushed the margin beyond a converted try.</p>
        
            <p>However, Melbourne scored twice in two minutes, stunning both the visitors and spectators alike.</p>
        
            <p>Taine Tuaupiki had his best game in a Warriors jersey while Roger Tuivasa Shek was back to his best.</p>
        
            <p>It was a shocking start for the Warriors, allowing the kick off to bounce into touch to give the Storm a golden shot at first points.</p>

            <p>It appeared they took it when Jonah Pezet strolled over, but the try was scrubbed due to obstruction and the Warriors survived the early scare.</p>
        
            <p>However, the reprieve didn't last long, kiwi Jahrome Hughes setting the Storm alight with a surging break before sending one across for Will Warbrick to leap into the night sky over the top of his opposite Marcelo Montoya.</p>
        
            <p>Dallin Watene-Zelezniak replied for the visitors, Tuaupiki putting it on a platter for his winger.</p>
        
            <p>The back and forth continued, Hughes again setting the Storm away and linking with Nick Meaney who showcased his scintillating speed as he gassed Tuivasa-Sheck to put the hosts back in front.</p>
        
            <p>Meaney pushed his side ahead by a further two, before Ryan Papenhuyzen sliced through the line to score the Storm's third after just 20 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The kiwi's appeared to strike back just before the break through Marcelo Montoya, only for a desperate Hughes tackle to deny the Warrior's winger.</p>
        
            <p>The reward did come just after halftime however, Watene-Zelezniak scoring his second in typically brilliant fashion as Shaun Johnson shifted it expertly to the right edge.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster called for accuracy in the sheds, and his side obliged with a perfect completion rate in the first twenty minutes of the second.</p>

            <p>It would lead to a third try through Jackson Ford after Tuivasa-Sheck soared into the sky and then popped it up off the turf.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors would be further tested with the losses of Rocco Berry and skipper Tohu Harris to HIA's, but the momentum was with them, Metcalf squaring the ledger with two points off the tee.</p>
        
            <p>They would then hit the front, a Melbourne mistake gifting the Warriors a full set five metres out, Metcalf firing it wide to Montoya for his side's third second half try.</p>
        
            <p>When Harry Grant tried to buy a penalty on his own line, he was pinged himself for milking, the ensuing Metcalf goal stretching the Warriors lead to six.</p>
        
            <p>Another Storm indiscretion in front of their own posts allowed Metcalf to bank another two to stretch the lead to eight with eight to play.</p>
        
            <p>Melbourne refused to lie down, the Warriors forced to defend back to back line drop outs, the second proving too much as Papenhuyzen cut his way through again to set up a grandstand finish.</p>
        
            <p>An attempted two point field goal was charged down to give Melbourne six more tackles with sixty seconds to play, and it was all the opportunity the four-time premier needed, Coates sealing the win in jaw-dropping fashion.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Storm 30 (Papenhuyzen 2, Warbrick, Meaney, Coates tries, Meaney 5 goals, 1 pen)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 26 (Watene-Zelezniak 2, Ford, Montoya tries, Metcalf 4 goals)</p>
