            <p>With 11 titles under their belt, you could be forgiven for thinking a 12th OFC Champions League crown would be a formality for Auckland FC, and players will take the chance to work on their tans in Tahiti.</p>
        
            <p>However, after requiring an extra time goal to scrape into last year's final, the side is under no illusions as to the challenge that awaits them.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland will line up in Group A alongside the Solomon Warriors, Rewa from Fiji, and PNG's Hekari Utd of Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>Team manager Albert Riera said despite the side's previous success, Auckland City are highly motivated.</p>
        
            <p>"People take it a little bit for granted. They think that well Auckland City will go there and do the job again. No, it's actually not like this."</p>
        
            <p>Riera said as most of the players in the squad have played in the Islands more than once, they understand the difficult assignment.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have to do much to keep them grounded because they know what it takes to compete in the islands. They know it's extremely hard. Every game is a 50/50."</p>
        
            <p>The hot and humid weather in Tahiti is of course another factor for Auckland to contend with.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously you are playing in conditions that you don't in New Zealand and playing against players you don't usually play. They very fast, very athletic, very strong, and sometimes you're playing in 30 odd degrees, 99 percent humidity, that takes its toll, so they are very humble they're working extremely hard."</p>
        
            <p>Riera said for four months, the side has been preparing daily for this tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"We are as prepared as we can be. We know we are the favourites because we won last year but we can't forget that we had to go through a lot of obstacles, setbacks, penalty shoot outs, extra times, to get there."</p>
        
            <p>He said while football is an unpredictable sport, he is confident his players can cope with the pressure and favourites tag.</p>
        
            <p>"What I know is that we have a group of players that they need to do everything have, if we have to play 120 minutes will do it. They are warriors, they don't really cower you know when it comes down to these these situations."</p>
