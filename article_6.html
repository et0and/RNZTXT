        <p>
The return of injured shooter Grace Nweke can't come quick enough for the defending champion Mystics after a demoralising 54-38 loss to the Pulse last night.

            <p>The return of injured shooter Grace Nweke can't come quick enough for the defending champion Mystics after a demoralising 54-38 loss to the Pulse last night.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics are clinging to third spot on the ladder while the Pulse went to the top of the ANZ Premiership table after their demolition job in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics have now lost their last three games and it's hoped that Nweke, who has been unavailable since round four, might be back in the next round or two.</p>
        
            <p>On top of that the Mystics were also without Peta Toeava for last night's game, after the wing attack was ruled out with a soft tissue knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>The Mystics called on former Silver Fern Kayla Johnson, who has been playing club netball and she got a couple of short stints at centre last night.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson last played for the Mystics in 2016. Her last season in the ANZ Premiership was for the Stars in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse got off to a tentative start but led 14-10 after the first quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Together Nweke and Toeava are the scoring heartbeat of the side and without the pair the wheels fell off for the Mystics in the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>It took the Mystics nearly 11 minutes just to score their first goal of the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors eventually scored six goals at the end of the period but trailed 27-16 at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>The game also marked the return of Silver Ferns shooter Tiana Metuarau, who got on court for the first time for the Pulse this year.</p>
        
            <p>Metuarau came on part way through the third quarter but rookie goal shoot Martina Salmon once again anchored the shooting end for the Pulse scoring 40 from 48.</p>
        
            <p>Mystics shooters Filda Vui, Hannah Glen, and Dani Binks had a difficult outing with the Pulse defence relentless.</p>
        
            <p>There was a lot of shuffling in the Mystics midcourt; even captain Michaela Sokolich-Beatson spent time in the unfamiliar position of centre at one point.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse led 41-25 at three quarter time and the Mystics had their best quarter when they drew 13-all with the Pulse in the final spell.</p>
        
            <p>Once again Carys Stythe was a beacon for the Mystics in defence but there weren't many other positives.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Fern Kelly Jackson picked up another MVP after another great night in the defensive end, where her connection with fellow Pulse defender Parris Mason goes from strength to strength.</p>
