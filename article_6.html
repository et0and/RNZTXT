            <p>An NRL bidding war has reportedly opened up over Kiwis player Dylan Brown.</p>
        
            <p>Australian media is reporting two clubs are trying to lure Brown from the Parramatta Eels with claims the 24-year-old is being offered $14.4 million over 10 years with Newcastle and another unnamed club in the running.</p>
        
            <p>Although midway through a long term contract with the Eels, the New Zealand Test five-eighth is on the market due to clauses in his contract that allow him to explore the market.</p>
        
            <p>"We think Dylan, or someone like Dylan, is the missing piece for us," Newcastle Knights chief executive Philip Gardner told the Sydney Morning Herald.</p>
        
            <p>The clauses allowing Brown to explore the market have reportedly been taken up by his managers, leading to offers from the Knights and another cub that says it will withdraw the bid if its identity is prematurely revealed.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder of Brown's current Parramatta contract is said to be worth about $7.75 million, meaning the new offers are a significant upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>"We see Dylan Brown as a great player. We're giving it our absolute best shot to get Dylan to come - and why wouldn't you want to come to Newcastle?" said Gardner.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have to compete with his contract with Parramatta. He's currently on a six-year contract with Parramatta. He's not going to come for less certainty, that's for sure â€¦ we're not ruling it [a 10-year contract] out. At his age, something beyond six years is a realistic option."</p>

            <p>Gardner insisted that the offer would be made within the club's salary cap.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got enough," Gardner said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would never sign a player if we haven't got enough cap space. They've got to show me a spreadsheet that shows me exactly where the cap sits before I'll sign anything.</p>
        
            <p>"So the offer that we've made to Dylan Brown is within our cap capacity."</p>
        
            <p>The salary caps for each NRL club for 2025 sit at $13.06 million.</p>
        
            <p>The largest current NRL contract is held by Gold Coast forward and captain Tino Fa'asuamaleaui who has a 10-year deal worth $14.72 million, while Newcastle's Kalyn Ponga earns $1.72 million, making him the NRL's highest-paid player.</p>
