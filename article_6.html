            <p>The White Ferns have slumped to a second straight loss to Pakistan in the second T20 cricket international in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The results means Pakistan have an unassailable 2-nil lead in the three match series after winning game one by seven wickets.</p>
        
            <p>Batting first Pakistan made 137 for 6 in their 20 overs with Amelia Kerr and Fran Jonas the most successful of the New Zealand bowlers with two wickets apiece.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan then made early in-roads into the New Zealand top order to have the home side reeling at 29 for four, with only Suzie Bates making double figures, in what was her 300th game for New Zealand across all formats.</p>
        
            <p>The middle order provided some impetus to the run chase with Georgia Plimmer scoring a run a ball 28 and Hannah Rowe with 33 off 24 balls but they ultimately fell short finishing at 127 for seven.</p>
        
            <p>Game three in the series is in Queenstown on Saturday.</p>
