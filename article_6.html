            <p>Lewis Clareburt has lowered a 12-year-old freestyle record at the national swimming championships although he fell painfully short of an Olympic qualifying time.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland-based Clareburt powered to victory in the men's 400m freestyle on the third night of finals in Hastings, clocking 3min 46.85sec, nearly a second faster than the previous mark set by Matt Stanley at the 2012 national championships.</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt set a solid pace from the outset but was pushed for much of the eight-length race by Zac Reid before pulling clear over the final 50m.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old world was delighted, even though the time was 0.07sec outside the Paris Olympic qualifying standard in an event which is not his speciality.</p>
        
            <p>"I was so happy with that swim, Zac and I have had some unreal battles in the 400 over the years and I'm proud of us both going in and attacking it," said Clareburt, who is the 400m individual medley world champion.</p>
        
            <p>"The game plan was to go out fast and try hold on which I did but the legs were feeling it for sure."</p>
        
            <p>Hazel Ouwehand returned to the pool for the 100m butterfly final, after earlier breaking the New Zealand record and hitting the Olympic qualification time in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>The Aucklander Phoenix Aquatics swimmer was unable to recreate her heroics from the morning session, as she posted a time of 58.27sec, having swum 0.84sec quicker earlier in the day.</p>

            <p>"I'm so tired, I put everything out there this morning and I'm buggered but it's done for now," Ouwehand said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had so many messages and congratulations and stuff, it's been a really happy day. I would've liked to have gone even better tonight but just couldn't quite get there."</p>
        
            <p>It was a similar story for Lili-Fox Mason who earlier hit the Paralympic qualification time in the women's 400m freestyle multi class.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't as fresh tonight, my turns were a bit sloppy but I'm so happy with the time this morning," Mason said.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather was also in action, picking up another national title with a commanding performance in the 400m freestyle - the event in which she is world champion.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin swimmer looked comfortable and in control as she paced herself in her favoured event.</p>
        
            <p>"You always want to go a little faster, I'm a bit off my PB but it's not a bad time," Fairweather said.</p>
        
            <p>"From here I'm just gonna keep on grinding, we want to swim fast all year round so just continue that momentum as we work towards Paris."</p>
