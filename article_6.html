            <p>It has been a troubled buildup for New Zealand, with head coach Jitka Klimkova having stood down from her role for the Olympics following an independent workplace employment investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant coach Michael Mayne is acting as head coach for the Football Ferns, who aren't favoured to advance through group play, where they face Canada, Colombia and hosts France.</p>
        
            <p>The NZOC said it wasn't available for further comment about the drone incident.</p>
