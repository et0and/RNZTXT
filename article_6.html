            <p>Golf New Zealand plans to revive the New Zealand Women's Open to help grow women's participation following Lydia Ko's recent success on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>The national body hopes the momentum generated by Ko's Paris Olympics and Women's Open tournament wins will help double the number of women and girls participating in golf over the next five years.</p>
        
            <p>Golf New Zealand CEO Jeff Latch said Ko's success over the last month represents a once in a generation opportunity to encourage more women and girls into the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love to see more women and girls playing golf and initiatives such as She Loves Golf and our talent development programme are helping grow the female game," Latch said.</p>
        
            <p>"Lydia has done more than perhaps anyone to help us realise that goal and her achievements in Paris and at St Andrew's give us a unique opportunity to encourage more Kiwi women to come and try golf or return to the golf course."</p>

            <p>Golf New Zealand's General Manager, Participation Vicky Mailei said there is huge potential to grow women's participation.</p>
        
            <p>"During the last spring and summer season, we saw more than 350 opportunities for women to participate in She Loves Golf.</p>
        
            <p>"We're excited to continue fostering this enthusiasm and engagement, working with more golf clubs across New Zealand to create even more opportunities for women and girls through the She Loves Golf and Futures initiatives," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have spoken to Lydia and her team to see how we can work together on this ambition, as we know she shares our vision of growing female participation, especially around encouraging more young girls into our game," said Latch.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Women's Golf Open was last staged in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>"We are keen to see the Women's Open return and are actively working on that as we speak," he said</p>
        
            <p>Golf New Zealand is also looking at attracting other events which will help grow the profile of and interest in women's golf such as the Women's Asia Pacific Amateur Championship.</p>
        
            <p>"These events are critical in providing development pathways for our best amateur golfers and opportunities to measure themselves against the world's best," said Latch.</p>
        
            <p>"Lydia has led the way with her inspiring performances - and we want to harness this fantastic series of achievements to encourage others to come in and enjoy our great game."</p>
        
            <p>Ko has won the New Zealand Women's Open thre times including once as an amateur.</p>
        
            <p>Golf is the most played sport in New Zealand, with over half a million Kiwis playing each year at one of the 390 clubs nationwide.</p>
