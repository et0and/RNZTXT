        <h2>Will a lack of play-off experience count against the Phoenix?</h2>
        <p>
Despite finishing second on the A-League table, Phoenix can probably consider themselves underdogs going into the semi-finals.

            <p>Despite finishing second on the A-League table the Wellington Phoenix can probably consider themselves underdogs going into the semi-final series against Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides meet in Melbourne on Sunday with the return leg in Wellington next Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix have limited play-off experience compared to the Victory.</p>
        
            <p>The Melbourne side has won the A-League title four times, while the best the Phoenix have done is third.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix have been eliminated in the first round of their last five Finals appearances.</p>
        
            <p>So how much does play-off experience count?</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano has previously said the season is about consistency and the play-offs are about pressure.</p>
        
            <p>While that could suggest some changes in personnel, he feels his squad is ready for what lies ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"All year they've been playing with that pressure, that stigma that we're not going to have a good season and (then) they've done well," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"But more the fact that they're more resilient; once they taste defeat the group has a real belief and spirit that they can overcome any situation, which bodes us well for this semi-final."</p>
        
            <p>After their dramatic shootout win over cross-town rivals Melbourne City last weekend, Victory boss Tony Popovic says their plan is simple.</p>
        
            <p>"We just want to keep on winning. We're excited that we're in a big game again in Wellington and credit to them, they've had a fantastic season.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully there will be a big crowd and they can lift us, I'm sure it'll lift them and let it be a fantastic game with us coming out on top."</p>
        
            <p>The Victory and Phoenix drew in their game in Melbourne earlier this season and Italiano admits AAMI Park is a tough place to play.</p>
        
            <p>However he says it is a challenge they are looking forward to.</p>
        
            <p>"They're the one club I wanted to play in the semi-final at AAMI because their fans make an electric atmosphere and if we have a good travelling contingent as well it will be a great feel and a great experience for the boys."</p>

            <p>Away goals no longer count in two-legged play-off games and Italiano feels they can therefore be a bit more adventurous in the first leg.</p>
        
            <p>He says any positive result - a win or a draw - will make them favourites.</p>
        
            <p>"In the Champions League, which no longer has away goals, the advantage is with the team that is more brave and therefore playing in front of a home crowd is like a half-a-goal advantage and we'll take that mentality."</p>
        
            <p>While encouraging his players to stay level headed in what will be a high pressure situation, Italiano says they also need to enjoy it.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to go into these games with nothing to lose.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel I've spent my whole season trying to take that pressure off the players and this will be no different.</p>
        
            <p>"They'll enjoy the moment and obviously feels the nerves and all the emotion but I think they're mature enough to get past that."</p>
