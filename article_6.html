            <p>The Black Caps have crushed Uganda by nine wickets in Trinidad and Tobago to notch their first win at the T20 cricket World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders dismissed the African side for just 40 - with Tim Southee claiming figures of three wickets for four runs - and reached their target in the sixth over.</p>
        
            <p>However, the result in Tarouba has come too late for the Black Caps, who can't advance to the knockout stage after losing their first two games.</p>
        
            <p>Defeat to Afghanistan and the West Indies left New Zealand with no chance of advancing through pool play - the first time they'll fail to do so at an ICC white ball tournament for a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran seamer Southee told Sky Sport this victory provided some cold comfort.</p>
        
            <p>"It was obviously a pretty clinical performance, nice to get a win," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"(But) extremely disappointed to play ourselves out of the tournament. You look at the side, plenty of experience and we were not at our best in the first two games. We have a proud record in World Cups in the last ten years and it has now come to an end."</p>
        
            <p>Southee played a dead bat to a suggestion the World Cup could be his last for the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>"The body is feeling well, I love playing for New Zealand. I still enjoy it, so you never know."</p>
        
            <p>Victory was never in doubt as the first three Uganda wickets fell for just two runs, with Southee and Trent Boult (2-7) virtually unplayable on an unpredictable pitch.</p>
        
            <p>Spinners Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra also bagged two wickets each as only won Ugandan batsman (Kenneth Waiswa with 11) reached double figures.</p>

            <p>The straightforward run chase lasted 5.2 overs, with opener Finn Allen departing for nine in the only setback as New Zealand reached 41-1.</p>
        
            <p>Devon Conway struck two sweet cover drives for four in his 22 not out.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's final match at the tournament will be against Papua New Guinea on Tuesday morning (NZT).</p>
