            <p>World number 93 Dayana Yastremeska has become the first qualifier to reach the final four at the Autralian Tennis Open in over 40 years.</p>
        
            <p>Battling in 30 degree heat the Ukrainian beat Linda Noskova of the Czech republic in straight sets, 6-3 6-4 to advance to the semi finals - the first qualifier to do so since 1978.</p>
        
            <p>Despite her lowly ranking Yastremeska's already beaten two Grand Slam champions during the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Yastremska and Noskova traded breaks early in the first set, but it was Yastremska who took the lead in the eighth game when Noskova netted a backhand.</p>
        
            <p>Despite failing to get nearly half her first serves in, the Ukrainian kept the pressure on with a string of forehand winners throughout the match.</p>
        
            <p>Noskova failed to capitalise on a break point when she was down 5-3 and Yastremska wrapped up the first set in 36 minutes with another well-targeted forehand.</p>
        
            <p>Both players went off court after the first set, escaping the heat, and Noskova had a long chat with her coach on her return.</p>
        
            <p>The players were level-pegging throughout the second set until the seventh game when Yastremska locked it up on her third break point with a backhand winner that left Noskova stranded on the far side of the court.</p>
        
            <p>She closed out the match on serve when Noskova's backhand return hit the net, ending the Czech's bid for her first tour singles title.</p>
        
            <p>Yastremska will play either 12th seed Zheng Qinwen of China or Russian world number 75 Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-finals.</p>
