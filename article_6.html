            <p>Maddi Wesche launched the New Zealand bid at the World Indoor Athletics Championships in style by setting a lifetime best of 19.62m to finish fourth, within 5cm of a podium position in Glasgow.</p>

            <p>The 24-year-old Aucklander extended her streak of personal bests on the global stage to offer genuine confidence she could be a medal prospect at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>In a quality competition Sarah Mitton of Canada claimed gold with a best of 20.22m to finish ahead of German Yemisi Ogunleye who set a huge PB of 20.19m in round one. The 2022 and 2023 outdoor world champion Chase Jackson snared the bronze with 19.67m, just ahead of the Kiwi in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Wesche, who was competing in her first competition since the 2023 World Championships last August, diced with danger in the early part of the competition following a first round foul with a modest 15.71m in round two. She remained in fifth until unleashing a mighty 19.62m throw in round five to add 11cm to her best set when seventh at the 2023 World Championships and move up the standings to fourth.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super happy. It was my first indoor competition, and I couldn't have asked for more than a PB. Being so close to a medal is tough but this gives me confidence going into Paris," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nerves were definitely present for the first two throws but that's all part of the game, and I've been in this position before. Experience took over and I was pumped I could have three more throws."</p>
        
            <p>James Preston set a national indoor record of 1:47.59 to place fourth in heat one of the men's 800m but was eliminated from the competition.</p>
        
            <p>And Maia Ramsden was third in heat three of the 1500m clocking 4:06.51 to progress to the women's final.</p>
        
            <p>And Geordie Beamish will contest the final of the men's 1500m after finishing third in his heat in a time of 3:39.17.</p>
