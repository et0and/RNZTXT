            <p>England have thumped the White Ferns by nine wickets in their opening one day international in Durham.</p>
        
            <p>After winning the toss and deciding to bat first New Zealand were bowled out in the 34th over for just 156.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Halliday top scored with 51.</p>
        
            <p>England reached their target in the 22nd over with Tammy Beaumont and Maia Bouchier putting on 137 for the opening wicket.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns made a decent start with the bat with Suzie Bates making 16 and Georgia Plimmer 29 before she was run out.</p>
        
            <p>However the rest of the batters didn't add much with Amelia Kerr making 10, captain Sophie Devine 13 and Maddy Green 2.</p>
        
            <p>Halliday kept the middle order together for a while with her 51 coming off 60 deliveries, but she quickly ran out of partners.</p>
        
            <p>England spinner Charlie Dean finished with four wickets for 38 runs.</p>
        
            <p>The England batters had few problems against the New Zealand attack with Beaumont's 76 coming off 69 balls and Bouchier's 67 off 50 balls.</p>

            <p>Devine tried seven bowlers with Haillday picking up the only wicket.</p>
        
            <p>"Really disappointed," Devine said afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"We got a really good start with the bat but England came back.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to put this behind and come back harder with important series coming up.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to identify areas we need to improve but also look at positives, especially Plimmer and Halliday.</p>
        
            <p>"We know we'll have to score 250-260 for which we were on course but lost wickets. On outfields like this we can score naturally."</p>
        
            <p>Game two of the three match ODI series is in Worcester on Sunday night.</p>
