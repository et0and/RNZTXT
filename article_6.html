        <h2>The march to Parliament, in photos</h2>
        <p>
It was an early start for thousands as the hīkoi sets off for its final destination - the grounds of Parliament.
</p>
        
            <p>Police say about 2000 people are walking from Petone to the Wellington train station along State Highway 2 this morning, as part of the hīkoi mō Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>The group set off at 4am, with cars travelling slowly alongside in support.</p>
        
            <p>Tens of thousands of protesters are expected at Parliament today, as Hīkoi mō te Tiriti reaches its final destination.</p>
        
            <p>It's the end of a nine-day trek for many who oppose the Treaty Principles Bill, which is being sponsored by the ACT party.</p>
        
            <p>Those walking are flying hundreds of tino rangatiratanga flags, while many drivers are tooting as they pass the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>Participants are aged from young children to the elderly.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a sample of some of those taking part.</p>
