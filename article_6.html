            <p>Matt Henry has brought the Black Caps back into the second test against Australia with a stunning spell of bowling at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>Henry took 7/67, record figures for New Zealand against Australia in New Zealand, to dismiss the tourists after lunch on day two, conceding a 94 run lead.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old seamer told TVNZ early wickets were absolutely crucial.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good to finally get them out, there is obviously a lot of work to do but pleased that we did get the job done today."</p>
        
            <p>He said the pitch should continue to offer something for the bowlers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's slowed up a bit, there will be enough there with the new ball, they showed with Labuschagne that if you get stuck in there are runs to be had, there is always bounce here at Hagley and that keeps the bowlers in the game so it's about being as accurate as possible and sticking to your plans."</p>
        
            <p>Ending day one at 124/4 after the Black Caps capitulated to 162 all out, Nathan Lyon was first out this morning, Henry claiming his fourth scalp.</p>
        
            <p>Henry had Mitch Marsh trapped in front for a duck shortly after, Southee opting to successfully review the original decision of not out.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips got in on the action, sending Alex Carey back to the pavilion for 14 before Southee claimed the crucial wicket of Labuschagne for 90.</p>
        
            <p>Mitch Starc and Pat Cummins eked out some runs from the tail before Henry finished off the innings to claim seven wickets as Australia took a 94 run lead.</p>
