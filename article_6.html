        <h2>Johnson reveals 'real penny-drop moment' he decided to retire</h2>
        <p>
The veteran halfback talked to media today regarding his decision to hang up the boots.
</p>
        
            <p>An emotional Shaun Johnson fronted media on Tuesday at Go Media Mt Smart Stadium, saying that it had been a "draining 24 hours" since he made his decision to retire at the end of this season.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot went into yesterday," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it feels good knowing that I've made the decision, a little bit like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. To be able to come out and say it, announce it the way I wanted to.</p>
        
            <p>"Departures can be forced sometimes. So for me to have control over this, knowing that there was something there for me (an offer to stay on) next year, but I've made the decision not to."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson will hang up the boots after 11 seasons at the Warriors, as well as a 44-game stint at the Sharks from 2019-21. He guided the side to their last grand final appearance in his first year with the Warriors, and last year played a pivotal role in almost returning to the NRL's biggest stage when they reached the preliminary finals.</p>

            <p>He said one of the main indicators it was time to call it a day was not being excited about the contract extension offer for next season.</p>
        
            <p>"The real penny-drop moment was receiving the offer from the club. They came through and offered me everything I wanted, and it didn't hit home for me the way that it should have. I was like 'man, I'm not going to sign a contract just to pick up a pay cheque'. There's something here I need to figure out. To be honest, that moment sucked."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors' 2024 season has been a disappointing one all round, with Johnson missing a number of games through injury. The team sits 13th on the NRL ladder after a disappointing loss to the Eels on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously when you're not winning and you're not healthy, I won't lie, it has been tough. But even on the weekend, running out, it's still just such a buzz. It's not lost on me that I get to experience this, I still have that little kid in me saying 'This is mean'."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson admitted stepping into some form of coaching role was something he had been thinking about, although he flatly ruled out any ambitions of being a head coach.</p>

            <p>"I think there's a role here at the club … and I think there's a similar one at the Kiwis. When I was coming through, I never had a specialist coach to help me with my position, and there's probably only one person that could've which was Stacey (Jones). Someone that … has been at that highest level, someone who's been in the arena."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson's last home game will be against the Bulldogs on 23 August. However, since the Warriors are still a mathematical chance of making the playoffs, his last game overall may or may not be against his old club the Sharks a week later.</p>
        
            <p>He is poised to equal Ben Matulino and eventually finish as the fourth placed for most appearances for the Warriors, behind Simon Mannering, Jones and Manu Vatuvei.</p>
