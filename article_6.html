        <h2>Tough-tackling Finau staying with Chiefs and NZ Rugby</h2>
        <p>
The 25-year-old blindside, best known for his powerful tackling, started both home tests against England in July.

            <p>Hard-hitting three-test loose forward Samipeni Finau has extended his Chiefs and New Zealand Rugby contract until the end of 2026.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old blindside, best known for his powerful tackling, started both home tests against England in July although he made way for Ethan Blackadder for the two opening Rugby Championship matches against Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>Finau scored a try on test debut against Australia in Dunedin last year but it wasn't enough to break into the World Cup squad.</p>

            <p>Incumbent blindside flanker Shannon Frizell's departure for Japan following last year's World Cup has set up a battle this year for the No.6 jersey, with Finau in contention for further appearances, along with Blackadder and Luke Jacobson.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan was thrilled the tough forward will play at least two more seasons for Super Rugby Pacific for the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>"He has put in a lot of effort over the last few years to go from a relatively raw-boned athlete finding his feet in the professional ranks to becoming an All Black," McMillan said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a Chief, he consistently has a positive influence on our game through his athleticism and desire for combat on both sides of the ball.</p>
        
            <p>"He provides a good balance amongst our other loose forwards, and we know at his young age his best years are all in front of him. We are excited to be part of that journey."</p>
