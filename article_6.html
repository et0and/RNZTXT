            <p>New Zealand Australian Rules footballer Mykelti Lefau is set to make his AFL debut on Sunday for his Richmond club. He will be on the Tigers' interchange bench as a utility, against Port Adelaide at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground in the second round of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Signed as an AFL rookie just over a month ago, Lefau's elevation to the match day squad is the culmination of a decade in the sport, after moving to Melbourne from Auckland as a teenager in the initial hopes of securing a career in the NRL with the Storm.</p>
        
            <p>After booting two goals in the opening half of Richmond VFL's practice match against Carlton last Thursday, Richmond's VFL (reserve grade) coach Steve Morris said Lefau was in "outstanding form".</p>
        
            <p>"He's bringing his training form to games and competing really well in the air," Morris said.</p>
        
            <p>"But also putting pressure on at ground level. He kicked a beautiful snap goal in the first half."</p>

            <p>Lefau was elevated from the Tigers' VFL program on the eve of the 2024 season as part of the AFL's Pre-Season Supplementary Selection Period, something that he said left him "speechless".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm full of excitement knowing what's to come," he said in an interview recorded by the club.</p>
        
            <p>"It just goes to show all the support of family and everyone around me hasn't gone for nothing. I'm happy to return it in this way."</p>
        
            <p>Lefau said the experience in the VFL system helped him "develop his craft".</p>
        
            <p>"That's how we improve so much â€¦ being with the boys so much builds those connections. Obviously I didn't know what football was when I was younger, but just playing with mates with school is what really developed the hunger for this sport, and I'm just grateful for my friends that believed in me since day dot, because some people didn't think of me as a footballer.</p>
        
            <p>"But this is for the ones around me that kept me on that track, they're the ones who showed belief in me."</p>
        
            <p>Standing at 195cm, Lefau once produced a stunning 25-goal display in the U/19s for St Kilda City in 2016. This led to a contract at Casey VFL for 2017, where he played in the VFL Grand Final and also represented New Zealand against the Australian Indigenous Side on two occasions.</p>
        
            <p>Lefau was an exciting addition to the Tigers' VFL side in 2022, but ruptured his ACL in Round 7 of that season. He took the setback in his stride and returned to play halfway through the 2023 VFL season and has continued to flourish ever since.</p>
        
            <p>Richmond is also the club of star player Dustin Martin, who has Kiwi heritage through his late father Shane. The 13-time premiers are coming off a disappointing 2023 season, in which they finished in 13th place. This will be there first home match at the MCG, where AFL games regularly draw crowds of 80,000 weekly.</p>
        
            <p>The game's first bounce is at 6pm, Sunday NZT.</p>
