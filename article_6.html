            <p>Kiwi Formula One driver Liam Lawson has had a tough introduction in practice sessions at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson finished 1.203s and 1.201s back from each winner, in 16th and 17th spots.</p>
        
            <p>The Red Bull driver needed repairs to the floor of his cars after veering off track in FP1.</p>
        
            <p>Occupying arguably the toughest race seat in F1 as Verstappen's teammate, Lawson had a rough start, brushing the wall at turn nine minutes into the early session and was ordered back to the garage.</p>
        
            <p>There was no major damage, though, allowing him to rejoin the session and post the 16th quickest lap, one better than his effort in FP2.</p>
        
            <p>Charles Leclerc left new Ferrari teammate Lewis Hamilton trailing in his wake as he topped the timesheets in the second free practice.</p>
        
            <p>Leclerc lapped the Albert Park circuit in one minute, 16.439 seconds on soft tyres, 0.124 seconds better than McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who nudged teammate Lando Norris into third.</p>
        
            <p>Seven-times world champion Hamilton was fifth, an improvement on his 12th ranking in the first session (FP1), but more than four-tenths of a second behind Leclerc.</p>
        
            <p>Yuki Tsunoda, who missed out on a seat at Red Bull to New Zealander Liam Lawson, was fourth in FP2 while rookie teammate Isack Hadjar was sixth in an encouraging day for the rebadged Racing Bulls.</p>
        
            <p>Defending F1 champion Max Verstappen managed only the seventh fastest lap for Red Bull, while George Russell, the fastest for Mercedes, was 10th.</p>
        
            <p>With six drivers starting a championship season for the first time, there were plenty of incidents throughout the day.</p>
        
            <p>Briton Oliver Bearman was unable to take part in the second session having damaged his Haas with a heavy shunt after a slide through gravel when exiting turn six earlier in the day.</p>
        
            <p>With his right rear wheel dislodged and bouncing down the track, the unharmed 19-year-old spun across the track and apologised to his team after coming to a halt.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second of two red flags to halt FP1, with stewards reporting debris from an unnamed car in the first.</p>
        
            <p>Carlos Sainz and teammate Alex Albon finished 11th and 12th respectively for Williams in FP2, dropping back after being second and sixth earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Russell reported trouble with his car in FP1, complaining of understeer at high speed and excessive heat.</p>
        
            <p>He spun off track with a minute left in the session, narrowly avoiding a front-on collision with a wall after setting the seventh-quickest lap.</p>
        
            <p>His rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli was 14th before dropping to 16th in FP2.</p>
