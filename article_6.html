            <p>The Breakers have rebounded from a heavy defeat three days earlier to pip the Sydney Kings 93-89 and climb to second on the NBL standings.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland side made it four wins from six in a gutsy performance in Sydney, which came in the wake of a 26-point hammering at the hands of South East Melbourne Phoenix in Auckland on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>They also had to overcome a debilatating injury list, with Dane Pineau, Mojave King, Mitch McCarron and Max Darling all unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>Guards Matthew Mooney (24 points) and Parker Jackson-Cartwright (21) lead the way offensively for the Breakers, while forward Karim Lopez pulled down 10 rebounds, including five off the offensive boards, to go with 13 points.</p>
        
            <p>After a sluggish start to trail by seven at the first quarter break, the visitors fought back to lead 49-45 at half-time and were still four points up going into a tense final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The Kings stayed in touch throughout, thanks largely to 23 points from their New Zealand international, Izayah Le'afa.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers return home to face the Adelaide 36ers on Saturday.</p>
