            <p>Mohammad Rizwan scored a timely half-century and Babar Azam played a captain's knock as Pakistan bounced back from successive defeats to beat Canada by seven wickets, keeping their hopes of reaching the T20 World Cup Super Eight stage alive.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan, third in Group A with two points after one win in three matches, have a shot at finishing in the top two if Ireland beat hosts United States on Friday and lose to Pakistan on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Canada, also on two points, need a win over India on Saturday to stay in the top-two race.</p>
        
            <p>Aaron Johnson (52) waged a lone battle against Pakistan's pace attack. Mohammad Amir (2-13) and Haris Rauf (2-26) led the charge for Pakistan, while Shaheen Afridi (1-21) and Naseem Shah (1-24) helped ensure Canada were unable to find rhythm.</p>
        
            <p>Only three Canadian batters reached double digits and if not for Johnson's maiden World Cup fifty and a late flurry from Kaleem Sana (13 not out), Canada would have struggled to reach the modest total of 106-7 they posted.</p>
        
            <p>The temporary arena in East Meadow, where India and South Africa defended less than run-a-ball targets in recent days, looked on course for another competitive low-scoring match as Saim Ayub (6) fell early and Pakistan looked shaky at 21-1 after five overs.</p>
        
            <p>However, Rizwan (53 not out) and Azam (33) steadied the ship, taking few risks and frequently rotating strikes. A measured Azam hit one six and one four before he fell to Dillon Heyliger (2-18), but Pakistan comfortably reached their target with 15 balls to spare</p>
