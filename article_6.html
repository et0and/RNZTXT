            <p>Steven Adams has played his first official minutes as a Houston Rocket coming off the bench in a 106-101 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time since January 2023 that Adams had played an NBA game.</p>
        
            <p>Adams was traded to the Rockets from the Memphis Grizzlies in the middle of last season but did not play due to an ongoing right knee injury that he eventually got surgery on.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old centre also missed the first three games of the current NBA season due to a left calf strain.</p>
        
            <p>Against the Spurs, Adams logged just under 14 minutes for 6 points and 3 rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>This season Adams is expected to be the back up centre to starter Alperen Sengun who played 26 minutes for 12 points, 12 rebounds, 5 assists a steal and a block against the Spurs.</p>
        
            <p>During his last season in the NBA -2022-23 with the Grizzlies - Adams averaged 8.6 points, 11.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.1 blocks in 27.0 minutes per game.</p>
        
            <p>The Rockets are sitting near the bottom of the Western Conference with two wins and two losses so far this season.</p>
        
            <p>The next game for the Rockets is on Friday afternoon (NZT) against the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
