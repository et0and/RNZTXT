            <p>The wait is over for kite foiler Lukas Walton-Keim, who has been named to compete at the Paris Olympics after he appealed his initial non-nomination at the Sports Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>The Tribunal upheld the appeal and, in a rare move, ordered Yachting New Zealand to revisit its selection process, having found selectors had relied on "one or more errors of fact".</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Olympic Committee today announced Walton-Keim and Justina Kitchen would contest the new high-speed Olympic class, which is a derivative of kiteboarding.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking from the Olympic sailing venue of Marseille, Walton-Keim said he was relieved his challenge had been justified and he was looking forward to re-focusing on the sport again.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been stressful, but it's not the first thing we've had to overcome," he said, explaining why he took the legal path.</p>
        
            <p>"I just thought about the impact it has on my career, you know, looking to the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Going to the Olympics comes with a lot of good things and gives you a good rub and sets me up really well for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to talk to the people around me about whether I was going to go through with that [appeal]. I'm lucky to have the people around me that I do and at the end of the day we said, 'Nothing to lose, so let's give it a go'."</p>
        
            <p>Three-time national champion Walton-Keim described his partner, Olympic pole vault bronze medallist Eliza McCartney, as an emotional rock.</p>

            <p>Holding back tears, he said McCartney's support had been enduring.</p>
        
            <p>"It's meant the world. That support she's given me has lasted longer than the last few months.</p>
        
            <p>"Since day one, she's one of the people who's made me realise I can do the sport and aim for the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been really cool because Eliza's incredibly professional in how she does things."</p>
        
            <p>Walton-Keim said he was "gutted" his competition would coincide with McCartney's in Paris, meaning they would not be able to support each other. "But it is what it is. We'll celebrate afterwards."</p>
        
            <p>Justina Kitchen won an injury race against time, having ruptured knee ligaments in a freak training accident last September.</p>
        
            <p>"The board flipped over - which would never normally happen - landed on my leg and dislocated it, bending it backwards the wrong way.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really lucky to have been out training with a group of Aussies, Brits, and Norwegians, and they knew straight away that something was very wrong."</p>

            <p>Australian kite foiler Breiana Whitehead prevented her from drowning.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember saying to her, 'I'm going to miss the Olympics' and crying uncontrollably. It was devastating'."</p>
        
            <p>Kitchen is the daughter of Rex Sellers, who won a sailing gold medal with Chris Timms at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Her father had been an inspiration, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Dad used to keep his medal in his undie drawer. It would be something he would kind of hide in there and wouldn't bring it out very often but if he did, it was something that was pretty cool.</p>
        
            <p>"You would get the chance to hold it and I remember how heavy it was.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes him like a hero to you and makes you want to aspire to the same thing - the challenge of something that's so hard to do.</p>
        
            <p>"You're out there, trying to prove you've got what it takes."</p>

            <p>Paris 2024 will be Kitchen's first Olympics at her third attempt, after missing out on selection in 2012 and 2016 in the windsurfing class.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been involved in different classes, retired, had a family, got on with my life but then decided to pick up kite foiling at the age of 29 with two young kids.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just been an absolutely incredible journey.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't believe I've made it to this point and I'm really excited to compete in eight weeks' time and show everyone what I've got."</p>
