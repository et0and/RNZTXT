        <h2>NRL: 'Emotional' win for kiwi Titans on Anzac Day</h2>
        <p>
Former Warriors Erin Clark and Kieran Foran's return to Mt Smart was one to remember.
</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors might have lost their match against the Gold Coast Titans 27-24 on Anzac Day, but at least two New Zealanders were smiling at the end of it. Erin Clark and Kieran Foran, who both played for the Warriors and are now with the Titans, played big hands in what was their club's first win of the season. Clark described it as "emotional".</p>
        
            <p>"To go right down to the wire, 80th minute. Like it's a tough, gritty, gritty win. To get the first win here, especially back home is pretty emotional. I was happy, to have my family here is pretty happy too," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>Foran, who played 17 times for the Warriors in a one-season stint in 2017, described it as a "special day to be playing footy".</p>
        
            <p>"Our guys were really looking forward to it, we felt extremely honoured to come over here and play on Anzac Day. The Warriors have an enormous supporter base getting right behind them, so we knew it'd be a great experience. It didn't disappoint, it was great."</p>

            <p>Fullback AJ Brimson, who scored two tries, said the experience at a full Mt Smart Stadium "was sick, it was awesome, we embraced the atmosphere."</p>
        
            <p>"I've never done Anzac Day before. It's good to be out here and share it with the Warriors and obviously they're big on it as well. And to do the pre-game and to get the crowd sold out and that is I feel really lucky that I get to play on Anzac Day, hopefully we can do it again in future."</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time the Warriors had hosted an Anzac Day fixture since 2015, which coincidentally was a close loss to the Titans as well. The Warriors now haven't won on Anzac Day in 10 years, but it's unlikely to be bothering Clark, who played one NRL game for the Warriors before shifting to the Gold Coast in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we know what we're good at and we've done it before," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It'd be nicer to not be 12-0 down, they scored an easy try through our middle and that's something we take personally and we don't like that. So, I think we turned it up pretty well. I just want to enjoy this one with the boys and the coaching staff."</p>
        
            <p>The son of former Silver Ferns legend Temepara Clark said the full house at Mt Smart made it a memorable place to play in a fixture that the NRL has turned into a yearly tradition.</p>
        
            <p>"Just the whole occasion, Anzac, playing here, can't put into words the feeling to get that first win on Anzac Day back in New Zealand. This is my first time playing back here ever since I played at the Warriors, pretty emotional. And the whole occasion probably made it a bit more emotionalâ€¦something special, something I'll remember for a while."</p>
