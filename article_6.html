            <p>Halfback Chanel Harris-Tavita has signed a one-year contract extension with the Warriors, ensuring his return to the NRL will stretch to at least a third season.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old Toa Samoa international took a year away from the game after the 2022 Rugby League World Cup, but returned to the Warriors on a two-year contract in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>He played 17 times in 2024 to lift his career tally to 71 games, though will likely see far more game time next season following Shaun Johnson's retirement.</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita alternated between a bench utility role and the halves, scoring four tries including a double in the home win over the Broncos.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors head coach Andrew Webster said Harris-Tavita made a great return to the NRL after his time out.</p>
        
            <p>"He was impressive the way he threw himself into the pre-season and earned his way back into the side. He plays so tough and his defence is awesome. He'll bring even more to us next season."</p>
