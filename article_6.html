            <p>The White Ferns have suffered a tour whitewash of England after losing the fifth and final T20 at Lord's.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the ODI series 3-0, England inflicted more pain by winning the final T20 by 20 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Fran Jonas got the White Ferns off to the perfect start when she dismissed England opener Danni Wyatt on the first ball of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Later Jonas pulled off a spectacular one handed catch off her bowling to get rid of Nat Sciver-Brunt.</p>
        
            <p>Jonas finished with 4 for 22 - the best bowling figures in a Women's T20 at Lords but was disappointed her side will leave England without a win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clear that England are one of the best sides in the world. Obviously this tour hasn't gone as how we planned but I think we can take a lot of learnings and I think consistency will be a big work on for us but we're definitely eager to get into our prep for the T20 World Cup," Jonas said.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't been as consistent as we would like but I think we showed a lot of fight tonight and we were able to push them, which was good. I think it's just kind of back to basics a little bit with nailing what we want to nail."</p>
        
            <p>Jonas said they had a lot of work to do before the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in October.</p>
        
            <p>"Those wickets over there will be quite different to here which will create a new challenge but I think we will be able to hopefully adapt and get some training in back home and get some wickets that we think will be similar to over in Bangladesh, which will be helpful. I think just honing in on the basics and doing them for longer."</p>
        
            <p>When Jonas knocked over Freya Kemp the White Ferns had England in trouble 87 for 6 but the home side highlighted the depth they have when they fought back.</p>
        
            <p>Heather Knight top scored for England, finishing 46 not out, and the home side finished with 155 for the loss of seven wickets.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer were dismissed for 16 and 8 respectively and when captain Sophie Devine went out for 12 it left a big dent in New Zealand's chase.</p>
        
            <p>Amelia Kerr and Brooke Halliday built a nice partnership but when Halliday was dismissed for 25, it was all on the shoulders of Kerr.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's hopes were dashed when Kerr was stumped in the 18th over, leaving the White Ferns 112 for 5.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns finished 135/8, with Kerr top-scoring with 43 but she needed far more support.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns have three T20 matches against Australia in September, their last hit-out before the T20 World Cup.</p>
