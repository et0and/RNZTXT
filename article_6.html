            <p>It's the fight Mea Motu has been asking for and history now beckons for the NightMea on Sunday against fellow unbeaten boxer Ellie Scotney.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Motu, the reigning IBO super bantamweight champion and number two ranked bantamweight in the world, will take on Scotney in Nottingham for the IBF, WBO, and Ring Magazine super-bantamweight titles.</p>
        
            <p>Here's everything you need to know ahead of the much anticipated world bantamweight unification bout as Motu attempts to become Aotearoa's first-ever unified world champion. </p>
        
            <p>Mea 'the NightMea' Motu is from Pukepoto, New Zealand. The 35-year-old is the current IBO super-bantamweight world champion.</p>
        
            <p>Motu has recorded 20 career wins, 8 KO's, and 0 losses.</p>
        
            <p>Motu has enjoyed a destructive run since her pro debut in 2020, amassing some highlight reel knockouts along her journey to the top of the boxing world. Her biggest challenge now awaits in fellow unbeaten super bantamweight champion, Ellie Scotney.</p>
        
            <p>Ellie Scotney is from London, England. The 26-year-old is the current IBF, WBO and Ring Magazine super-bantamweight world champion.</p>
        
            <p>Scotney has recorded 9 career wins, 9 decisions, and 0 losses.</p>
        
            <p>While Scotney has never finished an opponent, all wins have come by the way of a unanimous decision, illustrating her dominance and nous, Her last six fights have combined for 60 rounds compared with Motu's 44.</p>
        
            <p>Motu: It was a destructive performance, sure to send a chill down Scotney's spine as Motu dealt to Australian Shannon O'Connell in vicious fashion. A bloodied and battered O'Connell's corner was forced to throw in the towel to save their fighter from further damage at the hands of Motu. A clinic by the champ.</p>
        
            <p>Scotney: The unbeaten Brit retained her IBF title won the WBO and vacant The Ring Magazine super-bantamweight straps to hand French fighter Ségolène Lefebvre her first career loss in 18 fights. Will Ellie claim another unbeaten record on Sunday?</p>
        
            <p>At the face-off a smiling Motu locked eyes with a dead-faced champion and later said "I was just being my happy self. I was just watching her, she was just staring at me all serious and I was all happy and smiley. Being me."</p>
        
            <p>Motu is generally never shy about firing shots at her opponent before getting in the ring, but Motu was measured when she spoke to RNZ from England -</p>
        
            <p>"I feel perfectly fine, I'm not worried, I'm not fussed about the crowd, I can block that out. I've done everything, I've executed everything, I've trained hard and now it's just time to fight. I'm willing to do anything and give everything possible in that ring."</p>
        
            <p>Scotney has also been cordial but confident - "My mindset is the same, every fight matters, I've got to do the business Saturday night and I will be. She's very aggressive, but I feel like that will only bring out the best in me."</p>
        
            <p>The hometown fighter is the overwhelming favourite for this one, the TAB paying just $1.20 for Scotney to retain while Motu is a long shot at $5.</p>
        
            <p>The deck is stacked against Mea Motu, with majority of the boxing world picking an easy win for Scotney, but Motu's power could well be the difference maker. We have seen many a fighter crumble once cracked cleanly in the midsection by Motu. If things go the distance, Scotney will likely prevail on points, but with an entire country in her corner, and the Maori Warrior spirit which dwells within, Motu has all the tools to shock the world. Prediction - Motu by round five TKO.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait for everyone to witness greatness. I'm ready to create history. I believe in myself. I back myself and I know I can do it."</p>
