            <p>England test captain Ben Stokes said he would be willing to return to the white-ball setup under new coach Brendon McCullum if he was asked but added that there had been no conversations about him coming back into the limited overs squads.</p>
        
            <p>Former Black Caps captain McCullum's appointment as head coach across all formats came after a two-year period of having separate coaches for the white and red-ball teams and followed Matthew Mott's departure as limited-overs coach in July.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealander will take charge of the limited-overs sides when England tour India in January.</p>
        
            <p>Stokes has been a key part of the test squad since McCullum took charge in May 2022 but has played sparingly in England white-ball sides.</p>
        
            <p>He retired from one-day internationals before returning for last year's ODI World Cup and last played a Twenty20 international in the World Cup final in November 2022.</p>

            <p>"I've played a lot of white-ball cricket for England and I'm very happy and content with what I've achieved in that form of the game ...," Stokes told Sky Sports on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"If I get the call to come and play, then obviously it's definitely going to be a yes. But I'm not going to be too disappointed if I don't - it means that I can just sit back and watch everyone else go out and smack it.</p>
        
            <p>"Me and Baz (McCullum) have not spoken about anything like that whatsoever."</p>
        
            <p>Stokes has been sidelined since tearing his left hamstring while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred last month. The 33-year-old said his rehabilitation was going well and that he would undergo a scan on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of bowling, there's a lot more than just my hamstring that I need to get back firing - you use everything," he added. "I need to get that all right to make sure I don't do any more damage to any other parts of my body."</p>
