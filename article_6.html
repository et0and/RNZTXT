            <p>After 14 seasons, Warriors all time fan-favourite Shaun Johnson - AKA 'The Prince of Penrose' - runs out in front of a sellout crowd at 'Shaun Johnson Stadium' for the last time tonight in what should be a fiery return clash against the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs.</p>

            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/525920/shaun-johnson-retirement-10-highlights-of-the-warriors-halfback-s-career </p>
        
            <p>It's also goodbye for club legends Jazz Tevaga and Addin Fonua-Blake, as they both head back to Australia for the 2025 NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors have unfinished business with the Bulldogs after their bitter golden point loss in July began their downward slide for the season. After languishing near the bottom of the table for the better part of a decade, the Doggies have found a formula that gets them wins on the board - and last time the two sides met, the Warriors found that out the hard way.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1. Charnze Nicole-Klokstad 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Adam Pompey 4. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Luke Metcalf 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. 10. Mitchell Barnett (C) 11. Marata Niukore 12. Kurt Capewell 13. Dylan Walker</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Freddy Lussick 15. Tom Ale 16. Jazz Tevaga 17. Demitric Sifakula</p>
        
            <p>Bulldogs: 1. Connor Tracey 2. Jacob Kiraz 3. Bronson Xerri 4. Stephen Crichton 5. Josh Addo-Carr 6. Matt Burton 7. Toby Sexton 8.Josh Curran 9. Reed Mahoney 10. Samuel Hughes 11. Vilame Kikau 12. Jacob Preston 13. Kurt Mann</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Bailey Hayward 15. Kurtis Morrin 16. Harry Hayes 17. Jaeman Salmon</p>
        
            <p>Warriors selections</p>
        
            <p>It's curtains for Shaun Johnson, Jazz Tevaga and Addin Fonua-Blake as they run out at home for the final time. Minimal changes to the side from last week, with Wayde Egan returning to the number 9 jersey, Lussick moving to the bench and Harris-Tavita in as 18th man.</p>
        
            <p>Bulldogs selections</p>
        
            <p>The Bulldogs also name an unchanged side from last week's 30-10 destruction of the Dolphins, as they charge towards the NRL finals.</p>
        
            <p>Past results</p>
        
            <p>Bulldogs 13-12 Warriors</p>
        
            <p>After being ravaged with injuries and left with just one spot on the bench after losing the Warriors back three of Nicole-Klokstad, Watene-Zelezniak and Montoya, the two teams fought it out in one of the matches of the season in a low scoring back and forth tussle.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors and their fans are no strangers to dubious decisions from NRL officials and the worst probably came at the hands of the Bulldogs back in round 18. After kicking down, Te Maire Martin was taken out by a late shot by Jae Salmon - a move that was left unpenalised during game play.</p>
        
            <p>Salmon would go on to be stood down for two weeks after the NRL admitted an error in not awarding a penalty for what was a grade 2 dangerous contact charge. Had the Warriors earned said penalty, they would have had a shot in front of the sticks to go up by two points - with only a few minutes to go. Instead, they went down to a Matt Burton field goal in the 88th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Prediction </p>
        
            <p>A sell-out crowd will gather to celebrate the milestone of the last ever home game for three of the club's most incredible players; Fonua-Blake, Tevaga and of course Johnson. Fans will be hoping the menu for the evening will consist of Vintage Johnson side steps, some big hits from Fonua-Blake and a bit of mongrel up the middle from Tevaga.</p>
        
            <p>Whilst the Bulldogs are on a roll right now, it would be classic Warriors to upset a top eight side after their own season has already been written off. The men from Mt Smart have everything to play for tonight, as they look to send their departing players off on a high note and give fans a reason to scream 'Up the Wahs' one last time this season.</p>
