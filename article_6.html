            <p>The 24-year-old's standout performances came in the knockout stage.</p>
        
            <p>The semi-final win over the West Indies by eight runs, featured Kerr taking 2-14, removing the big-hitting Deandra Dottin at a vital moment in the chase.</p>
        
            <p>In the final, she top-scored with 43 off 38 balls as New Zealand posted 158-5 against South Africa and delivered another bowling masterclass, taking 3-24 as the Proteas collapsed to 126-9.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the responsibility the White Ferns have given me. It's a team I love playing for," Kerr told the ICC after the award announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"The World Cup success has to be the one that sticks out, and that's for the team. To win a World Cup is everyone's dream and I've dreamt that since I was a young kid.</p>
        
            <p>"To celebrate with your team-mates in the changing room, it's a real family feel at the White Ferns, so it's something I'll remember for the rest of my life."</p>
