            <p>There is growing speculation over whether Wayne Brown's own deputy and political ally is set to challenge him for Auckland's top job.</p>
        
            <p>Desley Simpson, who previously stood under the right-leaning Communities and Residents (C&R) party in local body elections, has served as deputy to Mayor Wayne Brown since his election in the 2022 elections.</p>
        
            <p>The high profile councillor is married to businessman and former National Party president Peter Goodfellow.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson took on a more visible role as the face of Auckland Council in the wake of the Auckland Anniversary Floods when Brown was criticised for not handling the emergency well and for his combative attitude toward media at the time.</p>
        
            <p>There has been speculation in political circles over Simpson's future in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>However, Simpson told RNZ on Thursday afternoon she had "not yet made a decision about what I intend to to this year".</p>
        
            <p>Sources familiar with the situation, who did not want to be named, told RNZ in December that Simpson was no longer a member of C&R and that it was expected she would launch a mayoral bid.</p>
        
            <p>In December a domain name, "DesleyforMayor.co.nz'' was registered by Andrew Simpson, her son by her first marriage to Coromandel MP and Senior National Party Whip, Scott Simpson.</p>
        
            <p>When asked whether Simpson was still an active member and would be a C&R candidate this election, President David Hay said he did not want to comment until he had spoken to Simpson.</p>
        
            <p>He said there had been no discussions between C&R and Simpson about her joining the mayoral race but "the rumour was she was running''.</p>
        
            <p>Hay said he had tried to contact Simpson in the past few days but she was not answering.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was told on Wednesday Simpson was overseas and would be back at work next week.</p>
        
            <p>In a bizarre turn of events, the domain name 'desleyformayor.nz' was registered by Jordan Williams last week.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan Williams is a right-wing lobbyist and political campaigner, known for his involvement in the Taxpayers' Union.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement today Williams said when he discovered the domain name was available he registered it.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ Williams said he was not involved in Simpson's campaign and had done it as a "practical joke''.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to Ratepayers' Union members, he said they discovered Simpson's son only registered "DesleyForMayor.co.nz" and forgot "DesleyForMayor.nz".</p>
        
            <p>He said they would give the domain to Simpson if she wanted it.</p>
        
            <p>Wayne Brown has not officially declared he is standing for mayor again, saying he would make an announcement early this year, but is widely expected to stand.</p>
        
            <p>He did not want to comment "at this time", a spokesperson for his office said.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson has been contacted for comment.</p>
