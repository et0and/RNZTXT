            <p>New Zealand shot-putter Tom Walsh has won his third World Indoor title.</p>
        
            <p>It is a dramatic turn around for the Cantabrian who had his Olympic campaign last year ruined by an injury.</p>
        
            <p>His victory in Nanjing, China follows wins in Portland in 2016 and Birmingham in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>It is his sixth medal in total and you have to go back to 2012 for a time when the 31-year-old did not feature at all on the podium at the World Indoors despite this being his first indoor outing of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh threw a season best 21.65 metres to finish just ahead of American's Roger Steen and Adrian Piperi.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh has also won a World Championship (outdoor) gold and bronze medal and two Olympic bronze medals.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh's first-round throw sent him to the lead, where he stayed for the rest of the competition. His 21.65 mark proved to be a throw too far for the rest of the competition, as Walsh remained</p>
        
            <p>unchallenged to his final throw.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh's five throws over 21m saw him throw the best series on the field, with pre-event favourite, Olympic medallist Leonardo Fabri of Italy finishing in fourth with a best throw of 21.35.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh entered the competition ranked 8th on his season best.</p>
        
            <p>He pockets $70,000 for the win.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh will now set his sights on competitions in both the USA and in Europe as he builds towards the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan in September.</p>
