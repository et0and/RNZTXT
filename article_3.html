            <p>American singer-songwriter Michael Bolton has told fans on social media that he is recovering at home after undergoing surgery to treat a brain tumour.</p>
        
            <p>Bolton told followers in a Facebook post that he was required to undergo "immediate surgery" after being diagnosed with a brain tumour prior to the 2023 Christmas holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Seventy-year-old Bolton - who rocketed to worldwide fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a series of power ballad chart hits - told fans the surgery had been a success, but he would be taking a break from touring while he recuperated at home.</p>
        
            <p>After an early career as a hard rock performer, Bolton found international fame in the late 1980s with his ARIA chart-topping album Soul Provider.</p>
        
            <p>"For the next couple of months, I will be devoting my time and energy to my recovery, which means I'll have to take a temporary break from touring," Bolton said in the Facebook post.</p>
        
            <p>"It is always the hardest thing for me to ever disappoint my fans or postpone a show, but have no doubt I am working hard to accelerate my recovery and get back to performing soon.</p>
        
            <p>"I am beyond grateful for all the love and support you have so generously shown me through the years."</p>
        
            <p>Bolton promised to update fans again on his condition as soon as he could.</p>
        
            <p>The record featured the Grammy award-winning ballad How Am I Supposed to Live Without You, which reached number two on the ARIA charts and topped the US Billboard charts. Follow up single How Can We Be Lovers? reached number 3 on both the US and Australian charts.</p>
        
            <p>Bolton found success again in 1993 with the ballad Said I Loved Youâ€¦ But I Lied, again reaching number 3 in the US and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, Bolton regained notoriety through his work with American comedy trio The Lonely Island, singing the chorus of their Saturday Night Live-featured song Jack Sparrow, as well as appearing in their 2016 film Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.</p>
