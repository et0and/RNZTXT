            <p>A synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-4en-PINACA has been detected in a yellow powder presumed to be N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).</p>
        
            <p>Drug Information and Alerts Aotearoa New Zealand (DIANZ) has posted on its High Alert website that this powder was linked to a hospitalisation in the Auckland region.</p>
        
            <p>MDMB-4en-PINACA is a powerful synthetic cannabinoid that can lead to overdoses, even at low concentrations, and has been linked to serious harm - including deaths - in New Zealand. DMT is a psychedelic drug that produces effects similar to those of LSD.</p>
        
            <p>DIANZ first posted an alert about the yellow powder on 3 May.</p>
        
            <p>Subsequently, a separate case of the synthetic cannabinoid was found in a sample of yellow powder presumed to be DMT that was submitted to a New Zealand Needle Exchange Programme (DISC) drug-checking clinic in Christchurch. There was no DMT in either sample.</p>
        
            <p>It was not known how widely the fake DMT had circulated, but the organisation warned it was now present in Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"High Alert strongly recommends people be cautious when consuming yellow powders, and drug checking is recommended to help minimise the risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Drug checking services can identify when a substance is not what it has been sold as.</p>
        
            <p>"If you, or someone you know, takes a substance thought to be DMT and starts to feel unexpected effects, call 111 immediately. Be honest about your drug use - you won't get in trouble and it could save your life."</p>
