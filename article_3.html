            <p>Analysis - While all eyes are on Paris, the All Blacks are setting up for their next rather significant block of work. The test season resumes on Saturday night in Wellington when they take on Argentina, the first of six Rugby Championship matches, and a challenge that ramps up significantly when the team travels to South Africa for a rematch of last year's World Cup final.</p>
        
            <p>But before then, the action starts this Saturday with the Wallabies playing the Springboks at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane (kick-off 4.30pm NZT) followed by the All Blacks and Pumas at Sky Stadium in Wellington (kick-off 7.05pm).</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at how each team is shaping up as the Rugby Championship gets underway:</p>
        
            <p>2024 results so far</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 16 - 15 England</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 24 - 17 England</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 47 - 5 Fiji</p>
        
            <p>The English series ended up being the perfect barometer for Scott Robertson in his debut as coach, with plenty to improve on and talk about, while netting two wins. Overall, it was impressive to see the All Blacks adapt in the first test and then over the week going into the second, however it's going to take another incremental step up in South Africa. Not a great deal can be read into the Fiji result, other than what it's done to the halfback situation.</p>

            <p>Who has impressed</p>
        
            <p>The front row and the scrum in general's dominance, particularly against the usually strong English, have been a very reassuring platform for the All Blacks to work off. Cortez Ratima looked right at home in test rugby, while Anton Lienert-Brown and Billy Proctor's combination against Fiji looked like they'd been playing together for years. Sevu Reece and Mark Tele'a have had high workrates in a very competitive outside back picture.</p>
        
            <p>Talking points </p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie and Beauden Barrett have put together a good case for a functioning 10/15 axis, but Will Jordan's return opens up another option. In the forwards, Samipeni Finau has a few eyes on him after a couple of comparatively anonymous performances after his massive Super Rugby Pacific season. The lineout has been shambolic at times and will cost the All Blacks' test matches if it isn't fixed. In the coaches' box, Scott Hansen and Jason Holland have an intriguing task ahead of them trying to unlock the Springbok defence once the action shifts to Ellis Park.</p>
        
            <p>2024 results so far</p>
        
            <p>France 28 - 13 Argentina</p>
        
            <p>Argentina 33 - 25 France</p>
        
            <p>Argentina 79 - 5 Uruguay</p>
        
            <p>The split series result with France was an interesting one, given that the French generally don't put much effort into their overseas obligations outside of World Cups and were rocked by two separate off field scandals on the tour. The second test victory in Buenos Aires was veteran loose forward Pablo Matera's 100th, although he didn't see it out due to injury and they recovered from a second-half deficit to record their first win over France since 2016. However, things will need to be lot better when they face the All Blacks in two tests in New Zealand starting this weekend.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Who has impressed</p>
        
            <p>Young prop Thomas Gallo scored twice in the win over France and was part of a very strong scrum that also yielded a penalty try. Julian Montoya was his usual dominant force up front, while Lautaro Bazan Velez and Santiago Carreras were an effective inside back combination.</p>
        
            <p>Talking points</p>
        
            <p>You get the feeling that if they are to achieve anything in the two tests against the All Blacks it'll be heavily reliant on the more experienced players. Matera was injured in the second test so what role he plays in Wellington remains to be seen, while Santiago Chocobares' move to the midfield looks to be a useful one so far.</p>
        
            <p>2024 results so far</p>
        
            <p>Springboks 27 - 20 Ireland</p>
        
            <p>Ireland 25 - 24 Springboks</p>
        
            <p>Springboks 64 - 21 Portugal</p>
        
            <p>The much-anticipated series against Ireland has arguably been the most interesting test series so far this year, with both matches extremely hard fought. The disappointment from Rassie Erasmus' side was evident after a last play drop goal denied them in the second test, so just what sort of mindset they're in once the All Blacks arrive will be interesting.</p>

            <p>Who has impressed</p>
        
            <p>Siya Kolisi has been immense with ball in hand so far, with fellow loosie Pieter-Steph du Toit upping their workrate noticeably with ball in hand. Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu came in with a lot of hype and lived up to it after playing pretty much all of the second test off the bench, can he force his way into the starting team by the time the Springboks play the All Blacks?</p>
        
            <p>Talking points</p>
        
            <p>Other than prop Ox Nche, the tight five hasn't exactly played to the high standards that won the Springboks the World Cup last year. That will need to be addressed if they are to reverse their shocking record lately in Australia, where the Wallabies have won six out of the last seven encounters, with one draw.</p>
        
            <p>2024 results so far</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies 25 - 16 Wales</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies 36 - 28 Wales</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies 40 - 29 Georgia</p>
        
            <p>Joe Schmidt's already managed to surpass Eddie Jones' win total from the Wallabies' disastrous 2023 season, but to be fair he was dealt a pretty good schedule to start off with. The wins over Wales probably should've been more decisive to have started some serious chat around some sort of resurgence of Australian rugby, but a win over the Springboks over the next fortnight will get that going.</p>

            <p>Who has impressed</p>
        
            <p>The loose forward trio of Liam Wright, Fraser McReight and Rob Valetini were very good in the first test, but McReight has been ruled out for the first test at least. Jake Gordon had a couple of really good performances too at halfback, while further out Tom Wright, Josh Flook and Filipo Daugunu have been the pick of the backs.</p>
        
            <p>Talking points</p>
        
            <p>Once again, the Wallabies chances will rely almost entirely on their tight five and Noah Lolesio's form at 10. There was enough from the key forwards during Super Rugby Pacific to suggest it's possible, but Schmidt needs to find a way to make them fire every week. Lolesio certainly has the skillset but needs the swagger of a player with consistent front foot ball, because he'll have Marika Koroibete on one wing now, a man who has no fear of playing the Springboks.</p>
