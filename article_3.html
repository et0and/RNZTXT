            <p>The government aims to test just over 3.3 million drivers a year in its plan to increase roadside tests for drink and drug-impared drivers.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown is launching a $1.3 billion Road Policing Investment Programme which will run for the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>He said 65 percent of breath tests will be done at high or extreme alcohol risk times.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme will also have a target of carrying out 50,000 drug tests per year.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said another priority will be speeding on open roads and at high-risk locations.</p>
        
            <p>"This plan has a clear focus on outcomes and has clear targets to ensure police are focused on the most high-risk times, behaviours, and locations.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan will ensure police target speeding offences on high-risk roads, a clear focus on drugs and alcohol enforcement to deter impaired drivers and expects police to focus on the key times and locations where the highest risk on our roads occur."</p>
        
            <p>He said alcohol and drugs are the number one contributing factor in fatal road crashes.</p>
        
            <p>"Over 2019-2022, crashes involving drug drivers claimed the lives of an average of 105 people each year and represented around 30 per cent of all road deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan increases the alcohol breath testing target from 3 million tests to 3.3 million tests per year and introduces a new target for at least 65 percent of alcohol breath tests to be undertaken during the most high and extreme alcohol risk times.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has an inconsistent record with breath tests. Over the past ten years, there are only two in which police have conducted 3 million tests. Some years have delivered less than half of that number.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that breath tests have a clear deterrent effect on people who risk drinking and then driving, and we are determined to see more breath tests undertaken so Kiwis are safer on our roads."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said $72 million of funding over three years will be available as an incentive payment to police to ensure performance against speed, alcohol, and drug enforcement targets.</p>
        
            <p>He said the funding will be released based upon targets being achieved.</p>
