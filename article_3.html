            <p>The Labour Party is furious its former minister and also former ACT leader Richard Prebble is one of two new members appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka said since leaving Parliament, Prebble has provided pro bono advice to various Māori trusts, hapū and iwi on a variety of issues.</p>
        
            <p>Prebble refused an invitation to be interviewed for Morning Report. However, Labour's Māori Development spokesperson Willie Jackson was scathing on the appointment.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson described it as "unbelievable" and "a kick in the guts" for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we were all in shock [on Thursday] ... but what next - are we going to make Don Brash the new chair of the tribunal?," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just incredible what this government will do."</p>
        
            <p>While Prebble had skills and experience as a lawyer working in the Māori sector, the most important factor was his alignment with the ACT Party and its policies, in particular the Treaty Principles Bill, Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>Board members Derek Fox and Hana O'Regan who had a lot of experience in te ao Māori had been stood down with Prebble named as one replacement.</p>
        
            <p>He believed former prominent National politicians like Jenny Shipley, Chris Finlayson or Doug Graham would have been better choices from the right of the political spectrum.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly disappointing - it's not personal with 'Prebs', we all know him. I've worked with him on the Māori Affairs select committee but he represents a party and David Seymour."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson was adamant Prebble supported ACT's principles.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that it's a real shock for Māori but it's virtue signalling from this government to ACT supporters. There's question marks now again over the prime minister."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was also disappointed Potaka had allowed Seymour and other coalition members "to come over the top of him".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Seymour said he believed it was important to discuss Prebble's qualifications for the role, not make "personal attacks"/</p>
        
            <p>"When you look at Richard's skills and experience, it's difficult to imagine someone better suited," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When Willie was in Government, numerous former Labour MPs were appointed to all manner of boards, some only a couple of years after being in Parliament. If he didn't have an issue then, there's no reason he should have an issue now."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said Prebble was exactly the sort of person who should be on the tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>"Richard is also an experienced lawyer, MP and company director, with an extensive knowledge of te ao Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"ACT looks forward to his contributions in ensuring that the Treaty of Waitangi is interpreted and applied in a manner that reflects what it actually says, including the promise of the same rights and duties for all New Zealanders," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>Prebble would be joined on the tribunal by Ken Williamson; Kevin Prime was reappointed for a second term.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Māori Development Tama Potaka on Thursday said the new appointments, including Prebble, would uphold the work done between the Crown and Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"Waitangi Tribunal members bring with them a range of knowledge and skills and are appointed for their broad expertise in the matters that are likely to come before the Tribunal," Potaka said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ensuring we have a range of talented appointees on tribunals and boards is absolutely key to the delivery of better public services."</p>
