            <p>An iguana has been returned to its home at a reptile park after a burglary in which the offender "slithered" away with two reptiles.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were stolen on 25 March from the Ti Point Reptile Park in Wellsford.</p>
        
            <p>"Since then the 17-year-old stolen leopard tortoise has been returned and now his eight-year-old iguana friend joins him back at the park," Sergeant Dan McDermott said.</p>

            <p>"Police have received a number of calls from the public and are following positive lines of enquiry to locate the animal thieve/s."</p>
        
            <p>The incident was distressing for the reptiles and their owners, McDermott said.</p>
        
            <p>Police say anyone with information about who stole the iguana and tortoise can contact police on 105 and quote file 240320/8108.</p>
