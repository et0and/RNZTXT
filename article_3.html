            <p>A New Zealand anti-apartheid activist has been posthumously honoured for the decades he spent campaigning to cut ties with apartheid South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Newnham, who died in 2010, was awarded the Order of the Companions of O R Tambo for his tireless campaigning against apartheid.</p>
        
            <p>Starting with the 1960 All Blacks tour of South Africa, Newnham worked to change New Zealand's sporting contact with South Africa by organising speaking tours by prominent international anti-apartheid activists.</p>
        
            <p>Newnham's son, Rewi Newnham, attended the ceremony in Pretoria and told Morning Report it was a tremendous ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>"These are the highest national awards bestowed upon not just South Africans, but international citizens as well who have supported South Africa over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really quite humbling to be there representing my father, a few years after he passed away of course, so a lot of memories coming back.</p>
        
            <p>"Amongst the awardees were some very notable people in South Africa and internationally, many of whom have made huge sacrifices.</p>
        
            <p>"To see my father's award amongst that was really quite a humbling experience for me."</p>
        
            <p>Newnham said his father spent 40 years fighting the anti-apartheid campaign, which ultimately triumphed when apartheid legislation was repealed in the early 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>"The sort of sacrifices he made were psychological. There was a lot of stuff that today would be called hate speech and hate mail and so on, that he suffered, some physical abuse as well.</p>
        
            <p>"But he stood up to that, and I guess in some ways he maybe thrived on it. He knew that he had to in order to get through this."</p>
        
            <p>Newnham also acknowledged the people who supported his father over the years, saying they should take a lot of credit for the award.</p>
