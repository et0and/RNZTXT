            <p>Doctors and those working in hospital emergency departments are concerned as the funding for extra security guards ends and it's unclear where more money will come from.</p>
        
            <p>As part of its 100-day plan, the government paid for 200 extra guards across some hospitals over summer, but the $5.7 million in funding finished on 29 February.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Thursday night, Health Minister Shane Reti said December's initiative addressed an urgent need.</p>
        
            <p>He said Health NZ was "able to reallocate funding between now and 1 July 2024 to sustain an improved security presence".</p>
        
            <p>The interim plan would mean a "slightly lower level of increase than the summer surge", he said, but it would provide additional support to frontline staff.</p>
        
            <p>"Further planning will continue," Reti said.</p>

            <p>But doctors working in EDs said they needed the guards on a regular basis.</p>
        
            <p>Violence and aggression were growing towards doctors, nurses and other emergency department teams, with many fearing for their safety.</p>
        
            <p>The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine New Zealand chair Dr Kate Allan said the success of the guards had been mixed.</p>
        
            <p>In some hospitals they were stationed outside of the departments' front doors, meaning they were slower to react, and some were not trained in deescalating aggression, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff are often having conversations with families and patients before security are involved so it's not that somebody gets a bit rude and we are calling security. Often we will be trying to de-escalate way earlier in the piece."</p>
        
            <p>Despite that, the college was "incredibly disappointed" that the funding for the dedicated guards would not continue beyond summer.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency departments tended to be busy year around and the rising aggression was having a "profound impact" on those working there, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Many were choosing to cut their hours to cope, Allan said.</p>
        
            <p>"These people are strong people who are coming to work and they're getting destroyed by the level of violence and aggression that they are getting exposed to."</p>
        
            <p>Reti said he had directed HNZ Te Whatu Ora to report to him on future options.</p>
        
            <p>But Te Whatu Ora chief of people Andrew Slater said the agency would only be able to decide what to do next once it had formally reviewed the programme.</p>
        
            <p>That review was yet to take place.</p>
        
            <p>"In the meantime, we have a programme of work underway to improve staff safety across our facilities, and we want to assure our staff that this is a high priority for Health NZ," he said in a written statement.</p>
        
            <p>Slater maintained Te Whatu Ora had good feedback about the extra guards.</p>
