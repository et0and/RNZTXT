            <p>A drunken shoplifter threatened to rape and kill a Specsavers staff member as he stormed out of the store with more than $2000 worth of glasses.</p>
        
            <p>A more sober Kenneth Nikora Waaka, 44, appeared via audio-visual link in the Hamilton District Court this morning where he admitted multiple theft charges after a series of incidents targeted at spectacle stockists in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Waaka had already been trespassed from Centre Place shopping centre when he strolled back into OPSM about 1.20pm on 26 October last year.</p>
        
            <p>He selected seven pairs of sunglasses from a display stand before walking out without paying.</p>
        
            <p>When confronted by security and asked to pay for them, he crushed three pairs in his hand, causing $2377 worth of damage.</p>
        
            <p>He then walked out of Centre Place across the road towards Specsavers.</p>
        
            <p>There, he nabbed four pairs of prescription glasses, worth $1656, from a display stand before walking out without paying.</p>
        
            <p>Waaka returned to the same store early on 27 October and was greeted by a staff member who took him to see the victim who was in another part of the store.</p>
        
            <p>He then made derogatory comments, "I want to pull your ponytail" and "f*** you", and about wanting to touch a work colleague's bottom.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents state the victim was "shocked by these comments and how gross they were".</p>
        
            <p>Waaka then stole six pairs of prescription glasses from a display stand before walking out, again without paying.</p>
        
            <p>However, as he left, he threatened to rape and kill the victim before saying, "I can do whatever I want to you", and "You owe me whatever I can take".</p>
        
            <p>During the incident, Waaka appeared intoxicated and "smelt strongly of alcohol, and his speech was slurred".</p>
        
            <p>The glasses were worth $2394 and were not recovered.</p>
        
            <p>Waaka was arraigned this morning on three charges of theft over $1000, wilful trespass, and threatening behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>He was convicted by Judge Kim Saunders and remanded in custody to reappear for sentencing in June.</p>
