            <p>Airports are hitting out at Air New Zealand's domestic airfares and are calling for ticket prices to be independently monitored.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data showed domestic airfares rose 7.4 percent in February from the month earlier, and increased 7.7 percent from February 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand recently announced it was reviewing fares in response to cost pressures.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Airports Association chief executive Billie Moore said the national carrier was adding to the cost of living for households.</p>
        
            <p>"Air New Zealand has upped its domestic airfares yet again, as well as increasing the cost of add-ons such as bag check by $10. It's flagged that other costs, like checking in your pet, could also be in for a future price hike," Moore said.</p>
        
            <p>The airline hit back, saying it was trying to meet costs and disputed some of the claims around fares.</p>
        
            <p>Air NZ general manager of domestic Iain Walker said its February domestic fares rose 2 percent year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>"[It is] below inflation and the increases we've seen in our operating costs," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>Therefore, he said, the airline was taking steps to ensure the fares covered the cost of travel.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also why we - and our competitor airlines - are so concerned about the Auckland Airport redevelopment, which will see charges increase from $9 per domestic passenger today to $46 in 2032," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>The association cited numbers from the airfare monitoring system Infare, saying the airline hiked its average one-way domestic fares by 34 percent in the year ended September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>However, Air New Zealand disputed the Infare data, saying it was "incomplete" and did not reflect its pricing, as it did not include online and Grabaseat bookings.</p>
        
            <p>The association said the new Civil Aviation Act 2023 provided the Ministry of Transport with information-gathering power to set up an independent airfare monitoring system.</p>
        
            <p>Moore said while a price monitoring system would not solve the market dominance of Air New Zealand, it could help improve prices.</p>
        
            <p>"What airfare monitoring can do is, first of all, have a bit of chilling effect on this because there can be independent data released on average airfares, that does have a natural effect on airline behaviour," Moore said.</p>
        
            <p>"It can also help show how the market is performing, potentially for other operators to take a look and see if they see an opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>The relationship between Air New Zealand and airports, notably Auckland, has turned sour over the past year as Auckland Airport pressed ahead with a $3.9 billion revamp of its terminal.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport's move to increase airline charges has also not gone down well with Air New Zealand and other airlines.</p>
        
            <p>"Air New Zealand is busy blaming Auckland Airport for cost increases when it's their own record-high domestic airfares and cost add-ons that are driving up the cost of domestic travel for consumers. Airport charges only make up a fraction of a ticket," Moore said.</p>
