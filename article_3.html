            <p>New Zealand athletes have bagged more gold medals at Paris 2024 than at any other Olympic Games in history.</p>
        
            <p>The 10 golds claimed across the two weeks of competition have smashed the previous record of eight won at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis also bagged seven silver and three bronze medals to take the total number to 20 and finish 11th on the medal table, between Germany and Canada.</p>
        
            <p>That is the same number of medals won at Tokyo 2020, which was previously New Zealand's most successful Olympics in terms of numbers. Athletes took seven golds, six silvers and seven bronzes at that competition.</p>
        
            <p>The second-most successful was Rio de Janeiro in 2016, where the Kiwis bagged 18: four golds, nine silvers and five bronzes.</p>
        
            <p>However, the 1984 LA Games were the most successful in terms of our place on the medal table. We came eighth at those Games, in between Japan and Yugoslavia.</p>
        
            <p>Going into these Games, Aotearoa was predicted to claim 14 medals and finish 16th equal, alongside Denmark and Turkey.</p>
        
            <p>The prediction, taken from the final edition of the Gracenote virtual medals table (which is compiled using results data from key global and continental competitions since the Tokyo Games), was for four golds, four silvers and six bronzes.</p>
