            <p>US President Donald Trump has ordered 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10 percent on goods from China starting on Tuesday to address a national emergency over fentanyl and illegal aliens entering the US, White House officials said.</p>
        
            <p>Energy products from Canada would have only a 10 percent duty, but Mexican energy imports would be charged the full 25 percent, the officials told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>Trump had declared the national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to back the tariffs, which allowed sweeping powers to address crises.</p>
        
            <p>The White House officials said there would be no exclusions from the tariffs. Moreover, in the case of Canada specifically, they said the "de minimis" US tariff exemption for small shipments under US$800 would be cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The moves followed through on a repeated threat Trump had made since shortly after winning last year's presidential election, and they likely would trigger retaliation and risk igniting a trade war that could cause broad economic disruption for all countries involved.</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear if Trump, who golfed at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday before signing the order, would speak to the media about the duties.</p>
        
            <p>Trump set the 1 February deadline to press for strong action to halt the flow of the opiate fentanyl and precursor chemicals into the US from China via Mexico and Canada, as well as to stop illegal immigrants crossing US borders.</p>
        
            <p>Less than two weeks into his second term, Trump was upending the norms of how the United States was governed and interacted with its neighbours and wider world.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, he pledged to proceed with the levies despite acknowledging they could cause disruption and hardship for American households.</p>
        
            <p>A model gauging the economic impact of Trump's tariff plan from EY chief economist Greg Daco suggested it would reduce US growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in "stagflation" at home.</p>
        
            <p>"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against US trading partners could create a stagflationary shock - a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse - while also triggering financial market volatility," Daco wrote on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>That volatility was evident on Friday, when the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both slumped after Trump vowed to fulfil his threats. US stock prices also fell and Treasury bond yields rose.</p>
