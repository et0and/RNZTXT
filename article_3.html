            <p>Justin Lester is not completely ruling out running for Wellington mayor again after confirming the Labour Party has asked him to consider it.</p>
        
            <p>Lester was in the capital's top job from 2016 to 2019 but failed to win re-election against now New Zealand First MP Andy Foster.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ that as long as a candidate runs that Wellingtonians can get behind he would support them.</p>
        
            <p>"If that doesn't happen, look you never say never, but [its] certainly not my intention. I don't want to get offside with my own family because they're my priority now."</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of people had approached him to consider running, including the Labour Party, Lester said</p>
        
            <p>"The Labour Party has asked if I want to run and I have said exactly what I am saying today, [which] is that look that's not my intention.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not interested in running, my family is my first priority so I hope they can find a good candidate."</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ he loved the city and that it had been going through a "rough patch" due to a lot of issues.</p>
        
            <p>That included public service job cuts, a difficult economic environment, people working from home and the follow on effects on infrastructure following the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Former Wellington deputy mayor and Labour Party president Jill Day said their conversations with a range of people were internal.</p>
        
            <p>"When we have selected a candidate we will make an announcement then."</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the performance of current mayor Tory Whanau, Lester said he had a lot of respect for her.</p>
        
            <p>"She is doing the job to the best of her abilities in a difficult situation because it has been hard for Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>She was doing a good job for the city, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Lester had also rebranded his Facebook page in recent days to Wellington Alive, which he said would be an outlet to tell good news stories.</p>
        
            <p>Through the closing of community papers such as the Cook Strait News and the Wellingtonian, there was a diminished ability to tell good news stories about local heroes, initiatives, sports, arts and the environment, he said.</p>
