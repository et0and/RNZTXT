            <p>New Zealand racing driver Liam Lawson has been eliminated after the first stage of qualifying for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson finished last of the 20 drivers in the stage.</p>
        
            <p>Pierre Gasly, Ollie Bearman, Jack Doohan and Gabriel Bortoleto also failed to make it beyond the first stage.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just really tough, honestly," he told the Sky Sport broadcast.</p>
        
            <p>"The window is really small, it's not an excuse. I have to get a handle on it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a messy session, had we not dealt with traffic it might have been okay but it is still not good enough.</p>
        
            <p>"We should be fast enough on our first lap. I just need to get on top of it."</p>
