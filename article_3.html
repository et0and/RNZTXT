            <p>The minister responsible for the government's response to the Abuse in Care report says the government will prioritise decisions around a redress system.</p>
        
            <p>It makes 138 recommendations - in addition to the 95 recommendations in the interim redress report.</p>
        
            <p>Erica Stanford says the redress system is big and broad, but there have already been a number of high-level Cabinet papers, with more to follow before the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"We are deliberately prioritising that because of the fact that so many of the survivors are older, and they are sick and many of them have already passed away and we know time is of the essence."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford says other recommendations will take more time to consider - but the government will provide an update by November.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the survivors spoken to by RNZ said they were glad the report is finally being released, but some remain sceptical over whether the government will honour it.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to make a formal apology to survivors in November.</p>
