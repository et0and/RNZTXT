            <p>Prince Harry has withdrawn his libel claim against the Mail on Sunday publisher, Associated Newspapers says.</p>
        
            <p>The Duke of Sussex, 39, had sued over an article about his publicly-funded security arrangements when visiting the UK after stepping back as a senior royal.</p>
        
            <p>In an article on the Daily Mail website the paper said he had "abandoned his case" hours before a court deadline.</p>
        
            <p>It said the prince would be liable for the publisher's £250,000 legal costs.</p>
        
            <p>The Mail on Sunday article, published in February 2022, had reported on the prince's legal challenge against the Home Office over changes to his publicly-funded security that had happened after he had stopped being a working royal and moved to the United States.</p>
        
            <p>After the claim was dropped, a spokesperson for the Sussexes said the duke was instead focusing on the safety of his family and his legal case against the Home Office.</p>
        
            <p>"His focus remains there, and on the safety of his family, rather than these legal proceedings that give a continued platform to the Mail's false claims all those years ago," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The Daily Mail said the duke could be facing costs of up to £750,000 but the spokesperson for the Sussexes said costs were still to be determined and it was "premature" to speculate.</p>
        
            <p>The now-withdrawn libel case is separate from the prince's claims of unlawful obtaining information against Associated Newspapers, which are due to go to trial.</p>
        
            <p>Prince Harry recently won damages from the Daily Mirror's publisher over phone-hacking claims.</p>
        
            <p>In his long-running libel case against Associated Newspapers, the prince had claimed the story falsely suggested he had "lied" and "cynically" tried to manipulate public opinion.</p>
        
            <p>The headline said the duke had "tried to keep his legal fight with the government over police bodyguards a secret" and his lawyers argued the article was "an attack on his honesty and integrity".</p>
        
            <p>The publisher contested this claim, arguing the article expressed an "honest opinion" and did not cause "serious harm" to his reputation.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the case being dropped, a three-day trial had been scheduled to be held between 17 May and 31 July this year.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Prince Harry lost part of the legal battle after his lawyers failed to persuade a judge to throw out a strand of Associated Newspapers' defence.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Nicklin said the newspaper group's argument that the article was "honest opinion" had a "real prospect" of success.</p>
        
            <p>Prince Harry has been involved in a series of legal cases in recent years, with most still yet to be resolved. They include:</p>
