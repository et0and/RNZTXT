        <h2>Supermarket spies: New bodycams' link to police surveillance</h2>
        <p>
Software for new anti-crime surveillance inside stores will be integrated with that used to recognise car number plates.

            <p>Two multinational companies with close ties to the New Zealand police have teamed up on anti-crime surveillance inside stores.</p>
        
            <p>The new partnership integrates the software system used to recognise number plates on cars, with bodycams.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as New Zealand supermarkets, in step with overseas trends, are bringing in body-worn cameras to deter rising rates of assaults on staff.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a global integration, US focused," said Auckland-based Auror, a global player in automated number plate recognition (ANPR).</p>
        
            <p>Its new partner, $35-billion US giant Axon, is a leading provider of bodycams to law enforcement in the US and Australia, and more recently expanded into retail.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand police have existing contracts with both Axon - for tasers and to store evidence overseas - and with Auror. Officers access its ANPR network that links to over 5000 CCTV cameras, hundreds of times a day.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions from RNZ, the police said in a statement they were able to access bodycam footage.</p>
        
            <p>"Police may access footage that a retailer has decided to upload to the Auror platform; this may be CCTV footage, photos taken on cellphones, as well as bodyworn cameras."</p>
        
            <p>Accessing bodycam footage was not a major change from how police already used ANPR footage, and they did not expect the integration to impact how they used Auror in investigations, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not aware of any formal discussions with police about this integration. We do not have any current plans to discuss the subject with Auror or Axon."</p>

            <p>Woolworths (formerly Countdown) was adding bodycams at all its stores, using Singaporean tech provider CSE.</p>
        
            <p>CSE said on its website the use of bodycams was spreading from law enforcement into other industries, "taking safety and accountability to the next level".</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs said just 16 of its 500 stores across the country used bodycams "to help keep team members and customers safe". Other stores used other measures.</p>
        
            <p>Its North Island stores reported over 5000 incidents in the first three months this year - one a week per store on average.</p>
        
            <p>"Footage is typically only recorded when the device is activated, with recordings later exported to secure systems.</p>
        
            <p>"Footage from bodycams of retail crime incidents is usually only uploaded to Auror following a legitimate request by police, and always only by authorised team members for the purposes of combatting retail crime."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths told RNZ that bodycam footage at its stores would be downloaded and stored securely by CSE, and retrievable by only a "handful of selected Woolworths team members in the safety and security team".</p>
        
            <p>It would only be shared if police requested it for an investigation, the company said.</p>
        
            <p>The police statement added that it was up to each business to determine which material was uploaded, adding "police may also make a request of a retailer in the course of an investigation which may include footage from bodyworn cameras if available."</p>
        
            <p>The new Axon-Auror partnership would include Axon's data system Evidence.com, to store footage.</p>
        
            <p>"With this new integration, once an investigation is at the hand-off point, law enforcement are able to export and securely transfer a full evidence package from Auror Investigate to Axon's Evidence.com," Axon said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand police already used Evidence.com to store taser and family violence interview footage on servers in Canberra. They were in the process of replacing their Axon tasers at a cost of $30 million.</p>
        
            <p>Both Axon and Auror emphasised their work with various police forces in their global marketing.</p>
        
            <p>Auror said individual retailers would determine the technologies they adopted.</p>
        
            <p>The integration's "focus is on the US (not New Zealand) where retailers are experiencing rising rates of violence and crime", it said.</p>
        
            <p>A legal challenge against police over their growing use of ANPR has been mounted in the district court, with the Public Defence Service arguing this should require a warrant.</p>
        
            <p>The police told RNZ they did not keep track of the types of cameras footage came from, so did not have any specific details or statistics.</p>
        
            <p>They had explicit policies around ANPR - for example, who could access the footage and for what purpose, and to monitor and audit the use of it - but not for bodycams.</p>
