        <p>

            <p>Engines are revving for the Otago Rally with 119 entries ready to tackle the challenging multi-stage course this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It marks the traditional start to the New Zealand season and has attracted local and international competitors.</p>

            <p>Dunedin rally driver Emma Gilmour grew up around cars and started as a navigator for her sister and cousin.</p>
        
            <p>But it was the driver's seat that felt like home.</p>
        
            <p>"Once I had a go in the driver's seat, I was hooked. It was a bit like a duck takes to water," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She was no stranger to the Otago Rally.</p>

            <p>"It's my favourite event. It's the event where I had a first go at driving so the organisers here have been amazing, a crucial part of my career journey," Gilmour said.</p>
        
            <p>"They let me be the course car 20-something years ago so I started and it was my first time driving on gravel."</p>

            <p>Auckland rally driver Zeal Jones, 19, switched from karting three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I was on a search for a kart and we did that for about seven years, and developed all the basics and learnt everything you need to about a car, and the fundamentals of set up and things like that.</p>
        
            <p>"From there on, we transferred into rallying. It was quite my driving style, really aggressive."</p>
        
            <p>Rallying was in his blood, he said; his grandfather was a driver, his aunty is his co-driver and his uncle owns the car he is racing.</p>
        
            <p>While not his first rodeo, he was preparing for a challenging course.</p>
        
            <p>"The nature of the road is quite different in Dunedin. It's a lot more faster, a lot of crests. You need a lot more commitment."</p>

            <p>Otago Rally organiser Roger Oakley said the teams would be put through their paces.</p>
        
            <p>"Fast flowing, open public roads. Lots of blind brows. Huge reliance on the pace notes from the co-drivers."</p>
        
            <p>The rally gave back to the host city, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year's event, the economic impact was 6700 bed nights for Dunedin and a direct spend of about $3 million."</p>
        
            <p>The Otago Rally kicks off with a ceremonial rally start in the Octagon on Friday night, before preparing to welcome spectators as wheels hit the gravel over the weekend.</p>
