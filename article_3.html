        <h2>'There won't be this behaviour again' - Luxon on MP Bayly's conduct</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister answered questions about MP Andrew Bayly's conduct after a regular meeting of the government's top ministers.
</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister is standing by Andrew Bayly after the Commerce Minister was accused of swearing at a business worker during a ministerial visit.</p>
        
            <p>At the post-Cabinet press briefing on Monday, Christopher Luxon was asked about Commerce Minister Andrew Bayly and his apology Friday for reportedly swearing at and offending an employee at a business visit.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly "unreservedly" apologised last week after it emerged the worker had complained he swore at him and repeatedly called him a "loser".</p>
        
            <p>Bayly's conduct was not up to scratch, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"He has genuinely, genuinely [apologised]. And that's what I'm always looking for in these cases. Have you internalised and understood how much hurt and insult you have caused, and what have you done... as best you can, to make amends?</p>
        
            <p>"But importantly, I would expect going forward - and I've told him that very clearly, and he has given me reassurances - that there won't be this behaviour again."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon would not be drawn on what type of complaint would warrant his immediate attention - saying only that he dealt with personnel issues "fairly and swiftly".</p>
        
            <p>The government also announced the start of the first Road of National Significance, in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"Early works have now started on the Hawke's Bay Expressway RoNS to four-lane this critical corridor that carries 29,000 vehicles a day and links freight to one of New Zealand's largest ports," Transport Minister Simeon Brown said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The post-Cabinet briefing came after Health NZ announced it would be making 400 staff redundant, and RNZ revealed 300 of its staff ate $9000 worth of canap√©s at a national conference, just as the financial crisis hitting hospitals was revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was also asked about New Zealand potentially hosting the America's Cup after Emirates Team New Zealand successfully wrapped up its third successive defence in Barcelona on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Former prime minister Helen Clark said the government would need to act "pretty quickly" if it wanted the chance to boost the economy and take advantage of all the benefits that stemmed from hosting it here.</p>
        
            <p>The government was open to receiving a proposal from Team New Zealand about hosting the competition, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Here is how this week's press conference unfolded:</p>
