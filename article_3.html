            <p>Silver Ferns superstar Grace Nweke concedes the series against Australia in October could be her last in the black dress for a while.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old, who has played 31 tests for New Zealand, has signed with the New South Wales Swifts to play in the Australian domestic competition.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke will move to Sydney for pre-season training after the four test Constellation Cup series against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>However, before that, she will take on England, starting with the first test in Auckland on Sunday - and her focus is firmly on the Roses.</p>
        
            <p>"I am just really enjoying every moment and opportunity to play. I want success. I enjoy winning and I want to be in a place where I'm proud of my contributions, especially as a leader."</p>
        
            <p>Nweke said there were several factors behind her move across the ditch.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the biggest thing is wanting to be better. I can be quite nonchalant and casual in the ANZ and just use my physical attributes to be successful. But I really wanted to challenge myself to grow my game even more, and I felt that a seventh season at Mystics wouldn't do that for me."</p>
        
            <p>Nweke had also never lived away from Auckland, and had an itch to "just try something new".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to get better. I want to be exposed by some of the best. But I also want to use it to grow my game and learn and come back here much, much better than I am now."</p>
        
            <p>The three-time ANZ Premiership winner believed she was leaving the squad in a strong spot.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got so much depth in the shooting circle, players who are ready to take the bib. We want to work hard and challenge everyone to put our hand up, but also support whoever is in that spot. So I know that there's great people coming through."</p>
        
            <p>She said she knew there was no guarantee of a return to black after her season in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Netball New Zealand rules state for a player to be eligible for the Silver Ferns they must play in the domestic competition.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke did not apply for an exemption from the Netball New Zealand board because it was clear she would not get one.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes me want to make sure I can come back for my bib, because it's up for the taking."</p>
