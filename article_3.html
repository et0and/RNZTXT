            <p>Two men, one accused of murdering an 18-year-old found in a burned-out car in a Hawke's Bay, have been given a trial date.</p>
        
            <p>Ariki Rigby's body was found in a dark grey Toyota Corona in River Road Reserve near Havelock North in September 2022, during an unplanned holiday to see her father and stepmother.</p>
        
            <p>Two men will stand trial at High Court at Napier on 3 November 2025, with the case being set down for three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man has been charged with her murder and with arson, and a 29-year-old man with being a party to arson. Both had name suppression for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>The public gallery was packed with family members in the High Court at Napier on Friday, and Judge Karen Grau asked them to be respectful of the court process.</p>
        
            <p>"Emotions are very raw, but I will ask you to be calm," she said.</p>
        
            <p>When Rigby died, police failed to realise there was a dead body in the burned-out car when they first checked on it. Officers visited the car after a caller told police on 3 September, 2022, that they thought they had seen the body of an animal on the floor in the back of the vehicle, but the body was not discovered until 5 September.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of Rigby's funeral, a family spokesperson said she was a beautiful, passionate person, who lived life at "full throttle".</p>
