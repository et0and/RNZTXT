            <p>Feeling disenchanted after getting rain for Christmas or just can't stand the thought of yet another year of stuffing the turkey, or your stuffy in-laws?</p>
        
            <p>House of Travel says it is seeing more people packing their bags and seeking out a white Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>So where can you find this Winter Wonderland next year?</p>

            <p>When people think Christmas abroad, many think of the bright lights of the Big Apple.</p>
        
            <p>With a huge number of Christmas movies, from Miracle on 34th Street to Elf, all set against a backdrop of the festive lights of New York, it is perhaps one of the most iconic Christmas destinations.</p>
        
            <p>There's the famous Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, the holiday window displays at Macy's Herald Square and the Radio City Rockettes Christmas Spectacular.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly-Ann Patterson from House of Travel Lower Hutt spent the first half of December there with her sister Maria on a trip she says was "nothing short of magical".</p>
        
            <p>"The best 'pinch-me' moments were experiencing the beauty of the iconic Rockefeller Centre Christmas tree as ice skaters whirled around beneath its twinkling lights.</p>
        
            <p>"The other 'wow' highlight was strolling by Macy's world-renowned holiday window display and then drinking coffee and walking through Central Park which looked like it was the backdrop to a winter wonderland movie."</p>
        
            <p>In this winter wonderland you can meet reindeer, take a sleigh ride with huskies, go ice fishing, and cross the Article Circle.</p>
        
            <p>Most Christmas tours will take you to Rovaniemi, which is considered the official hometown of Santa Claus.</p>
        
            <p>There you will find Santa Claus' Village - an experience Adventure World head of sales Andrew Eddy says can be enjoyed by all ages.</p>
        
            <p>You can meet the man in red himself and visit his official post office.</p>
        
            <p>You may also have a chance to see nature's Christmas lights, the Northern Lights, which are at their peak during the Christmas season.</p>
        
            <p>"Witnessing the Northern Lights in a snowy landscape with a reindeer sleigh ride and visiting Santa himself - I don't think it gets much more Christmassy than that," Eddy says.</p>

This year Suzanne and Dave Andrews from House of Travel The Square spent seven nights on a river cruise from Nuremberg to Amsterdam, where they were able to visit several festive Christmas markets and enjoy plenty of Glühwein.

            <p>The European Christmas markets are perhaps the ultimate festive shopping experience.</p>
        
            <p>This year, Suzanne and Dave Andrews from House of Travel The Square spent seven nights on a river cruise from Nuremberg to Amsterdam, where they were able to visit several Christmas markets and enjoy plenty of Glühwein (mulled wine).</p>
        
            <p>They were able to find hand-blown glass snowmen, Christmas-themed stained glass, and ceramics crafted by local potters.</p>
        
            <p>Other highlights from the pair's trip included strolling through Rothenburg's fairy-tale streets while snow fell, marvelling at the twinkling Christmas lights and wafting smells of roasting chestnuts.</p>
        
            <p>Demark is also a hit for those wanting to visit the Christmas markets with markets in theme parks, castles and of course old towns.</p>
        
            <p>Liva Polack, a Danish student living in New Zealand, recommends Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which are decked out with over one million Christmas lights.</p>
        
            <p>London is steeped in Christmas tradition and come December it counteracts its grey days with dazzling light displays, ice skating and festive entertainment galore.</p>
        
            <p>Brandon, a Kiwi living in London, says one of the biggest displays to see is Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park.</p>
        
            <p>The park is transformed into an amusement park, and also has (quite literally) cool experiences like an ice bar.</p>
        
            <p>Brandon says the pubs also get into the Christmas spirit and his favourite thing he has done so far is a pub crawl outside of London.</p>

            <p>It's not just the traditional white Christmas that has people jetsetting at Christmas. House of Travel says millennials in particular are increasingly ditching holiday traditions and family expectations in favour of ticking off their bucket-list travel dreams.</p>
        
            <p>This year Kylie Rutland and two of her best friends are having their third Christmas "girls-cation", this time to Thailand. They are also celebrating Rutland's 40th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>"We're swapping the hustle for pure relaxation - flopping on the beach, enjoying delicious food, sipping Thai cocktails, people-watching to our hearts' content and diving into the books we've been meaning to read all year."</p>
        
            <p>Their Christmas Day plans included an afternoon sundowner at Nomad Beach Club, a family-friendly seaside spot with fresh seafood and cocktails.</p>
        
            <p>"On New Year's Day, we'll enjoy a taste of Ibiza in Phuket at beach club, Café Del Mar.</p>
        
            <p>"And for my birthday, we're heading to the adults-only Yona Beach Club, which is the world's first floating club - it's on a boat in the middle of the ocean."</p>
