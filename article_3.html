            <p>Country singer Luke Combs has said he is "sick to my stomach" after learning he has been awarded US$250,000 ($402,900) after winning a lawsuit against a fan who sold homemade merchandise.</p>
        
            <p>The star said he had been unaware Nicol Harness had been sued for selling 18 drinks tumblers with his face on them.</p>
        
            <p>Harness said she only learned of the legal action after the ruling, which came days after she was in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Combs said he called her to apologise and promised to send US$11,000.</p>
        
            <p>That's double the US$5,500 that was initially frozen in her account following the judge's order, meaning she couldn't pay her bills.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old Grammy-nominated singer has now started selling his own tumblers on his official merchandise store, with all proceeds going to Ms Harness.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Combs scored a hit and won single of the year at the Country Music Association Awards for his cover of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car.</p>
        
            <p>He said he first learned of the legal action when he was sent a clip of Harness, from Florida, crying on a TV news interview.</p>
        
            <p>In the report, she said she didn't know she was being sued and later found the notice in the spam folder of her email account.</p>
        
            <p>She heard about the ruling after returning home from hospital, where she had been treated for congestive heart failure, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very stressful. I don't have money to pay my bills," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want this resolved. I didn't mean any harm to Luke Combs. I quit selling the tumbler. I pulled it down. I just don't understand."</p>
        
            <p>Harness was selling the items on Amazon and used her store as her main source of income, which was then cut off as a result of the lawsuit.</p>
        
            <p>She had been inspired to sell the tumblers after attending his show in Florida earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>After seeing the clip, Combs posted a video on social media to explain: "We have a company that goes after folks - only, supposedly, large corporations operating internationally that make millions and millions of dollars, making counterfeit T-shirts, things of that nature, running illegal businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"And apparently this woman Nicol has got somehow wrapped into that, and that makes me absolutely sick to my stomach."</p>
        
            <p>Combs said he was "so apologetic" and that "talking to her, it makes me sick that this would happen, especially [during] the holidays". He said "no fan should ever have to be involved in anything like this".</p>
        
            <p>He added that he was "not greedy in any way, shape or form".</p>
        
            <p>"Money is the last thing on my mind - and I invited Nicol and her family out to a show this year so I could give her a hug and say sorry in person," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The judgement was reportedly made against a number of counterfeit sellers, most of which were large operations in Asia, according to the Associated Press.</p>
