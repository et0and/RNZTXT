            <p>Police are following a large group of dirt bikes driving dangerously around the Counties Manukau area this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Kerry Watson says a number of resources have been deployed in response to the group, including the Police Eagle helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not want to put the public at risk or put the riders at any more risk than they're putting themselves in, however there is a significant police response, and we will be taking action when we can do so safely."</p>
        
            <p>The group had been seen running red lights, riding on the wrong side of the road and breaking the speed limit, Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not only concerning, but it's putting other road users and members of the public at extreme risk of harm.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the riders are not wearing appropriate gear and if something goes wrong, someone could easily lose their life," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police had made five arrests so far, and expected to make further arrests, Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police's message is clear: If you ride your dirt or off-road bike where you shouldn't, or ride in an anti-social manner, we will do everything in our power to identify you and take enforcement action."</p>
        
            <p>That could include seizure or impounding of the bike, Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>It was illegal to ride a dirt bike on the road unless it was roadworthy and had a current warrant and registration.</p>
        
            <p>Police are seeking information on 105 or online using the reference number P060876126.</p>
