            <p>Four UN peacekeepers from Italy were wounded by rockets in Lebanon fired by Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, Italian officials said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed "deep indignation and concern" over "new attacks suffered by the Italian headquarters of UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) in southern Lebanon" on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"These attacks are unacceptable," she said in a statement, calling on "the parties on the ground to guarantee, at all times, the safety of UNIFIL soldiers and to collaborate to quickly identify those responsible".</p>
        
            <p>Meloni did not attribute blame but Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said the rockets were "fired by Hezbollah" and called on both Israel and Lebanon to protect the base.</p>
        
            <p>"We condemn this act of war against the representatives of a peacekeeping mission", he said on X.</p>
        
            <p>The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the soldiers were "wounded following the launch of two rockets by Hezbollah".</p>
        
            <p>"Attacks against UNIFIL are a grave and unacceptable violation of international law and must stop," he said on X.</p>
        
            <p>An Italian foreign ministry spokesman said Rome would await an investigation by UNIFIL.</p>
        
            <p>The force said "two 122mm rockets struck the Sector West Headquarters" in Shamaa, around five kilometres from the Israeli border.</p>
        
            <p>The village has been a battleground between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters for around a week.</p>
        
            <p>The rockets were "likely launched by Hezbollah or affiliated groups", the force said, adding that it was "the third attack on this UNIFIL base in Shamaa in a week".</p>
        
            <p>The four peacekeepers, whose wounds were not life-threatening, were "receiving treatment at the base hospital", it said.</p>
        
            <p>"UNIFIL strongly urges combating parties to avoid fighting next to its positions," it added.</p>
        
            <p>Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli air strike on Friday killed the director of Dar al-Amal hospital in the east of the country near Baalbek and six of his colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>A ministry statement announced the "loss of Dr Ali Rakan Allam, director of Dar al-Amal university hospital, and six colleagues in a cowardly Israeli attack which targeted his residence near the hospital".</p>
        
            <p>It also denounced "continual Israeli aggression against medical staff and facilities".</p>
        
            <p>A statement from Hezbollah said its fighters targeted "a gathering of Israeli enemy troops in Shamaa with a rocket salvo".</p>
        
            <p>Crosetto earlier said two 122mm rockets appeared to have hit a bunker on the base.</p>
        
            <p>The peacekeepers were wounded by shards of glass when windows shattered, Crosetto said in a statement, adding that the rocket fire was "intolerable".</p>
        
            <p>He said he had contacted his Lebanese counterpart "reiterating that the Italian contingent of UNIFIL remains in southern Lebanon to offer a window of opportunity for peace and cannot become hostage to attacks by militias".</p>
        
            <p>"I will try to speak with the new Israeli minister of defence (Israel Katz), which has been impossible since he took office, to ask him to avoid using UNIFIL bases as a shield," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even more intolerable is the presence of terrorists in south Lebanon who are endangering the safety of the blue helmets and the civilian population."</p>
        
            <p>Crosetto later said on X he had been told by Katz that "the IDF (Israeli military) is making every effort to protect UNIFIL forces and positions in the region".</p>
        
            <p>Tasked with monitoring the Blue Line separating Lebanon from Israel, UNIFIL's 10,000 peacekeepers have come under repeated fire during the current Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>
