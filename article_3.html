            <p>"I came to support our Rainbow community.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what we want for Auckland is to celebrate all our diversity no matter who we love."</p>
        
            <p>Woof! organiser Moana McDowell said they were raising money for the SPCA.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the funniest, brightest, most colourful family event.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a competition but it's not about that, it's about people who love dogs coming and having a great time."</p>

            <p>Despite a few protesters trying to disrupt the event with a megaphone, McDowell said they could barely hear them.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a little disruption but it is what it is. The fact people were still willing to come out is fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>She said they were prepared for disruption after recent protests targeting Pride events and had asked police to attend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great for the rainbow community that people are strong in their convictions and don't want to hide away.</p>
        
            <p>"We're safe today and I'm glad people are having a great time."</p>
        
            <p>The winners were set to be announced on Sunday afternoon.</p>
