            <p>A lockdown at Onslow College in Wellington was sparked by a motorcyclist who had a water pistol that was mistaken for a firearm, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a street near the school in the suburb of Johnsonville after a staff member who was on duty at the school's back gate reported seeing a person on a motorbike who they believed was holding a gun.</p>
        
            <p>As a precaution Onslow College went into lockdown with its website posting that it was in lockdown due to an incident outside of the school at 1.52pm.</p>
        
            <p>About half an hour later Onslow College's Facebook page said it was out of lockdown and thanked people for their patience.</p>
        
            <p>The lockdown was lifted after police found a motorbike bike and recovered a water pistol.</p>
        
            <p>Once the lockdown was over Onslow sent an email to parents of children at the college saying all students, staff and persons on-site were safely accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>Another email said that the school worked with police who worked out where the motorbike was and who had been riding it. "The supposed gun was actually an electric water pistol," the email said.</p>
        
            <p>Police say they are speaking with the motorcyclist.</p>
