            <p>Five-time champions Australia battled through to Sunday's final of the 50-over Cricket World Cup against India with a nervy three-wicket win against South Africa in the second semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>Australia laid the foundations for a place in the final after bowling out South Africa for a below-par 212 despite David Miller's defiant 101 at the Eden Gardens.</p>
        
            <p>The chase, however, was not as straightforward as Pat Cummins and his team would have liked.</p>
        
            <p>Man-of-the-match Travis Head (62) led their rollicking start before a mid-innings wobble put Australia in a spot of bother.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa did not let big partnerships bloom but their inadequate total meant Australia eventually prevailed with 16 balls to spare to make the final for the eighth time.</p>
        
            <p>"Nerve-wracking couple of hours but great effort and a great game," said Cummins, who was especially pleased with his side's fielding. "It's something we talk a lot about. It wasn't up to scratch at the start of the tournament."</p>
        
            <p>The chase has not been South Africa's forte in the tournament and Temba Bavuma's decision to bat first under an overcast sky seemed to be a no-brainer.</p>
        
            <p>Bavuma played the match despite not having fully recovered from a hamstring strain and his four-ball duck suggested sitting out would probably have been a wiser decision for him.</p>
        
            <p>Australia ramped up the pressure with their electric fielding and Cummins led by example, taking a brilliant catch to send back the other South African opener Quinton de Kock.</p>
        
            <p>Australia were so dominant that South Africa had to wait until the ninth over for their first boundary and were 18-2 after their 10 powerplay overs.</p>
        
            <p>It soon snowballed into a full-fledged crisis and South Africa slumped to 24-4 in the 12th over.</p>
        
            <p>PLAY INTERRUPTED </p>
        
            <p>Drizzle held up play after 14 overs and when the action resumed Heinrich Klaasen (47) and Miller rebuilt the innings, taking South Africa past the 100 mark in 28 overs.</p>
        
            <p>Klaasen hit Adam Zampa for back-to-back sixes but Australia regained control after part-time spinner Head broke the 95-run stand, claiming two wickets in two balls.</p>
        
            <p>Miller brought up his hundred with a six off Cummins but departed in the same over trying to clear the rope again.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, Australia got off to a flyer, plundering 60 runs from the first 10 overs with Warner smashing four sixes in his 29.</p>
        
            <p>Bavuma introduced spin in the seventh over and the move immediately paid off as Aiden Markram bowled David Warner with his first delivery.</p>
        
            <p>Kagiso Rabada dismissed Mitchell Marsh in the next over but South Africa's catching was rather sloppy and Head was the beneficiary on two occasions either side of his fifty.</p>
        
            <p>Just when Australia appeared to be cruising to a comprehensive victory, South Africa's spinners injected fresh excitement into the contest.</p>
        
            <p>Keshav Maharaj bowled Head through the gate and Tabraiz Shamsi dismissed Marnus Labuschagne and Glenn Maxwell to jolt Australia out of any complacency that might have crept in.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Smith made 30 and Josh Inglis scored 28 but South Africa kept fighting back. However, Cummins and Starc combined to foil the Proteas and get Australia over the line.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite hard to put into words," a dejected Bavuma said. "Our character came through. It was a dog fight.</p>
        
            <p>"The way we started with the bat and the ball was probably the turning point, we lost it quite badly there."</p>
        
            <p>India beat New Zealand in the first semi-final on Wednesday to book their place in the final in Ahmedabad.</p>
