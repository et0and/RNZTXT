            <p>Back in round two, it appeared the losing streak was finally over.</p>
        
            <p>Up by 12 with just two minutes to play, a first Warriors' win over the Storm in 14 games was in the bank.</p>
        
            <p>However, a gravity defying Xavier Coates broke Warriors' hearts and the internet right on the siren with one of the most spectacular finishes in the game's history.</p>

            <p>The Warriors will get their chance to avenge the dramatic loss in Auckland tomorrow night as the table toppers come to town.</p>
        
            <p>The side welcomes back a host of frontliners after a wretched run of injuries, including star halfback Shaun Johnson who has sat out the past three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>His return sees Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad resume fullback duties, but with a fresh perspective after his time in the halves.</p>
        
            <p>"I look at the game a little bit differently now in terms of what I what I'm looking for as a fullback. I haven't been out in the frontline like that for a very long time and to throw the ball around and have a bit of fun with the boys was really exciting for me and those are the things that I want to keep in mind when I move back to fullback."</p>
        
            <p>Nicoll-Klokstad said the club was in high spirits following a difficult period.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing that I've been most happy with is how connected we've stayed throughout that whole process, the rollercoaster. It starts at the head, and our coaches do a really good job making sure that we've stayed connected, stayed together, stayed strong."</p>
        
            <p>He said whether their opposition was sitting first or last on the points table, their approach remained the same.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't matter who we're playing week in week out. We have to make sure that our standards are held high and above where we want to play and I think if we continue to train how we want to play, the results will keep rolling."</p>
        
            <p>Nicoll-Klokstad said the Storm presented a stern challenge and a gauge of where the Waiiors were really at in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"They have held really high standards for a really long time. I think that's the key. They have players that can just break the game wide open and that's what makes them dangerous. So for us, that's about making sure that we prepare as best as we can.</p>
        
            <p>"Standards need to be as high as they have been, and [then we] give ourselves every opportunity to play good footy this weekend."</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old said Johnson's return was a timely one.</p>
        
            <p>"The type of influence that he has around the group and on the paddock as well. These things that only Shaun can do, and for him to be able to come into the side and add to what the boys have been doing, it's going to be really exciting. can't wait to to rub shoulders again."</p>
