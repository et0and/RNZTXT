        <h2>Clean Car Discount scheme ends - but will it slow the EV market?</h2>
        <p>
The Clean Car Discount scheme wraps up today, taking financial incentives for low-emissions vehicles and the so-called "ute-tax" with it.

            <p>The Clean Car Discount scheme wraps up today, taking financial incentives for low-emissions vehicles and the so-called "ute-tax" with it.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme was announced in June 2021, creating fees for the buyers of newly imported combustion engine vehicles, with that money going towards rebates for electric cars or plug-in hybrids.</p>
        
            <p>It was designed to be financially neutral, but when demand for low-emission vehicles outstripped the fees collected, the Labour government rejigged the scheme in May.</p>
        
            <p>Those changes increased fees for higher emitting vehicles - something ute drivers like farmers and tradies were particularly concerned about - and lowered the emissions threshold for eligible vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>National promised it would scrap the rebate and higher fees for high-emissions vehicles in the first 100 days of government if it got into power, and now, it is axing the scheme as of the new year.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party disagrees with cutting the scheme, saying it was foolish to be getting rid of something this effective.</p>
        
            <p>The party's transport spokesperson, Julie Anne Genter, said it had been hugely popular, and increased the range of low-emissions vehicles being brought into the country.</p>
        
            <p>"It created a step-change in the number of low-emissions vehicles and EVs in particular that were coming into New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Genter said New Zealand should be striving to be an international frontrunner in the uptake of low emissions vehicles, and scrapping the scheme would put us behind.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that momentum will slow down, but it won't go back to what it was before we had the policy, so that's a win."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ previously reported car dealerships were slashing their prices in the wake of the announcement of the scheme's demise, but there was no stampede to get in before it ended.</p>
        
            <p>Genter said while it was possible the scheme could re-emerge at a later date, the time to make change was now, with transport as the biggest source of emissions in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"In a few years' time, we won't need a policy like this, because automobile manufacturers are phasing out fossil fuel vehicles as a result of so many countries in the world having policies sending them in that direction."</p>
        
            <p>Automobile Association spokesperson Dylan Thompson said it could be months before we saw the effects of the scheme's cancellation on the car market.</p>
        
            <p>"It was designed to stimulate the market, get people to go out there and incentivise them to purchase electric vehicles or cleaner vehicles, and it's been really successful."</p>
        
            <p>He said it had rapidly increased the number of low-emissions vehicles on our roads, normalised them for buyers, and attracted more manufacturers to the New Zealand market.</p>
        
            <p>Only time would tell if the lack of incentive in the form of rebates would be enough to slow the market.</p>
