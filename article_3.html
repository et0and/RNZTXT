        <h2>The changing sound of politics: The voices of past PMs</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Politicians get a lot of time on the radio. Their voices, tones and accents become incredibly familiar to us. Maybe all too familiar.</p>
        
            <p>Politics is an 'in the moment' thing, often reported without much history or context. This extends to MP's style and presentation, yet political communication today is very different to how it once was.</p>
        
            <p>The speech was often gentler and more formal. As is true today, many were immigrants who brought strong accents with them.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament was not sitting this week, so instead of the usual suspects, here for your interest and comparison, the House has compiled a political busman's holiday - the voices of some of New Zealand's past political leaders.</p>
        
            <p>At the audio link above you can hear:</p>
        
            <p>With thanks to RNZ's longtime radio historian Jim Sullivan, and long-time RNZ scheduler and audio-squirrel Gavin McGinley; and of course Ngā Taonga Kōrero Sound and Vision, who care for New Zealand's Oral and Visual history.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's The House, with insights into Parliament, legislation and issues, is made with funding from Parliament's Office of the Clerk.</p>
