            <p>A woman has been caught with over $5 million worth of methamphetamine in her suitcase at Auckland Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The woman, 27, landed in Auckland on a flight from Vancouver on 30 October, a Customs spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>She was referred to Customs for further questions, and a baggage search by officers found two sealed packages of meth wrapped in towels, totalling 14 kilograms.</p>
        
            <p>That's enough for 700,000 individual doses, worth up to $5.25 million in street value, and has an estimated cost of over $15 million in harm to New Zealand, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Customs Auckland Airport manager, Paul Williams, said it's a case of individuals being targeted and exploited by trans-national criminal syndicates.</p>
        
            <p>"Our message to anyone who thinks this is easy money - don't do it. Don't be a pawn in their game. Your chances of making money balanced against your chances of getting caught mean the risk isn't worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"I commend our front-line officers and support teams, who all played their part to protect our borders."</p>
        
            <p>The woman, who holds a Canadian passport, has been charged with importing methamphetamine, and possessing the drug for supply.</p>
        
            <p>She has been remanded in custody, and will re-appear in court in January.</p>
