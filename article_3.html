            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters has noted New Zealand and China will not always agree, in his opening remarks at today's bilateral meeting with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng in Beijing.</p>
        
            <p>Peters spoke at the Great of Hall of the People, and told Han Zheng that New Zealand had a long history of engagement with China going back to 1972 with Robert Muldoon and Chairman Mao Zedong, and he was delighted to be in China.</p>
        
            <p>Peters then made the point that New Zealand and China will not always agree.</p>
        
            <p>"If everybody always agrees, there is something wrong with the arrangement, somebody is not thinking hard enough."</p>
        
            <p>The meeting comes at a time of heightened tension in New Zealand and Australia over the presence of three Chinese Navy ships conducting exercises in the Tasman sea.</p>

            <p>Acting Prime Minister David Seymour told media on Wednesday, the Chinese had made a "tactical error" by moving through the Tasman Sea.</p>
        
            <p>"Personally I actually think that the Chinese have made a tactical error, because they have alerted the New Zealand public that the world is changing, and that we need to strengthen our defences."</p>
        
            <p>He noted they were allowed to move through the area.</p>
        
            <p>"All I know is that they can legally do this... they are doing what they have a right to do."</p>
        
            <p>He said he believed the government had responded well to the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"If New Zealanders knew what I knew about the actions of the navy and defence force, I think they would be really proud."</p>
        
            <p>The Chinese have stressed that New Zealand and Australia is over-hyping the issue and the ships are in international waters.</p>

            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins said she was aware of rumours the group were being accompanied by a nuclear submarine but could not confirm them.</p>
        
            <p>"While Chinese task groups do occasionally deploy with submarines, I am not aware of any reports indicating that this is the case for this particular task group."</p>
        
            <p>It is likely Peters will seek assurances today from the Chinese as to why they are conducting the exercises and whether there could have been more warnings.</p>
        
            <p>In his opening remarks, Peters also noted New Zealand is keen to be a positive partner with China and stressed he hoped Prime Minister Christopher Luxon would be able to visit China in the near future.</p>
        
            <p>Peters is meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi later tonight (NZT).</p>
