            <p>A 37-year-old man has been charged with the murder of an eight-year-old boy in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to an address in the suburb of Bader about 5.20pm on Sunday afternoon, after reports of a violent altercation.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were taken to hospital - the boy, and two adults who were moderately and seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>The child died last night in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City field crime manager Inspector Darrell Harpur said the man was taken into custody at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police have now launched a homicide investigation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not seeking anyone else in relation to what happened, however will remain in the area as they continue a scene examination and further inquiries," Harpur said.</p>
        
            <p>At the house at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, washing could be seen hanging on the line in the back yard.</p>
        
            <p>A child's bike, barbecue and an old fridge were among items strewn in the front yard.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours said loud music and parties could often be heard coming from the house, with a man doing renovation work nearby saying he had been warned the house was used by a gang.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour said she knew the family but would not comment, saying the family had requested she not say anything.</p>
        
            <p>A furniture removal truck also sat in the driveway of the home.</p>
        
            <p>The man accused is due to appear in court today.</p>
