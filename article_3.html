            <p>Alice Taylor may not have won MasterChef in 2022, but she won the hearts of fans, and the judges' attention. </p>
        
            <p>Competing in the show inspired the 24-year-old to pivot from a planned career in politics to fully embrace her love of baking. </p>
        
            <p>She's now working as a pastry chef at Auckland's Paris Butter and has just released a cookbook - Alice in Cakeland.</p>
        
            <p>Packed with tips and tricks, it has easy, affordable and adaptable recipes for cakes, desserts, biscuits, breads, brioche, crepes, donuts just to name a few.</p>
        
            <p>And rest assured the book does include the recipe for her famous MasterChef ginger cakes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an incredibly delicious cake. I don't really bake it anymore after MasterChef ... [I] kind of lost the enjoyment because there was so much anxiety around making that cake perfect at the time," Taylor told Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>"But of course they're in there and it's a great recipe."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said the book gives readers the building blocks of baking in order to boost confidence in the kitchen and also what they can substitute for different ingredients.</p>
        
            <p>"I really want people to understand, especially from reading this book that, a recipe is a recipe, and you can change that depending on what you have in the pantry or what your palate prefers.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of nervousness around baking in general, can you change a certain ingredient, can't you, what can you swap out.</p>
        
            <p>"But ... there's actually a lot that you can change."</p>
        
            <p>While baking was a chemistry and there were basic rules, she said her book guides people to what can be adjusted.</p>
        
            <p>For example, most of Taylor's cake recipes use a liquid fat and a liquid sugar. That means liquid fat can be melted butter, but it can also be oil.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said she grew up surrounded by incredible food.</p>
        
            <p>"My dad's an amazing cook and then my mum's an amazing baker, so were my grandparents."</p>
        
            <p>"I loved to read, and I remember being really young and always reading cookbooks. From age five, they were the books I was really obsessed with.</p>
        
            <p>She would not read many books for children, only cookbooks, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Working as a chef may also seem quite a different path from her master's degree in politics, where she specialised in Taiwanese foreign policy.</p>
        
            <p>"My degree and my career as a chef and a food writer very much help each other," said Taylor.
