            <p>Less than a third of people believe the country is in a better shape than it was before the election, while 40 percent believe it is worse, according to a new poll.</p>
        
            <p>The 1News-Verian poll asked voters: "A year on from the election, do you think the country is in a better shape or worse shape or no different than it was before the election?"</p>
        
            <p>Some 30 percent said the country was in a better shape, 40 percent believed it was in a worse shape and 26 percent did not think there was a difference; 4 percent said they did not know or preferred not to say.</p>
        
            <p>The poll surveyed 1000 eligible voters between 5 and 9 October.</p>
        
            <p>Approximately half the voters were asked the question in a different order: "Do you think the country is in a worse shape or better shape or no different than it was before the election?"</p>
        
            <p>Further results from the 1News-Verian poll, including party vote and preferred prime minister, will be revealed on 1News at Six on Monday night.</p>
