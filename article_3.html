            <p>A Christchurch school performance of Stairway to Heaven has wowed the crowd so much it led to a flood of requests for the footage, and has now been viewed more than 150,000 times.</p>
        
            <p>St Andrew's College included the classic Led Zeppelin rock song as part of a prizegiving ceremony on 26 November, with about 3500 people in the audience watching.</p>
        
            <p>The school said it "became the canvas for a showcase of the extraordinary talent within our school community", and the video was compiled "in response to high demand".</p>
        
            <p>"The 100 performers on stage poured their hearts into the performance, leaving the audience in absolute awe. The standing ovation from many parents echoed the sentiment-truly a performance to remember," a school spokesperson said on its Facebook page.</p>

            <p>In a later post, the school thanked those who had shared the video, and said its success was down to "the exceptional talent within our team of staff and students".</p>
        
            <p>"We feel incredibly fortunate to have such a dedicated and skilled group, and we thank you once again for acknowledging and directing credit where it truly belongs."</p>
