            <p>New Zealand coach Scott Robertson was philosophical in defeat but admitted there would be tough questions back home after the All Blacks lost 18-12 to South Africa to see their Rugby Championship hopes disappear in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>It is a fourth loss in a row to the world champions and a third defeat in four tests in this year's southern hemisphere competition, a tough start to his tenure for Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a hell of a test match, congratulations to South Africa, they know how to get it done," Robertson told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"We created enough opportunities but did not finish them. The best of us is finishing what we create, but there are small margins in test rugby."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand led by 10 points with 12 minutes to go in their 31-27 loss last weekend at Ellis Park, and again held the advantage into the second half but allowed the Springboks to score two tries, while flyhalf Damian McKenzie missed a couple of crucial kicks.</p>
        
            <p>"I am pleased where we are. The last few weeks have been exceptional with some great performances, some players went really deep," Robertson said.</p>

            <p>"Our breakdown tonight was phenomenal. A lot of big games are won on those small margins off the boot.</p>
        
            <p>"There was so much good, but test matches are about finishing on top and finding a way to do it. We need to learn from that."</p>
        
            <p>But Robertson said he expected there would be questions around the team when they arrived back in New Zealand, given the exceptionally high standards they had set for decades.</p>
        
            <p>"Our duty demands that we win those games. We care very deeply about the jersey and we have to win," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be frank and honest around it (the team's results), that is the way to approach it."</p>
        
            <p>Captain Scott Barrett feels their two fixtures in South Africa were missed opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"We are on the wrong side of it for a second time and that is disappointing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to regroup, there will be a lot of discomfort heading into the bye week. We have to be better."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have two Rugby Championship fixtures remaining against Australia but cannot catch South Africa at the top of the table having fallen 11 points behind their great rivals.</p>
