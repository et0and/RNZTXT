        <h2>Fullers ferry to keep fares unchanged</h2>
        <p>
Fullers360 will not change prices for now as a new player enters the Waiheke-Auckland city route. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Auckland ferry operator Fullers360 will not have its fares regulated on the Waiheke route.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi has been reviewing the exemption granted to Fullers360, which allows it to operate outside Auckland Transport's control.</p>
        
            <p>That means Fullers can set its own fares, which has upset locals who use it as a public transport service.</p>
        
            <p>A report for the transport agency has found the company does not generate super profits, and has a normal commercial approach.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Central MP Chl√∂e Swarbrick blasted what she called the report's "inexcusable, circular, bureaucratic logic" and criticised the "extraordinarily expensive" prices Fullers charges Waiheke commuters.</p>
        
            <p>Fullers360 chief executive Mike Horne told Checkpoint the report was overdue, but welcome.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really good that actually we have a level of certainty now. It's probably been ... 18 months of intense work, and we've been in this space for at least four years."</p>
        
            <p>"I think it gives quite a bit more information certainty to a whole range of stakeholder groups."</p>

            <p>He said "millions" of tourists visit Waiheke, and there were different prices for different groups.</p>
        
            <p>As for daily commuters from Waiheke into the city, "they actually have access to Auckland [AT] Hop level pricing, which is about $10 each way".</p>
        
            <p>He said the report showed that there was "plenty of choice and pricing points".</p>
        
            <p>Going by "facts" and not the "emotional, political position", Horne said the report talked about exempt services as opposed to specifically Fullers been granted an exempt service.</p>
        
            <p>"So what that means is where other competitors are now on that route, while there are exemptions there, they can then compete on that route as well. So it's a highly competitive piece of waterway."</p>
        
            <p>He said the company was making good gains in building up its workforce from around the globe.</p>
        
            <p>A new provider, Island Direct begins its Waiheke service on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of talk about price wars. There's nothing like that at all. As I said, we've got multiple price points for multiple people, and you can choose which service and which price point you want," Horne said.</p>
        
            <p>"We won't be changing our approach at all at this point. It's working well."</p>
