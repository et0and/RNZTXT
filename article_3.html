            <p>Six people have been hospitalised following a multi-vehicle crash in Auckland's Dairy Flat.</p>
        
            <p>The crash, which involved three vehicles, occurred on the Northern Motorway, heading north, shortly after 2pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said of the six injured, four were in a serious condition, one was moderate, and another suffered minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial indications suggest there have been critical injuries," police said earlier in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Footage of the scene on social media showed multiple police cars, ambulances, fire trucks and a helicopter.</p>

            <p>Hato Hone St John Ambulance said nine vehicles responded to the accident - five ambulances, two rapid response units and two operations managers.</p>
        
            <p>The road was closed northbound between Oteha Valley Road and Silverdale until about 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said motorists could expect northbound delays to ease.</p>
        
            <p>At 6pm, NZTA webcams showed northbound traffic backed up as far as Wairau Valley.</p>
        
            <p>Northern Emergency Services Trust helicopter spokesperson Steve Macmillan said one of his organisation's helicopters was on its way back from taking a patient from the Bay of Islands to Auckland Hospital when it was contacted about the crash.</p>
        
            <p>He said the pilot found a gap in the clouds and landed in a paddock near the motorway.</p>
        
            <p>Two paramadics on board helped with the injured but the helicopter did not take any patients to hospital and has returned to Whangarei, he said.</p>
