            <p>Warning: This story contains mention of a potential suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The personal trainer for Phillip Polkinghorne and Pauline Hanna says Hanna suspected her husband had a girlfriend.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne, 71, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife Pauline Hanna in 2021 and staging her death to look like a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Payne, the couple's personal trainer for many years, told the High Court in Auckland he had been training Polkinghorne for about 15 years and Hanna for eight years.</p>
        
            <p>The couple didn't train together - but that wasn't unusual for couples, Payne said.</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes Payne would train the couple one after the other and said they generally seemed "quite fond of each other".</p>
        
            <p>"Pauline and I were good friends, but we didn't talk much about her personal life, mainly more small talk."</p>
        
            <p>Payne said there was one time Hanna mentioned she thought her husband had a girlfriend, but he ignored it not wanting to get involved in their personal life.</p>
        
            <p>Payne said Polkinghorne called him on Easter Monday 2021, which he thought was strange as he normally texted.</p>
        
            <p>"When I answered, he said: 'She's gone, she's dead.' Phillip sounded pretty distraught.</p>
        
            <p>"I was stunned and didn't know how to respond - I asked what had happened and he just said she's gone."</p>
        
            <p>Payne noted that he believed Polkinghorne had sounded "heartbroken" on the phone call.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutor Pip McNabb, asked Payne about Hanna's mood during their sessions and he mentioned her mum had died recently but she "seemed to be handling it okay".</p>
        
            <p>"She could be a little moody or grumpy at times but I never saw her breaking down unhappy, no".</p>
        
            <p>During cross-examination by Defence lawyer Ron Mansfield, Payne said Hanna had been "working hard" on her Covid-19 work and often had to rush away to take phone calls.</p>
        
            <p>"She did look quite stressed...run down I would say".</p>
        
            <p>In terms of Polkinghorne's drug use, Payne said he didn't see any signs of it and hadn't suspected anything. The Crown has previously said Polkinghorne was a heavy meth user.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike the family friend who took the stand on tuesday, Stephen MacIntyre, Payne said he did not notice a behavioural change.</p>
        
            <p>He was not manic, didn't "turn into a weirdo" and was not erratic, Payne said.</p>
        
            <p>After Hanna's death, Polkinghorne and his girlfriend Madison Ashton, travelled to the South Island to stay at Mt Cook Lakeside retreat.</p>
        
            <p>Ashton is an Australian sex worker.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Lisa Jane Anderson, was involved with a police raid at the property on 30 April, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Police were there to seize Asthon's phones.</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the phones had been pin protected, and Ashton declined to give the pin numbers.</p>
