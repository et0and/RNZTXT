            <p>Following a gutsy win over the Newcastle Knights at home, the Warriors hold their heads high as they hit the road over to Australia for the second time this season.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend they try to make it three wins on the trot coming up against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, in what will be a real test of character to see if the Warriors can rediscover their away form from last season.</p>
        
            <p>Latrell Mitchell and the men in green and red should never be taken lightly though. After a horrible start to their season that's seen them sitting second to bottom of the table, they appear to be mounting a comeback, notching up their first win against the Bulldogs last weekend. They'll be looking to get one up over the Warriors to get their season back on track.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Kolkstad 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Rocco Berry 4. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Te Maire Martin 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Mitchell Barnett 11. Jackson Ford 12. Marata Niukore 13. Tohu Harris (c)</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Freddy Lussick 15. Tom Ale 16. Bunty Afoa 17. Jazz Tevaga</p>
        
            <p>Rabbitohs: 1. Latrell Mitchell 2. Izaac Thompson 3. Jack Wighton 4. Isaiah Tass 5. Taane Milne 6. Cody Walker 7. Dean Hawkins 8. Tevita Tatola 9. Damien Cook 10. Thomas Burgess 11. Keaon Koloamatangi 12. Jacob Host 13. Cameron Murray (c)</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Michael Chee Kam 15. Tallis Duncan 16. Sean Keppie 17. Davvy Moale</p>

            <p>The Warriors head into round five in a strong yet precarious position for multiple reasons. Firstly there's the dilemma of the five eighth position. Recently re-signed half Luke Metcalf will be sidelined for some time after fracturing his leg against the Knights, leaving two serious options: Chanel Harris-Tavita AKA Mr Fix It, who came off the bench last week putting on a man of the match performance. Or the slightly more experienced option of Te Maire Martin, who's been playing reserve grade footy, waiting for the big call up to back to first grade.</p>
        
            <p>Secondly the big question on everyone's minds is finally put to rest as we see Kiwi Star Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad make his long awaited return to the Warriors number one jersey, resulting in the reshuffle of man of the moment Roger Tuivasa-Sheck back to centre for his 200th NRL game.</p>

            <p>The South Sydney Rabbitohs, who released weeks of increasing strain with a breakthrough victory last week on Good Friday, will be trying to sustain their positive fortune by winning two consecutive games for the first time since May of last year. Coach Jason Demetriou made just minor adjustments to the team that defeated the Bulldogs 20-16. Izaac Thompson is named to start on the wing in the absence of superstar Alex Johnson (hamstring), while Sean Keppie was given an opportunity to return to first grade with Shaq Mitchell out with concussion. With 14 victories out of 15 meetings against the Warriors since 2013, the team has a fearsome record. This will also mark second-rower Jacob Host's 50th club game.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 6 - 28 Rabbitohs</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors only faced off against the South Sydney franchise once last year in a night to forget at Mt Smart where they uncharacteristically went down 6-28 to the Rabbitohs. It was a short sharp wake-up call that the Warriors received loud and clear as they went on a crucial seven-match winning streak. However, the Rabbitohs went in a completely different direction and ended up missing the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will seriously be looking to right the wrongs of last season's loss to the Rabbitohs in what was the one of only two blow-outs of their otherwise stellar season. There's no time like now to strike when the Rabbitohs are wounded from one of their worst starts to an NRL season in recent history, but as mentioned time and time again they are not a team to be taken lightly. It could be another tight game on the cards but if the Warriors can control possession and stick to their systems and processes, we could be in for a bit of a show.</p>
