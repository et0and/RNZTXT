        <h2>Auckland Zoo Sumatran tiger cub turns one after recent tragedies</h2>

            <p>Blood and milk ice blocks are not everyone's idea of a birthday treat, but Auckland Zoo says it is just the ticket for its tiger cub Cahya.</p>
        
            <p>Sumatran tiger cub Cahya turned one on Thursday, and in a post on Facebook, carnivore keeper Kristin said Cahya is a mini-me of her mother Zayana.</p>
        
            <p>"Now a year old, Cahya is becoming more independent and sassy," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Cahya is one of two siblings born on 2 January last year, but the other had to be euthanised after a head injury on 30 January.</p>
        
            <p>The four-week-old cub had sustained the injury after a tumble while exploring his habitat, Auckland Zoo said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2023, Zayana also gave birth to two cubs, but one of them died during delivery. Left with only one offspring, the tiger killed the cub in an instinctual attack.</p>

            <p>Kristin said Cahya has started to take her cue with "chatting" when she sees the keepers.</p>
        
            <p>Cahya was also an "absolute superstar" with her voluntary healthcare training, she said, where the keepers train to be able to weigh her and take blood draws if needed in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Cahya weighs almost 60 kilograms, and is still growing, but she said Cahya looks so much like her mum Zayana it is getting trickier to tell them apart.</p>
        
            <p>She enjoys playing and wrestling with her mum Zayana, and to swim and play in the pool when big cat appropriate toys are provided by its carnivore team.</p>
        
            <p>Watermelon is also on the menu for Cahya's birthday celebration.</p>
