            <p>The Wellington Phoenix women stretched their unbeaten run to three matches after coming from a goal down to draw 1-1 with the Melbourne Victory in their sixth round A-League match.</p>
        
            <p>Young Wellington substitute Manaia Elliott scored the equaliser in the 90th minute after the hosts had taken the lead from the penalty spot early in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix head coach Paul Temple was thrilled with the performance and the result, which gave them their first ever point in the state of Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a gameplan and the women were brilliant," Temple said. "I asked them to defend in a certain way to create some counter-attacking opportunities and nullify some of their threats.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew that at some point in the game, if we stayed in it for long enough, that we would have some really good impact off the bench, some fresh energy and we could take it to them and see if we could get something.</p>
        
            <p>"In the end that plan worked well and we came away with a point, and arguably could have taken all three. We created some good chances in that last 20 minutes to win the game, but we're pretty happy with a point."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington remain eighth on the ladder, but are now just a point outside the top six and Temple said the result would give them a lot of confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight was a real shift in terms of the direction we want to take. We got in that position quite a number of times last season when we were one-nil down away from home and the games sort of unravelled and we couldn't find a way back.</p>
        
            <p>"For us to stay in the game, show the character to hold on and then to probably be the best team for the last 15 minutes, push to get something from the game and get our reward is huge growth for us."</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix had less than a third of the possession in the first half but did well defensively, and goalkeeper Carolina Vilão pulled off a number of impressive saves throughout the game.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts ended the stalemate five minutes into the second half when they took advantage of a penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Temple made his final substitution in the 83rd minute, bringing on winger Elliott in place of centre back Alivia Kelly.</p>
        
            <p>The change in formation had its desired effect, with Wellington looking the more dangerous of the two sides for the remainder of the match.</p>
        
            <p>Combining for the equaliser in the final minute of normal time - Emma Main delivered a pinpoint right-wing cross that Elliott met with a thumping header that Victory keeper Courtney Newbon was powerless to stop.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix will turn their attention to next Saturday's match against reigning champions Sydney FC at Porirua Park.</p>
