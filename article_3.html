            <p>Their victory marks the end of Te Matatini o Kāhui Maunga, where a record 55 teams took to the stage making it the biggest festival to date.</p>
        
            <p>Second place went to from Ngāti Rangiwēwehi - also from Te Arawa - while third went to Ngā Tumanako from Tāmaki Makaurau.</p>

            <p>Ngāti Whakaue leader Te Ngāwari Wright said she was is in shock and had not yet found the words to describe the victory.</p>
        
            <p>She said the biggest difference between this performance and the groups second equal placement at the last festival in Auckland was a cohesive theme.</p>
        
            <p>"Ko tetahi āhuatanga i panoni pea mai i tērā atu Matatini ko te whakakotahi i ngā whakaaro ki tetahi kaupapa, nā ko te kaupapa ko te aroha, nō muri mai i te matenga o tō tātau koroua."</p>
        
            <p>"One thing that we changed from the last Matatini was to bring our ideas together into a cohesive theme, that is love. After the passing of our elder."</p>

            <p>Her fellow leader Cori Marsters said the group achieved their goal of living up to the legacy left by the late Sir Bom Gillies.</p>
        
            <p>"I tutuki tērā taha o mātau, te kawea mai i ā Koro Bom ki kōnei, ko tāna ōhākī 'kia mau ki te aroha."</p>
        
            <p>"We achieved that, bringing Koro Bom here, his parting wish to us was to 'kia mau ki te aroha."</p>

            <p>In a statement, Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka said the pinnacle of Māori performing arts was on full display at Te Matatini o Kāhui Maunga on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"[Te Kapa Haka o Ngāti Whakaue] were one of those groups who just took to the stage and made it their own.</p>
        
            <p>"Their uniqueness, their wairua Māori, shone throughout their performance and that was a poignant point of difference.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard a beautiful expression that stuck with me earlier this week: 'The waiata goes into my ears and out my eyes'.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing the passion in their performance and being part of that sold-out crowd was an awesome feeling."</p>

            <p>Potaka said it was the culmination of the biggest Te Matatini ever seen, with 55 rōpū performing with Te Mahau under the watch of Te Kāhui Maunga.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen whānau lining up for hours in the mornings to get the best spots.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen Ōpotiki Mai Tawhiti give an emotional tribute to their lost loved ones including former leader Ricky Mitai.</p>
        
            <p>"And we've seen those just at the start of their reo journey; they might not understand all the kupu yet but they can feel it and know they're resonating with something magic."</p>
        
            <p>That was why the government had made the largest ever investment in Te Matatini at the last Budget, Potaka added, with $48.7 million over three years.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make sure that this event can continue to grow and thrive."</p>

            <p>The new Kohine Ponika "People's Choice" award has also seen spectators surging to the Te Matatini app for vote their favourite kapa.</p>
        
            <p>The inaugural winners are Te Kuru Marutea from Te Tauihu, whose Waiata ā Tira wowed crowds enough to push them to being top pick for People's Choice.</p>
        
            <p>Naia Awatea is a member of the group and told RNZ winning the award would be particularly special for them because kapa from the South Island often go under the radar at Te Matatini.</p>
        
            <p>"It's overwhelming but, at the same time, it's a huge change for us from Te Waipounamu and the standard that everybody naturally has for us. This is a huge step for us and it's so exciting. I'm just so proud of our kapa for finally - in the most humble way - making our mark," Awatea said.</p>
        
            <p>"We try our best to put it all out on the stages, to make it to these big stages [but] the majority of the time we go unnoticed because of where we're - that's just being real.</p>
        
            <p>"So to be here and be recognised for our efforts is fufilling."</p>
