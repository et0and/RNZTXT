            <p>A pro-Palestinian protester says up to nine people have been arrested at a demonstration at Ports of Auckland this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>About 200 people blocked the entry and exit into the port and one of the protesters says several were pepper sprayed by the police.</p>
        
            <p>Lillian Murray says about 40 officers were there.</p>
        
            <p>The group are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and want a boycott of shipments to and from Israel.</p>
        
            <p>The police have been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The protest lasted for four hours, ending at six this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Watch some video from this afternoon's protest. </p>
        
            <p>Protesters were also asking workers to go on strike as a show of support for Palestinians.</p>
        
            <p>Some port workers tooted their horns in support of the protesters. Others watched while the protesters tried to enlist their support.</p>
        
            <p>A truck driver waiting in the carpark said he had been held up for three hours while trying to bring his truck into the port. He said many other trucks had also had their movements held up.</p>
