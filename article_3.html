            <p>A kindergarten teacher opposite the scene of an unexplained death in Northland said it's business as usual for the early childhood centre.</p>
        
            <p>It follows police investigating the unexplained death of a man outside a property in Albemarle Road on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police are advising residents in the area that they can expect to see a large number of officers at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard said police were treating the death as unexplained and a scene examination was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"Members of the Northland community can expect to see a high volume of police staff in the area as these enquiries continue," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third sudden death to be reported in Wellington on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Heather McRobbie from Childspace said there were up to eight officers at the property yesterday when she left work for the day at around 4pm.</p>

            <p>"I saw a lot of police people up and down the street and there was a forensics van apparently, detectives... the police said that we were safe so I guess I'll take their word for it," McRobbie said.</p>
        
            <p>She said she also witnessed police officers in blue forensics suits and a white tent on the property while police investigated.</p>
        
            <p>"I was thinking it looks like something bad has happened," McRobbie said.</p>
        
            <p>After reassurance from police she said she's not concerned.</p>

            <p>Another resident who also recently moved to Albemarle Road said he was reassured that he was safe with the police presence in the neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>A mother who lives opposite the property said when she arrived home yesterday at around 4pm she also saw around 15 police officers.</p>
        
            <p>She said the street was usually quiet and there was never any drama.</p>
