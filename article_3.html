            <p>The Crown Observer to Wellington City Council has been named as Lindsay McKenzie.</p>
        
            <p>He will start on Wednesday, concluding his term on 31 July next year.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council had been facing "significant challenges" in delivering services to its community, local government minister Simeon Brown said, while balancing its debt and insurance obligations.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to appoint a Crown Observer was not one that I took lightly, however, my assessment is that the financial and behavioural challenges facing the council represent a significant problem.</p>
        
            <p>"I have decided a Crown Observer is necessary to better enable Wellington City Council to address their problems and allow me to monitor their progress in doing so."</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie was the former CEO of Tasman District Council and Gisborne District Council.</p>
        
            <p>He had significant governance and senior leadership experience in local government, Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"When Invercargill City Council was facing governance issues, Mr McKenzie was called upon as an external appointee to support its governance performance improvement programme.</p>
        
            <p>"He also has strong financial acumen, which is reflected in his current appointment as an independent member of the Nelson City Council audit, risk and finance committee."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau earlier said her council would work collaboratively with the government after it decided to appoint a Crown Observer.</p>
