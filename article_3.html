        <h2>Treaty Principles Bill hīkoi begins in Far North</h2>
        <p>
The hīkoi will gather supporters from throughout Aotearoa over the next nine days, before arriving at Parliament in a display of unity.
</p>
        
            <p>A national hīkoi across the motu begins on Sunday, in the small Far North town of Te Kāo. Supporters are gathering at Pōtahi Marae, before setting out on the first leg of the long journey south, on Monday 11 November.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers from Bluff at the far end of the South Island are also travelling toward Wellington to join the North Island group.</p>
        
            <p>On 19 November, the hīkoi is planned to arrive on Parliament grounds, having [gathered supporters from the very top and https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/532355/hikoi-mo-te-tiriti-south-island-to-join-nationwide-hikoi-to-parliament bottom of New Zealand] through the nine-day journey.</p>
        
            <p>Toitū te Tiriti organiser Eru Kapa-Kingi told RNZ the hīkoi was as much about Māori unity as it was opposition to government policy - in particular, the Treaty Principles Bill, which had been expected to be tabled at Parliament on 18 November, the day before the hīkoi was set to arrive.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Bill was tabled earlier than expected, on 7 November, a move many Māori leaders labelled an attempt to undermine the the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>
The hīkoi against the proposed Bill is going ahead as planned, despite the Bill's earlier introduction to Parliament.

            <p>In a statement posted to the Toitū te Tiriti Instagram page, Kapa-Kingi said no changes would be made to the planned hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>"We always knew a shuffle like this would come along, this is not unexpected from this coalition, they have shown us who they are for the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"However this timing change does not matter, our kaupapa could never be, and will not be overshadowed. In fact, this just gives us more kaha (strength) to get on our whenua and march for our mokopuna. Bills come and go, but Te Tiriti is infinite, and so are we; our plans will not change. Kia kaha tātou."</p>
        
            <p>Police have warned that some disruption are likely on roads and highways, as the hīkoi passes through.</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent Kelly Ryan said police will keep Waka Kotahi and local councils updated about the roads, so drivers in each area can find updates. She recommended travellers "plan accordingly".</p>
        
            <p>Police have also been in contact with the hīkoi organisers, she said: "Our discussions with organisers to date have been positive and we expect the hīkoi to be conducted in a peaceful and lawful manner.</p>
        
            <p>"We've planned for large numbers to join the hīkoi, with disruption likely to some roads, including highways and main streets along the route."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi said it would also be monitoring the impact of the hīkoi on highways, and will provide real-time updates on any delays or disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>A police Major Operations Centre has been set up at the Wellington national headquarters, to oversee the response to the hīkoi in each area, Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to co-ordinate with iwi leaders and our partners across government to ensure public safety and minimal disruption to people going about their daily routine."</p>
