            <p>A dozen inmates at Waikeria Prison in Waikato will be charged with misconduct, after being found to have consumed homebrew on Christmas Eve.</p>
        
            <p>The prison's general manager Jim Watson said 10 prisoners have been placed in segregation, and another two have been moved to another prison.</p>
        
            <p>He said the unit involved was temporarily locked down to deal with the incident, but there were no injuries to staff or prisoners.</p>
        
            <p>Watson said the behaviour is unacceptable, and that they will continue to carry out regular searches.</p>
        
            <p>Homebrew can be made using rotting fruit, water, sugar and a plastic bag.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections said while they restrict the amount of fruit prisoners can purchase, some will go to great lengths to stockpile fruit for making home brew.</p>
