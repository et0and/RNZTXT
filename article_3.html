            <p>LeBron James and his son Bronny became the first father-son duo to play together in a regular season NBA game as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Minnesota Timberwolves in their season opener.</p>
        
            <p>The sold-out crowd let out a roar when 20-year-old Bronny checked into the game alongside LeBron, who was re-entering the game with four minutes to play in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>Bronny, who like many first-year players is not expected to see significant floor time this season, grabbed a rebound in his three minutes of action while LeBron contributed 16 points in the Lakers' 110-103 win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always been family over everything," LeBron said alongside Bronny after the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I lost a lot of time because of this league ... so to be able to have this moment where I am working still and I can work alongside my son, it's one of the greatest gifts I've ever got from the man above and I'm going to take full advantage of it."</p>
        
            <p>No father-son duo has ever played during the same NBA season, let alone on the same team. The pair appeared together during a preseason game earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>LeBron, 39, had long said one of his remaining goals in basketball was to play with his son, a guard who was selected with the 55th pick of the NBA Draft in June after one season at the University of Southern California.</p>
        
            <p>LeBron, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, a four-time champion and three-time Olympic gold medallist, is now in his 22nd NBA season and has yet to say when he plans to call time on his career.</p>
        
            <p>Bronny, meanwhile, is looking to make a name for himself in the league he has grown up around with a father who has also played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat.</p>
        
            <p>"Going up to the scorer's table and checking in for the first time was a crazy moment I will never forget," Bronny said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just extremely grateful for everything. I was given an amazing opportunity to come into this league and get better every day and learn every day."</p>
        
            <p>LeBron said he reminds his eldest son how fortunate they are to play in the NBA.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not promised every day that you get to play in this beautiful league," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's only 450 of us and you have to understand it's not given to you, you have to earn every moment. I think he knows that and he looks forward to the process of getting better every single day to be the player he ultimately wants to be.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super proud of him. He's my lifeline, that's for sure."</p>
        
            <p>In attendance at the game was another sporting father-son duo in Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., who played together on Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. The pair memorably hit back-to-back home runs in a game in September 1990.</p>
        
            <p>LeBron and Bronny warmly welcomed the Griffeys at midcourt ahead of the game before posing for photos.</p>
