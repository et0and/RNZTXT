            <p>In her new position of minister for economic growth, Nicola Willis, says driving up tourism numbers is top priority.</p>
        
            <p>Willis, who is also the finance minister, told Morning Report her new role will look at how to grow the economy so New Zealand is an attractive place to live in the future.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as inflation is heading into more manageable territory, but GDP was still in the negatives when it was last updated in December.</p>
        
            <p>To make New Zealand a more attractive place to invest, Willis said rules and regulations would need to be reformed.</p>
        
            <p>In the short term this included driving up tourism numbers, which would include ensuring the visa process to visit the country was as fast as possible - something Willis said she was in contact with the minister of immigration, Erica Stanford, about.</p>
        
            <p>Driving up tourist numbers would also include looking at how New Zealand was working with international airlines, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want people with wealth, with skills for our software and gaming industry to come to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to welcome them - we need to bring in that money, get dollars circulating in our economy.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not get rich by selling to ourselves."</p>
        
            <p>When asked, Willis noted her new role had previously been held by Melissa Lee, under the title of economic development.</p>
        
            <p>Lee was demoted from cabinet in April last year and sacked from her remaining ministerial roles last week during a reshuffle.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had asked Willis personally to take on the responsibility of the portfolio, Willis said.</p>
