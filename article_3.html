            <p>The Education Minister has slammed her ministry for "very poor communication" over the situation with a teaching block at Wellington Girls' College.</p>
        
            <p>The school learnt late in April that its biggest teaching building, Brook Block, was structurally weak on top and lacked earthquake resilience.</p>
        
            <p>Until prefabs were up and running, likely to be mid-September, each year group would have between two and five days at home.</p>
        
            <p>Students set set up a makeshift classroom on Parliament grounds in protest on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Erica Stanford told Morning Report the education ministry's handling of this was "just another example of very poor communication".</p>
        
            <p>"Its always concerning when the Ministry of Education don't communicate well, certainly in situations like this."</p>
        
            <p>"My portfolio now and we're under new management and I've made my expectations very crystal clear that we will have good and timely information and we will be open and transparent."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said she believed the latest report had been share quickly with the school and the ministry was now working "at pace" to help find a solution.</p>
        
            <p>Initially prefab classrooms would be brought in to allow all students back to school, a long-term solution would be decided on by 26 August, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've told the Ministry my expectations are that we move at pace on this and make sure that learning is disrupted for only a minimal amount of time."</p>
        
            <p>School principal Julia Davidson said the students were "fantastic" with their protest at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report the students wanted to do something positive and make their point.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they were fantastic.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they had a really nice day, the weather helped of course, but they actually did their work down there, there were lots of teachers down there helping them."</p>
        
            <p>For the students studying from home it was a lot different than during Covid-19 lockdowns, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like normal day, but you're just at home in front of your computer... much more structured than lock down, quite different."</p>
