            <p>Auckland ferry commuters are frustrated at a recent spate of delays and cancellations and worry the problem will worsen as cruise season peaks.</p>
        
            <p>Close to 100 ferry sailings were cancelled or delayed in the city in December, due to cruise ships arriving or departing Princess Wharf.</p>
        
            <p>It has been one of the busiest cruise ship seasons in recent years, and arrivals are yet to peak.</p>
        
            <p>And as more people return to work, commuters are worried the problem will continue to get worse.</p>
        
            <p>Ports of Auckland said ferries were restricted from moving through the downtown ferry basin while cruise ships were arriving or departing from Princess Wharf.</p>
        
            <p>There are exclusion windows for cruise ships, where they cannot move through the harbour, at weekday peak times between 6.30am and 9.05am, and 4.30pm and 6.05pm.</p>
        
            <p>But, a total of 98 sailings all around Auckland were still cancelled or delayed during December.</p>
        
            <p>The most affected run was to and from Devonport, with 81 sailings cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Waiheke ferries are not included in the numbers from Auckland Transport, but were also delayed.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Mojiel catches the 6am ferry from Devonport to his job at Auckland Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>That ferry sailing falls outside the morning period where cruise ships are banned from sailing through the harbour, and is often cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when an organisation is offering a public service, and you then can't rely on it and can't depend on it, such as me and a lot of other people are finding, it's a big problem," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's annoying, it's really frustrating."</p>
        
            <p>Since December, RNZ has added up more than 20 further sailings cancelled or delayed.</p>
        
            <p>That's a worry for ferry commuters, who are tired of cruise disruption.</p>
        
            <p>Commuters were being treated shoddily by Auckland Transport, Mojiel said, and the problem had worsened over the past three years.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever cruise ships require, seems to be what happens [...] tourists are being given preferential treatment over commuters."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport public transport manager Rachel Cara disagreed that cruise ships were being put first.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think that's the case, it's more that there's a balancing act of multiple parties wanting to use the same area within downtown."</p>
        
            <p>The ferry cancellations were a safety issue, as engine thrusters used by cruise ships caused underwater currents that were hazardous to ferries, Cara said.</p>
        
            <p>North Shore ward councillor Chris Darby said he constantly heard from residents about the cancelled ferries.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have several hundred passengers lining up for the Waiheke ferry, the Devonport ferry, the Birkenhead ferry, and all the other ferry services, and they're listening to the [speaker] saying nothing's moving out of here for another hour, in temperatures of 27 degrees, the blood boils."</p>
        
            <p>Darby has been working on extending the no-movement window for cruise ships since 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He said the current proposal, to come into force by the start of the next cruise ship season in August, would extend the afternoon exclusion window by one hour - this does not help morning commuters like Mojiel.</p>
        
            <p>Darby said this was not enough, and that he would like the morning window extended, too.</p>

            <p>He raised doubts about the economic benefit of cruise ships to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We overestimate the value of cruise, and we underestimate the economic impact of commuter ferry services and the number of people that are reliant on that," Darby said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not convinced of the so-called 'great value' of cruise tourism.</p>
        
            <p>"We should be defining cruise tourism in Aotearoa, not just accepting what turns up, tie it up, take the fee."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cruise Association executive director Jacqui Lloyd said Auckland was an essential stop for cruise ships, as it was where many passengers joined the cruise.</p>
        
            <p>She said 120 cruise ships were expected to visit Auckland between October and April, bringing economic benefit to the city.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only does that help in regards to visitor spend in retail, hospitality, and tourism operators, but also it's a significant benefit to accommodation providers, the airport, and other services around the Auckland region."</p>
        
            <p>Lloyd could not comment on the cancelled ferries, but suggested a purpose-built wharf for cruise ships with walk-on and off capacity would support the future growth of cruises in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly that's one thing we should strongly advocate going forward," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Cara, from AT, said it would be supportive of infrastructure development that relocated cruise ships from the ferry basin into purpose-built facilities - but could not confirm whether any plans were in the works.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ports of Auckland said: "POAL has identified the need for more cruise ship infrastructure and has factored this into its long-term planning."</p>
        
            <p>Darby was adamant that cruises could not continue as it was.</p>
        
            <p>"The long-term future for cruise is not in the ferry basin. It can't be in Princess East, and it can't really be even on Queens East," he said.</p>
