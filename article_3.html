            <p>An elderly man who was found near the scene of a car driving into pedestrians at a bus stop in East Auckland has died.</p>
        
            <p>Half Moon Bay residents were in shock after the incident on Prince Regent Street when a car swerved off the road and rammed into a woman on 10 December.</p>
        
            <p>Five people were hospitalised at the time of the incident, including the elderly man.</p>
        
            <p>Police said officers had been working to establish the nature of his involvement but he died in hospital on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The man's death is being treated as unexplained and further enquiries needed to be carried out, which would include a post mortem examination, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were not in a position to formally release any further details about the man.</p>
        
            <p>All other victims have now been released from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A man, 22, is facing numerous charges in relation to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>But police were asking any witnesses to get in touch if they had not already done so.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public can contact police by calling 105 or going online to using Update My Report and referencing file number 231210/5003.</p>
