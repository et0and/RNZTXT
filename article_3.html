        <h2>28 days and waiting for Wellington leak fix</h2>
        <p>
Water has been spilling onto one of the capital's busiest streets so long local stores have started a running tally.

            <p>A Wellington hair salon is keeping a running tally of how many days it takes to fix a large leak outside its shop on Lambton Quay.</p>
        
            <p>The leak sprung up through the paving stones 28 days ago and is sending a constant flow of water across the footpath and into the gutter.</p>
        
            <p>Rachel Pope, a hairdresser at Jean Jacques, said the tally written in chalk on the footpath outside is a bit of fun.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason being is that we have lots of people coming in asking whether we've reported it and it let's everyone know we're on it as well and we're watching it.</p>
        
            <p>"But what's been really cool is that it's created a bit of community. Negativity builds that little bit of banter".</p>

Staff are keeping a count of how long ago it started.

            <p>She said the salon reported the leak to Wellington City Council before Christmas but they haven't heard anything since.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard back just before Christmas, they said, 'Hey we're on to it'. The reason [the leak hasn't been fixed], over the phone they said they are struggling to find the plans on where the pipes are. That was what we were told".</p>
        
            <p>Pope understands work slows down over the holiday period but she wants the leak fixed before someone slips or the water reaches the salon doors.</p>
        
            <p>"Jean Jacques has got insurance on this place but we as stylists/contractors don't have that.</p>
        
            <p>"So if [the pipe] blows, smashes the window and if anyone does take advantage of it and steals our property, we have nothing to back it unless we have insurance at home... I'm very wary of what could happen".</p>

            <p>In a statement, Wellington Water said it will endeavour to fix the large leak outside the hair salon as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>The region's water service provider confirmed the leak was reported by the Jean Jacques salon three weeks ago, while another eight reports have been made by the public.</p>
        
            <p>Crews have been on site and have assessed the problem as a low to medium priority job.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a new leak has bubbled up through the paving stones behind the Old Bank Arcade on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said crews responded to the leak in a fire service connection pipe on Hunter Street.</p>
        
            <p>A section of the footpath is cordoned off because the leak loosened pavers and is sending water across the walkway and into the street.</p>
        
            <p>The region's water service provider said the water was not turned off so no shops nearby lost access.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said there are an increasing number of leaks in the region and the jobs that have the biggest impact on the water supply and public safety are prioritised first.</p>
        
            <p>Recent data shows there are over 3000 leaks across Wellington city.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider publishes updates on leaks on its website.</p>
