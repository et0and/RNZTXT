        <h2>What's happening around the motu for Matariki?</h2>
        <p>
The theme for this year's celebrations is Matariki Heri Kai - the Feast of Matariki. Here's what's happening across the motu to celebrate the occasion.

            <p>The rising of the Matariki star cluster on the horizon heralds Te Mātahi o te Tau - the Māori New Year - a time to remember those who have passed over the past year and plan for the one ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rā Aro ki a Matariki/Matariki Observance Day falls on Friday 28 June this year.</p>
        
            <p>The theme for this year's celebrations is Matariki Heri Kai - the Feast of Matariki. A call for people to think not only about their kai, but the environment it came from.</p>
        
            <p>As Professor Rangi Mātāmua puts it: "One of the great unifiers of people is food."</p>
        
            <p>Events have been happening all across the motu in the lead up to this week.</p>
        
            <p>Different iwi celebrate Te Mātahi o te Tau at different times, depending on the local environment and the geographic markers of their home rohe. In Taranaki, people look towards Puanga (Rigel) as the star heralding the new year, partly because Mt Taranaki is a literal barrier, making it hard to observe the stars of Matariki.</p>
        
            <p>Let's look at what the feast of Matariki will bring.</p>
        
            <p>This year the national Matariki celebrations will be hosted by Ngāi Tahu at Treble Cone near Wānaka.</p>
        
            <p>The hautapu ceremony will be broadcast live just before dawn on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ will be live from Treble Cone, with hosts Mihingarangi Forbes and Justine Murray taking you from 6am through to 10am on RNZ National.</p>
        
            <p>In Ōtautahi, the Tīrama Mai festival has already begun to light up the city.</p>
        
            <p>It will run every night from 5pm to 10pm until 30 June. It includes illuminated artworks, musical soundscapes, lightboxes and interactive installations.</p>
        
            <p>Trafalgar park in Nelson will host Te Huihui-o-Matariki on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Beginning at 5pm, it will include light displays, a Mākete Pō (night market) and a performance from singer-songwriter Maisey Rika.</p>
        
            <p>Whakatū is also hosting Ngā Kapa Haka Kura Tuarua o Aotearoa - the national secondary schools kapa haka competition this week.</p>
        
            <p>It began today at the Trafalgar Centre, with three days of pool competition before finals day on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whanganui a Tara will also see kapa haka action over Matariki weekend with Te Papa hosting Taikura Kapa Haka on 29-30 June.</p>
        
            <p>More than 700 hundred kaumātua (elders) from regional and marae-based rōpū across the motu will be performing.</p>
        
            <p>The Matariki Ahi Kā festival is also happening along the Wellington waterfront from Thursday to Sunday, at 6pm to 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>It will include projections, performances, and a special ceremony to honour those who have passed away and to express hopes for the future.</p>

            <p>The Ātea a Rangi Star Compass at Waitangi Regional Park near Napier is hosting several events over the week of Matariki.</p>
        
            <p>These include talks from local waka navigators; the ticketed Whānau Marama light show which runs from 24-28 June from 6.30pm to 9.30pm; and a Hautapu ceremony on Friday from 5am to 7am.</p>
        
            <p>The success of last year's beach bonfires event along the Hawke's Bay coast has seen it return for a second year, with the potential to expand into other regions.</p>
        
            <p>The DIY event named Matariki Mahuika, for the Goddess of Fire, will be on the night of 29 June. Fire and Emergency New Zealand (Fenz) has even created a special category for anyone planning to light a Matariki Mahuika fire on its Check It's Alright page.</p>
        
            <p>The National Wildlife Centre Pūkaha in Wairarapa is celebrating the one-year anniversary of the opening of its wharenui and education complex Te Whare Wānanga Taiao o Manukura on 6 July with a koha entry into the wildlife reserve - as well as the grand opening of an arts and weaving studio.</p>
        
            <p>AROUNI Indigenous Arts Festival presents 'Matariki', a free drone light, sound and story event at the Rotorua Lakefront on 27-28 June at 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>The show will feature 160 drones forming shapes hovering over the water, following the story of Matariki, our connection to the taio (our environment) and sharing Matariki knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>Check out a sneak peek of the drone light show in Rotorua:</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei will host their annual hautapu ceremony on Friday morning at Takaparawhau Bastion Point.</p>
