            <p>The family of the man killed in the Ponsonby Road shooting have paid tribute to him.</p>
        
            <p>Robert Sidney Horne, 33, had just got out of a car with three others when a man fired multiple shots in their direction. By the time emergency services arrived, he was already dead.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, Horne's family said they expected the coroner to release his body on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with deep sadness we announce the tragic and sudden passing of our son, brother, moko, uncle & friend to many," the post on Facebook said.</p>
        
            <p>They said his body would lie at Parawera Marae once it was released.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed his name in a statement, saying their thoughts were with the family.</p>
        
            <p>"The family of Mr Horne are understandably devastated at what has occurred and have requested privacy at this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>The suspect, 31-year-old Hone Kay-Selwyn, was found dead at a rural address in the Broadlands area, near Taup≈ç, on Tuesday. His death was being treated as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>Police said he was a member of the Killer Beez gang, but the motivation behind the Ponsonby shooting remained unclear, and police knew of no links between the man shot in Ponsonby and any criminal groups.</p>

            <p>A woman who said she was the partner of Kay-Selwyn, had expressed remorse for his actions. In a now-deleted Facebook post earlier this week, she said her inbox had been "overflowing" with messages about her partner's actions on Sunday night in Ponsonby.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to express my sincerest condolences to the family and loved ones of the victim. I'm deeply sorry and feel a great sense of shame about the situation."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was "grappling" with the fact he had taken someone's life.</p>
        
            <p>When contacted by RNZ the woman did not want to comment further.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not comment directly on the social media post or confirm if they had spoken to the woman.</p>
