It is madness to have eight operating theatres sitting empty in the face of huge surgical wait lists, doctor says.

            <p>The huge surgical centre sitting unused at Auckland's North Shore Hospital could be treating more than 15,000 patients a year.</p>
        
            <p>The brand new, 150-bed facility, Tōtara Haumaru, was built and kitted-out but did not have enough staff - or a budget - to get up and running.</p>
        
            <p>Doctors there told RNZ they had been kept in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>One, who did not want to be named, said it was madness to have the centre's eight operating theatres sitting unused in the face of huge surgical waiting lists.</p>
        
            <p>Clinicians had been asking how it would be staffed and funded since the project was in the planning stage but had never had straight answers, he said</p>
        
            <p>He could not believe the problem had not been addressed before now.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti said when the building was fully up and running it would be able to do 8000 surgeries and 7500 endoscopy procedures (such as colonoscopies) every year.</p>
        
            <p>But he acknowledged it would be a challenge to get the staff - and he understood the frustration of doctors, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly as I see wait lists which this would directly apply itself to."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's health spokesperson and former health minister Ayesha Verrall said Reti and Te Whatu Ora must sort the problem.</p>
        
            <p>"A specific plan needs to be made for this hospital and it's troubling that a pathway to getting this hospital open, with the staff it needs in place hasn't been put forward," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora had not yet allocated money to run the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said Te Whatu Ora could divert the money used to pay for public waitlist operations in private hospitals to the project.</p>
        
            <p>For now, no one can say when the building will be operating full tilt.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said the first stage should now be working in June but even finding enough workers for that would be tough.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the failure to open was "utterly disappointing" and the government was working on boosting the workforce through building another medical school and clearing immigration pathways.</p>
        
            <p>But Verrall said progress that had begun to be made under her government to boost the health workforce had instead stalled.</p>
