            <p>A retired eye surgeon charged with murdering his wife has pleaded guilty to meth charges ahead of his trial starting in Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court trial of Philip John Polkinghorne has begun with selection of the jury panel.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne arrived in court dressed in a suit and surrounded by his legal team, including Ron Mansfield KC.</p>
        
            <p>Before the trial began, Polkinghorne pleaded guilty to two charges that had been suppressed until today - possession of the class A drug methamphetamine and possession of a pipe, at the time his wife died.</p>
