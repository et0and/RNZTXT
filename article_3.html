            <p>San Francisco's former mayor Willie Brown has dismissed as "fiction" Donald Trump's story that they once endured a scary helicopter trip together.</p>
        
            <p>The former president said on Thursday that he and Brown "went down" in a helicopter together and Brown was "a little concerned".</p>
        
            <p>"We thought maybe this was the end," Trump said. "We were in a helicopter... and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing."</p>
        
            <p>Brown, 90, told US media he had never shared a helicopter with Trump, adding: "I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him".</p>
        
            <p>Trump, 78, appeared to be confusing Brown with Jerry Brown, California's former governor, with whom he shared a helicopter ride in 2018 to visit the aftermath of the Paradise wildfires. Gavin Newsom, the current state governor, was also on the flight.</p>
        
            <p>Both men told US media there was no emergency landing or danger. "I call complete BS," Mr Newsom told The New York Times.</p>
        
            <p>Trump told his story in response to a question about Willie Brown's relationship with Kamala Harris, 59, in the mid-1990s while she was a California prosecutor.</p>
        
            <p>Trump was asked whether he thought the relationship played a role in Harris's career journey.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, I know Willie Brown very well," Trump said, before speaking of the flight and claiming the former mayor had told him "terrible things" about Harris.</p>
        
            <p>"He had a big part in what happened with Kamala," Trump said.</p>

            <p>The former mayor also denied this.</p>
        
            <p>"That's so far-fetched, it's unbelievable," he told local TV station KRON. "I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way.</p>
        
            <p>"She's a good friend a long time ago, absolutely beautiful woman, smart as all hell, very successful, electorally speaking.</p>
        
            <p>"He was doing what Donald does best, his creative fiction."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Jerry Brown also told US media that the former governor did not discuss Harris on the helicopter flight in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Trump's remarks at an hour-long news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate come as a recent national poll shows Harris is beating him among likely voters.</p>
        
            <p>The two have visited a number of battleground states this week alongside their vice-presidential candidates to speak to voters.</p>
