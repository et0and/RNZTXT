            <p>Wellington eatery Egmont Street is closing its doors at the end of the month after nine years in business, leaving 15 people without jobs.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, the deli and diner said the current economic climate has created huge challenges and changes to its business.</p>
        
            <p>"We're proud to have experienced many moments of joy, achievement, growth, resilience, tough decisions and change and we're deeply grateful for the supportive customers and community we've had the pleasure of serving throughout our time here.</p>
        
            <p>"We extend our sincere gratitude to all of our suppliers and service providers, whom without your partnership and loyalty, we would never have made it this far."</p>
        
            <p>Egmont Street is encouraging all its customers to show their support towards other eateries and restaurants.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Wellington florist Yvette Edwards is also closing after seven years on Tory Street.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to customers, she thanked them for their energy and support throughout the years and during their toughest times.</p>
        
            <p>"The YE Team and my YE Fam past and present, have given their everything to make it through the challenges of the past few years, always with enthusiasm and lots of smiles. In response the love we have been shown has always kept me going and I love you all for it.</p>
        
            <p>"We couldn't have made it this far without everyone's incredible encouragement and loyalty and that sentiment extends to all our wonderful growers and suppliers too.</p>
        
            <p>"I am excited to see what the future holds and the next reinvention, all for the love of flowers."</p>
        
            <p>Edwards planned to host a garage sale of some of its art and furniture on 14 and 15 September, followed by a farewell high tea at its studio on the 22 September.</p>
