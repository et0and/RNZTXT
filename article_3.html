            <p>A total fire ban is about to be imposed across much of Northland as a massive fire continues to burn in Waipoua Forest.</p>
        
            <p>The prohibited fire season will come into force at 8am on Saturday in the Muriwhenua or Te Hiku area at the top of the Far North along with the entire west coast of Northland, including North and South Hokianga, and the Ripiro and Paparoa fire districts.</p>
        
            <p>Any previously issued fire permits in those areas have been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ manager Wipari Henwood said the Waipoua fire - which forced the evacuation of 20 homes this week - was a stark reminder of what could happen in Northland's current hot, dry, windy summer.</p>
        
            <p>"The frequent hot days we're experiencing have increased the chances of a fire taking hold that we won't be able to contain quickly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This week we've had multiple helicopters, trucks, firefighters, and support teams working around the clock to contain a large vegetation fire at Waipoua River. Residents have been evacuated and are still waiting to return to their homes.</p>
        
            <p>This is a prime example of the impacts a fire can have when it gets out of control," Henwood said.</p>

            <p>He urged Northlanders to consider the risk before doing anything that generated heat and/or sparks, and could accidentally start a fire.</p>
        
            <p>The FENZ website checkitsalright.nz had good advice about fire safety and information about where fire permits were needed.</p>
        
            <p>Fires can still be lit in eastern and central areas of Northland but only with a permit.</p>
        
            <p>The Waipoua fire, which started on Wednesday afternoon, currently covers just under 100 hectares of young pines, cut-over areas, and scrubland.</p>
