            <p>Police will deploy staff to monitor the movement of the body of a gang member, who was behind a fatal shooting in Auckland last week.</p>
        
            <p>Hone Kay-Selwyn's body was found at a rural address in the Broadlands area near Taupō on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Revealed to be a Killer Beez gang member, he was wanted for the fatal shooting of Robert Horne on Ponsonby Road last Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said his death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a police spokesperson said Kay-Selwyn's body would be moved from the Massey area to Ōtara on Sunday ahead of planned funeral proceedings on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Movement of gang members in the city would be monitored, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are deploying resource across the route and there will be support provided by the Police Air Support Unit.</p>
        
            <p>"High visibility and reassurance patrolling will also be conducted around the wider Massey and Ōtara areas today.</p>
        
            <p>"We have set very clear expectations on the standard of behaviour that is acceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Police said any concerning behaviour can be reported to police immediately on 111, or if after the fact on 105, or online.</p>
        
            <p>The motivation behind the Ponsonby shooting remains unclear, and police know of no links between Horne and any criminal groups.</p>
