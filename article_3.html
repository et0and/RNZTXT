            <p>A winner of the highest individual accolade in the A-League is crossing the ditch to play for Auckland FC during their inaugural season.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielder Jake Brimmer has left Australia after playing 92 games across four seasons with Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Steve Corica saw Auckland FC as a stop-off for the 26-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>"He possesses immense talent that will take him beyond the A-League. Auckland FC has the pathways to help him achieve that and we anticipate he will step up to his role within the club as a key contributor to the team's success both on and off the field," Corica said.</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer has long been considered one of the A-League's most accomplished midfielders, having received the prestigious Johnny Warren Medal for the 2021-22 season.</p>
        
            <p>At just 24 years old, Brimmer was the youngest Australian to win the award since Mark Viduka was crowned player of the year in 1995.</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer featured in 24 of Victory's 26 games last season. During his debut season with the Victory, he finished as the club's joint top goal scorer for the 2020-21 season.</p>
        
            <p>"He has superb passing range and the ability to score from anywhere within 35 yards of goal. Combined with his tenure in Victory's leadership group, Jake has demonstrated dedicated progression from player to a key role model for his team mates.</p>
        
            <p>"The next step is to continue to work hard on his game and at being the best player he can be for Auckland FC."</p>
        
            <p>Born in Lilydale, Victoria, Brimmer attributes his early years playing at Nunawading City FC as the most influential time of his career.</p>
        
            <p>"It's where I learnt at a young age the competitive side of football, and the importance of fighting for the badge, it's what took me to Liverpool and then back to Melbourne," said Brimmer at his unveiling.</p>
        
            <p>"It's never easy leaving the club you've grown up supporting, but Auckland FC will provide an exciting new challenge for the next phase of my career. Having played alongside many of the team, I know how strong the squad is and I can't wait to be part of this group's drive to win.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone can see that the club has made big steps forward under the leadership team of Steve, Nick (Becker, CEO), Terry (McFlynn, director of Football), and Doug (Kors, head of player recruitment). I couldn't be more excited for the season ahead, and am ready for the hard work expected here."</p>
        
            <p>Brimmer's signing further boosts the Auckland FC squad heavy on attacking talent following signings of back-to-back champion Dan Hall, All Whites Callan Elliot and Joey Champness, plus three-time A-League title winner Scott Galloway.</p>
