            <p>Word game Gubbins, the brainchild of two Australians who came up with the idea during lockdown in Melbourne, is giving Wordle a run for its money.</p>
        
            <p>The game, designed by the pair’s company Studio Folly, was initially rejected by investors before taking the fancy of a social media star who has 8 million followers on TikTok</p>
        
            <p>The game is “like our take on solitaire meets Scrabble,” game creator Darcy Smith told First Up.</p>
        
            <p>“It's a single-player game where you can just make the words that you want to make - it’s a game about striving for a high score, if that's your kind of thing, or it's a game about making funny words and funny postcards out of those words.”</p>
        
            <p>In Gubbins, the player places letters on a board to create words, similar to Scrabble, but with the help of Good Gubbins —which provide power ups — and Bad Gubbins, who throw up challenges.</p>
        
            <p>“The Gubbins, which are like the wildcard modifiers and the characters of the game, with this mechanically simple tile system that's domino-esque or solitaire-esque with letters stuck together."</p>
        
            <p>Having spruiked their idea around the world and getting no investor bites, Smith says they decided to post a video about the game – this was the video that Hank Green noticed.</p>
        
            <p>“Hank Green is an internet personality. He's also a New York Times bestselling author, and philanthropist entrepreneur, has a bunch of different cool businesses and is really sort of involved in charity work and goodwill.”</p>
        
            <p>Green sent Smith a direct message expressing his interest, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“He reached out and basically said, 'Your game looks awesome. I wonder if there's some way that we can work together. I'd love to hear more about it.'"</p>
        
            <p>The deal they struck with Green gave Smith and his business partner, Jess Shipard, the money to get the game to market, and a portion of revenue will go to one of Green’s charities.</p>
        
            <p>The game has taken off and is even giving Wordle a run for its money - the free-to-play game has more than 50,000 downloads on the Play Store.</p>
        
            <p>“I just feel grateful that people like what we're making and thankful that we can entertain people for a portion of their day, just a couple of minutes over a coffee even,” Smith said.</p>
