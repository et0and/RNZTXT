            <p>Russell Cook, the man nicknamed 'Hardest Geezer', has successfully run the full length of Africa, crossing the finish line in Tunisia after 352 days.</p>
        
            <p>Before he set off on the mammoth challenge to run the entire length of Africa, he said he hoped to look back at his life and have no regrets.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old from Worthing, West Sussex, said he had struggled with his mental health, gambling and drinking, and wanted to "make a difference".</p>
        
            <p>After running through 16 countries, he has raised in excess of Â£700,000 for charity and has completed his final run.</p>
        
            <p>As he crossed the finish line at about 16.40 (BST) in Ras Angela, Tunisia, Cook was greeted by a shouting crowd, with many chanting "geezer".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pretty tired," he told reporters and in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

            <p>Cook told those who had been following his journey to the finish line: "Mission completed."</p>
        
            <p>A lot has changed since Cook set off from home in February 2023.</p>
        
            <p>His initial plan to run from Tunisia to South Africa, completing 360 marathons in 240 days with no rest days, was soon halted by a lack of an Algerian visa - a hindrance that would later resurface.</p>

            <p>But after a last-minute switch, he set off on foot from South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April - a journey that would take him through cities, rainforests, mountains and the Sahara Desert.</p>
        
            <p>After ticking off South Africa and Namibia in 50 days, Cook encountered his first major setback - an armed robbery.</p>
        
            <p>He and his support team had cameras, phones, cash, passports and visas stolen in Angola on 24 June.</p>
        
            <p>However, as with many stumbling blocks he would face throughout the challenge, the ultrarunner vowed to soldier on.</p>
        
            <p>Consistently running more than a marathon a day began to take its toll.</p>
        
            <p>After some minor tummy troubles in the early weeks, he was forced to take his first rest day after doctors found blood and protein in his urine on day 45.</p>
        
            <p>But it was recurring back pain that caused the most concern.</p>
        
            <p>On day 200, Cook was forced to reduce his mileage and intensity at the request of a doctor in Nigeria - even missing consecutive days on day 205 and 206.</p>
        
            <p>But in true Hardest Geezer style, he was not to be stopped.</p>
        
            <p>He said: "I took a couple of days to get some scans. No bone damage so figured the only option left was to stop mincing about like a little weasel, get the strongest painkillers available and zombie stomp road again."</p>
        
            <p>After overcoming everything in his path, it was a single piece of paper - an Algerian visa - that cast doubt over the entire challenge on day 278.</p>
        
            <p>Cook was forced to halt while he waited to find out his fate as to whether he could secure permission to cross the border into Algeria from Mauritania.</p>
        
            <p>"If we don't get the visas, then it is game over," he said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>His public appeal video on X, formerly Twitter, was seen by 11 million people - even catching the attention of the site's owner Elon Musk, as well as MPs Tim Loughton and Alexander Stafford and the Home Office.</p>
        
            <p>The increased attention on the challenge eventually paid off as the UK's Algerian embassy announced he would receive a courtesy visa on the spot.</p>
        
            <p>After the setbacks, all that separated Cook and the finish line was the small task of the Sahara Desert.</p>

            <p>The tarmac roads ran out, as did the signal and any signs of civilisation. But an end date was set: 7 April, 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Ramping up his mileage to make up for lost time, Cook made the decision to run through the night due to the intense daytime heat and sandstorms.</p>
        
            <p>Months turned into weeks, and weeks turned into days.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, on Sunday afternoon, Cook laced his trainers one last time - at least for now - as he set off for Tunisia's most northerly point.</p>
        
            <p>Joined by supporters from across the world for the final marathon, Cook completed the challenge.</p>
        
            <p>The celebrations will go long into the night - helped by a finishing party performance by British punk band Soft Play, formerly Slaves, at a hotel in Bizerte.</p>
        
            <p>And the 'Hardest Geezer' will finally get his hands on the one thing he has been craving since day one - a strawberry daiquiri.</p>
