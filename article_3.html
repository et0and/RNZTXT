            <p>New Zealand's Lydia Ko turned in a bogey-free, 5-under-par 67 to join Japan's Ayaka Furue atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions this morning in Orlando, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Ko and Furue are at 8-under 136 through 36 holes at Lake Nona Golf and Country Club, two shots ahead of Scotland's Gemma Dryburgh and Mexico's Gaby Lopez. Furue held the first-round lead and shot a 1-under 71 Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The Tournament of Champions is open to players who won an LPGA event over the past two seasons and does not feature a 36-hole cut. Ko, a former World No. 1, is in the field on the strength of three victories in 2022, but she is aiming to rebound after not winning on tour in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Ko did team up with Australian Jason Day to win December's Grant Thornton Invitational, a mixed-team exhibition in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Grant Thornton helped a lot. We did a lot of good work the week before with my coach flying over and spending some time here at Lake Nona," said Ko, who takes up residence in Orlando.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though it was a unique format at Grant Thornton, I think it just was really beneficial week for me to kind of be in positions where I was uncomfortable and still be able to commit to my shots."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Ko had three birdies and an eagle at the par-5 ninth hole. She hit a 3-wood into the ninth green and had around 9 feet for eagle.</p>
        
            <p>"Just tried to keep it simple and give myself a lot of good opportunities, and I was giving myself a lot of birdie chances, so I feel like I left a few out there," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Furue took her first bogey of the tournament at the par-3 fourth and finished a quiet round with two birdies on the back nine. Dryburgh posted a 4-under 68 and Lopez shot a 1-under 71.</p>
        
            <p>Alexa Pano and Canadian Brooke Henderson each shot 70 Friday and are tied for fifth at 5 under. Pano, 19, broke through last August with her first career victory at the ISPS Handa World Invitational.</p>
        
            <p>"I turned pro for a reason, that I belonged out here and wanted to be out here," Pano said. "But it's just really proving that you belong out here I think can be tough. There is so many great players out here. You really got to prove yourself. I feel like I've done that, so I feel like now it's just continue to do that.</p>
        
            <p>Nelly Korda (69), Rose Zhang (71) and Japan's Nasa Hataoka (70) are among the notable names tied for seventh at 4 under.</p>
