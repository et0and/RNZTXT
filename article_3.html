The bathroom vanity was installed crooked and the waterproofing wasn't compliant. Now Sam Kumar can't be found.

            <p>An Auckland man says a handyman with a history of leaving work unfinished has been ordered to pay him over $17,000 for a poorly done bathroom renovation, but two months later he is still waiting to be refunded.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Rust, from Waimauku, said he hired a man he knew as Sam Kumar from On Call Renovations to renovate his bathroom and do painting while he was in Rarotonga celebrating his daughter's birthday in February.</p>
        
            <p>Rust said he found Kumar, who is also known as Sanjay Kumar or John Sam Kumar, on Facebook, and was assured he could do the work in 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>But when he got back, the work was unfinished and what had been done was "awful", Rust said.</p>
        
            <p>"The vanity was installed crooked, there was rubbish everywhere, paint on my couch, carpet, shirts and blinds and the waterproofing for the bathroom wasn't compliant.</p>
        
            <p>"He finally agreed to fix it in May, but kept making excuses about being sick and then blocked my number and Facebook profile."</p>
        
            <p>Rust said he had paid $15,000, with only $3500 being returned.</p>
        
            <p>"The entire bathroom needs to be pulled out and re-done, meaning I'll need to stay somewhere else for a week or so".</p>
        
            <p>Rust decided to take Kumar to the Disputes Tribunal to try to get his money back.</p>

            <p>A tribunal ruling from 9 August, seen by RNZ, showed referee Johanna Perfect ordered Kumar to pay Rust $17,690.91 by the end of September.</p>
        
            <p>Kumar did not turn up to the tribunal hearing despite "being called four times", and during it Rust supplied photographs of the work and had his friend, who was a plumber and had seen the work, give evidence on what he called "sub-standard workmanship".</p>
        
            <p>"I find Mr Kumar failed to provide a service with reasonable care and skill and it was not fit for purpose," Perfect said.</p>
        
            <p>"The extent of the failure is substantial and all work must be ripped out and done from scratch."</p>
        
            <p>Perfect noted Rust had proven Kumar claimed to be a licensed building practitioner on his website, by taking a screenshot before the words were deleted. Kumar is not a licensed practitioner.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the ruling, Rust is yet to get any payment and said he was at a loss on what to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't find this guy, and since I can't find him he doesn't have to pay me as it's considered a civil dispute."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ contacted Kumar for comment, but he did not respond. Instead, he emailed Rust saying "thank you" for contacting the media.</p>
        
            <p>"As I don't have jobs there will be no jobs in future too. Thank you," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He did not respond as to whether he would pay the amount ordered by the tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>Roshni Devi spoke to RNZ earlier this year about her interactions with Kumar, who she said left her with an unfinished garage and poorly done flooring.</p>

            <p>She had wanted a refund of the $30,000 she paid him.</p>
        
            <p>Devi filed a police report against Kumar, but said she had not heard anything since and has been unable to get any money back.</p>
        
            <p>In the past, Kumar has done renovation work across Auckland, using different company names including RJ Handyman Services Ltd and SSK Renovation and Home Services.</p>
        
            <p>Three others RNZ spoke with in the past all won Disputes Tribunal proceedings against Kumar, but none received all of the money owed.</p>
        
            <p>Two said they were never repaid, while the third said he was paid about 20 percent of the money.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) can investigate and prosecute people who breach the Building Act.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE's manager of investigations Kathryn Young warned anyone wanting building work carried out should do their "due diligence" and make sure the builder they were using was licensed before work began.</p>
        
            <p>"Carrying out work without a licence can incur a fine of up to $20,000," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"Complaints about non-licensed individuals and individuals carrying out restricted building work can be investigated, but victims need to file a complaint and provide evidence."</p>
        
            <p>Young said "due to privacy", MBIE could not comment on whether any complaints had been laid against Kumar.</p>
