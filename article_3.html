            <p>New Zealand captain Tom Latham was lost for words following his team's stunning 3-0 triumph in India on Sunday but had no doubt that it was their greatest series victory.</p>
        
            <p>With their 25-run victory in the final match, the Black Caps became the first team to whitewash India at home in a series featuring three or more tests.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm lost for words a bit, in terms of what's happened over the last three days but also the last three weeks," Latham told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"If you asked me at the start of the tour whether I'd be in this position, I would have liked to be in this position, but to be here now and play the cricket that we've played is really special and I'm really proud of the group.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously a great moment for New Zealand, probably one of New Zealand's greatest series wins I think."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's wins were all the more significant as they were without injured batting mainstay Kane Williamson, and Latham praised Will Young for stepping up.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old scored 244 runs at an average of 48.80 to collect the man-of-the-series award.</p>

            <p>"He's obviously been in our squad for a long period of time now. He probably hasn't played as much as he would have liked in terms of that backup role," Latham said.</p>
        
            <p>"He played an important innings in that fourth innings (in Bengaluru), but the way he played here on a wicket that wasn't easy for batters, he controlled our innings really nicely.</p>
        
            <p>"He trusted his defence, he took brave options, he tried to fire a shot at them and played fantastically well."</p>
        
            <p>Latham took over as captain from Tim Southee after New Zealand's 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always a really proud moment to lead New Zealand. To come here, my first time as full-time captain and to be in this position is really special," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's not about me, it's about the team. They did the job. Everyone's chipped in when they needed to and that's the beauty of a team sport."</p>
