            <p>It's the start of the silly season, but some sneaky suspects are stealing Christmas joy before it even happens, with parcel thefts on the rise.</p>
        
            <p>A 29-year-old has this week been arrested over large scale thefts from rural mailboxes in North Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>The police searched a property near Eyrewell and discovered heaps of opened mail as well as a firearm and ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a few Grinches out there that are keen to spoil our Christmases," Inspector Brett Callander told Checkpoint. </p>
        
            <p>"Some of it's opportunistic, you know, sometimes people will just see it and think 'well, that's me' and other times it's actually planned and people are targeting parcels."</p>
        
            <p>The 'planners' can follow parcel trucks around on their routes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It can happen anywhere and everywhere, but obviously in rural areas because of the distance and neighbours being further away it's a little bit harder to capture these people."</p>
        
            <p>The thieves do not always know what is in a parcel, but anything electronic would be of value to them, Callander said.</p>
        
            <p>Having a camera on your mailbox can deter people, but it may not actually stop the thefts.</p>
        
            <p>"If you really want to stop your parcels being taken then you might have to send them to a work address or have them click and collect instead of being delivered to your house, or even make sure that you're home when they're going to be delivered.</p>
        
            <p>"Another thing people are doing now is having really clear instructions on where the courier needs to deliver to, that it's hidden and not obvious when it's been delivered."</p>
        
            <p>Cameras can help with the investigation as it did in the Canterbury case, Callander said, and good neighbours were also valuable in solving the case.</p>
        
            <p>"My suggestion is hey, if you're not already a member of your neighbourhood support group then get hold of them and find out how the neighbourhood and the police can work together to stop these Grinches."</p>
        
            <p>If you're going away for Christmas holidays, it's also important to be wary of thieves.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think you should draw your curtains because that sends a message that nobody's home."</p>
        
            <p>It is better to have a neighbour help keep an eye on your property, perhaps mowing lawns or emptying bins or leaving a car in your driveway to make it look like you're still home.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't put that big 55-inch TV box out besides your rubbish bin because that just screams the fact that you've just got a new TV and that makes it easier for someone to decide that they're going to come and take it."</p>
