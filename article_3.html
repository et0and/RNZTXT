            <p>When a family arrived at a remote Northland hospital with their daughter when she attempted an overdose and was self-harming there was no crisis team available and they were sent home and told to "keep an eye on her".</p>
        
            <p>The lack of services in remote emergency departments, along with the limited pool of counsellors available, has been highlighted in the second week of a Northland coronial inquest into six suspected youth suicides.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Tania Tetitaha is leading a four-week inquest in Whangārei into the deaths of five youths in 2018 and one in 2020, aged between 12 and 16.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Tetitaha said at the end of the inquest there will be a finding that these rangatahi died by suicide and is seeking solutions to impediments to access to prevention for suicide services in the North.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, family members for Hamuera Ellis-Erihe, James Patira Murray, Summer Mills-Metcalf and Martin Loeffen Romagnoli gave evidence about circumstances leading up to the death of their children.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Carmen and Pouaka 'Boxer" Heta gave evidence about the death of their daughter Ataria Moeroa Heta in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The family had lived in the small village of Moerewa for 15 years next door to her grandparents and Ataria was "the baby of the family".</p>
        
            <p>She was a creative girl who gave everything a go, had a solid friend group and was once described as a standout performer at a local kapa haka competition.</p>
        
            <p>"She was very likeable and quite charismatic. Really sociable and a go-to person for a lot of people. She had a really good nature," her mother said at the coroner's hearing.</p>
        
            <p>In the years leading up to her death, Ataria lost her grandfather who she was exceptionally close to.</p>
        
            <p>She also experienced a distressing incident at a party but it was months until Ataria disclosed what happened. Her parents initiated action immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we knew what happened, we pushed to get her help, we put her in counselling and she was often brought home by a social worker."</p>
        
            <p>Her parents said she developed anxiety after the incident and would often have to face her alleged offender as he hung around the school.</p>
        
            <p>"It was obviously distressing to her.</p>
        
            <p>"In a small village, things spread like wildfire," her mother said.</p>
        
            <p>A sensitive claims application was filed with ACC and Ataria accessed counselling with a provider in Kerikeri however, she told her mother she found the counselling boring and at 16, disengaged herself from the service.</p>
        
            <p>"We did what we could and played the hand that was dealt at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"If we had the right clinician or professional help we may have been able to get what she needed."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>In December 2019, Ataria was self-harming and attempted an overdose and was taken to the Bay of Islands Hospital emergency department where there was no crisis team available. A doctor told them to take her home and keep an eye on her.</p>
        
            <p>"We just did as we were instructed.</p>
        
            <p>"We need someone there 24/7. By the time we got to the hospital, there was no one there and we were waiting for a few hours, by then they'd had enough, they don't feel valued," her mother said.</p>
        
            <p>Days later she was prescribed Escitalopram for depression and anxiety which she took until February before being switched to another antidepressant.</p>
        
            <p>On 29 February 2020, Ataria performed kapa haka at a local event before visiting her grandmother who lived next door.</p>
        
            <p>Her grandmother, Georgina said in a statement that Ataria walked in and Georgina asked her "What are you up to?"</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing", Ataria responded and walked out.</p>
        
            <p>Ataria died later that evening.</p>
        
            <p>Although Ataria left behind information that she had been sad for five years, Carmen said they were at a loss.</p>
        
            <p>"We keep trying to find out what caused this but we might never know," Carmen said.</p>

            <p>Before Ataria's death, the family had navigated the mental health system in Auckland and said the difference in services to the North was shocking.</p>
        
            <p>"In Auckland, we could say what we liked, we had input ... the process was very different.</p>
        
            <p>"Up here, it's s***."</p>
        
            <p>A detailed record of services Ataria was engaged with was presented to the coroner's court, but Carmen said the process was confusing at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Pouaka said he was shocked to find ACC was sending letters to a 16-year-old regarding her discontinuation of counselling and believed it should have been addressed to the parents.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a bit puzzled why a letter is being sent to our daughter when it was a process initiated by us from the beginning," he told the coroner's court.</p>
        
            <p>Carmen said her daughter was very good at telling people what they wanted to hear and believes whānau, including grandparents, should have input into a 16-year-old's plan.</p>
        
            <p>"Ataria said she was okay to the counsellors and they believed it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about communication and everyone being on the same page as the child. The privacy issues with the counsellor, ACC sending letters to my daughter, it should be all collective I feel."</p>
        
            <p>Pouaka also told the inquest that financial support for families left behind was non-existent for those who earn above the threshold which placed extreme pressure on those who were grieving and unable to show up to work.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing is expected to finish early November and will hear evidence from social workers, health and education officials.</p>
