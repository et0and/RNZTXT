        <h2>Much of NZ 'dotted' with little-known volcanoes, scientist reveals</h2>
        <p>
Saturday Morning - Many people do not know Northland was built on a volcanic field, while the Otago Peninsula is "one big volcanic complex". Audio

            <p>Most New Zealanders are familiar with our big volcanoes like Ruapehu and Taranaki - but there are lesser-known volcanoes "dotted" over much of the country, a scientist has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Northland, for example, was built on a volcanic field, much like Auckland, GNS Science principal scientist Graham Leonard told Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>It was made up of scoria fields, lava flows and explosion craters.</p>
        
            <p>The volcanoes were not talked about much because they were "not quite as frequently active, but also we don't have a third of the country's population living on top of [them]".</p>
        
            <p>There were two separate clusters of volcanoes in the Northland region - one around Whangārei and one through the Kaikohe and Bay of Islands area.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone driving out of Whangārei, through Kamo, would see "several little scoria cones, just like Mt Eden" - those were volcanoes, Leonard said.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland's south, the Pukekohe area had also seen "a lot of volcanism", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The beautiful soils there for growing vegetables are all volcanic.</p>
        
            <p>"That's where it used to be [active] before Auckland and for some reason it migrated slowly up to Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel was also volcanic, but the field was now "basically extinct" as the subducting plate underneath the North Island had moved and deepened over millions of years.</p>

            <p>That same plate was responsible for a cluster of extinct volcanoes around the Tauranga hills.</p>
        
            <p>South Auckland, Otago and Canterbury were home to "an odd kind of diffuse volcanic area" which was "still very occasionally popping off now", Leonard said.</p>
        
            <p>That included the entirety of the Otago Peninsula, which was "one big volcanic complex".</p>
        
            <p>One of the youngest volcanoes in the country was Timaru's Mt Horrible, which was now extinct.</p>
        
            <p>The city was built on lava flows from the volcano, which gave it its undulating appearance.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason you've got good rock at Timaru for a port is it's volcanic."</p>
