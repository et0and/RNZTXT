        <p>
The national grid operator says all circuits came back online at 4am without any problems.

            <p>Transpower has restored the circuits it took out of action over the weekend, because of concern they could be damaged during the solar storm.</p>
        
            <p>The national electricity system turned several circuits off on Saturday, ahead of a geomagnetic storm hitting.</p>
        
            <p>There were concerns the solar storm would damage satellites and power equipment, so Transpower closed down some electricity transmission circuits as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>People around the world have been enjoying colourful auroras, caused by material being spat out of a huge spot on the sun.</p>
        
            <p>The stunning, colourful lights, or Aurora Australis, it generated were clearly visible around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower extended the notice on Sunday to early Monday, when further activity was notified.</p>
        
            <p>It said all affected circuits came back online at 4am without any problems.</p>
        
            <p>There were no power cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University physics Professor Craig Rodger told RNZ that despite the storm reaching G5 - the top of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) SWPC scale for geomagnetic storms - it had only just done so.</p>
        
            <p>It was the largest such solar storm for more than a decade in New Zealand - but not as big as those of 2003 or 2001, and he said we had learned a lot since then.</p>
