            <p>Businesses in Northland's Kaipara District say they're frustrated by a 13-hour internet outage that forced many shops to close or switch to cash-only transactions for a day.</p>
        
            <p>Dargaville Community Development Board manager Sue Curtis said Wednesday's fibre outage meant eftpos terminals and ATMs stopped working, and banks closed.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, anyone who didn't have cash on hand before the 8am cable break could not spend money at the town's businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Spark has confirmed the outage was caused when a culvert was being dug near Tangowahine, between Whangārei and Dargaville.</p>
        
            <p>The digger hit the main fibre-optic cable providing broadband internet to Dargaville, Maungaturoto, Paparoa and Ruawai.</p>
        
            <p>Lines company Northpower, which also provides internet services, said all internet providers in the area and more than 2070 homes and businesses were affected.</p>
        
            <p>The cable was repaired about 9.30pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said the cable break was especially frustrating because it followed a series of major infrastructure failures.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disappointing because not so long ago we had that power outage which shut down the whole of Northland, and now we have a digger driver who digs through a fairly recently placed fibre network. They've dug straight through it and it's affected so many people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said affected businesses should be compensated, but it was hard to put a figure on how much they had lost.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be good if they could be, but it is really is up to the providers to come up with a solution."</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said the day-long outage came just as the town was busy with visitors, many of whom were camping at the popular Kai Iwi Lakes or the 107km-long Ripiro Beach, or visiting Waipoua Forest further north on State Highway 12.</p>

            <p>The damaged cable consisted of a number of fibre-optic cables, some owned by Spark and others by Chorus.</p>
        
            <p>Spark referred questions about whether the company would try to recover its costs to Chorus.</p>
        
            <p>Chorus has not responded to RNZ enquiries since Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A Spark spokeswoman said professional locators could advise contractors on where cables were buried, and checks could also be done [www.beforeudig.co.nz online].</p>
        
            <p>In June last year, power was cut to all of Northland after contractors carrying out routine maintenance unbolted three legs of a pylon at once, causing it to topple over.</p>
        
            <p>The region's backup high-voltage line was disconnected at the time for maintenance.</p>
