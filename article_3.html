        <h2>‘You need to have the will to fight’ - Osaka through to ASB quarter-finals</h2>
        <p>
The seventh seed and star attraction is showing the sort of mental fortitude that won her four Grand Slams.
</p>
        
            <p>Even with big names pulling out and the local hopeful gone, there's plenty of life left in the ASB Classic.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd got what they came for on the New Year's Day session, as drawcard Naomi Osaka advanced through to the quarter-finals with a 7-5 6-3 win over Austrian Julia Grabher.</p>
        
            <p>Osaka's killer instincts took over at the end of a tight first set, in which Grabher defied the 400 ranking spots between the two to almost force a tie break. In the second, Osaka sent down five aces to wrench back control, closing it out after breaking Grabher twice.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like for me, it's really interesting because…I'm not really a confrontational person," Osaka said of her lift in intensity.</p>
        
            <p>"But when you're on the court, it's kind of like you're in a boxing match and you need to have the will to fight more than the other person. And I feel like I finally found that again."</p>
        
            <p>Osaka famously took a break from the game after struggling with the pressures of being such a high profile athlete, but her demeanour this week has shown she is very much returning to the mindset that won her four Grand Slams.</p>

            <p>"I've said this for years - I'm not the most talented player. But I always felt like I work the hardest. And that, for me, gives me a lot of confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"Then it's just, you know, trying to go into a fist fight with another person and in the end, it's who wants it more. I think last year it was really difficult for me to get that mindset, and you could see that in a lot of my matches."</p>
        
            <p>However, she admitted that there were times on court where things got tough.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there are moments where it's really difficult where I do get down on myself. But then I think today, I don't know, I just kind of realised, I was pregnant not so long ago, and I just really wanted the opportunity to play again.</p>
        
            <p>"And now I'm finally here and I'm putting up a really good fight, and I hope that I can just keep continuing this way."</p>
        
            <p>The former world number one moves on to play the winner of American Hailey Baptiste and Jodie Burrage in the quarter-finals. The 179th-ranked British player would have to be one of the luckiest qualifying losers in tournament history, as she took over from the injured Elise Mertens and has been handed a real chance to make a WTA 250 quarter-final.</p>
