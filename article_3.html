        <p>
The precursors to the Anzac biscuit included eggs and were sandwiched together with jam - so what changed? Audio

            <p>The history of the Anzac biscuit can be traced back to the 1700s - and contrary to popular belief, it did not evolve from the Scottish oat cake, a culinary historian says.</p>
        
            <p>Australian-based historian Allison Reynolds told RNZ's Anzac Morning that the precursor to the Anzac biscuit was featured in a 1747 book by Englishwoman Hannah Glasse, called The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy.</p>
        
            <p>The biscuit was not identical to today's Anzac biscuit but featured many of the same ingredients and the same method of making, using melted butter, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Many people believed it evolved from the oat cake, but that was not true, she said. Anzac biscuits used rolled oats, while oat cakes used ground oat meal.</p>
        
            <p>Oat cakes and Anzac biscuits were also made, baked and served differently.</p>
        
            <p>Reynolds said the biscuits Kiwis knew and loved today were perfected by Scottish migrants to both Australia and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The biscuits I like to say were created simultaneously in both countries."</p>
        
            <p>Prior to 1915, they were known by other names, such as 'nutties' or 'munchies', she said.</p>
        
            <p>During World War I, wives and mothers began sending the biscuits to soldiers at the front, and they became known as 'Red Cross biscuits' or 'soldiers' biscuits'.</p>
        
            <p>"They wanted to send something nutritious because they were worried the troops weren't getting that well fed."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier versions featured two biscuits sandwiched together with jam, but that changed during the war years.</p>
        
            <p>Eggs were also removed from the recipe at that time and golden syrup was added, Reynolds said.</p>
        
            <p>"The sensible wives and mothers knew that the biscuits would not keep long and because of the war rationing, eggs were not always in ready supply."</p>
        
            <p>As well as being sent to soldiers and nurses at the front, the biscuits were baked for fundraisers for the war effort.</p>
        
            <p>They became known as Anzac biscuits sometime after the formation of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in 1914.</p>
        
            <p>Reynolds said the first printed reference to that name that she could find was in the eighth edition of the St Andrew's Cookbook, which was published in 1919.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was often a lag of two or three years between when a recipe became popular and when it was published in a cookbook, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Reynolds said golden syrup was "absolutely essential" to Anzac biscuits - "don't change it for honey, don't change it for anything else".</p>
        
            <p>It should come from a tin rather than a squeezy bottle, as bottled golden syrup was often more liquid, she said.</p>
