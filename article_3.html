            <p>Opportunities like this don't come around very often.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, being part of the biggest choral event on the planet - the World Choir Games - only became a reality for many New Zealand choirs because of its proximity, held in Tāmaki Makaurau for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Among those taking that opportunity with both hands were Manurewa High School's Rewaken Polycation Choir - a talented group who represent many different cultures and ethnicities, brought together by their shared love of music and a collective desire to express themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Student Charlie Miller explains: "The choir represents the different, diverse cultures that connect together. We have people in from Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands but there is nothing that is separating us, we think that we're all connected as one people, as one choir."</p>
        
            <p>That's a crucial driver for Rewaken Polycation's experienced, respected choirmaster and composer Sola Vuna - who has developed the choir's creed: one band, one sound, one family, one love.</p>
        
            <p>"We carry that motto everywhere we go," Vuna explains. "When we get to perform, they're songs that reflect our ancestors… we perform from the heart.</p>
        
            <p>"The technical aspect comes afterwards - when you feel the music, it can touch every single soul out there. That's the purpose."</p>
        
            <p>Student Louise Ponifasio told The Big Idea: "It's a huge privilege to be participating at the World Choir Games, especially for us as students. There aren't many of us Polynesians competing at this event. It's a global event and I think it's really important to us to represent our culture and put ourselves on the map.</p>
        
            <p>"To have these opportunities for our kids, especially from South Auckland, it's huge for them to expose their talent, their gift that they've developed at home, at church, in their surroundings and in their cultures."</p>
        
            <p>Competing in the Secondary Schools Championship category, the competition is steep - on a global scale. Rewaken Polycation Choir is the last school to perform in their session.</p>
        
            <p>When the choir hit the Auckland Town Hall stage, those in attendance offered polite, hometown applause and waited in silence. As soon as they opened their mouths, there was an energy and uplifting sense of joy that kept the entire audience captivated throughout.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from their wonderful skills, one aspect that stood out was the lack of presence from their choirmaster. While every other group from around the world that afternoon had their director front and centre - performing the usual conducting role - Vuna was to the side or in the background, showing immense trust in his young charges that gave them the impetus to back themselves on their biggest ever stage. Their soulful, gospel-inspired song was led in charismatic fashion by young Charlie Miller and if you looked closely, you could just spot Vuna at the rear of the stage, beaming with pride and swaying to the sounds of their passionate closing number full of Polynesian flair.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd response was organic and powerful as applause rippled through the famous venue, invoking raucous cheers and a standing ovation. As they left the stage, you could see in their eyes what it meant to these young men and women.</p>
        
            <p>But perhaps the most spine-tingling acknowledgement came as they re-emerged into the foyer, where there was a spontaneous performance at the encouragement of their American contemporaries. The energy was unchained, wholesome and electric - Rewaken Polycation choir couldn't believe that those who travelled from the other side of the globe couldn't get enough of them.</p>
        
            <p>This event was about bringing the cultures of so many to Aotearoa - but some of the stars of the show turned out to be those putting the culture of Aotearoa on display to the world.</p>
        
            <p>Rewaken Polycation Choir were awarded silver for their stunning performance - just 0.25 points away from gold - in a result that was met with huge pride. It was one of 13 medals won by New Zealand choirs from a total of 131 medals across the course of the 11-day event.</p>
        
            <p>There are more big choir events to come in their calendar, but this achievement against the best in the world will be a memory these talented teens can take forward into whatever creative venture their future holds.</p>
