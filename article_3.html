            <p>The partner of an Australian diplomat taken into custody in Wellington following a post-rugby game brawl has pled guilty to assault.</p>
        
            <p>The altercation occurred after the All Blacks beat the Wallabies in their Bledisloe cup match in the capital last September.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who was aged 37 at the time, yelled a homophobic slur at police officers before insisting he had diplomatic immunity, and was filmed by a member of the public.</p>
        
            <p>Diplomatic staff and their families are granted immunity from arrest or prosecution, and cannot be detained or subpoenaed as a witness, with the intent of keeping them safe in countries where justice systems might have a history of unfair trials, or use the death penalty.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian authorities later waived that immunity and in October 2024, he was charged with assault,</p>
        
            <p>He pled guilty in the Wellington District Court on Thursday, but has interim name suppression until sentencing, which is scheduled for 3 April.</p>
