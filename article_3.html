            <p>All Blacks star Will Jordan is backing the idea of a Super Rugby draft, and would like New Zealanders to be able to play for Australian sides without affecting their eligibility for the national side.</p>
        
            <p>After a test season with the All Blacks and a summer break, Jordan is back with the Crusaders and he's raring to go after missing all of last year's Super Rugby Pacific with injury.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been probably 18 months now since I put on the Crusaders jersey and I'm excited by the new year ahead. It's a team that I'm extremely passionate about and we've got a great group coming through."</p>

            <p>Last year's Super Rugby season wasn't a bad one to miss for the 26-year-old, with his beloved Crusaders - who had won seven titles in seven years prior to 2024 - failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 2015, finishing ninth with just four wins from 14 games.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan said the players and coaching staff were determined not to let that happen again.</p>
        
            <p>"There's obviously a little bit of hurt from last year and it's in the back of everyone's mind and provides a fresh challenge and perspective for the group.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a clean slate, but you want to harness a bit of that hurt as well. For us it's about making a few changes and trying to stay ahead of the game and trying to put a bit of pride back in this jersey, which has had a pretty good run over the last 25 years or so.</p>
        
            <p>"There's huge amount of motivation in the group."</p>
        
            <p>Jordan is confident the 2025 Super Rugby season will be a close-fought affair and hopes some rule changes and promotional drives will help increase interest in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's gonna be a hugely exciting comp. Some new rule changes have come in to try and promote the game and have it played at a faster pace. And there's a few initiatives… Fantasy as well, which hopefully will drive a bit of fan engagement.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the comp's in a decent place as we start the year, and the onus is on the players to go out there and produce a product that excites the fans and gets people both watching on TV and down at the ground."</p>
        
            <p>Jordan understood Super Rugby had a fight on its hands to increase both crowd numbers and viewership figures, and the All Blacks fullback believed introducing a draft system could help.</p>

            <p>Many pundits believed evenly spreading the best young players from across Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands (and possibly Japan) would create a truly competitive Super Rugby, with the draft concept becoming increasingly popular.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the stuff around the draft, it obviously creates a huge amount of excitement and equity across the competition right? You see it in American sports a lot and it does add a lot of excitement," Jordan said.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby Australia boss and former Wallabies loose forward Phil Waugh was keen on the idea, vowing to discuss the concept with his New Zealand Rugby (NZR) counterpart Mark Robinson.</p>
        
            <p>NZR Player Association chief executive,Rob Nichol was also a fan, though he's said previously that some conditions would need to be in place.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan understands the potential obstacles, including New Zealand Rugby's policy to bar national selection for players if they're not contracted domestically, a rule aimed at preventing an exodus of players and weakening local competitions.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a few challenges in there around logistics of the Players Association and guys getting shipped off and all that. So I think there's a bit of work that would have to go into it. I'm not sure it's something that would necessarily come in, but you never know," Jordan said.</p>
        
            <p>NZR's All Blacks selection rules have been thrust into the spotlight in recent times, with All Blacks coach Scott Robertson publicly voicing his desire to review the current policy. He favours a South African type model, where players who have reached a certain number of tests can ply their trade overseas and still be eligible for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan thinks allowing New Zealanders to play for Australian Super Rugby sides could be the way forward.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of the eligibility it's obviously been a hot topic of conversation over the last few months. I could see it getting to a point where maybe you could play for any Super Rugby team and still be eligible for the All Blacks. It would create diversity across the comp having a few Kiwis playing over in Aussie or vice versa.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how far away that would be or if that's something that's realistic. I know New Zealand rugby have got a pretty strict policy at the moment and that's something that's held them in good stead over the last 25 years as the game's gone professional. There's a bit of water to go under the bridge there, but you've got to look at ways to keep the game exciting at a franchise level and keep it in the news and being talked about."</p>
