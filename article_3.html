            <p>US Olympic skateboarding medallist Nyjah Huston says his Paris medal is "not as high quality as you might think".</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old secured a bronze medal following a nailbiter final at La Concorde last Monday, which saw his US teammate Jagger Eaton claim silver and Japan's Yuto Horigome take home gold.</p>
        
            <p>"These Olympic medals look great when they're brand new, but after letting it sit on my skin with some sweat for a little bit, and then letting my friends wear it over the weekend, they're apparently not as high-quality as you would think," Huston said in a video posted to his Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>Holding it up to the camera to display the deterioration, Huston exclaimed "look at that thing - it's looking rough".</p>
        
            <p>"Even the front is starting to chip off a little."</p>
        
            <p>"I don't knowâ€¦ Olympic medals, we gotta step up the quality a little bit."</p>
        
            <p>In a later post to his Instagram Story, he conceded "I guess medals are meant to be in cases. Not meant for the full send".</p>
        
            <p>He reshared a message from a follower who remarked "looks like you won that thing in 1982".</p>
        
            <p>Each Olympic and Paralympic medal awarded at the Paris Games is set with a piece of original iron from the Eiffel Tower - preserved during renovations of the landmark.</p>
        
            <p>Just over 5000 medals were made by the Paris Mint; 2600 for the Olympics and 2400 for the Paralymics.</p>
