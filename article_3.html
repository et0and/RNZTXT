            <p>A major fire north of Christchurch has been contained but Fire and Emergency continue to battle multiple blazes in the region.</p>
        
            <p>A vegetation fire broke out on Racecourse Road just outside Amberley. It has burnt through grass, tree stumps and car wrecks.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it has been contained to an area 1km long and 600 metres wide.</p>
        
            <p>It said multiple tankers and three helicopters responded when it was reported early this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Some residents on Racecourse Road have been evacuated from their homes and have been told they can go to the Amberley Library for support.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurunui District Council has asked those being evacuated to make their way to the library on Carters Rd in the town.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be further updates about an evacuation location as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation and patience," it said in a post on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions are hot and dry in the region, and Fire and Emergency said several appliances will remain on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the increasing winds it's likely that we will have crews on site through the night," FENZ said in a social media post.</p>
        
            <p>However, it said resources have been shifted to four other fires which continue to burn at Loburn near Rangiora.</p>

            <p>Crews are also fighting four vegetation fires on Loburn Whiterock Road, near Loburn.</p>
        
            <p>Eight fire trucks, three tankers and three helicopters are attending the Loburn fires which are estimated to cover about a square kilometre.</p>
        
            <p>Police are in the process of evacuating those affected.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby residents who may be affected by smoke should close windows and doors and reduce outdoor exercise, a FENZ spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are advised to call Healthline on 0800 611 116 if they have any concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The council has also appealed to residents in both Amberley and Loburn to limit their water use and not to turn on appliances such as washing machines.</p>
        
            <p>"We have diverted extra water supply to allow the emergency crews to fight the fire."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ has appealed to people to stay away from the scene of the fires so they do not hamper efforts to bring it under control.</p>
