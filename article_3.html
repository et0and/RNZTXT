            <p>Ronaldo became the world's highest-paid athlete after his move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr and Forbes said the 39-year-old's estimated total earnings were in the region of $US260 million ($433m), an all-time high for a football player.</p>
        
            <p>His on-field earnings amounted to $US200 million while his off-field earnings were $US60 million thanks to sponsorship deals where brands make use of his 629 million Instagram followers.</p>
        
            <p>Twice major winner Rahm joined LIV Golf in December in a big-money move that sent shockwaves through the sport after media reports said the current world number five would be paid at least $US300 million.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from that guarantee, Rahm has earned $US218 million and joins Ronaldo as the only two athletes to earn over $US200 million.</p>
        
            <p>Third on the list is record eight-times Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, who made a lucrative switch to Major League Soccer side Inter Miami, helping the Argentine World Cup winner earn $US135 million.</p>

            <p>The 36-year-old has earned $US65 million in on-field earnings but $US70 million off it thanks to deals with major sponsors such as Adidas and Apple.</p>
        
            <p>Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James is fourth at $US128.2 million and although the 39-year-old, the first NBA player to score 40,000 career points, is nearing the end of his career, the American is set to have one last crack at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo ($US111 million) of the Milwaukee Bucks rounds out the top five while France soccer captain Kylian Mbappe has dropped down to sixth ($US110 million).</p>
        
            <p>Mbappe announced he would be leaving Paris St Germain after seven years in the French capital where he became the club's all-time leading scorer and the 25-year-old is expected to join Spanish giants Real Madrid in the close season.</p>
        
            <p>Former PSG star Neymar, who also moved to the Saudi Pro League to join Al-Hilal, is seventh ($US108 million) despite sitting out the majority of the season with a torn ACL.</p>
        
            <p>French striker Karim Benzema, who also moved to Saudi Arabia, is eighth ($US106 million) on the list followed by Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry ($US102 million).</p>
        
            <p>Lamar Jackson is the only NFL player on the list in 10th place ($US100.5 million) thanks to the signing bonus that was negotiated into his new Baltimore Ravens contract last year.</p>
