        <h2>What an artist makes of King Charles' new portrait</h2>

            <p>Too much artist and not enough subject, is the verdict on the official portrait of King Charles III by Wellington artist Tatyana Kulida.</p>
        
            <p>The first official painted portrait of King Charles III since his coronation was unveiled at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>There has been a mixed reaction to the artwork which stands six feet high, a modern oil on canvas by artist Jonathan Yeo.</p>
        
            <p>The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones said it was a "masterpiece of shallowness by an artist so ludicrously upbeat he should be called Jonathan Yo!"</p>
        
            <p>Yeo has previously painted portraits of Tony Blair, David Attenborough, Prince Philip and Queen Camilla.</p>
        
            <p>Kulida has painted former prime minister Sir Bill English and primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, and isn't entirely convinced by the portrait either, she told Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"It's larger than life in every sense of the word. It's red, with the red colour coming forward a lot and his face getting lost, his face it's actually larger than life-size. So, there's a certain exaggeration happening," Kulida said.</p>
        
            <p>Artist Yeo has a distinctive bold style, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that was part of the artist's intention to make a statement and to be modern. In my opinion, when you're trying to do portraiture, the subject is far more important than your creative expression. So that's where I get a bit puzzled."</p>
        
            <p>Meticulous planning was involved when she embarked on a portrait, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I painted Dame Goodall, for example, I had to hire a body double and get everything worked out so that I could just place her in the setting."</p>
        
            <p>Then it was a question of capturing the subject's essence, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm trying to do is capture the person as faithfully as possible and just be available and present for who they are."</p>
        
            <p>The point of a portrait was to create an experience for the viewer, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really about conveying the presence of the person. I want to create an experience of that person being felt for the viewer. So, it's really quite different from photography, or any ways of making a face recognisable. A portrait is an experience within itself."</p>
        
            <p>And it was a vulnerable exercise both for the sitter and the artists, Kulida said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously as an artist you have to bring your A game and as the sitter you are risking to be seen as you truly are."</p>
        
            <p>Painting well-known people, she said, required a little digging, .</p>
        
            <p>"I'm certainly looking to find something that goes deeper than the surface image. I'm very much interested in the person. And I think a good artist is a lot more interested to discover something and reveal something that's very authentic about the sitter, rather than just simply echoing what the rhetoric may be."</p>
        
            <p>So, does Kulida believe artist Yeo manage this with Charles?</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's just a bit too much artist, and too little sitter."</p>
