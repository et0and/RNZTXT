        <p>
Te Wehi Ratana would be held in custody because no judge was available to hear a bail application, his lawyer said.

            <p>A man arrested after allegedly damaging a part of the Treaty of Waitangi exhibition at Te Papa will be held in custody until Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Te Wehi Ratana was charged with intentionally damaging an art installation after the protest at the national museum yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A wooden display panel showing an English version of the Treaty of Waitangi was damaged with spray paint and some kind of power tool.</p>
        
            <p>Ratana's lawyer, Seth Fraser from Liberty Chambers, confirmed the accused man would be held in custody because there was no judge available to hear his bail application.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime Ratana's wahine and his three tamariki would be "waiting patiently for their dad", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fraser said police opposed bail for Ratana.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Monday said 12 people had been arrested after the incident. Eight protesters were formally trespassed and released without charge.</p>
