            <p>The family of world champion cyclist Melissa Hoskins say they are devastated and struggling to process what has happened.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old former professional cyclist and mother-of-two died in hospital in Adelaide from injuries she sustained after she was struck by a ute on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband, former two-time world time trial Rohan Dennis has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, driving without due care and endangering life.</p>
        
            <p>The Adelaide Advertiser says detectives investigating the death of Melissa Hoskins will allege she was dragged some distance along the road by her husband's ute.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released through AusCycling the family said words could not convey their grief.</p>
        
            <p>She was the rock of her family and the family wanted to honour her memory so her two children would grow up knowing what she achieved.</p>

            <p>Her father Peter, mother Amanda and sister Jess said: "Words cannot convey our grief, sadness and the tragic circumstances of Melissa's passing.</p>
        
            <p>"Myself, Amanda, Jess and families, are utterly devastated and still struggling to process what has happened.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only have we lost a daughter and sister, her children have lost their mum, a freewheeling spirit, a giver with a big heart, patience and zest for life.</p>
        
            <p>"She was the rock of their life and ours and we need to honour her memory so they can grow up knowing who she was, what she stood for and what she gave to everyone whose life she touched.</p>
        
            <p>"The outpouring of sadness and support has overwhelmed us. In her short life Melissa has had so many positive touch points in and around the world."</p>
        
            <p>Her funeral will be held in Perth with a memorial service in Adelaide after the Tour Down Under.</p>
