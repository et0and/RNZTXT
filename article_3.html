            <p>Andrew Jury, one of the original grooms from the first season of Married at First Sight NZ, has died.</p>
        
            <p>An Instagram post shared by former contestants including Brett and Angel Renall and Benjamin Blackwell announced his death.</p>
        
            <p>"It's with the heaviest hearts we've come together to acknowledge the passing of Andrew Jury," the collective statement read.</p>
        
            <p>"We had the absolute pleasure of filming and participating in a show which leaves us intricately linked for a lifetime."</p>
        
            <p>"Despite his struggles, Andrew was always friendly and the life of the party during our shared experience and he really valued his time on the show.</p>
        
            <p>"At this time our entire cast wish to send our deepest condolences and love to his family - Ben, Angel, Brett, Vicky, Haydn, Lacey, Claire, Dom, Aaron, Luke, Belinda."</p>
        
            <p>The builder, then aged, 26 and based in Auckland, appeared in the first MAFS series in 2017, describing himself as outgoing, charming and spontaneous.</p>
        
            <p>He was matched with Vicky Gleeson-Stokes and the pair married, however the pair struggled to see eye to eye and didn't make it beyond the finale.</p>
        
            <p>A year later, Jury spoke out questioning the ethics of the show, which claimed to genuinely match people for love.</p>
        
            <p>He said he and Vicky were complete opposites and did not fit with what they had asked for and made accusations about the conditions contestants are put under while filming.</p>
        
            <p>MediaWorks and Warner Bros Discovery NZ have been approached for comment.</p>
