            <p>"All the kids in Palestine should be safe," says an eight-year-old who attended a picnic on Parliament's lawn along with other children, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 100 people attended the peaceful picnic on Parliaments lawn, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>About 50 soft toys were left behind as a symbol to represent children who have died in the war.</p>

            <p>Eddie Te Hōia, an 11-year-old spokesperson for the picnic, said he hoped the toys would send a powerful message to the government .</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping the politicians will have a change of thinking because seeing all the toys, even all the toys that come today probably won't be enough to represent all the children," Eddie said.</p>

            <p>The picnic had custom made colouring in books for the children but organisers were told by Parliament security it was not allowed because it verges on being pamphlets because of the information inside it.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think its right to take away colouring in even if it has information because it's just a colouring in book ... what harm can be done with children colouring in a book," Eddie said.</p>

            <p>Among the children was eight-year-old Aneva Read who wanted to show her solidarity with the children in Palestine.</p>
        
            <p>She said watching images of children dying on TV made her want to take a stand and do something.</p>
        
            <p>"Palestine is dying and I don't like Palestine dying, and I want them to be free," Aneva said.</p>
        
            <p>"All the kids in Palestine should be safe, and they shouldn't be dying right now."</p>

            <p>His mother Priya Patel said she brought her kids down because it was a child friendly event but still gave a powerful message at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>"I just can not believe that it's still happening. What's so disappointing is that, it's not like we don't know, we know very clearly what's happening and yet the Western world at least isn't standing up and saying 'This is not ok'. Regardless of the politics around it, people are dying and that should come first above anything else," Patel said.</p>

            <p>According to a Reuters report, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday some 25,490 Palestinians - many of them women and children - had been killed in the conflict since 7 October, and most of the 2.3 million population is displaced, causing a humanitarian disaster.</p>
