            <p>ACT leader David Seymour is spearheading a review of the hairdressing industry to address what he views as "unnecessary" regulations.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third sector review to be led by the Minister for Regulation, after the agriculture industry and early childhood education.</p>
        
            <p>"Hairdressers and barbers... make up a billion-dollar industry of more than 5000 mostly small businesses employing around 13,000 people," Seymour said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The review will seek to give the industry a regulatory 'buzz cut', as barbers and hairdressers deal with regulations which have been out of style since the '80s."</p>
        
            <p>He pointed to regulations that prohibited dogs, other than guide-dogs, from being inside a barber shop and banned refreshments from being served to customers having their hair cut.</p>
        
            <p>"These rules aren't making a practical difference to public health, but they are frustrating for business owners and customers," the minister said.</p>
        
            <p>Other regulations, which Seymour did not comment on, included requiring hair to be swept up at regular intervals and for hairdressers not to smoke tobacco at work.</p>
        
            <p>"The review will look at whether current rules are suited to a billion-dollar industry made up of mostly small businesses, while ensuring public health is protected," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a short and sharp review... The review is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2025."</p>
