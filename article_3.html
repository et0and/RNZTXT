            <p>Former Cabinet colleagues Winston Peters and Chris Hipkins have traded blows, after the NZ First leader accused Labour of abandoning workers, and blaming it for the recession the current government has to deal with.</p>
        
            <p>In his hour-long State of the Nation speech in Christchurch on Sunday, Peters mentioned Labour 30 times.</p>
        
            <p>He accused Labour of no longer representing workers, and that it was instead focused on "race, culture wars, rainbow wars, and Marxist ideals".</p>
        
            <p>He blamed Labour for the economy the government inherited, accusing Hipkins and Grant Robertson of a "litany of lies" for statements they made at the PREFU ahead of the election.</p>
        
            <p>"Within six months of that litany of lies, our country was suffering from the deepest and longest economic downturn and recessionary retraction for over three decades," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ after hearing the speech, Hipkins said New Zealand was poised for recovery when this government took office, and the recession was due to decisions it made.</p>
        
            <p>"If anybody knows how to tell lies about the New Zealand economy, it's Winston Peters. He's had a lifetime of experience," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>He said Peters had come back from the US seeking to emulate Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the fact Winston Peters spent the vast majority of his speech talking about Labour shows that clearly he's not particularly proud of the accomplishments of the government that he's a part of," Hipkins said.</p>

            <p>"This is the most right wing, pro-privatization, pro-neoliberalism government that New Zealand has seen in at least 30 years, and Winston Peters is integral to that government. He clearly doesn't want to talk about that, so he spends all his time talking about Labour."</p>
        
            <p>Peters did spend some time talking about actions New Zealand First has taken, or is intending to take, in government, such as fighting 'woke' banks, and fining people who do not use the bathrooms of their designated sex.</p>
        
            <p>He also spoke of the the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion targets in the public service, and the removal of relationship and sexuality education guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>He claimed the only reason New Zealand First voted in favour of diversity targets and relationship and sexual education guidelines when last in government was because Labour had kept the facts hidden.</p>
        
            <p>"You know full well it was during the full time of a Covid lockdown. We didn't have a chance to even be here, some of us, to get our head around it. And the moment we discovered what it was about, we went for it, and put out all the reasons why this introduction back in 2020 went so perversely wrong," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Former New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin was the minister responsible for introducing the education guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>"The trouble with being on this side of right is that you keep so much dubious company," Peters said, quoting Winston Churchill.</p>
        
            <p>"We all make mistakes."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether that meant Martin, who is no longer part of the party, was "dubious company," Peters said that was not what he meant.</p>
        
            <p>"That is not what the party at the time knew to be the case. My colleagues behind me will endorse that, and that's my position. I'm not ducking from it."</p>
        
            <p>He also criticised the Paris Agreement, which a National government signed New Zealand up to, though stopped short of saying New Zealand should withdraw.</p>
        
            <p>"Why are we making a rod for our own backs? Punishing our farmers and our taxpayers and our economy, when China or the US could sneeze and produce more CO2 overnight than we do in a year?"</p>
        
            <p>On their way in and out of the speech, attendees told RNZ they were hoping to hear Peters speak about a range of topics, including vaccine mandates, fluoridation, the gene technology bill, and pay equity for support workers.</p>
        
            <p>They did not get all of those things. But what they did get was a declaration of war.</p>
        
            <p>"To get to where we want to get to, we first have to deal with the plethora of malignant policies surrounding our nation, and stopping progress. We're going to declare a war on woke," Peters told the 800-strong crowd of supporters, and protestors.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' speech was interrupted seven times by protestors calling on him to take a stronger line against Israel.</p>

            <p>The deputy prime minister had anticipated disruption, writing attacks on them into his speech.</p>
        
            <p>"That's how communist, fascist and anti-democratic losers work. That's their idea of a hard day's work. Well, we have news for them, and it's all bad. As Elvis sang, 'looking for trouble, you've come to the right place,'" he said.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking outside, ahead of the speech, organiser John Minto said Peters was appeasing Israel by not speaking up.</p>
        
            <p>"They're terrified that if they draw attention to New Zealand standing up for human rights, and against what Israel is doing, that Donald Trump might impose tariffs on New Zealand. And that is not the reason we should not speak out," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Peters reiterated New Zealand supported a two-state solution, and again accused the protestors of fascism.</p>
        
            <p>Protestors for and against the ban on greyhound racing, which Peters has announced as racing minister, were also outside.</p>
        
            <p>Greyhound trainer Craig Roberts said he was "gutted" about the ban, and was hopefuly Peters would change his mind.</p>
        
            <p>"We're Winston's people. A lot of us helped him get in power, and we thought we'd be safe with Winston being minister of racing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Supporter of the ban Sarah Jackson was wary a large number of submissions opposing the bill would make Peters reconsider.</p>
        
            <p>"If we become complacent, and we think that everyone's against it and we don't do submissions, there's a chance," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Peters, however, seemed unlikely to change his mind, citing a number of reviews into the sport.</p>
