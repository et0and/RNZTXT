            <p>East Coast mayors have joined forces, calling for the government to make Eastern Institute of Technology (EIT) a standalone institution as part of its plans to disestablish Te Pūkenga.</p>
        
            <p>The government had been consulting on a re-designed network for institutes of technology and polytechs, with some standing alone, while others will come under a federated structure, supplemented by the Open Polytechnic.</p>
        
            <p>Last week the Tertiary Education Minister Penny Simmonds said she expected five or six institutes would be ready to stand on their own by January, with three more to follow by the end of next year.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay and Tai Rāwhiti's five mayors, iwi/hāpu representatives, business, and community organisations submitted a joint submission as part of the six-week consultation process, strongly advocating that EIT remains independent.</p>
        
            <p>The consultation process closed on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The group of mayors said that as one of the largest populations in the country without a university, EIT was critical to their recovery from Cyclone Gabrielle ensuring educational opportunities for key regional industries.</p>
        
            <p>These included horticulture and agriculture.</p>
        
            <p>"Since 1975 EIT has been an exemplar as a tertiary education and training provider, teaching around 12,000 learners each year.</p>
        
            <p>"Our regions have long faced challenges in reducing the number of youth not in employment, education, or training but EIT's broad offering of quality programmes have lessened those numbers. Without providing these options, young people in will leave the region."</p>
        
            <p>The mayors said returning EIT to a stand-alone polytechnic will ensure it will be able to provide students with more choice and flexibility to continue providing innovative learning.</p>
