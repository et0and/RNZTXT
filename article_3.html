            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency / Waka Kotahi has racked up more than $4.1 million in legal costs for the controversial Mt Messenger bypass project on State Highway 3 in Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>And documents released under the Official Information Act revealed it was still incurring legal bills of up to $100,000 a month.</p>
        
            <p>The figures, released to RNZ, show that more than half the legal costs by the end of December - $2.2 million - related specifically to appeals against Resource Management Act and Public Works Act decisions.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said the figures did not include staff costs or those of expert witnesses for preparing for or attending hearings.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, another release under the Official Information Act revealed Waka Kotahi had spent $172 million so far on the six-kilometre Mt Messenger bypass, which has a total price tag of $280m.</p>
        
            <p>The Taranaki farmer fighting the Public Works Act acquisition of his land on the project's northern boundary said battling Waka Kotahi through the courts had been exhausting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been bloody hard, but when you're right in what you are doing and because people in power are also telling you are right for what you are doing, how do you stop or when do you stop?" Tony Pascoe said.</p>
        
            <p>"Or do you turn away from how you've been brought up and taught about the right thing to do? Do you turn away from that and if you do how do you live with yourself afterwards?"</p>
        
            <p>Pascoe believed Waka Kotahi had not followed due process or negotiated in good faith when it first approached him about his land.</p>
        
            <p>"They told us how it was going to be. They told us what they wanted, they didn't ask us. They told us they wanted 144 hectares of my land out of the 155 hectares and that was the only way we were going to get a house or anything from it. On their terms."</p>
        
            <p>Pascoe said he was offered $600,000 for the land and a contribution towards a new house.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Taranaki Regional Explorer website, the Pascoe property - made up of two blocks totalling 255 hectares - had a capital value of $1.4 million.</p>
        
            <p>NgƒÅti Tama exchanged 20 hectares of Treaty settlement land required for the project for a 120 hectare coastal property, a cultural compensation payment of about $7.7 million and an environmental programme - including pest management in perpetuity on 3650 hectare of its rohe, costing $750,000 annually.</p>
        
            <p>Pascoe said he had spent thousands of dollars on legal advice, and it was only because of the support of others he was able to continue the fight.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a huge impact on us in many ways, but when you get your back pushed against the wall, you think well, hang on - a lot of people in New Zealand must go through this and don't have support and we've been lucky we've had support.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you try and do the right thing. You don't sleep at night, but you wake up in the morning and you hear the birds' chorus and you carry on."</p>

            <p>The Poutama Kaitiaki Charitable Trust was also opposed to the bypass route, preferring the option of upgrading the existing highway.</p>
        
            <p>Trust member Marie Gibbs wasn't surprised by Waka Kotahi's legal bill, which she felt was "par for the course" for a large project.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps more than they need to be because as far as we can see they haven't really followed due process, especially with the Public Works Act taking."</p>

            <p>She had no regrets about the cost to the public purse.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think anybody can have regrets for exercising their legitimate legal rights. These are really important issues and I think the expenditure by NZTA, that has been sanctioned by their board, the decision-making about that sits with them."</p>
        
            <p>Gibbs said the trust had paid out about $30,000 in court costs to Waka Kotahi for unsuccessful court appeals.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the trust was put into liquidation over unpaid legal costs owed to First Gas in an unrelated and ultimately unsuccessful legal bid to stop the company working on a pipeline in North Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Transport Minister Simeon Brown said he was frustrated at continuous court action delaying the project.</p>
        
            <p>"The Mt Messenger Bypass option was selected by the previous National-led government in August 2017, but has been continuously delayed by court action.</p>
        
            <p>"These delays are extremely disappointing and frustrating for the local community that want this important link between the Waikato and Taranaki completed. I share in this disappointment and frustration as minister of transport, and want to see this project completed."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said Waka Kotahi was giving him regular cost and completion timeframes for the project.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agency was approached for comment.</p>
