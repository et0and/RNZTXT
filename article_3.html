            <p>One of the two men who died in the Gisborne mass brawl was celebrating his birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Posts on social media are paying tribute to Chrysler Stevens Mark.</p>
        
            <p>There are also a number of tributes to the other man Kane Taare-Gray, who is pictured online wearing a Black Power vest.</p>
        
            <p>In a police news conference on Monday afternoon, Detective Inspector Dave de Lange said police had identified more than 40 witnesses of the 100 people at the party on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>The 21st birthday party had erupted into a brawl after two uninvited guests arrived, police previously said..</p>
        
            <p>A 29-year-old charged with wounding with intent following the brawl was one of the uninvited guests.</p>
        
            <p>Another uninvited guest sustained critical injuries in the brawl. They were in a stable condition in hospital on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Two other people also remained in hospital - one in a critical condition, one in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>De Lange said there were people out there who knew what had happened and they needed to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>Police said while there were gang members involved, this was not an incident involving "rival gang factions".</p>
        
            <p>"This is a very complex investigation with dozens of witnesses to be spoken to and everyone involved remains committed to getting answers for the grieving wh훮nau and our community.</p>
        
            <p>"Again, if you were there on the night, or have information, please contact us as soon as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne residents are fearful for their safety following the incident, while neighbours say the wh훮nau who hosted the birthday party are good people.</p>
        
            <p>Police forensic teams were at the property on Monday, examining cars on the street and have been and coming and going from a number of homes inside the cordon on Lytton Road.</p>

            <p>Civil Construction worker Daniel Walters, who lives on Lytton Road, said a friend whose house is on a different street, but near where the party happened, decided to stay elsewhere out of fear for her safety.</p>
        
            <p>"She's been staying at her mother's for two days just cause they feel like it's unsafe and they haven't come back to the house yet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour of the wh훮nau who did not want her name used described the family as "lovely people" who sometimes take kina over to her grandmother.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were still awake on Saturday night when they heard the commotion outside.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a whole lot of people in the middle of the road, pretty much. Couldn't see much, it was pretty dark, no lights, just a whole bunch of people screaming, yelling."</p>
        
            <p>She said emergency services arrived within minutes.</p>
        
            <p>She had never experienced anything like this in the neighbourhood before.</p>

            <p>Supermarket worker Tione Williams Tamatea said the double homicide had been the talk of the town.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of chitter chatter in the supermarket about what happened - everybody's got their own little scenario about how it happened.</p>
        
            <p>She agreed the wh훮anau who held the 21st birthday party were good people.</p>
        
            <p>"They're a pretty good family. We've had no issues with them whatsoever," Williams Tamatea said.</p>
        
            <p>Extra police officers are patrolling the area, and armed police remain at Gisborne Hospital where three people are being treated for stab wounds, one in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Although the party involved Black Power gang members, police said the brawl was not sparked by conflict between rival gangs.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in or near the Elgin suburb where the party was held say they're concerned about the growing violence in the area.</p>
