            <p>A tramper in his 70s who was missing in the Tararua Ranges since Monday has been found, police have announced.</p>
        
            <p>He was found alive just before 7pm yesterday by family who were helping the search in the Ohau Gorge.</p>
        
            <p>He was airlifted to Palmerston North Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Ashley Gurney said: "We are so pleased to be able to share this news.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously he has been through quite an ordeal after spending close to three days in the Ranges, but the community rallied together determined for him to return home, and he will."</p>
        
            <p>The man was last seen on Monday and police, land search and rescue, search dogs and a team from Amateur Radio Emergency Communications had assisted with the full-time search.</p>
        
            <p>Private helicopters, as well as a Royal New Zealand Airforce chopper, supported the operation from the air.</p>
