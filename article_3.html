        <h2>Gym, day job, training - The reality of playing hockey for NZ</h2>
        <p>

            <p>When you think of elite athletes, you might imagine flash cars, million-dollar endorsement contracts and sponsorships - but that's not always the case.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, the Black Sticks national men's hockey team know a thing or two about work-life balance, with the sport being amateur here in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The side qualified for the Paris Olympics at a tournament in Oman in January. First Up went along to its first Olympic training camp.</p>
        
            <p>Looking around, there are a lot of fresh faces, with all but four of the Black Sticks main squad over in Europe playing club hockey.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Greg Nicol says while it makes continuity difficult, it does have some positives.</p>
        
            <p>"They get to play a high level of hockey every week and make some money. Then they come back into our environment and bring some of the stuff they've learned [over here].</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes we want them to be available for a bit more, but it's how the system runs now. So I'm really pleased that these guys get a chance to make a living playing hockey."</p>
        
            <p>Nicol says in any given year, between 10 and 15 Black Sticks players head overseas to play professionally.</p>
        
            <p>It means this training camp is full of fringe and development players.</p>
        
            <p>"It provides us with an opportunity to have a look at the next tier of athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some guys here coming to their first Black Sticks camp, and then there's a few who've maybe had a few chances before.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a chance for us to see where they're at and where they're going to challenge for positions moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>Black Sticks striker Jacob Smith debuted back in 2012, and was a senior member of the team that got through Olympic qualifying.</p>
        
            <p>He says the celebrations in Oman were short-lived.</p>
        
            <p>"I went straight back to work - I'm full-time lawyer by trade.</p>
        
            <p>"So yeah, we sort of go back to reality. We gym in the morning and we train at night or vice versa.</p>
        
            <p>"Saturdays and Sundays are normally training as well, and we squeeze in one day off a week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tough gig juggling both, and one of the cool things is when we travel, you get to focus on one thing and it makes it a bit easier."</p>
        
            <p>In the past, Smith has lived abroad playing in Belgium for Royal Herakles and for Pinok√© in the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>He says time spent over in Europe is more about the hockey than the pay.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not saving for our retirement with that career choice, but it is an epic lifestyle.</p>
        
            <p>"You go into a professional environment where you are paid to train and play. So that's your sole focus, and you're living in a foreign country and you're often with some of your mates, so it's a pretty cool experience overseas."</p>
        
            <p>The core Black Sticks squad receive a small retainer, and costs are covered and day rates apply when players are in camp or on tour.</p>
        
            <p>Smith says balancing full-time work with international hockey isn't straight forward.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have a lot of downtime. You do have to be very particular with that and you make other sacrifices in your social life and other aspects like that.</p>
        
            <p>"But we do find balance. You often have lots of close friends who do the same thing, so we're all going through those experiences and sharing them together.</p>
        
            <p>"But yeah, the the answer is, when you're on, you're on and when you're off, you've really gotta switch off and and make the most of it."</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeeper Leon Hayward is not shy in saying he would love to make more money playing hockey.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't get paid like Beauden Barrett, which is unfortunate! If anyone does want to pay me, I'm here. I can [take] cash and cheques, if you like.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really difficult being in a sport like hockey where there's so much time given to it and there's not that much money."</p>
        
            <p>Up until a couple of years ago when there was more funding, the Black Sticks ran a centralised training programme, with New Zealand-based players training in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the squad members train in their respective regions, and come together for camps like these.</p>
        
            <p>Hayward, originally from Darwin, is now based in Perth with his girlfriend's family.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a bit of a strange concept ... to be decentralised like this, but I think it's actually a pretty good move from Hockey New Zealand to allow people to go do that.</p>
        
            <p>"There's guys over in Europe making some pretty good money and playing some very good hockey, so that's a hard thing to say no to.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, [training] for me looks like a lot of lonely runs at the moment and getting back into things in Perth with the hockey scene."</p>
        
            <p>Hayward played for Australia at the beginning of his career, but got a second chance at international hockey when the selectors realised he also had a New Zealand passport.</p>
        
            <p>His younger brother Jeremy plays for Australia, which makes for an interesting family dynamic when they go head to head.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cool to play against him - a really weird and happy sort of time. But my parents wear black shirts when we play against Aussie, that's for sure."</p>
        
            <p>The veteran goalkeeper isn't getting ahead of himself though, and knows selection for Paris is still very much up in the air.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of really good goalkeepers, so it's not as if I'm in the team just now.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping it will go that way, and I'm sure my mum and dad will be there and they'll be super stoked to see me and Jeremy playing against each other."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Sticks head to the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia next month.</p>
