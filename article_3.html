            <p>Tens of thousands of people turned out to watch King Frederik X succeed his mother as the monarch of Denmark, in a historic moment for the nation.</p>
        
            <p>Blinking back tears, King Frederik told a cheering crowd outside Christiansborg Castle that he hoped to become "a unifying king" for the future.</p>
        
            <p>He also praised his mother, who formally abdicated an hour earlier, ending exactly 52 years on the throne.</p>
        
            <p>She is the first Danish monarch to voluntarily abdicate in over 800 years.</p>
        
            <p>Despite being billed as a low-key affair, a sea of people gathered outside Christiansborg Castle to witness the succession on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking the words, "Long live king Frederik the tenth" three times in a ceremony on the balcony of the palace, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen proclaimed Frederik as the King of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.</p>

            <p>In his first speech to the people, King Frederik said his task of becoming "a unifying king of tomorrow" is something he has approached all of his life.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a task I've taken on with pride, respect and joy."</p>
        
            <p>He added that his mother would always be remembered as an "extraordinary" regent.</p>
        
            <p>King Frederik appeared to grow emotional at the sight of the crowd, wiping away a tear as he took in the celebratory spectacle.</p>

            <p>He was joined on the balcony by their four children, including 18 year-old Crown Prince Christian, the new heir to the throne.</p>
        
            <p>And a kiss between King Frederik and his wife, the Australian-born Queen Consort Mary, was met with whoops and cheers by the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Crowds lined the streets across the city to bid farewell to Queen Margarethe - who was the world's only remaining female sovereign.</p>
        
            <p>The 83-year-old revealed her unprecedented decision to step down during a live televised address on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>In the broadcast, she revealed that the decision was made after a period of reflection following surgery on her back in early 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation," she said, offering her thanks to the Danish public for their support over the years.</p>
        
            <p>She will keep her title as Queen, while the King's wife retains the title of Queen Consort.</p>
        
            <p>King Frederik, 55, now helms Europe's oldest monarchy.</p>
        
            <p>The British monarch King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla sent their best wishes to new monarch, paying tribute to the "many years of service" Queen Margarethe had given to Denmark.</p>
