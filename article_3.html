            <p>The Chatham Islands are critically low on fuel and while a back up boat with limited supplies is due to arrive tomorrow, locals are pleading for a long term solution.</p>
        
            <p>Its power supply was being fuelled by diesel and there was about a week's worth left.</p>
        
            <p>Petrol and LPG supplies ran out several weeks ago. The diesel pump for people to stock up their own generators and the likes of farm equipment was also out.</p>
        
            <p>The island's regular supply vessel Southern Tiare is out of action for planned maintenance for several more weeks, meanwhile, a large barge carrying supplies from Auckland was turned around earlier this month because of weather.</p>
        
            <p>A back up boat, with limited supplies was to due to arrive from Nelson tomorrow at lunch time.</p>
        
            <p>Chathams Island Mayor Monique Croon told Checkpoint the situation was "grim".</p>
        
            <p>She said it was not just fuel supplies the island needed, but the Southern Tiare also moved stock for farmers to sell.</p>
        
            <p>"Farmers haven't been able to move stock since March so they haven't had an income, so there's a whole other bit of work that's needed to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"The trouble with the Chathams, with the ... wharf, it's quite a shallow wharf and it can only accommodate a ship up to 17 metres long so most ships are too big, so finding another vessel or alternative is something that's being worked [out] currently."</p>
        
            <p>The island needed a solution "very quickly" because the Southern Tiare was 38-years-old, said Croon.</p>
        
            <p>"[The Southern Tiare's] not in the best of conditions ... we don't expect her to last much more than 18 months, so we need a solution or a ship within the next six months to a year."</p>
        
            <p>Croon said the last government had agreed to provide funding to build a new ship, but that was not currently an option.</p>
        
            <p>They did receive $35 million in 2022, which has partly been spent on surveys to keep the Southern Tiarre going, with the rest going to a replacement vessel or service, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Chathams had reset a relationship with the new coalition government and they were working with the Ministry of Transport, which was "well-aware" of the situation, Croon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not want to be in this situation again - ever, and certainly want a solution as soon as possible, so that farmers can farm, people can [go] fishing, people can drive to work and have confidence in fuel supplies."</p>
