            <p>Debt-to-income (DTI) rules are likely to hit investors harder the first-home buyers, as interest rates fall further over the coming year.</p>
        
            <p>DTIs took effect in July, but at that point high interest rates were more of a restraint on borrowing.</p>
        
            <p>As rates ease, that could change. Corelogic economist Kelvin Davidson says they could become a greater consideration by the middle of next year.</p>
        
            <p>But he said it was normally investors who were pushing the boundaries of what would be allowed.</p>
        
            <p>The rules mean banks can only lend 20 percent of new borrowing to owner-occupiers with debt that is more than six times household income, and to investors with debt that is seven times income.</p>
        
            <p>Other debt, such as student loans, is included in the calculation.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said it was a significant change for the property market.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a landscape shift compared to previously when interest rate falls lead to bigger loan sizes and put upward pressure on house prices. It is a pretty big change and it will take some time to get used to it."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was likely banks would reserve the 20 percent they were allowed to lend at higher DTI ratios for more expensive markets.</p>
        
            <p>"DTIs are about financial stability not targeting the housing market specifically."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said DTIs might not improve housing affordability in absolute terms but they could help keep prices at a better level than otherwise.</p>
        
            <p>He said investors tended to borrow at higher DTIs.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if you take into account their cap is a bit higher, in 2020 and 2021, 40 percent of investors borrowed at a DTI above seven, whereas 20 percent, 25 percent of first-home buyers borrowed at a DTI higher than six. At the point where loans were largest in relation to incomes, or where it would have had a more significant impact if DTIs already existed, not many first-home buyers would have found themselves battling but a decent chunk of investors would have."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said DTIs would slow the rate at which investors could build their portfolios.</p>
        
            <p>"If you already have a house with a mortgage against it and one rental or two you might be tapped out on debt until such a time as you can grow your income. It's a slower process than the ability to buy under things like LVRs."</p>
        
            <p>New builds will be exempt.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent data showed 2 percent of first-home buyer borrowing and 3 percent of investor borrowing was at high DTIs.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said they were being held down by the still-elevated test rates used by banks to check that borrowers could afford a loan.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, there's also a sense that some borrowers don't want mega loans anyway (due to job concerns for example) or actually need them either, given that national property values are still 18% below their post-Covid peak."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Property Investors Federation spokesperson Matt Ball agreed DTIs would have an effect next year if the housing market picked up as expected.</p>
        
            <p>"When the banks hit their limits, it will affect all buyer categories, especially in Auckland and any other regions where house prices are high relative to income."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Property Investors Association general manager Sarina Gibbon said the DTIs were a responsible approach to prevent house prices becoming a "runaway train" in future cycles.</p>
        
            <p>"What's interesting is that while property investment remains a valuable pathway to building wealth for New Zealanders, we have to acknowledge a fundamental truth - you typically need to be able to step onto the housing ladder before you can consider building an investment portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>"So these lending frameworks, including DTIs, actually help create a more balanced market where first-home buyers have a fair shot at entering the market. This balance is crucial for the long-term health of our property sector and the financial well-being of all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>Squirrel mortgage advisers said they could affect lower-income households more because those borrowers might be more likely to have consumer debt such as car loans and personal loans.</p>
        
            <p>"They are also likely to hit high-end, where income cannot be verified, and carry high credit card limits."</p>
