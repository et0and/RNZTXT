            <p>Police say illegal street racing took place across Auckland Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>About 200 vehicles were involved, splitting into smaller groups across Penrose, Onehunga and Westgate.</p>
        
            <p>Police said just after midnight, a car with three people was seen running a red light on Bush Road in Albany. The driver then fled from police.</p>
        
            <p>Three young men were taken into custody when the vehicle eventually stopped on Henderson Valley Road in West Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The trio, aged 16,18 and 20, are due to appear in court this week.</p>
        
            <p>Two others were taken into custody, but not charged, after a different vehicle was seen driving dangerously earlier in the evening, and then spotted in Karaka about 3am.</p>
