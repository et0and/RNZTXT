            <p>The reopening of State Highway 1 over the Brynderwyn Hills will be delayed by a number of weeks due to an active slip.</p>
        
            <p>The section of highway was damaged during last year's Cyclone Gabrielle, and had been closed for repairs since mid-February.</p>
        
            <p>The critical Northland highway was due to fully reopen on the 13 May.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA Waka Kotahi says there was a slip over the weekend and it has continued moving over the last couple of days.</p>
        
            <p>A substantial amount of material fell on Tuesday, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said it was still in the early stages of assessing the best solution, and would confirm more details as soon as it could.</p>
