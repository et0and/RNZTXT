        <h2>UK travel no longer visa-free for Kiwis</h2>
        <p>
From 8 January, New Zealand citizens wanting to travel to the United Kingdom will need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation before leaving home.

            <p>A travel agent says new rules for New Zealanders wanting to visit the United Kingdom could prove costly if people are not aware of them.</p>
        
            <p>From January, people wanting to travel to the UK will need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) as the country digitises its border and immigration system.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone wishing to travel to the UK - except British and Irish citizens - will need permission to travel in advance of coming here. This can be either through an ETA or an eVisa," the UK Home Office said.</p>
        
            <p>Eligible citizens outside of Europe could apply for an ETA from 27 November 2024, and it would be compulsory from 8 January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Those Kiwis with European passports, however, would have until 2 April 2025, with applications open from 5 March 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Flight Centre NZ general manager Heidi Walker said previously New Zealanders had been able to enter the UK for six months without a visa.</p>
        
            <p>All that was required then was an onward ticket and sometimes proof travellers could support themselves financially in the UK over that period, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's very easy for New Zealanders to currently travel to the United Kingdom."</p>
        
            <p>Although the cost for the new eVisa or ETA was relatively small at Â£10 (NZ$21), Walker said it could get costly if travellers were not aware of the rule change.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've planned your holiday yourself, unaware that you require a visa and then you go [to check in], you could be denied boarding, which obviously is an extremely costly mistake for travellers to make," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The visa application was expected to take around three days to process.</p>
        
            <p>The UK Home Office said ETAs were digitally linked to a traveller's passport, so they ensured more robust security checks were carried out before people began their journey to the UK, helping prevent abuse of their immigration system.</p>
        
            <p>"Digitisation enables a smooth experience for the millions of people who pass through the border every year," the British migration minister Seema Malhotra said.</p>
        
            <p>"The worldwide expansion of the ETA demonstrates our commitment to enhance security through new technology and embedding a modern immigration system."</p>
        
            <p>People living, working or studying in the UK would also now require an eVisa rather than physical documents.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said travel agents were seeing more countries using an electronic entry method, rather than the physical passport stamping of years gone by.</p>
        
            <p>"This is really taking that process and doing it prior to boarding an aircraft to speed up the arrival into a country."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had also made recent changes to the fees it charged visitors, with its International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) jumping from $35 to $100 on 1 October.</p>
        
            <p>Its electronic entry fee - known as the NZeTA (New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority) - was remaining the same.</p>
