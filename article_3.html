            <p>Fans were treated to an unexpected pitch invader when Wellington Phoenix captain Annalie Longo's dog stole the show in the team's A-League clash with Canberra United.</p>
        
            <p>Sky commentator Jason Pine responded to the action unfolding on Sunday afternoon at Porirua Park, as the adorable pooch bounded onto the pitch and roamed freely for half a minute.</p>

            <p>"Well, while we're watching that - there's a dog on the pitch. You don't often see that, or certainly not at this level," Pine said.</p>
        
            <p>The experienced A-League broadcaster was the first to have an inkling who the dog might belong to.</p>
        
            <p>
Longo's dog stole the show, and had the crowd chanting along, as he joined the players on the pitch.

            <p>"I think that might be Annalie Longo's own dog," Pine said.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe she needs to go and get her."</p>
        
            <p>Multiple players chased the dog, before Longo gave it a hug and carried it safely off the park, all while the Phoenix fans in the Yellow Fever chanted along to the song, 'Who let the dogs out'.</p>
        
            <p>Finally the commentary team wrapped the action of the canine variety, with Pine noting in an amused tone: "This is indeed the best league in the world".</p>
        
            <p>But he wasn't done yet, later musing about the encounter on his X (formerly known as Twitter) account.</p>
        
            <p>"Never take the mic away from me. I absolutely love this league," he said.</p>
        
            <p>For the record, Canberra came away with the 1-0 victory, as Matilda's player Michelle Heyman scored the winner for the visitors in the 11th minute. This was a significant milestone, as the experienced Australian representative chalked up her 100th A-League goal.</p>
        
            <p>And while the Phoenix women are without a point after two rounds, they gained a raft of new fans after today's friendly action on the pitch.</p>
