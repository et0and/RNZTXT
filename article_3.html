            <p>An Auckland councillor is calling on people to support the world's biggest secondary school Pacific and Māori performance festival when it gets underway from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The ASB Polyfest will be held in south Auckland's Manukau Sports Bowl from 20-23 March. It will feature 239 performing groups from 69 schools across Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers say they expect a record 8000 secondary school students performing traditional Pacific and Māori song and dances.</p>
        
            <p>Manukau Ward councillor Alf Filipaina said people should get behind it and experience the wonderful atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing, it brings our communities together," Filipaina said.</p>
        
            <p>He remembered the beginning of Polyfest in 1976, when it was started at Hillary College (now known as Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate) in Ōtara, by a group of students and teachers.</p>
        
            <p>It began with just four schools, with students and teachers eager to demonstrate the pride of cultural identity.</p>
        
            <p>The festival's first ever competition winners were Māngere College, followed by Hillary College and Seddon High School (now known as Western Springs College).</p>
        
            <p>"Look what we got now, and how big it's grown. And the main thing is these students want to show off their culture and I think that is so cool."</p>

            <p>Filipaina said he was a part of the Polyfest when he started his career as a police officer, and was still involved as a councillor for Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"We see the benefits of it in our kids and our community. Tāmaki Makaurau, come down, you will enjoy it."</p>
        
            <p>Students will perform and compete in speech, song and dance across six cultural stages - Cook Islands, Maori, Niue, Samoan, Tongan, and a diversity stage comprising cultures such as Chinese, Fijian, Tokelau, Indian, Korean and Sri Lankan.</p>

            <p>Polyfest director Seiuli Terri Leo-Mauu said school entries have returned to pre-Covid numbers.</p>
        
            <p>The theme for this year's festival is "Me anga whakamuri kia kohe whakamua - looking to our past to determine our future".</p>
        
            <p>"It is our hope that our young people and schools will continue to draw on the stories of our ancestors to help them navigate their futures with a sense of self, a sense of belonging to something bigger and a sense of empowerment, knowing that the future is in their hands."</p>
        
            <p>ASB commercial partnerships executive manager Mark Graham said they were proud to support Polyfest.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been amazing to be part of this event over so many years and to see it progress into the festival it is today," Graham said.</p>
