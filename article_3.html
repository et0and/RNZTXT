        <p>
There will be a "real feel-good factor" at the fundraising concert, the former Christmas in the Park emcee says.

            <p>Ever wondered what happened to former New Zealand Idol host and Christmas in the Park emcee, Frankie Stevens?</p>
        
            <p>The entertainer now calls South Taranaki home, and has been calling in some industry favours for the Waverley Summer Jam on Sunday which he hosts.</p>
        
            <p>"This year we decided to go for it a bit stronger and so I hit up the Lady Killers - Jackie Clarke, Tina Cross and Suzanne Lynch from the Chicks - so they're coming down to join us.</p>
        
            <p>"Along with Sophie Toyne who's a very, very good country singer guitar player from Whanganui, so she's joining us as well as the Pātea Māori Club who speak for themselves, of course."</p>
        
            <p>Stevens said the idea for the annual fundraising concert was inspired by his time at Christmas in the Park and a desire to rally around his new home during the holiday season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be one hell of a Sunday afternoon with some great performers, great food and beautiful weather."</p>
        
            <p>Stevens would also be taking centre stage.</p>

            <p>"It's something I've got a little bit of experience with over a lot of years, mainly singing and musical stuff as well, so yeah, it makes sense for me to emcee seeing as I'm a local as well."</p>
        
            <p>Stevens said he was enjoying living in Waverley.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a background in Taranaki. My iwi is Te Atiawa. My grandfather spent a lot of time here and consequently I have a lot of whānau from one end of Taranaki to the other.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it was really a matter of where we parked up. My wife's family is from Whanganui originally and we got tired of the big smoke, let's put it that way, and I didn't want to do more travelling for work, so it was a toss of a coin sort of thing and Waverley came up. We love it here, it's great."</p>
        
            <p>The entertainer said the township was handy to Whanganui and only three hours from his old home town of Wellington if he missed the bright lights.</p>
        
            <p>He said Waverley was usually quiet, but Sunday's Waverley Summer Jam would be an exception.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hoping we get at least a couple of thousand people. I think it depends a lot on the weather like a lot of outdoor events.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some great performers, some great food stations, games for the kids. It's a family situation, you can bring a picnic, that sort of thing."</p>
        
            <p>Entry to the Dallison Park event will be free with a bucket going around collecting for the Whanganui Air Ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>Stevens promised the vibe at the event - which ran from 4pm to 8pm - would be chill and the entertainment outstanding.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be a real feel-good factor. It's part and parcel of who we are as people who live in South Taranaki and part and parcel of who I am as being part of Te Atiawa."</p>
