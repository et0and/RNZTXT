            <p>A Māori portrait by renowned artist Vera Cummings is set to return to New Zealand after at least six decades.</p>
        
            <p>The portrait was sold in the UK for NZD$3790 (1800 pounds) to an online bidder from New Zealand by Richard Winterton Auctioneers.</p>
        
            <p>It depicts a Māori man with a tā moko wearing a pounamu hei-tiki pendant.</p>
        
            <p>Cataloguer and auctioneer David Fergus said the previous owners of the painting were not aware of its importance, and did not know how it had travelled to the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the person that had originally owned it had passed away, and when they were clearing the house, they found the painting in a drawer. They'd never seen it before."</p>
        
            <p>He himself was not aware of its value at first glance.</p>
        
            <p>"It needs a good clean and there's a little bit of damage, and I wasn't expecting any high hopes for it. And then when I started researching through the art auction databases, I was stunned to find that she's highly regarded, and it's actually worth some money. It was a nice surprise."</p>
        
            <p>The winning bidder beating competition in Australia and Fergus said it was fitting that the portrait was going back to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know who has bought it personally, but I like to think that it will get shown to a wider audience once it does get back, because it deserves to be seen."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Vera Cummings was known for her portraits of Māori people.</p>
        
            <p>Fergus estimated the work was painted in the 1930s or 1940s, when Māori portraiture was not thought of as valuable.</p>

            <p>"It was painted at a time when new Zealand indigenous people were not thought of as being highly regarded at all. Most people thought they weren't worthy - 'why would you want to paint somebody like that, why aren't you painting the mayor?'"</p>
        
            <p>"So there's not many early portraits of indigenous Māori people."</p>
        
            <p>Cummings sold her portraits as souvenirs as they were not high value.</p>
        
            <p>"There's probably a few tucked away waiting to be discovered - but she wasn't a prolific artist," Fergus said</p>
        
            <p>Cummings was born in Thames in 1891. At the age of 11, she was one of the youngest students to receive a scholarship to attend Elam School of Fine Arts where she studied under renowned portrait artist CF Goldie.</p>
        
            <p>After graduation she continued to paint alongside Goldie and frequently depicted the same people, often elderly Māori from a hostel near the Auckland suburb of Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>She died in Auckland in 1949, aged 58.</p>
        
            <p>Her work 'Portrait of a Māori Woman' is part of the collection of the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki.</p>
