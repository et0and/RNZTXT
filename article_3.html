            <p>The latest round in the region's most dangerous rivalry appears to be over, for now.</p>
        
            <p>Israel still has not officially acknowledged that the attack in Iran in the early hours of Friday morning was its doing.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Iran's military and political leaders have downplayed, dismissed and even mocked that anything of consequence happened at all.</p>
        
            <p>The accounts over what kind of weaponry was deployed on Friday and how much damage was caused are still conflicting and incomplete.</p>
        
            <p>American officials speak of a missile strike, but Iranian officials say the attacks, in the central province of Isfahan and in northwest Tabriz, were caused by small exploding drones.</p>
        
            <p>"The downed micro air vehicles caused no damage and no casualties," Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian insisted to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency.</p>
        
            <p>But these simple quadcopters are Israel's calling card - it has deployed them time and again in its years of covert operations inside Iran.</p>
        
            <p>This time their main target was the storied central province of Isfahan, which is celebrated for its stunning Islamic heritage.</p>
        
            <p>Of late, however, the province is more famous for the Natanz nuclear facility, the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre and a major air base, which was used during Iran's 14 April attack on Israel.</p>
        
            <p>It is also an industrial heartland housing factories which produce the drones and ballistic missiles that were fired by the hundreds in Israel's direction last Sunday.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>So a limited operation seems to have carried a powerful warning - that Israel has the intelligence and assets to strike at will at Iran's beating heart.</p>
        
            <p>It is a message so urgent that Israel made sure it was sent before, rather than after, the start of the Jewish Passover, as was widely predicted by Israel watchers.</p>
        
            <p>US officials have also indicated that Israel targeted sites such as Iran's air defence radar system, which protects Natanz. There is still no confirmed account of its success.</p>
        
            <p>So this attack may also be just an opening salvo. But it was, for the moment, an unintended 85th birthday gift to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's official silence gave Iran's ultimate decision-maker vital political space. Tehran did not have to invoke its new rule that whenever its arch-enemy strikes, Iran will hit back hard, with the risk of sparking a perilous escalatory spiral.</p>
        
            <p>Iran is also basking in what it sees as its new projection of power.</p>
        
            <p>Hardline President Ebrahim Raisi did not even mention these most recent events in his Friday speeches.</p>
        
            <p>For the Islamic Republic, it is all about what it dubs Operation True Promise - its unprecedented onslaught against Israel in the dead of night last Sunday. He hailed what he called his country's "steely will".</p>
        
            <p>Iran has prided itself for years on its "strategic patience", its policy of playing a long game rather than retaliating immediately and directly to any provocations.</p>
        
            <p>Now, it is invoking "strategic deterrence". This new doctrine was triggered by the 1 April attack on its diplomatic compound in Damascus, which destroyed its consular annex and killed seven Revolutionary Guards, including its most senior commander in the region.</p>
        
            <p>Iran's supreme leader was under mounting pressure to draw a line as Israel ramped up its targets during the last six months of the grievous Gaza war.</p>
        
            <p>No longer just striking Tehran's assets, including arms caches, buildings, bases and supply routes on battle grounds like Syria and Lebanon, Israel was also assassinating top-ranking officials.</p>
        
            <p>A decades-long hostility, which had previously played out in shadow wars and covert operations, erupted in open confrontation.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Whatever the specifics of this latest tit for tat, there is a more fundamental priority for both sides: deterrence - a more solid certainty that strikes on its own soil will not happen again. If they do, there is a cost to pay, and it will hurt.</p>
        
            <p>For the moment there is an audible sigh of relief in the region, and in capitals far and wide.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's latest move, under anxious urging from its allies to limit its retaliation, will have eased this tension, for now. Everyone wants to stop a catastrophic all-out war. But no one will be in any doubt that any lull may not last.</p>
        
            <p>The region is still on fire.</p>
        
            <p>The Gaza war grinds on, causing a staggering number of Palestinian casualties.</p>
        
            <p>Under pressure from its staunchest allies, Israel has facilitated the delivery of greater quantities of desperately needed aid, but the blighted territory still teeters on the brink of famine.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli hostages have still not come home, and ceasefire talks are stalled. Israel still warns of battles to come in Hamas's last stronghold in Rafah - what aid chiefs and world leaders say would be yet another untold humanitarian disaster.</p>
        
            <p>Iran's network of proxies across the region, what it calls an "Axis of Resistance" stretching from Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon through Iran-aligned militias in Iraq and Syria, to the Houthis of Yemen, are at the ready, still attacking daily.</p>
        
            <p>In the last few weeks, simultaneously everything and nothing has changed in the region's darkest, most dangerous days.</p>
