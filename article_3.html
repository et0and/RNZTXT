            <p>Britain's Jack Draper honoured American tennis legend and US Open champion Andre Agassi via post-match footwear after his quarter-final win on Wednesday, but do not expect him to don those kicks on court in the semis.</p>
        
            <p>The 25th seed in the men's draw paused before an on-court victory interview to swap out his match sneakers for a pair of "hot lava" colored Andre Agassi Nike Air Tech Challenge IIs like the ones worn by the mulleted one in the 1990s.</p>

            <p>And while the style was on point, their performance might not be.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how the hell he moved with these shoes. Honestly, I can't imagine sliding in these," Draper said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he would play in them, he said: "Absolutely no chance."</p>
        
            <p>Draper's footwear fashion was the latest in a US Open brimming with on- and off-court shoe style, from Frances Tiafoe's custom-made Air Jordan lowtops to Naomi Osaka's match-worn Nikes with Harajuku inspired bows to match her tutu "super suit".</p>

            <p>Osaka also had bows on the back of her bomber jacket and tennis dress but the bold look was not only about image and style but rather her mental game.</p>
        
            <p>The four time grand slam champion has spoken of the challenges of performing the way she used to since returning from having a baby and told the New York Time fashion is one way she boosts her confidence during competitions.</p>
        
            <p>"When I wear what I feel is a good outfit, I definitely feel more comfortable," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The funky footwear has also extended to the volunteers with the ball crew also get colourful shoes.</p>
