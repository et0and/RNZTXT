            <p>A passenger onboard an Air New Zealand flight to Sydney that experienced engine trouble says the plane made a rapid descent.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ249 was about an hour into its journey from Wellington on Sunday when it had a problem.</p>
        
            <p>Ruth Ann Herd was a passenger on board the plane and told Morning Report she was having her dinner when the inflight entertainment stopped.</p>
        
            <p>"And then we dropped, then we descended and it was quite a rapid descent.</p>
        
            <p>"I looked out the window and I could see we were closer to the ocean then before and then we did a big swing and turned in another direction and I thought oh oh, we're being diverted or something."</p>
        
            <p>Other passengers told her they heard a grinding sound from one of the engines.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone thought they saw a bit of something coming away from the plane or smoke or smoke trail of some kind."</p>
        
            <p>Heard said initially passengers weren't told what was happened but she said that wasn't a bad thing, it was good not to cause panic.</p>
        
            <p>She said the airline put passengers up in overnight at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an inconvenience but I'd rather be able to tell the story about it."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said the engine was shut down, and the plane landed safely in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"As per Air New Zealand's standard operating procedures, the engine was shut down and the aircraft was diverted to Auckland where it landed safely just after 5.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The matter will now be investigated. The safety of our customers and team is our utmost priority."</p>
