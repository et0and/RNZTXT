        <h2>Kaiarahi hull repair work delayed due to weather</h2>
        <p>
The Kaiarahi was left with a large hole that spread across a meter in its hull after it smashed into a Wellington wharf when it came into berth last Sunday.

            <p>Bad weather has delayed repairs to the hull of the stricken Cook Strait Interislander ferry Kaiarahi and passengers are having to rebook on other ferries.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaiarahi was left with a large hole that spread across a meter in its hull after it smashed into a Wellington wharf when it came into berth last Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander had expected the ferry to be out of action for a week.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, KiwiRail says high winds and rain over the past couple of days has delayed work to repair the gash.</p>
        
            <p>"While we are tracking well with hull repairs, high winds and rain over the last couple of days have continued to delay the use of a crane and we are using temporary scaffolding to complete part of the repair work.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working around the clock to get safely back into operation."</p>
        
            <p>
The hole was about one metre across, the harbourmaster said.

            <p>Interislander was working to contact all its affected customers who were expected to travel early this week and work out new travel time options for them.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail's investigation into what led to the collision was ongoing.</p>
