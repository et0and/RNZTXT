            <p>Knight's Choice ridden by jockey Robbie Dolan has won the 2024 Melbourne Cup in a huge upset.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC is reporting it is a second win in the Melbourne Cup for New Zealand trainer Shelia Laxon.</p>
        
            <p>Warp Speed (Japan) has finished second and Okita Soushi (Ireland) was third.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-three years ago Laxon was the first female trainer to win the Melbourne Cup when Ethereal won the Caulfield-Melbourne Cup double.</p>
        
            <p>Now Laxon, whose husband Laurie trained Empire Rose to win the Cup in 1988, has become a two-time success.</p>
        
            <p> KNIGHT'S CHOICE wins the 2024 Melbourne Cup at 100/1 under Robbie Dolan for John Symons and Sheila Laxon! That was a cracking finish to the race that stops the Nation. #MelbourneCup #MelbCupCarnivalpic.twitter.com/JFlDPd27CJ</p>
        
            <p>She told Nine her co-trainer, John Symons, had always been confident despite Knight's Choice's outsider status.</p>
        
            <p>"He did, he did. He started the race, and he knew how to ride him. We didn't give him instructions, he knew what to do," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I love it being down for the Australians. The Australian horse has done it, and Robbie is Australian now as well, so I'm thrilled to win the Cup, and it is the people's Cup, and that's what it is all about."</p>
        
            <p>Knight's Choice becomes only the sixth Australian-bred horse to win since 1993, and the first since Vow and Declare in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Dolan told the host broadcaster, "Pinch me I think I'm dreaming."</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredible, I can't believe it, I don't even know what to say.</p>
        
            <p>"I watched every Melbourne Cup for the last 40 years the other night and I just thought my best chance was if I get him to stay the trip and hopefully he can rattle home and quicken up in good sections that he can do on a good track and he just proved everybody wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the biggest race in the world and to win it is just incredible."</p>
        
            <p>The race was the 164th held at the Flemington Racecourse in the Victorian capital.</p>
        
            <p>It included three New Zealand-trained horses - Sharp 'N' Smart, Positivity and Trust in You.</p>
        
            <p>There had not been three Kiwi trained horses in the race since 2009, and the last New Zealand owned and trained winner was Ethereal in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>The trio attracted significant interest from punters at the TAB, with a spokesperson noting it would have been a great result for bettors if a Kiwi horse crossed the line first.</p>
        
            <p>Sharp 'N' Smart was paying $41 for a win, while Positivity and Trust In You were both paying $81 each.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi horse racing fans were expected to spend up to $30 million on the event.</p>
        
            <p>A record contingent of four female jockeys were in the race, including New Zealander Winona Costin.</p>
        
            <p>Sixteen horses of the 24-strong field were bred in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        
            <p>Sharp 'n' Smart: 53.5kg The five-year-old gelding was a multiple group one winner with $3 million in winnings. He was trained by Graeme and Debbie Rogerson near Hamilton. Graeme Rogerson won the Melbourne Cup with Efficient in 2007. Sharp 'N' Smart won the New Zealand Derby in 2023. Finished third in its last start in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2400m). Expat Kiwi jockey Mick Dee riding.</p>
        
            <p>Positivity: Bred by the Hogans, the four-year-old mare made it into the field following the withdrawal of a number of other horses over the last week. She was trained by Andrew Forsman at Cambridge. Had four wins, including a 2000m race at Caulfield in September. Finished second in the New Zealand Oaks at Trentham in March. Was eighth of 10 runners in last start in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2400m)</p>
