            <p>Knight's Choice has won the 2024 Melbourne Cup in a huge upset.</p>
        
            <p>Warp Speed (Japan) has finished second and Okita Soushi (Ireland) was third.</p>
        
            <p>The race, the 164th held at the Flemington Racecourse in the Victorian capital, has just finished.</p>
        
            <p>It included three New Zealand-trained horses - Sharp 'N' Smart, Positivity and Trust in You.</p>
        
            <p>There had not been three Kiwi trained horses in the race since 2009, and the last New Zealand owned and trained winner was Ethereal in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>The trio attracted significant interest from punters at the TAB, with a spokesperson noting it would have been a great result for bettors if a Kiwi horse crossed the line first.</p>
        
            <p>Sharp 'N' Smart was paying $41 for a win, while Positivity and Trust In You were both paying $81 each.</p>
        
            <p>TAB spokesperson Matt Smith said if any of these horses won, it would be a solid payout for bettors.</p>
        
            <p>The largest bet as of midday was on Onesmoothoperator, with one punter placing $10,000 on it to win for a potential payout of $85,000.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi horse racing fans were expected to spend up to $30 million on the event.</p>
        
            <p>A record contingent of four female jockeys were in the race, including New Zealander Winona Costin.</p>
        
            <p>Sixteen horses of the 24-strong field were bred in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        
            <p>Sharp 'n' Smart: 53.5kg The five-year-old gelding was a multiple group one winner with $3 million in winnings. He was trained by Graeme and Debbie Rogerson near Hamilton. Graeme Rogerson won the Melbourne Cup with Efficient in 2007. Sharp 'N' Smart won the New Zealand Derby in 2023. Finished third in its last start in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2400m). Expat Kiwi jockey Mick Dee riding.</p>
        
            <p>Positivity: Bred by the Hogans, the four-year-old mare made it into the field following the withdrawal of a number of other horses over the last week. She was trained by Andrew Forsman at Cambridge. Had four wins, including a 2000m race at Caulfield in September. Finished second in the New Zealand Oaks at Trentham in March. Was eighth of 10 runners in last start in the Moonee Valley Gold Cup (2400m)</p>
        
            <p>Trust In You: Trained by Bruce Wallace and Grant Cooksley in Karaka. Thirty starts for four wins. Last race was a fourth place in the Group 3 St Leger at Randwick (2600m). Mark de Plessis riding.</p>
