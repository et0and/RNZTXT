        <h2>Delay in issuing new rating valuations for property owners in Wellington</h2>
        <p>
Updates are now due out in February instead of December thanks to a lack of sales data on vacant lots.

            <p>Property owners in Wellington City will find out their rating valuations later than expected, with updates now due out in February rather than December.</p>
        
            <p>They were due to be released this month, but there were some areas which did not have enough recent property sale data for vacant lots to enable a quick decision.</p>
        
            <p>The Office of the Valuer General (OVG) - the government body that oversees all rating valuations - has given property and valuation service Quotable Value (QV) more time to finalise its ratings.</p>
        
            <p>The council said in a statement the delay would ensure the valuations were "robust and comply with statutory standards", and QV operations manager James Wilson said it would ensure greater accuracy.</p>
        
            <p>He said capital values, which represented the total value of properties, had faced no significant issues as properties with homes on them had been selling more frequently.</p>
        
            <p>"We're taking a small amount of extra time to thoroughly review a number of values within Wellington city before resubmitting it for audit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to OVG workloads, and with Christmas in the middle, that will not be until early next year now."</p>
