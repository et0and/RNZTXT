            <p>Auckland's public hospitals were affected by a systems outage for over three hours this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2.30am and 6am some applications at Auckland City Hospital, Waitematā and Counties Manukau were impacted by the IT glitch, Health NZ Te Whatu Ora northern region deputy chief executive Mark Shepherd said.</p>
        
            <p>However, he stressed this was a case of simple software malfunction, with systems back up and running normally by 6am.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no evidence of any cyber security concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"Patients and staff all remained safe, and there is no ongoing risk to systems.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to thank our staff for responding quickly to the outage and extend our thanks to our patients and whānau for their understanding."</p>
        
            <p>In July, multiple clinical applications and services were unavailable in all four health regions across the country during the Crowdstrike IT outage according to a Health NZ Te Whatu Ora incident report obtained by RNZ.</p>
