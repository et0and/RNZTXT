            <p>A magnitude 5.0 earthquake has struck 25 kilometres north-east of Seddon.</p>
        
            <p>More than 11,000 people have reported feeling the earthquake, which hit around 5.49pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>It had a depth of 12 kilometres, and the shaking was "moderate", according to GeoNet.</p>
        
            <p>It was likely felt at the top of the South Island, and as far north as the Tararua District.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter in Wellington said the jolt was a quick and sudden fright, which had produced loud shaking sounds from the house and strong side to side movement, but was over very fast.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough mayor Nadine Taylor said it gave the cupboards a good rattle.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably quite a timely reminder to us all to stop, drop cover and hold if an earthquake comes through, we haven't had one through Blenheim for a wee while, so always good to have a reminder."</p>
        
            <p>She had not heard any reports of damage.</p>
        
            <p>A M4.9 earthquake occurred in the Cook Strait 5:49PM this evening. Moderate shaking was felt across the Wellington and Marlborough regions and we have received 10,000+ felt reports. For more detail, see https://t.co/fPsb7Yjwsu pic.twitter.com/7SjgRSOjPK</p>
        
            <p>The last time the region was badly hit was during the Kaik≈çura earthquake in 2016, which devastated homes in Seddon and Ward.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not unfamiliar with earthquakes," she said. "This one wasn't big, it was just a nice little roll."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington resident Lesleigh Salinger said she felt it in her Karori apartment.</p>
        
            <p>"I react in dread, waiting for it to get bigger and go on longer, but it didn't last too long. But it was a noticeable shake."</p>
        
            <p>Her first response was to check GeoNet, she said.</p>
        
            <p>As she grew older, she was becoming more nervous about earthquakes, she said - particularly when she was alone.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I've got a vivid imagination," she said, laughing. "I've got a colleague and friend, and she's a geogapher [...] and they don't worry her at all, but oh God, they certainly do me."</p>
        
            <p>She said she kept an earthquake kit in her car, including a sleeping bag, first aid kit, warm clothes and sensible shoes.</p>
