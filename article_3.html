            <p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, bidding to become her country's first woman to win an Olympic boxing gold medal, said she is proud for guaranteeing herself a medal amid a row over her eligibility for the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old beat Hungary's Luca Anna Hamori by unanimous decision in a welterweight quarter-final fight on Saturday to ensure at least a bronze medal - Algeria's first boxing medal since 2000.</p>
        
            <p>Khelif and a second boxer, Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, fell foul in 2023 of the International Boxing Association's (IBA) eligibility rules, which include preventing athletes with XY chromosomes from competing in women's events.</p>
        
            <p>Both boxers were disqualified at the 2023 World Championships in New Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>The IBA did not specify on what grounds they failed, and it has not been shown that they have a genetic condition giving rise to a difference of sexual development, or DSD.</p>
        
            <p>International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach on Saturday said there "was never any doubt" that Khelif and Lin were women who had every right to compete at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"There is not an easy pass in the Olympics, and I will try to be fully ready for the coming fight," Khelif told Algerian state television after her win.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very proud of myself and my country. I fight for my country flag and for a sport I love very much, and I hope to be an Olympic champion after winning a first medal in Olympic female boxing for Algeria, for the sake of the next generation."</p>
        
            <p>Khelif dedicated her medal to boxer Moustafa Mousa, the first Algerian to win an Olympic medal, who died on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune congratulated Khelif on her win in a post on X, writing: "You have honoured Algeria, Algerian women and Algerian boxing.</p>
        
            <p>"We will stand by you no matter what your results are. Good luck in the next two rounds."</p>
        
            <p>Algerian Sports Minister Abderrahmane Hammad said Khelif was "one of a kind".</p>
        
            <p>Khelif will face Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand, whom she beat at the World Championships in 2023 before being disqualified, in Tuesday's semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Suwannapheng beat defending champion Busenaz Surmeneli of Turkey in her quarter-final bout.</p>
        
            <p>"I know the Algerian boxer is very strong and I will try to watch her video to learn her tactics and correct mine," Suwannapheng said of Khelif.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if Khelif should be allowed to compete at the Olympics, the Asian Games silver medallist said: "I don't know but I'm not afraid to face her at this level. I will do my best."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Hamori said she lost fairly to Khelif after losing a unanimous decision in their quarter-final.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot say a single bad word about my opponent," Hamori, who hugged Khelif after the final bell, told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"The last few days have been difficult for everyone. I have respect for her, I don't have a bad thought for her, this situation is not her fault," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We both put up a fight, that's the way it is now, it could be different in the future. The situation has not ruined my Olympics at all."</p>

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni raised the issue with IOC chief Thomas Bach after Italian boxer Angela Carini pulled out during her round-of-16 bout against Khelif after sustaining a series of crushing blows.</p>
        
            <p>Balazs Furjes, Hungary's IOC representative, said there was never a question of Hamori not fighting Khelif.</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether he believed it was a fair fight, he said: "As loyal members of the international Olympics family, we are 100% convinced, 100% convinced that the International Olympic Committee will make the right decisions."</p>
        
            <p>"We Hungarians are always ready to fight bravely and that's what Luca has just done and showed us. We're not afraid of difficult circumstances and we are ready to fight even in difficult circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>Hamori added: "I wish good luck to my opponent and the others in the finals."</p>
