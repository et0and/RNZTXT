            <p>New Green MP Benjamin Doyle has taken "full responsibility" after not wearing a seatbelt in the back of a cab on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>They shared video on Instagram this morning, promoting their speech for this afternoon's third reading of the Taranaki Maunga Collective Redress Bill.</p>
        
            <p>It's clear Doyle is not wearing a seatbelt in the headshot video, which has since been taken down.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party musterer Ricardo Menéndez March said it would not happen again.</p>
        
            <p>"Benjamin made a mistake. They take full responsibility for it and will ensure it is not repeated."</p>
        
            <p>It comes a day after the Green Party criticised the coalition's move to lift speed limits on some stretches of state highway.</p>
        
            <p>The party's transport spokesperson Julie-Anne Genter said the change would kill people and ruin lives.</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March said the party stood by this criticism.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely critical that we address the systemic issues which can make our roads more or less safe for all of us. That's why we've been clear about the need for safe speed rules."</p>
        
            <p>Doyle entered Parliament in October.</p>
