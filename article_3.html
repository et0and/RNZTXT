            <p>Many Aucklanders are still waiting for closure two years after storms damaged thousands of homes throughout the city.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Shore suburb of Milford, damaged houses still dot the streets, marked for demolition after being bought out by Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>North Shore councillor Richard Hills said it remained one of the city's worst-affected areas, after torrential rain filled the Wairau Creek and submerged many streets on Auckland Anniversary weekend 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"The night of the floods this area was sort of under two metres of water in some cases," he recalled.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously on the surface it looks fine, on a sunny day you can't tell the damage that's gone through some of these homes. But this now is one of the highest, if not the highest, areas of buyouts."</p>
        
            <p>Four people died in the floods across Auckland as emergency services responded to about 700 calls for help.</p>
        
            <p>Milford Cruising Club commodore Andrew Robertson was shocked at the scale of the floods.</p>
        
            <p>"The boats were breaking their moorings in the marina, the floats were floating off the top of the poles," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"People were attempting to go through the floodwater, cars were breaking down within the floodwater."</p>

            <p>An independent review was highly critical of the council's initial response, one that Hills admitted was chaotic.</p>
        
            <p>"The report speaks for itself that we did drop the ball as a council family. It was chaos, we were trying to redirect buses, we were trying to get messages to people all over the shore," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a pretty scary time and the communication just was completely lacking that night."</p>
        
            <p>The recovery process was similarly controversial. Aucklanders voiced their frustrations at heated community meetings, sometimes cursing at council staff.</p>
        
            <p>Hills said staff took that on the chin.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my job and I don't mind, and I understand people's emotions. Definitely there were some of those early public meetings where people were very angry, were very confused, were very upset," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was swearing and other things. Other people just wanted answers. There was a real mix and you expect that in these sorts of situations."</p>

            <p>Lyall Carter, the chair of community group West Auckland Is Flooding, had since moved east to Maraetai.</p>
        
            <p>He recently visited his old neighbourhood, a "surreal" experience.</p>
        
            <p>"We were able to go back about a week or so ago to be able to see where our home once stood has started to return to nature and the concrete's been removed, the fences have been removed."</p>
        
            <p>Looking back, he said the community response had stuck with him.</p>
        
            <p>"Those groups that have been on the ground day in and day out, any time that our community has needed them and they've been there," Carter said.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot thank [enough] the countless people that put up their hand and said, in a time of crisis, in a time of personal crisis, they put up their hand and they said, 'hey, I'm willing to help out.'"</p>
        
            <p>After two years, Carter said many in his community had been able to put the traumatic event behind them.</p>
        
            <p>But others were still seeking closure, something he hoped they would find soon.</p>
