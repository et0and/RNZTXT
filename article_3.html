        <h2>Social cost of road crashes hit $10b</h2>
        <p>
Any increase speed limits could lead to more people being killed and seriously injured in crashes, a former road safety police officer says.

One of the points in the government's 100 day plan is to stop blanket speed limit reductions.

            <p>Road crashes are costing New Zealand in more ways than one. As the summer holidays roll in, a former top road safety cop wants everyone to slow down on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>The latest data from the Ministry of Transport shows the social cost of crashes was $9.77 billion in 2021 - 4 percent of gross domestic product or GDP.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was also far behind other countries with 7.3 road deaths per 100,000 people for 2022.</p>
        
            <p>That compared to 2.1 in Sweden and 4.5 in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive of Global Road Safety Partnership and former assistant commissioner of Road Policing David Cliff said any crash at more than 30 km/h increased the likelihood of serious harm, so one solution was to adjust speed limits.</p>
        
            <p>"If New Zealand were to take this bull by the horns and halve the trauma rate that's potentially around a $5 billion [a year] saving... Multiply that across 10 years you're talking about $50 billion. Huge opportunities for New Zealand to reduce its trauma levels."</p>
        
            <p>Research showed a 5 percent decrease in average speed led to approximately a 10 percent decrease in all injury crashes and a 20 percent decrease in fatal crashes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown has issued a directive to Waka Kotahi and councils around the country to cease blanket speed limit reductions.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Brown said work would begin on a new policy ensuring speed limits took into account travel times and the views of local communities as well as safety.</p>
        
            <p>Cliff said the government's plans to put speed limits back up in some areas may not be a good idea.</p>
        
            <p>"To move away from that is incredibly risky. New Zealand can't afford to have an increase in trauma rates through increasing speeds," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any calls to increase speed limits directly mean they're asking for more people to be killed and seriously injured in road crashes."</p>
        
            <p>It would also push up costs with more people having to use the hospital system, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport transport safety specialist Ping Sim said there had been 45 road deaths in Auckland alone so far this year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not our worst year on record, it's certainly not our best either. What we've really been seeing is drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians [as the] top three modes by harm this year to date."</p>
        
            <p>Last year the city had 49, however, there are 10 days left of this year.</p>
