            <p>Ardie Savea is shifting back to openside flanker for this weekend's test against France in Paris. With Sam Cane out with an injury, it is one of five changes Scott Robertson has made to his side that beat Ireland 23-13 last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It means there is a new look loose forward trio, with Wallace Sititi shifting to number eight and Samipeni Finau starting at blindside. Peter Lakai comes onto the bench as cover, with the other change in the forwards being Codie Taylor returning from a concussion stand-down to replace Asafo Aumua.</p>
        
            <p>Beauden Barrett also returns at first five after a head knock, with Cam Roigard winning the race for the halfback spot after a strong performance off the bench in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend's starting pairing, Cortez Ratima and Damian McKenzie, drop back to the bench despite McKenzie being named man of the match in the win over Ireland.</p>

            <p>Sevu Reece comes in on the right wing in place of the injured Mark Tele'a to complete the changes.</p>
        
            <p>Once again, there is no room for Ethan de Groot, who has been missing since breaking team protocol between the Japan and England tests.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaiti Williams has once again got the nod at loosehead, with veteran Ofa Tu'ungafasi backing him up. Tyrel Lomax and Pasilio Tosi will again share the tighthead duties.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks are currently three wins from three on their tour, with this match in Paris and then a meeting with Italy in Turin next weekend to finish off Robertson's first season in charge.</p>
