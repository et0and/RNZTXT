            <p>The Wallabies have signed another former member of the All Blacks coaching staff.</p>
        
            <p>Former All Blacks forwards coach Mike Cron has signed on with Australia Rugby and will assist the Wallabies new head coach Joe Schmidt - the former Ireland head coach and All Blacks assistant coach under Ian Foster.</p>
        
            <p>Cron spent 16 years and more than 200 tests in the All Black environment before stepping away after the World Cup in Japan in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Cron had been planning to retire after the All Blacks 8-7 win over France at the 2011 World Cup in Auckland but when Steve Hansen took over from Sir Graham Henry has was persuaded to stay on.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years Cron has been a consultant with World Rugby.</p>

            <p>"Mike has added tremendous value in every programme he has been involved with and brings a wealth of knowledge to our coaching group," Schmidt said.</p>
        
            <p>The Wallabies first test of the year is against Wales in July.</p>
        
            <p>They will take on the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship but that won't be until late September.</p>
