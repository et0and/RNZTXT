            <p>The past year has been one of two halves for the housing market.</p>
        
            <p>Property research firm CoreLogic said the first half was one of declining sale volumes and house prices, before the market found a floor halfway through the year.</p>
        
            <p>Sale volumes hit the lowest level in about 40 years in April, with a 12-month moving total of just 60,475 sales, while national property values fell 5 percent over the year earlier</p>
        
            <p>"The New Year will likely kick off positively in terms of mood, with a new property-friendly government looking to shorten the brightline test back to two years and steadily reinstate full mortgage interest deductibility," CoreLogic chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>He said investors may also return to the market in greater numbers as the housing market moves into its next phase.</p>
        
            <p>"This could start to pull some investment demand back into the market, and may see some existing investors find themselves off the hook for capital gains tax sooner than expected.</p>
        
            <p>"But even if some investors do start to buy again, it's not likely to be a torrent, due to low rental yields and high mortgage rates."</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, he said first-time buyers were likely to continue to benefit from market conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"First home buyers should still be able to find good opportunities, as they continue to benefit from accessing KiwiSaver for deposits and make full use of the low-deposit lending speed limits at the banks."</p>
        
            <p>He said caps on debt-to-income (DTI) ratios remained firmly on the cards for 2024, but high mortgage rates were currently doing the job of restricting any risky, high DTI lending.</p>
        
            <p>As for the number of property sales, Davidson said the upturn was expected to be more subdued than in previous cycles.</p>
        
            <p>"We're anticipating sales rising by perhaps 10 percent and prices seeing growth of around 5 percent, which is still below long-term average levels."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said some regions offered better pricing than others, given value drops over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>Featherston was the weakest performer over the past year with values down nearly 17 percent, while the top-ranked Sunshine Bay in Queenstown saw 6.6 percent growth, which Davidson said was relatively moderate growth for the top-performing suburb.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's Herne Bay maintained its position as the most expensive suburb with a median value of $3,161,400, compared with the most affordable suburb of Cobden in Grey at $258,200.</p>
