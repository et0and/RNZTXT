        <h2>America's Cup held overseas was  'significant loss' to Auckland hospitality, businesses say</h2>
        <p>
"We weren't allowed to be open for customers, we would have opened if the government granted us extended hours like it did with the Rugby World Cup."

            <p>Auckland bars and restaurants say this year's America's Cup made no difference to business as time zones meant most races were live in the middle of the night.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand won the America's Cup for a third time in a row over the weekend in Barcelona. The previous win was in Auckland in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The America's Cup historically, had a "massive financial impact on New Zealand", Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said, especially for hospitality, but this year didn't have the same impact.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2021, businesses in and around Auckland's viaduct were pumping with packed venues and a vibrant atmosphere, not just during the races, but throughout the event period.</p>
        
            <p>"But with it being in Spain this year it's a very different story - the time zone differences mean key races are on in the middle of the night which led to minimal live viewership and limited public engagement."</p>
        
            <p>Bidois said while passionate sailing fans would have caught up on the action in the mornings, the wider public wouldn't have been brought in by the "buzz" of live events.</p>

            <p>Manager of Auckland's Wynyard Pavilion, Alex Pearson, said he was unable to host any watch parties of the races live as the timings fell outside of liquor licence hours.</p>
        
            <p>"We weren't allowed to be open for customers, we would have opened if the government granted us extended hours like it did with the Rugby World Cup."</p>
        
            <p>Owner of Baduzzi also in Wynyard Quarter, Michael Dearth, said this year's America's Cup did nothing for his business either.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all down this quarter in Wynyard Quarter and it's so different compared to how it was in 2021 - even with Covid-19 we were packed."</p>
        
            <p>Owner of Parasol and Swing in Auckland's viaduct, Jason Rosen, said they also hadn't shown any of the races live this time and hadn't had any requests to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City's Viv Beck agreed there hadn't been much of an impact on Auckland businesses this time around due to the time differences.</p>
        
            <p>"I've watched a couple of races this time round but not as much as I would if it was being held here.</p>

            <p>"It would've reaped huge benefits for businesses here and I hope it can come back. We've been through a such a lot with Covid-19 and businesses are still struggling, it would give us a spark to look forward to.</p>
        
            <p>Bidois agreed the competition moving away from New Zealand has been a "significant loss" for bars and hotels.</p>
        
            <p>"We would certainly advocate for it returning here."</p>
        
            <p>Pearson remembered working at Wynyard Pavillion during the previous cup in 2021, which was hosted in Wynyard Quarter.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the Covid challenges at the time it was brilliant and played a major role in helping us and other businesses survive through the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"We were the official Team New Zealand supporters bar that time and regularly had the sailors plus supporters stopping in for after work drinks in the years leading up to the race, the team even came in a few hours after winning, it was amazing."</p>
        
            <p>By the next America's Cup, Beck said, Auckland would be "out of its decade of construction", and ready to host an international event.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Monday, the government told RNZ it was open to discussions around the next Cup being hosted in New Zealand, but warned economic times were tight.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour said while there was no question it would be a lot of fun to host the America's Cup, and nearby businesses would do well, it was not the core role of the government.</p>
