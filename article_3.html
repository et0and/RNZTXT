            <p>A resident of Marvon Downs Avenue,who did not want to be named said they heard two loud bangs one or two nights ago. They said sounded like gunshots rather than fireworks.</p>

            <p>Elm Park School said there was no immediate danger to the school but the police activity could may disrupt access.</p>
