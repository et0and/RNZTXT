            <p>ACT leader David Seymour was met with chants of "Kill the bill, kill the bill" when he walked out of the Beehive for a brief appearance at Parliament's forecourt, before waving to the crowd and returning into the building.</p>
        
            <p>More than 35,000 people have gathered as the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti overflows from Parliament's grounds and onto nearby Wellington streets.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour says it was important for democracy to go outside and face the hīkoi gathered at the front of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Toitū te Tiriti spokesperson Eru Kapa-Kingi told the crowd "Māori nation has been born" today and that "Te Tiriti is forever".</p>
        
            <p>Seymour, the Treaty Principles Bill architect, had previously said he supports the right to protest, but thinks participants are misguided and have a range of different grievances.</p>
        
            <p>Having faced the protesters on Tuesday afternoon, flanked by police and members of diplomatic security, he said it was useful to listen.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt these people have made a long journey to Parliament and we as parliamentarians should be there to hear them.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say it was quite difficult to hear a lot of what was being said, but nonetheless I thought it was important to be out there."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour was flanked by police and members of diplomatic security.</p>
        
            <p>He added he would have liked to have gone out and spoken.</p>
