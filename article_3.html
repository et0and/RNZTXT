            <p>Police have arrested a man for allegedly performing "a lewd act on himself" in Epsom earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>The father of a 14-year-old girl said his daughter ran from a man after she saw him naked in his vehicle on Gladwin Road on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The dad, who wished to remain anonymous for his family's privacy, said his 14-year-old daughter saw the alleged perpetrator after getting off the bus close to home.</p>
        
            <p>As the van the man was in began to move in her direction, he said his daughter ran home.</p>
        
            <p>The driver did not leave his vehicle during the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't expect this to happen in your area let alone to your children," the father said.</p>
        
            <p>He said his daughter's school had offered counselling, which he was appreciative of.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Greaves thanked the public for providing information which led to the man's arrest yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old will appear in Auckland District Court next week charged with two counts of indecent act.</p>
