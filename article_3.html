        <h2>'Refreshing' Karanga Plaza pool a hit with children - and adults</h2>
        <p>
First person - Leonard Powell takes a dip in Auckland's newest saltwater pool, and declares it a winner.

            <p>First person - As I wander through Auckland's Viaduct and approach the new Karanga Plaza pool, I'm met with a promising sight - if not a slight inconvenience.</p>
        
            <p>The problematic Te Wero Wynyard Crossing Bridge is going up, meaning I'll have to wait a few extra minutes before I cool off in the water.</p>
        
            <p>From the city side of the bridge, I can hear the splashes and laughter coming from the pool, as kids line up and see who can pop the biggest manu from the jump zone.</p>
        
            <p>A boat passes through, the bridge eventually lowers back, and I get to see Karanga Plaza in all its glory. Dozens of people sun themselves on the steps, while groups of kids whip up the stairs for another turn at jumping.</p>
        
            <p>The complex is the brainchild of Auckland mayor Wayne Brown, who christened the new pool with a dive back in late December (and a couple barbs at Joe Biden for good measure).</p>
        
            <p>On this sunny day, I meet Leah Tautiaga, looking after five youngsters on their school holiday break.</p>
        
            <p>"Its our first time here, something for the kids, and free! Cost saving for the holidays."</p>
        
            <p>Three lifeguards are spread around the facility, which Leah says was a factor in bringing the children along.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we came, because of the lifeguards. Safety in the water."</p>
        
            <p>Six-year-old Willow comes up and nestles in with her mother, rocking a lifejacket. She says she is loving the pool, despite being a bit cold.</p>

            <p>The 33-metre pool includes three lanes for swimmers, and at the south end I meet Aaron Dixson and Flinn Gardner.</p>
        
            <p>They are competitive swimmers from the North Shore, and are taking a breather from their 1000m training session.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good, I like how it's really deep, and saltwater rather than freshwater," Dixson says.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't see the bottom. It just looks green, like ocean water."</p>
        
            <p>Gardner isn't as convinced about the water quality.</p>
        
            <p>"Its pretty murky and dirty, you can't really see much. I went on Safeswim, and it said it was fine, so yeah."</p>

            <p>Safeswim keeps track of water safety for beaches all over Aotearoa, and has been in the news a lot in recent years, with constant issues plaguing central Auckland's beaches.</p>
        
            <p>Nick Vigar is head of network planning for healthy waters and flood resilience at Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>He says a green flag on the Safeswim map indicates low risk, but doesn't guarantee absolutely clean water.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a regular monitoring programme to understand water quality, and we're doing everything we can do monitor that public health risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Wherever you are, whether down around the waterfront or at the beach, there are a whole of other potential water quality risks. Its important to understand there is never no risk."</p>
        
            <p>Up on the walkway about the pool, passers by are watching the swimmers. Office worker John is on his regular lunchtime walk, and says he is keen to go for a splash, but not in front of the crowds.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been tempted, but I'm not sure I'm keen to get my kit off in front of everyone else in the centre of the city. These guys are brave!"</p>
        
            <p>Back down poolside with Leah, I meet some of the brave bunch John is talking about.</p>
        
            <p>Rylin, Jamieson, Kaylis, Willow and Josiah are having a ball, jumping in and having swimming races.</p>
        
            <p>Leah tells me Rylin is the manu expert. Any tips?</p>
        
            <p>"Just tuck up tight when you jump, and untuck when you hit the water," the youngster shrugs.</p>
        
            <p>I stick with a classic pin drop off the jumping zone, and it's fair to say the water is refreshing, and particularly salty.</p>
        
            <p>It's then off for a cold shower, a whip through the pool's changing rooms, and back on the bike to the office.</p>
        
            <p>Judging by the people out making the most of it, the city is onto a winner.</p>
