            <p>A rare visit by bottlenose dolphins to Akaroa Harbour has delighted swimmers and kayakers.</p>
        
            <p>The pod was estimated to be made up of as many as 100 of the dolphins and was seen just after 7am on Sunday near the Akaroa lighthouse and wharf.</p>
        
            <p>The animals were feeding in the water directly off Akaroa township by about 9:30am and moved towards the heads after about an hour, but stayed in the area until the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The dolphins were followed by several boaties, kayakers and jet ski riders.</p>
        
            <p>The endangered Hector's Dolphins are often seen in Akaroa Harbour, but it is very unusual to find bottlenose dolphins there.</p>

            <p>George Waghorn, part owner and skipper at Akaroa Dolphins, said it had been about a year since a smaller pod was seen in the same area.</p>
        
            <p>He said the dolphins had put on a show for the sightseers, who were delighted to see them.</p>

            <p>"It was pretty amazing to see them. They were jumping and hanging around, and even our two-year-old daughter got to go for a ride on the dinghy and she was screaming and loving it.</p>
        
            <p>"They looked all really healthy - they were doing front flips, back flips, belly flops, side flops tail slaps."</p>
        
            <p>The pod had left the harbour by Sunday afternoon, but Waghorn was now expecting bottlenose dolphin sightings to become more common in the area.</p>
