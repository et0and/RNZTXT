            <p>A global shortage of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication is affecting thousands of New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmaceutical company Teva alerted Pharmac in September that it was facing a supply issue for the drug methylphenidate, due to a global increase in demand.</p>
        
            <p>The shortage led to 4000 patients being given the Concerta brand of the drug instead.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac told RNZ there was no certainty about when the supply issue would be resolved but Teva stock of the drug was now starting to arrive back in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"People who were previously on Methylphenidate ER - Teva will need to start switching back to this brand as there will not be enough stock of the Concerta for people to stay on that brand long-term."</p>
        
            <p>ADHD NZ chairperson Darrin Bull told RNZ Concerta was very similar and Pharmac had assured them there should be no issue with the change of drug.</p>
        
            <p>"However, there's always nuances to this and there will be some instances where people may not feel that it is just as effective or might feel some side-effects."</p>
        
            <p>He said they had not had any real issues or complaints with due to the shortage.</p>
        
            <p>"There's bigger issues in New Zealand for the ADHD community including access to diagnoses as well as better medication."</p>
        
            <p>He said Pharmac had been proactive about with dealing with the shortage.</p>
        
            <p>Bull told RNZ he had seen pharmaceutical companies worldwide struggling to meet the demand.</p>
        
            <p>That could be due to the economics of developing medications and the lack of production facilities, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have certainly noticed in the ADHD community in the US and UK there are some quite severe shortages which haven't come through to here, and I don't think they will, but certainly worldwide there is an issue at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac said it would continue to update its supply issues webpage as more information became available.</p>
