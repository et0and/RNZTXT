            <p>A Rainbow Storytime nationwide tour planned for later in the year has been cancelled, due to threats of violence.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki-based drag Queens Erika and CoCo Flash were set to tour the country with their show aimed at children of all ages, to coincide with the Out on the Shelves rainbow reading campaign month in June.</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow Storytime founder Sunita Torrance, who performs as CoCo, told RNZ she and Erika have received death threats and threats of attack.</p>

            <p>A Facebook post said promises of violence had also forced one of the event's stars, Erika, to relocate to the UK.</p>
