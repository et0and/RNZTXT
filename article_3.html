            <p>A candidate for the Port Waikato by-election is frustrated there are only seven places to make an advanced vote from Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Votes for the local MP were not counted in the General Election following the death of ACT candidate Neil Christensen, just days before polling.</p>
        
            <p>The Electoral Commission said there are seven voting places open before election day in P≈çkeno, Pukekohe, Tuakau, Te Kauwhata and Waiuku.</p>
        
            <p>National MP Andrew Bayly, who is the incumbent in the seat, said some of the electorate is "a very remote farming area".</p>
        
            <p>"There are few settlements and only one or two schools... To rely on a single place of voting on the 25th of November and they may have to spend up to an hour travelling to it, I think it's unreasonable," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every election should have the opportunity to be fully staffed and properly run and people have the opportunity to advance vote particularly in the rural parts of the electorate.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure we've got good coverage and something I'm certainly going to talk to the Electoral Commission [about]."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Chief Executive Operations Anusha Guler said on election day, November 25, there will be a total of 37 voting places open including Waikaretu School, Naike Community Hall, and Glen Murray Community Hall.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission said it has used many of the same voting place locations for the Port Waikato by-election as used for the General Election, however some were not available.</p>
        
            <p>For the General Election there were 10 open in the advance period and 44 open on Saturday 14 October.</p>
        
            <p>Guler said it is usual for the number of voting places to be lower in a by-election than a general election due to a shorter timeframe to secure locations.</p>
        
            <p>She encouraged voters to check opening hours and locations before they go to vote.</p>
        
            <p>EasyVote packs have been delivered to enrolled voters in the electorate which include an EasyVote card, list of candidates and voting place list.</p>
        
            <p>During the first week of voting, there will be a letterbox drop providing information about the by-election, including when and where people can vote.</p>
