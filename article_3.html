        <h2>Tauranga's council's only woman elected to become deputy mayor</h2>
        <p>
A councillor let the news slip just before mayor-elect Mahé Drysdale was able to officially announce it.

            <p>Former Zespri treasurer and NZ Avocado boss Jen Scoular has been named as Tauranga's deputy mayor, alongside mayor-elect Mahé Drysdale - only Drysdale wasn't the one to first name her.</p>
        
            <p>During a swearing-in ceremony of the 10-member Tauranga City Council at its inaugural meeting on Friday, seven-time councillor Rick Curach congratulated Drysdale on his appointment of Scoular to the role before Drysdale himself had a chance to announce it.</p>
        
            <p>Pāpāmoa ward councillor Steve Morris, the only other newly elected member with previous experience on council, told Drysdale he did not know how they were going to get that "cat back in the bag".</p>
        
            <p>But the slip of the tongue did not dampen Drysdale's enthusiasm when he did officially announce Scoular as his deputy in front of a room full of dignitaries including MPs Sam Uffindell, Cameron Luxton, and Tom Rutherford.</p>

            <p>"It is with great pleasure that I appoint councillor Jen Scoular to the position of deputy. Jen has a great range of skills but we could have any of this part of a team of 10, but I believe Jen will complement me very, very well in leading this team to achieve for the people of Tauranga."</p>
        
            <p>Scoular, who is the only woman elected to the council, said it was with pride and a deep sense of responsibility that she accepted the role of deputy mayor.</p>
        
            <p>While she was disappointed not to be joined by more women around the council table, she was dedicated to making Tauranga an inclusive and prosperous city.</p>
        
            <p>She said throughout her 30-year career in commercial business leadership and seven years as a trade diplomat, she had recognised the huge benefits of developing strong cultures, collaboration and building enduring relationships.</p>
        
            <p>"These are pre-requisites for a successful council here, in one of the fastest growing regions in New Zealand. As deputy mayor I will work to foster strong alignment and cohesion within the Tauranga community, across cultures, across sectors and across interests.</p>
        
            <p>"We must invest in infrastructure, support local business and enhance the quality of life for our people."</p>

            <p>Scoular would represent the Mauao/Mount Maunganui ward.</p>
        
            <p>In his address, Drysdale - cloaked in the red mayor's robe and mayoralty chain - said the oaths taken by councillors on Friday formally marked the beginning of their governance journey.</p>
        
            <p>"In doing so, we commit ourselves to making good decision on behalf of the whole city. Decisions that will ensure Tauranga has a vibrant future. In short, we will continue the progress that will make this city the best city in Aotearoa New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>In a nod to the 2019 council, which was sacked in late 2020 for dysfunction and replaced by commissioners, Drysdale said to be effective the new council must work as a team.</p>
        
            <p>"Open and honest debate is a hallmark of democracy but once a decision is made, it's the governance team's job to embrace it, see it through and support the council to deliver it.</p>
        
            <p>"Our city expects nothing less than governance that is respectful and is united in its determination to deliver the bright future the people of Tauranga want and deserve."</p>
        
            <p>On a personal note, Drysdale said the day held special meaning for him.</p>
        
            <p>"My grandfather, the late Sir Bob Owens, was a much-loved mayor of Tauranga serving from 1968 to 1977. And he was also the mayor of Mt Maunganui from 1971 to 1974.</p>
        
            <p>"He left a lasting legacy which we enjoy today and that is a huge inspiration to me. It is an honour to wear the same mayoral robes and chains as him with [my wife] Juliet wearing the chains my grandmother Joy once wore."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said while most of the council was new to their roles their induction was already underway.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Mikaere Sydney for the new Te Awanui Māori ward was absent from the ceremony due to illness.</p>
