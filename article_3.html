            <p>When the duffle bags were examined, 14 methamphetamine packages were found.</p>
        
            <p>They were wrapped in four layers of black film, clear plastic wrapping, tea bag branded packaging, and clear plastic wrapping.</p>
        
            <p>This amount of methamphetamine would have had a street value of up to NZ$10.7 million.</p>
        
            <p>Customs manager Auckland Airport, Paul Williams, has credited frontline staff for the find.</p>
        
            <p>"This seizure has stopped a significant quantity of harmful drugs from getting into our communities, and will no doubt leave the criminals involved out of pocket for the Christmas season. Investigations are ongoing, so we are not ruling out any arrests.</p>
        
            <p>"Customs is accustomed to the tactics organised crime syndicates used during the busy travel season. Whether it's exploiting people to act as drug couriers or sending drugs within unaccompanied luggage to be picked up later by criminal accomplices, our officers are always on high alert."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said officers would be continue to be vigilant "for suspicious behaviour or baggage".</p>
