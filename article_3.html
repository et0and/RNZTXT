            <p>Warning: This story contains discussion of potential suicide. </p>
        
            <p>Philip Polkinghorne told police he was "sobbing uncontrollably" while trying to call emergency services, in an interview on the day his wife, Pauline Hanna, died.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne, 71, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Hanna in 2021 and staging her death to look like a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday afternoon at the High Court in Auckland, the jury was shown a police interview between Detective Ilona Walton and Polkinghorne conducted on the day of Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>Dressed in jeans and a pink shirt, Polkinghorne told Walton he had gone downstairs that morning and put the kettle on before going into the hall and discovering his wife.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw Pauline there and she was slouched and there was a chair. I could see her arm was blue and knew she was dead straight away.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just a wreck when I called 111, I was trying to lie her down flat and I dropped the phone, I was sobbing uncontrollably."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the couple's personal trainer Barry Payne told the court Polkinghorne and Hanna seemed "quite fond of each other".</p>
        
            <p>Payne said there was one time Hanna mentioned she thought her husband had a girlfriend, but he ignored it not wanting to get involved in their personal life.</p>
        
            <p>After Hanna's death, Polkinghorne and his girlfriend Madison Ashton travelled to the South Island to stay at the Mt Cook Lakeside Retreat.</p>
        
            <p>Ashton is an Australian sex worker.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Lisa Jane Anderson was involved with a police raid at the property on April 30, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Police were there to seize Asthon's phones.</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the phones had been pin protected, and Ashton declined to give the pin numbers.</p>
