        <h2>All staff resign at litter-picking charity, blames former and current government</h2>
        <p>
The charity has been promoting litter control for the last 45 years, but has now accused the current and former government of bullying and under-funding the organisation.

            <p>The entire team behind Keep New Zealand Beautiful has resigned, warning the organisation will likely fold in the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The charity - that coined the phrase 'Be a Tidy Kiwi' - has been legislatively mandated to promote litter control since 1979.</p>
        
            <p>Its chief executive Heather Saunderson has now accused the current and former government of bullying and under-funding the organisation.</p>

            <p>"My entire team resigned in solidarity with me so it's obviously been a situation where there has been systematic bullying, both at an individual and organisational level," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Saunderson, who has cancer, penned a now-public letter to the Ministry for the Environment and its minister two weeks ago, asking government representatives to meet with the charity.</p>
        
            <p>"Frankly, I'm a dying woman and Keep New Zealand Beautiful will be a part of my legacy when I'm gone," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to think that the momentum that the team and I have built over the past 15 years will continue and that the next generation of Tidy Kiwis will have the knowledge and skills to manage the environment that they'll inherit."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the environment minister says the ministry was speaking to the charity's board - and the minister - Penny Simmonds - was across the situation.</p>
