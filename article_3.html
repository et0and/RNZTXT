            <p>Police are hunting for a prisoner who escaped from Corrections staff at Waikato Hospital in Hamilton this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified about 1.30pm that a prisoner had escaped from Corrections custody at the hospital on Pembroke Street.</p>
        
            <p>The prisoner is on remand at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.</p>
        
            <p>Spring Hill general manager Scott Walker said the prisoner was handcuffed and wearing a GPS monitor when he escaped from staff.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said police were informed immediately and that public safety was the prison's top priority.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said officers were actively searching for the escapee.</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked anyone in the immediate surrounding areas, who has seen anything suspicious, to please call police immediately on 111.</p>
