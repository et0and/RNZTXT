            <p>Two of New Zealand's top athletes have formed what could be described as a bromance to help keep each other at the top of their game.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand high jumper Hamish Kerr has to be having fun and enjoying what he's doing to be competitive and he shares that feeling with champion shot-putter Tom Walsh.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are preparing for this weekend's World Indoor Athletics Championships in Glasgow and have again enjoyed each others company in the build-up.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr and Walsh share a laugh whenever they can. It helps them both cope with the intensity of competition when they enter the arena.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr, the Commonwealth Games champion, said he jumps his best when he's enjoying it.</p>
        
            <p>"We've obviously put a lot of hard work in and we're being very methodical with our approach but ultimately I've just got to enjoy it," Kerr told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll come a time this year where all the work we've done an all the numbers become secondary to the fact that I just have to create the freedom.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm sharing some experiences with the people I love and really enjoy spending time with that's what's fun for me.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of those people are the people I compete with, some are my support people and some are other New Zealand athletes I get to travel with."</p>

            <p>Kerr said he and Walsh had caught up more often recently as they had been on similar schedules overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last few years we've travelled together more and he's definitely a guy I love spending a lot of time with and so and we definitely have similar attitudes towards what performance looks like."</p>
        
            <p>Walsh is one of those athletes who enjoys what he does.</p>
        
            <p>He's earnest during training and competition but makes the most of enjoying the rest of his time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hugely important for me, we're doing an individual sport and are on the road a lot by ourselves and I'm really lucky that Hamish and I get on like a house on fire so we do spend some time together which takes out that loneliness a bit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh said the shot-putters in particular are a friendly bunch.</p>
        
            <p>"We compete against each other and don't want to lose but we try and go for a beer or a feed afterwards and talk a bit of smack and just laugh.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't matter if you've had a good day or a bad day but things are always a bit easier when you're chilling out and debriefing with some mates."</p>
        
            <p>While shot-putters are known for their calorie intake, Kerr is probably a bit of a lightweight when it comes to bulking up and may struggle to be competitive with the big boys in that game.</p>

            <p>Walsh said he's been lucky enough to talk to a lot of people from different sports and so if anyone is ever seeking advice he's happy to give it, though he said he would always have to be asked first.</p>
        
            <p>While they're both extremely experienced athletes, Walsh and Kerr aren't past giving each other a little help.</p>
