            <p>The national electricity grid operator is warning of possible insufficient power generation to meet households' demand on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower has issued a notice saying there was a risk that power generation and reserves would not meet demand between 7.30am-8.30am.</p>
        
            <p>It said if power generators could not provide enough electricity, Transpower would manage demand to avoid a grid emergency.</p>
        
            <p>"The system operator may instruct the grid owner to disconnect feeders without further notice to connected parties," it said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has forecast temperatures to plunge overnight, with Christchurch set to fall to -4 degrees Celsius.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, almost 34,000 households lost power on one of the coldest nights of the year, as insufficient supplies were arranged for the surge in demand.</p>
        
            <p>An industry panel fined Transpower $150,000 for its role in the blackouts.</p>
