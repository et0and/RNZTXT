            <p>Pop star Liam Payne had multiple drugs including crack cocaine and methamphetamine in his system when he fell to his death from a hotel balcony in Argentina, according to initial toxicology reports cited by US media on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The British singer and former One Direction member died last week at the age of 31, after plunging from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires.</p>
        
            <p>ABC News and TMZ said a cocktail of drugs called "pink cocaine" - containing methamphetamine, ketamine and MDMA - had been found during a partial autopsy, citing anonymous sources familiar with the preliminary tests.</p>
        
            <p>Crack cocaine and benzodiazepine were also listed.</p>
        
            <p>An "improvised aluminum pipe to ingest drugs" was also found in the room, ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>Payne - who was found dead after staff called emergency services twice to report a guest "overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol" was "destroying" a hotel room - had spoken publicly about struggles with substance abuse and coping with fame from an early age.</p>
        
            <p>Post-mortem results indicated that he was alone at the time of the fall and "was going through an episode of substance abuse," prosecutors had previously said.</p>
        
            <p>The singer suffered "multiple traumas" and "internal and external haemorrhaging," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The Clarin newspaper published photos last week of what it said was the interior of Payne's room, with white powder visible on a table next to a piece of aluminium foil and a lighter. The pictures also showed a television with a broken screen.</p>
        
            <p>The prosecutor's office said substances that appeared to be "narcotics and alcoholic beverages" had been found in the room, amidst pieces of broken furniture and other objects.</p>
        
            <p>A hotel employee suspected of providing Payne with drugs on the day he died has been interviewed by officials, but not arrested or charged, local police told ABC News.</p>
        
            <p>Payne was a member of One Direction, the hugely successful pop group whose fame began in 2010 on the British television talent contest "The X Factor."</p>
        
            <p>One of the highest-grossing live acts in the world, the group went on indefinite hiatus in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Payne went on to enjoy solo success, but in recent years spoke openly about struggles with alcoholism and fame.</p>
        
            <p>He was the father of a seven-year-old boy shared with Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy.</p>
