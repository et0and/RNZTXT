            <p>Evacuations are underway in Canterbury after a large fire broke out near Lake Pukaki.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says they were called to the scene after a farmer's burn-off got out of control shortly before 3pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze has been burning in the area where State Highway 80 and State Highway 8 intersect.</p>
        
            <p>The flames spread through about 50 hectares of grass and scrub during the afternoon, and FENZ said the fire was not contained, but was not spreading to the north.</p>

            <p>A Twizel resident said she could see the flames from about 10 kilometres away.</p>
        
            <p>Twizel Community Board chairperson Tracey Gunn said she was concerned about the fire spreading.</p>
        
            <p>''It is very close to significant numbers of pine trees, which is always a concern, with a lot of fuel for the fire, but yeah, it is [a worry], the flames are visible from a good distance, you know, 10km away."</p>
        
            <p>Gunn said it was the fourth incident in the area in the past five days, following twin bus crashes last week, and another multi-vehicle crash at the weekend.</p>
