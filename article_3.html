            <p>An Air New Zealand flight from Queenstown to Auckland sparked a callout of emergency services after it experienced a fault with one of its hydraulic systems.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said Flight NZ614 experienced a fault with one of its three independent hydraulics systems after departing Queenstown on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The flight continued to Auckland, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Passenger safety was not at risk, and the captain notified air traffic control in accordance with standard operating procedures. This resulted in a 'local standby" at the airport."</p>
        
            <p>The aircraft landed safely and passengers were able to disembark, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it was alerted to the situation at 10.42am and treated it as a full emergency response before it was downgraded to a local standby.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters checked the plane's undercarriage at about 11.10am before leaving the airport.</p>
