            <p>Police were out in force last night cracking down on street racers across the Hutt Valley, north of Wellington city.</p>
        
            <p>The operation, dubbed "Kereru", saw police staff taking a coordinated zero-tolerance approach to street racing, a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Over the course of the night, 10 vehicles were either pink or green stickered, three licences were suspended, 32 infringement notices were issued, three vehicles were impounded and three drivers were summonsed for excess breath alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Bailiffs from the Ministry of Justice also assisted in the operation, which led to the seizure of four vehicles and the collection of a large number of fines.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Area Prevention Manager Senior Sergeant Samuel Avison said the operation sent a clear message to those wanting to participate in disruptive and illegal activity.</p>
        
            <p>"Our high visibility and enforcement approach meant groups were intercepted before they could set up in one location, meaning they were unable to participate in antisocial road user behaviours."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were committed to holding illegal street racers to account as they knew the impact this activity had on the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only does it keep residents awake and damage the roads, but it places drivers, passengers, bystanders, and other motorists at extreme risk," Avison said.</p>
