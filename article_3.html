            <p>New Zealand speed climber Julian David set a personal best to reach the Olympic quarterfinals in Paris and so did the man he'll go head-to-head with, except American Sam Watson's time was a new world record.</p>
        
            <p>David's time of 5.20 seconds during the qualification elimination was the second time in less than an hour that he had improved on his previous best.</p>
        
            <p>On his first time up the 15-metre wall during the seeding heats at Le Bourget Climbing Venue David hit the timing pad at the top in 5.24 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>David's winning time in the elimination moved him through to the last eight to be seeded against Watson who won his elimination in 4.75 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Watson was the second climber to beat the world record on Tuesday (Paris time) as records tumbled.</p>
        
            <p>While David's time was a national and Oceania record it's still a long way off Watson's time given the narrow margins in the sport.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly two hours after he'd sealed his quarterfinal spot David was surprised to be told by media he'd meet Watson on Thursday (Paris time).</p>
        
            <p>The 19-year-old was convinced he was facing off with a different climber until his coach Rob Moore eventually chimed in to settle the confusion.</p>
        
            <p>Yes, he would be lining up on the wall next to Watson in the first quarterfinal.</p>
        
            <p>David will be hoping that the Olympics isn't anything like the last time he meet the American in a high profile competition.</p>
        
            <p>"I versed him back in Dallas at Youth Worlds and I got my arse kicked.</p>
        
            <p>"But I've been following in his footsteps so hopefully I can pull something off it will take a miracle but we will see what we can do."</p>
        
            <p>David wasn't surprised several climbers were able to achieve record times in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's been performing super well and seeing [Italy's Matteo Zurloni] do the European record as well as Sam's world record is just phenomenal.</p>
        
            <p>"There were some upsets, there were some people who I would have thought would have made it through but didn't and all respect to them they are phenomenal athletes and I've competed against them before and they definitely should of but that's sport - anything can happen in speed climbing."</p>
