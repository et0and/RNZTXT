        <h2>What is your glimmer?</h2>
        <p>
You might not have heard the term, but you've certainly experienced them - it's those tiny, micro-moments that allow us to feel a bit more joy.
</p>
        
            <p>You may not have heard of glimmers yet, but you've certainly experienced them.</p>
        
            <p>Glimmers are tiny, micro-moments of joy; those fleeting, everyday moments that elicit a rush of happiness, gratitude, peace and calm. They're when you cuddle your pet or hear your favourite song in the supermarket.</p>
        
            <p>They're when you feel the sun on your face after your first ocean swim of the summer, or when your partner makes you a cup of tea without being asked.</p>
        
            <p>Deb Dana is the clinical social worker and author that coined the term 'glimmers'. In her 2018 book The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy: Engaging the Rhythm of Regulation, Dana wrote that micro-moments of joy can "shape our system in very gentle ways" by anchoring us in the present moment, and cueing our nervous systems to feel safe, calm and connected.</p>
        
            <p>"When we detect features in the environment or in interpersonal interactions that we associate with safety, it activates ... the 'safety circuit' in our nervous system."</p>
        
            <p>In the same book, neuropsychologist Stephen Porges explained how this sets off a cascade of biological responses "that enable our most human qualities like empathy, connection, and openness to emerge, enriching our emotional landscape".</p>
        
            <p>"This is the physiological undercurrent of experiencing a 'glimmer' ... they're moments of regulation that foster feelings of wellbeing."</p>
        
            <p>Alex Walker, a mental health researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington, says taking a moment to recognise our glimmers can be hugely beneficial for our mental and emotional health.</p>
        
            <p>"We often live in such a fast-paced world, lots of things striving for our attention, lots of stimulating things all around us almost from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed.</p>
        
            <p>"In that overwhelming atmosphere, those glimmers are moments of joy, moments of peace, and I think, a moment of immersion where you're really in the moment, you're really experiencing a delightful feeling, and you're not so caught in the conveyor belt of busy-ness.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's also really positive to have things to look forward to - a concert, a birthday - but then the corresponding danger is that you might get so caught up in these landmark events, that the life in between is in the margins almost.</p>
        
            <p>"Whereas with glimmers, it almost brings you back to your everyday life and lets you see the joy that's right in front of you or right around the corner, to really live in a fundamental way of living, which is day-to-day, moment-to-moment, rather than those big landmark bursts of excitement."</p>

            <p>"Just having the mindset to begin with is actually quite transformative, to be able to go into your day with the intention of noticing those little moments," Walker says.</p>
        
            <p>"Often those will be moments that you've already quite enjoyed and gotten positive feelings from, but you might not have ever really paused in those moments to really let it soak through you.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, one glimmer I really love is the sound of rain against the window whenever there's a storm. When I notice it and I'm inside, I really try and actually go, 'Okay, I'm gonna lie down for a bit', listen to the rain against the window and really enjoy that, and try and carve out time to honour that moment ... it's noticing the things that you love and swimming through that feeling more than you might normally."</p>
        
            <p>Glimmers are small experiences that allow us to feel a bit more joy in our daily lives.</p>

            <p>This time of year is when the wisteria wall on the north-western cycle path in Auckland starts to bloom, and it gives me much secret delight to watch it emerge day by day after a winter of damp, grey misery.</p>
        
            <p>I love when you get a bottle of non-homogenised whole milk and there is always a layer of thick cream on top. As soon as I come in with the shopping, I open that bottle and scoop the cream out right into my mouth. There's only ever enough for one or two teaspoons. It is just delightful.</p>

Leonard loves old things and people.

            <p>Old quirky designs, like these books, for some reason bring me a lot of joy. I'm a sucker for colourful titles and block lettering. I'm constantly pulling out my phone and taking pictures of signs/posters that speak to me when I'm out and about. Shout-out Pam Ayres and the Avondale Salvation Army shop.</p>
        
            <p>My other answer would be old people. I am slightly obsessed with old people - so well-dressed, their beautiful wrinkles, their lack of rushing around, their wisdom. Old people have a special glow to them, a warmth, a comfort in their skin. Bonus points for an old couple doing mundane tasks, the beauty in the monotony.</p>
        
            <p>My cat Squid spends all day seeking attention from anyone she can and meowing for food. But when she drinks from her water bowl it's the cutest sound. Not sure why it makes me so happy - hearing her contentedly lapping water is meditative and calming, like a tranquil water feature in a Zen garden. And maybe it's because it's a short respite from her constant demands.</p>

Charlotte's vinyl collection is a cherished possession.

            <p>Mine is picking a piece of vinyl from my collection - or even better, a new piece - carefully putting it on my record player and dropping the needle - the crackles of sound that it brings to the room brings me such warmth and happiness.</p>
        
            <p>The feeling of having a chicken in the fridge to be cooked. A good and underrated feeling.</p>

            <p>I'm not a pet person and I only caved to more than a decade's worth of pleading to get a dog during Covid times. Four years on, I have to admit that our dog Cosmo brings his fair share of joy to our little family.</p>
        
            <p>One of the things that makes me happiest is seeing his delight at chasing a ball on the beach. One morning last week, a woman walking on the footpath nearby stopped and shouted over to me, 'LOOK AT YOUR DOG, HE JUST LOOKS SO HAPPY!' But what I love most is when we're on the sofa together at night and he gently lays his head on my knee. At that moment, I believe everything they say about pets being good for you.</p>
