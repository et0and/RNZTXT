            <p>Kīngi Tūheitia is to host a national hui for unity next month in a bid to bring together the many voices of Māori.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a spokesperson said many Māori were strongly opposed to the government's statements on the Treaty of Waitangi which could undermine decades of hard fought justice.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said Kīngi Tūheitia received a clear message from many rangatira across the country after the 165th anniversary of the birth of the Kiingitanga movement.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingitanga chief of staff Ngira Simmonds said there was a lot of divisive rhetoric during the election campaign which was being felt by many New Zealanders - both Māori and non-Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"There's strong opposition to the government's statements on the Treaty of Waitangi which could undermine decades of hard-fought justice and equality for our nation.</p>
        
            <p>"Now is the time for Kotahitanga and focusing on what we have in common."</p>
        
            <p>The affirmation of Mana Motuhake has been the driving force of the Kiingitanga for 165 years, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The national hui would be held at Turangawaewae Marae on 20 January and Kīngi Tūheitia would then carry the mauri of the hui into the annual Ratana and Waitangi Day celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>The call for a national hui comes after a day of action and protests on Tuesday organised by Te Pāti Māori.</p>
