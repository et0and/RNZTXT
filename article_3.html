            <p>Police have launched a homicide inquiry and say they are searching for the person responsible for a fatal shooting in the Lower Hutt suburb of Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called about 3.20pm to the scene on Seddon Street in Lower Hutt, after a man was located critically injured in the street and he died a short time later.</p>
        
            <p>Police said cordons remained in place on Seddon Street and residents could expect to see a police presence in the area this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Simon De Wit said police would also have an increased presence in the area in the coming days to provide reassurance to residents.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was underway and police wanted to speak to potential witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there had been no arrests at this stage and they were working to locate the offender or offenders.</p>

            <p>Local resident Shannon McColley said the first she knew about the incident was when she looked out the window and saw the Armed Offenders Squad across the street.</p>
        
            <p>Her partner called to ask if she was okay, having seen it in the news, and she could see what looked like a white tarpaulin in the street.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't hear anything. I've had my door open - the screen door - all day, so I'm kinda surprised."</p>
        
            <p>The neighbourhood was quiet, she said, but it had its share of petty crime.</p>
        
            <p>"I won't be surprised if the cops come knocking about my cameras," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Was it scary? "Nah," she said. "It's Naenae. It's par for the course around here, honestly."</p>
        
            <p>Another resident said everyone was on edge while police searched for the person behind the fatal shooting.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who RNZ agreed not to name, said the murder investigation was shocking because the area was generally quiet, and it was scary knowing that the person responsible was still on the loose.</p>
        
            <p>"Menace to society, basically.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's on edge, I would be - because I've got children."</p>
        
            <p>The resident said the house at the centre of the police investigation was a "known party house".</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen gang related stuff in there ... a lot of people in and out."</p>
        
            <p>They said despite that, the people were pleasant and mainly kept to themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"[The area] is quite quiet most of the time, so this is quite shocking to see."</p>
        
            <p>A resident, who RNZ has agreed not to name, earlier said it was sad to hear someone had died, but they were not worried for their safety.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident told RNZ a sheet had been lain over something in the middle of the road.</p>
        
            <p>Local resident Fatima Khaliff told RNZ she was not sure when she would be able to return home, as the shooting took place right outside her house.</p>
        
            <p>She was at work at the time, but when she returned home she found the road blocked off, and police told her to wait at the cordon.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't really told us anything yet, they just told us to stay still, wait around and see what happens."</p>
        
            <p>She said the events were shocking, but the neighbourhood was "pretty ghetto, pretty loud".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not surprised, because stuff like that does happen a lot around our street."</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services are asking Seddon St residents to follow the directions of officers at the cordons.</p>
        
            <p>Three police cars and armed officers have blocked Seddon St at the corner of Wheatley Street.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are out on the street talking amongst each other and looking on down the road, but the scene cannot be viewed from the cordons.</p>
