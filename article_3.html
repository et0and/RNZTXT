            <p>Invercargill Mayor Nobby Clark is scheduled to undergo heart surgery next week, after suffering a minor heart attack on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was taken to Southland Hospital and stayed overnight as a precaution after the incident on 27 December, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>He was then transferred to Dunedin Hospital for more tests yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Tom Campbell said on Thursday that Clark was in good spirits and recovering well.</p>
        
            <p>Clark will stay in Dunedin Hospital with his family until his surgery next week, Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said Clark's recovery was likely to take a couple of months and that he would take the reins at council in the meantime.</p>
        
            <p>Clark won the mayoralty from long-time incumbent Tim Shadbolt in last year's local body election.</p>
