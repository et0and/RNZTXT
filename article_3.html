            <p>Seven first-division winners of last night's $50 million Powerball draw will be $7.18 million richer today, whether they know it yet or not.</p>
        
            <p>The MyLotto app will open later than usual this morning, at 10am, to handle the huge volume of people checking to see if they have become an overnight multimillionaire.</p>
        
            <p>The regions and stores where the winning tickets were purchased will not be released until midday.</p>
        
            <p>Just under 2 million tickets were sold for the much anticipated, must-be-won draw - far more than usual, Lotto NZ says.</p>
        
            <p>Head of communications Lucy Fullarton said big winners often share the wealth with family, friends, charities and their communities, and their lives will be changed.</p>
        
            <p>"It means something different for everyone, and I think all of our winners have their things they come into our winners' room talking about.</p>
        
            <p>"But what we see more than ever is that they want to use it to support their whanau and their friends and their communities, and I expect that will be exactly the same for these seven winners."</p>
        
            <p>The numbers drawn were 22, 35, 10, 30, 21, 37, bonus ball 5 and Powerball, 2.</p>
        
            <p>Once again, no one got the first division plus Powerball, so the record-equalling jackpot was shared amongst division two.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing that Powerball rolled down to second division and was shared between seven players - it's fantastic to see more of our lucky players get to experience what it's like to win," Lotto NZ chief executive Jason Delamore said.</p>
        
            <p>Fourteen other players won $71,429 through Lotto First Division and one person took home $600,000 through Strike Four.</p>
        
            <p>Delamere said the big winners should phone Lotto NZ's Customer Services team on 0800 695 6886 "to ensure they receive the support they'll need throughout this life-changing experience".</p>
        
            <p>The biggest single winner in Lotto's history took home $44m in 2016.</p>
