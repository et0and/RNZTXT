            <p>Ngāti Rangi and the Department of Conservation (DOC) are calling for dog owners to "respect the rules" after a monitored North Island brown kiwi was found dead in a suspected dog attack.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Rangi sees kiwi as a taonga species and even one death can have a "devastating" impact on their recovery, Pou Ārahi of Ngā Waihua o Paerangi Helen Leahy said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Brown kiwi can live for around 40 years, and the early death of a breeding adult male means the loss of generations of taonga," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The kiwi, named Geyser, was released into Rangataua in 2015 alongside two others. The rangers found the other two monitored kiwi safe and almost ready to fledge their chicks.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors can take up to two dogs into Rangataua Forest, as long as they have a DOC permit and have been certified as being "kiwi avoidance trained".</p>
        
            <p>DOC supervisor Danial Van der Lubbe urged owners to "respect the rules" and educate both themselves and their dogs.</p>
        
            <p>The Rangataua Forest Ecological Area is managed in partnership with Ngāti Rangi and the predominantly beech forest is also home to a large population of short-tailed bats and other native species such as kākā and kārearea.</p>
        
            <p>Leahy said the iwi was looking to introduce more kiwi into the area in the future, "so it's imperative that we protect these taonga".</p>
        
            <p>DOC and Ngāti Rangi called on the public to report roaming dogs on conservation land to the 24-hour DOC emergency hotline.</p>
        
            <p>The Dog Control Act 1996 enables the destruction of any dog found to have injured or killed any protected wildlife, including kiwi, and the owner to be fined $20,000, and/or three years in jail.</p>
