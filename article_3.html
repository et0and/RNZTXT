            <p>An alleged thief was caught in Rome after sitting down to read a book during a burglary, according to Italian media.</p>
        
            <p>The 38-year-old is accused of using the balcony of a building to break into an apartment while the owner slept.</p>
        
            <p>However, once inside, he became distracted by a book on a bedside table, and halted the burglary so he could read.</p>
        
            <p>According to local media, the 71-year-old homeowner woke up and confronted the man, who was sitting down on a bed, engrossed in the pages.</p>
        
            <p>The alleged thief tried to escape, but was arrested shortly afterward.</p>
        
            <p>The man told police he was not breaking in, but trying to visit someone he knew, Italian media reported.</p>
        
            <p>The book, Gli Dei alle sei. L'Iliade all'ora dell'aperitivo, examines Homer's Iliad from the point of view of the gods.</p>
        
            <p>Author Giovanni Nucci told Il Messaggero he would like to connect with the alleged thief so he could give him his own copy of the book.</p>
