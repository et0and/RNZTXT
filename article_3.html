            <p>An ingenious invention, a pesky pest eradicated, and an unusual dinner guest were this week's good news stories from RNZ.</p>

            <p>When US stand up comic Ali Wong's producer messaged Auckland cook and MasterChef 2022 winner Sam Low for low key Asian restaurant recommendations in his home town, Low sent over a bunch of ideas as well as an invite to his own home. Next thing, Wong and her family were at his house ready for a home-cooked meal.</p>
        
            <p>While chatting about Ru Paul's Drag Race and dating, the group dined on a feast created by Low including slow cooked duck wrapped in lotus leaf, char siu and more. Wong's verdict: "It tasted like a grandma-made meal from a young person's view."</p>

            <p>A male stoat that has been evading capture on Pōneke's predator-free peninsula since December has finally been caught after a six-month chase.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers from Predator Free Miramar found the stoat dead in its northernmost trap, at the top of the peninsula's ridge. "We've just been doggedly doing the mahi, rebaiting traps and trying to outsmart this little furry critter," said PFM founder Dan Henry. Although reinvasion of pests on the peninsula is a constant threat, its biosecurity systems are working as planned.</p>

The health of the fishery in Niue is crucial to the local people.

            <p>It is hoped that Niue's Marine Protected Area could help fish stocks recover.</p>
        
            <p>The Niue Moana Mahu covers 127,000kmsq, which is half the size of Aotearoa. As a 'no take' zone guided by sustainable management guidelines of the Niue Ocean Wide Trust, it is hoped fish stocks will replenish with nurturing of the entire ocean ecosystem.</p>
        
            <p>Overfishing has previously pummelled fish stocks, including wild tuna. The island's reefs are also recovering from 2004 cyclone Heta. A significant portion of the Niuean population's livelihoods rely on the fishing sector.</p>

            <p>A Lord of the Rings musical is on its way to Auckland's Civic Theatre in November. Lucky ticketholders will get to follow Frodo on his legendary and perilous quest across Middle Earth to the darkest realms of Mordor, to vanquish evil. The dynamic folk-inspired score is performed live on stage, woven with original music and storytelling. The Guardian called it the "Greatest show on Middle Earth."</p>

            <p>Clyde Quay School on Pōneke has raised an astonishing $112,500 by raffling off two Taylor Swift tickets, including airfares to London, seven night's accommodation and spending money. The school sold 4500 raffle tickets for $25 each.</p>
        
            <p>The money will go toward upgrading the school's hall. Board chairwoman Michelle Little says the idea was risky and they were "floored" when the raffle sold out. "It's beyond our wildest dreams...Every[one] in the school is so excited and I believe every kid wishes that they were the one winning."</p>

            <p>A New Zealander at Cambridge University, Dani Clode, has built a prosthetic you can wear on your hand - strapping on opposite your thumb, which connects to controls at the feet.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 98 percent of nearly 600 people who trailled the 'third thumb' were able to successfully operate it. It has potential applications to help stroke patients, as well as people with broken arms. "We give crutches for people that have recently broken a leg, but we don't really have any options for people who've just broken an arm," she says.</p>
