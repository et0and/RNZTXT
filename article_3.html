            <p>A person has been charged after an emailed threat that sent an Auckland school into lockdown on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Waiuku College was one of two schools named in an email threat sent overnight on Wednesday to a number of organisations, including RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Police in Counties Manukau have been investigating where the email came from, leading them to a Māngere East address.</p>
        
            <p>A man and a woman were taken into custody on Thursday morning, with the 20-year-old man charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Counties Manukau District Commander Inspector Alison Brand said the pair were arrested without incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigation staff have been speaking with both of these individuals throughout the day," she said. "This is still very much an active investigation and we are limited in further comment at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>The man was expected to appear in Manukau District Court on Friday, and police were not ruling our further charges.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge the impact these events have on parents and the wider school community," Brand said. "Any threatening message directed towards our educational institutions is taken seriously and police have worked diligently to get to the source of this email."</p>
