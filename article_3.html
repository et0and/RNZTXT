            <p>Dozens are feared dead after a gun attack at a concert hall near Moscow, Russian media say.</p>
        
            <p>At least four people dressed in camouflage opened fire at the Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk, social media video verified by the BBC shows.</p>
        
            <p>The roof of the concert hall, where people were waiting to see a rock band, is engulfed in fire and collapsing, according to Russia's state news.</p>
        
            <p>Russia's Foreign Ministry described the incident as a "terrorist attack".</p>
        
            <p>Specialist police are at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Footage on social media shows gunmen inside the hall, and Russian media report that some people are still inside.</p>
        
            <p>Tass news agency said a third of the concert venue was on fire and the roof was almost completely ablaze.</p>

            <p>Eyewitnesses have started to speak to Russian media about the attack. One man, called Vitaly, said he was on a balcony in the hall when he heard shots fired.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't know what happened at first. Then I saw some terrorists shooting people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They threw some petrol bombs, everything started burning. We were led out towards an exit."</p>
        
            <p>An anonymous eyewitness said parents were attending a ballroom dancing competition in the venue with their children when the shooting started.</p>
        
            <p>"Children and teenagers were at the competition. People came and said there was shooting. A crush ensued. The children were running out in their ballroom gowns."</p>
        
            <p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the images of the shooting were "horrible and hard to watch".</p>
        
            <p>- This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
