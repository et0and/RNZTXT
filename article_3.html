            <p>One of the world's most globally recognised liver cancer treatments will receive public funding from today.</p>
        
            <p>Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with bevacizumab will help the 70 or so New Zealanders diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) each year.</p>
        
            <p>Country medical director at Roche New Zealand Doctor Kerryn Symons said these two treatments combined to treat the cancer.</p>
        
            <p>"Atezolizumab is an immunotherapy that activates the patient's own immune system to fight off the cancer, while the other medicine bevacizumab cuts off the blood-supply to the tumour, which slows down the tumour growth," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Symons said their clinical studies show a 34 percent reduction in the risk of death with this immunotherapy treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"Half of patients are surviving more than 18 months which is a significant improvement on the previous treatments," Symons said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pleased that this treatment, which has been the standard of care in many countries for years, is now funded for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>"With liver cancer being one of the few cancers where mortality rates are on the rise, this treatment can now be accessed by patients throughout Aotearoa which is a great outcome."</p>
        
            <p>Hepatologist and Professor of Medicine at the University of Auckland Ed Gane said it was important New Zealanders had access to better treatment options that were available overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"Patients require this treatment combination when the HCC is unable to be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body," Gane said.</p>
        
            <p>"Clinical trial results have shown that this treatment combination helped patients to live for longer than other medicine. Having this option more readily accessible for New Zealanders is a positive step for patients, their families and those that care for them."</p>
        
            <p>Chronic liver disease was the main cause of HCC and was often undetected.</p>
        
            <p>Hepatitis Foundation of New Zealand chief executive Sarah Davey said it was important New Zealanders also understood that both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C could progress to HCC as well.</p>
        
            <p>"More than 94,000 New Zealanders are living with chronic viral hepatitis B of whom more than 200 will die each year from liver cancer," Davey said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every death is preventable by earlier diagnosis, and follow-up. Hepatitis B is responsible for almost half of HCC cases, while Hepatitis C is responsible for approximately one-third."</p>
        
            <p>Māori and Pacific people were disproportionately affected by HCC, Davey said.</p>
        
            <p>"These populations have a higher prevalence of Hepatitis B and C, obesity and diabetes, which are all underlying risk factors for chronic liver disease. Māori patients have a lower survival rate with 31 percent of Māori patients more likely to die of liver cancer than non-Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"This is due to lower rates of diagnosis and management of the underlying liver disease. With 90 percent of chronic liver disease cases being preventable, these are statistics that need to be turned around," Davey said.</p>
