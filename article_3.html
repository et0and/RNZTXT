            <p>A lithium battery at a nearby recycling depot is the likely cause for a fire that gutted a Christchurch car workshop this morning, the owner says.</p>
        
            <p>At mid morning, smoke was still billowing from the roof of the industrial complex on Cass Street in the suburb of Sydenham.</p>
        
            <p>An alert has been issued because of the smoke coming from the fire, with nearby residents warned to stay indoors with their windows closed.</p>
        
            <p>At least one school was closed because of the smoke.</p>
        
            <p>Auto Inspection Services owner Nick, who did not wish to provide his last name, said his business was a mess and he would likely need to move.</p>
        
            <p>It appeared the fire started in a neighbouring recycling plant before spreading through the roof of the complex and into his business, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Nick dispelled rumours an electric vehicle was the cause, saying the only EV there was his own and it was undamaged.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters believed a blaze at a Sydenham car workshop spread from a pile of waste and general rubbish, but said it's not clear how it started.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch's Hagley College is closing for the day because of the smoke coming from a nearby fire.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Facebook, the College said they had made the decision to close because of the smoke.</p>
        
            <p>"Year 9 & 10 students will be heading to Gym 2 and will be released upon a message from home being sighted. We will make a decision about After 3 later in the day."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Incident controller Dave Key said earlier the fire was contained but still burning.</p>

            <p>50 firefighters and 10 fire engines were battling the Sydenham blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Key said they know where the fire began but were still investigating what caused it.</p>

            <p>He said roads around the workshop would be closed for much of the day but crews aimed to get at least part of Colombo Street reopened by about 10am.</p>
        
            <p>Crews would be at the scene all day and using heavy machinery to turn over the site.</p>
        
            <p>That meant the smoke would be coming and going throughout the day, Key said.</p>
        
            <p>Other businesses ran out of the same building that the workshop was in and would be affected, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Auto Inspection Services on Colombo St shortly before 4.30am on Thursday, a Fire and Emergency NZ spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The large fire was still burning, the spokesperson said and part of Colombo and Durham St, around the building were closed and would remain so for some time.</p>
        
            <p>A police car and ambulance were also at the site, an RNZ reporter said.</p>
        
            <p>The smoke drift was affecting the Sydenham, Addington and Spreydon area, Fire and Emergency said.</p>

            <p>It issued an emergency alert warning people to stay indoors if possible, keep doors and windows closed and be mindful about using air condititioning units.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have any health concerns please call Healthline or 111 in an emergency".</p>
        
            <p>At this stage it was too early to say what had caused the fire, the spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>It was believed it would take some time to extinguish the fire due to the size of the building.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries have been reported.</p>
