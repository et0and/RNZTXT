            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced the government is trialling a targeted maths acceleration programme to give more students confidence in mathematics at today's post-Cabinet press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"After discovering just 22 percent of Year 8 students are at the expected standard for maths, we launched our Make it Count Action Plan to give our teachers the tools they need to set students up for success," Education Minister Erica Stanford said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We're continuing to supercharge our plan so students who need the most help, can catch up to where they need to be.</p>
        
            <p>"In Term 1 and 2 next year, around 2000 Year 7 and 8 students who are behind in their learning will take part in an intensive support programme to bring them up to the required curriculum level in maths.</p>
        
            <p>"The trial will use small group tutoring and supervised online tuition for 30 minutes, up to four times a week for each child."</p>
