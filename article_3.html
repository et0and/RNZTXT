            <p>A bribe was paid to secure the release of New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens, held hostage by the West Papua National Liberation Army for 19 months, the Army says.</p>
        
            <p>Mehrtens was seized by rebels in February 2023 after he landed a small commercial plane in a remote area of Indonesia's Papua region.</p>
        
            <p>He is in good health and has since been reunited with his immediate family in Jakarta.</p>
        
            <p>West Papua National Liberation Army spokesperson Sebby Sambom said they did not regret taking Mehrtens hostage.</p>
        
            <p>"The hostage-taking is reasonable, because we are still fighting for an independent Papua," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Sambom said Mehrtens was treated well by the Liberation Army.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case we know the international humanitarian law on war, so we order the pilot to be guarded properly."</p>
        
            <p>The group had used Philip Mehrtens to promote their fight for independence, and had released intermittent videos of him wearing free West Papua T-shirts, often surrounded by rebels holding military assault rifles, while he was being held captive.</p>
        
            <p>At the time he made this plea: "Indonesia's been dropping bombs in the area over the last week - there's no need and it's dangerous for me an everybody here".</p>
        
            <p>Sambom said he was not worried about an Indonesian military assault now Mehrtens had been freed.</p>
        
            <p>"The West Papua Liberation Army has never been afraid of the Indonesian military and police, and is ready to fight against Indonesia's illegal occupation of West Papua," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The leader of the group that took Mehrtens hostage Egianus Kogoya was bribed with money by a local politician in Nduga province who then gave Mehrtens to Indonesian authorities, Sambom said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not in line with the captors' proposed release terms.</p>

            <p>The family of Mehrtens had issued a statement thanking everyone involved with his release, including the New Zealand and Indonesian governments as well as the captors.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also grateful to General Kogoya and his army for keeping Phil as safe and healthy and for allowing Phil to get several messages out to let us know that he was alive and okay. Those messages filled our souls and gave us hope and that we would eventually see Phil again."</p>
        
            <p>Indonesia Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono said Mehrtens was handed over peacefully, unlike a previous rescue attempt by Indonesia's military.</p>
        
            <p>"Not a single bullet was fired, no one was killed, which is different from what happened in March 2023 when Indonesian military allegedly killed some West Papua militants and in return West Papua militants killed more than a dozen killed Indonesian soldiers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He added Mehrtens' captors have described looking after him with great care, like an egg.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are being treated like an egg, you cannot be cracked at all of course. You have to be fed well, you have to be drinking well, sleeping well, but of course this is hostage taking, and he's not free to walk on his own."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said securing the release had been an enormous effort.</p>
        
            <p>"After 594 days of the capture of him we've got him free and I have to say it's an enormous relief. His family will be absolutely over the moon I believe. And also we want to thank the media for unusually not saying a thing on the critical months and months of work."</p>
        
            <p>While Mehrtens ordeal has made global headlines, Harsono said West Papuans continue to suffer.</p>
        
            <p>However, Pacific leaders plan to meet with Indonesia over human rights abuses in West Papua within the next year.</p>
