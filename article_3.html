            <p>An updated Covid-19 vaccine will be available to New Zealanders from next winter.</p>
        
            <p>Today Medsafe has approved Pfizer's application for the updated shot for the XBB.1.5 strain to be used.</p>
        
            <p>Medsafe group manager Chris James said following a robust and efficient approval process the vaccine will be used to help reduce next year's winter load on the country's hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>"The series of changes we see in the Covid-19 virus means we need to continually reassess and update our response to it."</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac's director, pharmaceuticals Geraldine MacGibbon said it was important to ensure the best available protection was available for people as they headed into the winter season.</p>
        
            <p>"Securing Covid-19 vaccine stock for 2024 is a high priority for Pharmac.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working with the suppliers, Medsafe, and Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora, to ensure New Zealanders have access to the Covid-19 XBB.1.5 vaccine in time for people to protect themselves and their whƒÅnau ahead of winter."</p>
        
            <p>MacGibbon said they understood people would be interested in who will have access to the XBB.1.5 vaccine when became available.</p>
        
            <p>"There are no changes to eligibility at present. If Pharmac were to consider changes that would affect people's access, we'd consult publicly to ensure we're incorporating feedback from the healthcare sector and the community into our decision."</p>
        
            <p>He said they will share more information on their website and with the public as it becomes available.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Health deputy director of public health, Harriette Carr said the current Covid-19 BA.4.5 booster vaccines remained available and were effective in reducing the risk of severe illness from the virus.</p>
        
            <p>"People are encouraged to get a booster now if due, as we are in the midst of a current Covid-19 wave. If you are due, don't wait until next year."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was important for people to get a booster now to protect themselves their loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Science Media Centre, modelling was suggesting that hospitalisations for the current Covid wave were due to peak this week - just days before Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>While the newest variant JN.1 was picking up speed in New Zealand, stocks of antiviral Paxlovid were running out, it said.</p>
        
            <p>University of Canterbury's Professor Michael Plank said JN.1 was likely the fastest growing variant seen this year, and could lengthen the time New Zealand was in its current wave.</p>
