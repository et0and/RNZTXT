            <p>Outgoing All Blacks coach Ian Foster has confirmed his wife and daughter were confronted by a knife wielding man while in Paris for the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"In regards to recent reports, I can confirm there was an incident involving my wife and one of my daughters in Paris during the opening week of the Rugby World Cup," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Leigh (Foster's wife) and (daughter) Michaela were walking to our team hotel from a nearby train station in the early evening when they were confronted by a young man with a knife.</p>
        
            <p>Foster's daughter Michaela is a member of the Football Ferns and plays for the Wellington Phoenix in the women's A-League competition.</p>
        
            <p>"The man appeared to be under the influence of something," said Foster.</p>
        
            <p>"My family were able to defuse the situation calmly but firmly and the man left.</p>
        
            <p>"Team security, which included local authorities, were made aware of this when Leigh and Michaela returned."</p>

            <p>Foster maintains the incident "did not in any way take away from our time in France which was positive overall."</p>
        
            <p>Foster didn't reveal the incident during the World Cup which the AllBlacks went on to finish runners-up after losing the final to South Africa 12-11.</p>
        
            <p>The match was Foster's last in charge of the side with former Crusaders coach Scott Robertson having now officially taken over the job.</p>
