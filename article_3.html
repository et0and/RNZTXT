            <p>Don McGovern is keen on the outdoors, with experience in lawn mowing, landscaping and construction management.</p>
        
            <p>But he is probably not your average job seeker - at 82 years old his job hunt is simply not going anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>"You can go to an interview, you tick all the boxes... [they say] fantastic we'll be back in touch tonight or first thing in the morning - I'm still waiting for those phone calls," he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>Ageism came into play, he said, but "age is a state of mind".</p>
        
            <p>"It's very disheartening, I know I can do the jobs with one hand behind my back, the jobs are less than what my training is, what I've done all my life, but I'm prepared to take a lesser job."</p>

            <p>It was a tough job market out there, with unemployment rising to 4.3 percent in the three months ended March.</p>

            <p>He has worked all of his life and said that would not change even if he won Lotto.</p>

            <p>For the past 10-12 years he had his own business in the industry but he sold up after doing up long hours six days a week.</p>
        
            <p>"I like work satisfaction, you can drive out the gate, look back, everything is looking pristine and... my clients have always been top clients, large properties and they like things looking nice. And that's what I do."</p>

            <p>McGovern's pitch to potential employers: "If you want an honest worker, I'm the person. I don't take a phone to work, I don't stop for photos, I have an early breakfast, I go to work and I love my job. I have a great eye for detail."</p>
