            <p>Palmerston North's streets have become busier - but quieter.</p>
        
            <p>From Monday, the city's bus fleet is 100 percent electric - a first in New Zealand - as more than 40 new buses enter service as part of a huge investment in public transport.</p>
        
            <p>Services in the city are more than doubling.</p>
        
            <p>City bus driver Charles Te Peeti said the new buses were smoother and came without the smell of diesel wafting through from the "ratty engines".</p>
        
            <p>"They're nicely set up, with the air conditioning on board these new buses - comfortable for everybody," Te Peeti said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're pretty quiet. You can hear everyone talking and if everyone's talking it means everyone's having a good ride."</p>

            <p>Routes in the city were changing from loops through the suburbs to direct, point-to-point services.</p>
        
            <p>There were a few first-day hiccups, but plenty of regional council and Tranzit bus staff on hand around city stops to help people, such as Maureen McArdle, get used to new routes.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said the change was not all positive.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cut down two areas where I can go shopping, so I have to come into town for my grocery shopping, which is more than I had to do in the past," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to go to the cathedral on Broadway, but it doesn't go down there any more. That's where I go to church, so that's a nuisance. I have to get a taxi."</p>

            <p>Ari Lewis-Clarke, who was on his way to Massey University, said the new stops were "kind of confusing".</p>
        
            <p>"I missed my bus, twice. That kind of sucked."</p>
        
            <p>"It is closer for me to catch now. It's just taking a bit of figuring out," Reita Barrow said.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems really good. I'm hoping it will be successful for them."</p>
        
            <p>McArdle, and other commuters RNZ spoke to, were pleased to see the introduction of electric buses - and their lower emissions.</p>
        
            <p>The new bus network will cost about $11 million a year to operate, up from $4.5m- $5m.</p>
        
            <p>Services now run later in the evenings and go every 15 minutes during peak times.</p>
        
            <p>There are 610 services each weekday, up from 324. At weekends there are 428 a day, up from 107 on Saturdays and 77 on Sundays.</p>

            <p>Horizons Regional Council transport manager Mark Read said he would love to see passenger numbers top one million a year, up from 610,000 in the year to June 2023, and 455,000 since July.</p>
        
            <p>The next six to 12 months were about bedding in the new network.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a massive change for Palmerston North and transport in Palmerston North - I'd say probably the biggest change that the city has seen in anything transport-wise in a decade or more," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any city now should be able to provide options for people to be able to move around their city in a way that suits them."</p>
        
            <p>Regional council chairwoman Rachel Keedwell had no doubt more people would hop aboard.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an amazing milestone and it's a step change for Palmerston North. It's 100 percent electric and it's a brand-new network.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fast. It's frequent. It's direct and it means people will be able to get around the city in a way they just haven't been able to up until now."</p>

            <p>There were concerns that the new routes meant people used to catching a bus near their property would now have to walk several hundred metres to a stop - not easy for those with mobility problems.</p>
        
            <p>Keedwell acknowledged the change was tough for some, and said officials had added a new trial route in response to concerns.</p>
        
            <p>She had no doubt the new system was worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was only a minor increase in costs to be a fully electric fleet. I think it was going to be 80 percent electric, so we decided it was worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"The long-term benefits of it were worth the extra investment."</p>
        
            <p>Horizons transport committee chairperson Sam Ferguson said the regional council was trialling more frequent services in Whanganui too - about every 20 minutes - and passenger numbers there had increased strongly.</p>
        
            <p>"That's coming from a level of service where people were sometimes getting buses only every two hours. We really stepped it up."</p>
        
            <p>Palmerston North city councillor Brent Barrett said there was a sizeable population who might not drive around the city.</p>
        
            <p>"In Palmerston North there's 7500 adults that have no driver's licence. It means this bus service is absolutely essential."</p>

            <p>Bus operator Tranzit had employed and trained about 50 extra drivers on top of its existing 30.</p>
        
            <p>Project manager James Howard said it had overcome shipping hold-ups to get the 42 new buses - Palmerston North previously had one electric bus operating - to New Zealand on time.</p>
        
            <p>"All the buses were finished in late October and early November, however, what happened was due to the conflict in the Middle East a lot of ships were delayed coming into China and therefore there's a ripple effect to getting the busses through into New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Two arrived before Christmas and the rest arrived in early January."</p>
        
            <p>That was enough time to get the drivers trained on their new routes.</p>
        
            <p>Howard said it took between one and three hours to charge each bus. They were fully charged overnight and would get through a day's service.</p>
        
            <p>Bus travel is free in Palmerston North for the rest of March.</p>
