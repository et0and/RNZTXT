            <p>Banks are competing hard to win customers' money in what appears to be an escalating mortgage war.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ cut interest rates again this week, but notably it has also trimmed its floating mortgage rate by 15 basis points - the first bank to do so in a while.</p>
        
            <p>It followed a general trend of declining mortgage interest rates in recent weeks as wholesale rates eased in anticipation of the Reserve Bank lowering the official cash rate.</p>
        
            <p>Mortgage advisor Mikey Smith from Guardian Smith said banks have targeted borrowers coming up for renewal, and he has seen increasing wiggle room from banks' during negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very noticeable, I feel like I'm updating people everyday, There's a new rate available for them - I think more so for the people with existing mortgages and I think that's what has driven it.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last couple of years, with interest rates being so high relative to the last 10 years - everyone's price sensitive at the moment and everyone's looking around for what option can provide them some easing."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said banks were aware borrowers were shopping around and were willing to negotiate with advisors.</p>
        
            <p>He said banks were also offering better cash-backs as they fought to win over clients.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely some competition out there," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>As for new home sales, Smith did not expect a sharp pick-up in activity if rates were to come down suddenly.</p>
        
            <p>"People are looking at things like job security and stuff like that which wasn't a problem during the pandemic."</p>
