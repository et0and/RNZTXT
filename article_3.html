            <p>Front-line services could face cut-backs as the coalition government looks to shave more than a billion dollars in annual public sector spending, the minister of finance has acknowledged.</p>
        
            <p>But Nicola Willis said the chief executives of government departments were expected to use "good judgement" when proposing where savings could be made.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-nine government departments or agency chief executives were asked in December to suggest annual savings or either 6.5 or 7.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury confirmed on Friday the chief executives could suggest cuts to both departmental and non-departmental funding.</p>
        
            <p>Departmental funding is spent on an agency's core business and operational expenses, while non-departmental funding is managed by an agency on behalf of the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>Examples of non-departmental expenditure include the Ministry of Culture and Heritage's funding of Te Matatini, the Royal New Zealand Ballet and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour Party's public services spokesperson Ayesha Verrall has been critical of National's plan to cut public service spending.</p>
        
            <p>Verrall told RNZ front-line services were at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Departmental spending is on a ministry, it is those important back-office functions but Nicola Willis has asked for cuts to non-departmental funding. That means [cuts to] Te Whatu Ora ... housing providers, it means all of the services that are provided in a front-line way to New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"Non-departmental cuts means that New Zealanders will suffer losses in their services.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a broken election promise. National promised cuts will be confined to back-office functions," Verrall said.</p>
        
            <p>National campaigned on slashing back-office public service spending across 24 public agencies by 6.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Willis said it would be up to the chief executives of government departments to decide where the cuts could be made.</p>
        
            <p>"Agencies have been asked to develop credible savings options, while ensuring New Zealanders continue to receive quality public services.</p>
        
            <p>"Agency chief executives and their staff are expected to use their good judgement, and proposals for savings will describe any impacts to front-line services consistent with our priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers and Cabinet will make final decisions on whether to accept those proposals as part of the Budget 2024 process."</p>
