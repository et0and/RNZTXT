            <p>Analysis - State asset sales have been a political dividing line in New Zealand for decades now, and it seems voters are again being asked to decide which side they're on.</p>
        
            <p>In his state-of-the-nation speech last week, ACT Party leader David Seymour advised New Zealanders to "get past their squeamishness about privatisation" and ask themselves:</p>
        
            <p>"If we want to be a first-world country, then are we making the best use of the government's half a trillion dollars-plus worth of assets? If something isn't getting a return, the government should sell it so we can afford to buy something that does."</p>
        
            <p>No doubt this appealed to ACT's core constituency.</p>
        
            <p>But the available evidence suggests many New Zealanders view the privatisation of state assets with scepticism, not squeamishness.</p>
        
            <p>The most rigorous available data are from the New Zealand Election Study: just under 50 percent of those surveyed in 2020 either "somewhat" or "strongly" agreed with the proposition that "privatisation has gone too far".</p>
        
            <p>Just over 9 percent either somewhat or strongly disagreed with that statement. In other words, those who oppose state asset sales comfortably outnumber those who support them.</p>
        
            <p>It seems reasonable to suggest this reflects the sizeable proportion of New Zealanders who remember the asset sales experience of the 1980s and 1990s under both Labour and National governments.</p>
        
            <p>Writing in 2000, during the heights of this bipartisan privatisation boom, economic analyst Brian Gaynor argued:</p>
        
            <p>"By selling 100 percent shareholdings in state assets, the New Zealand Government has allowed a small group of investors, mainly offshore, to make enormous profits. With just a little foresight these profits could have been kept for the benefit of domestic investors and taxpayers."</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, voters have watched levels of wealth inequality rise, and the transfer of public wealth into private hands.</p>
        
            <p>And while asset sales can improve efficiency, they can also reduce access to services for those on limited incomes or experiencing higher unemployment.</p>
        
            <p>Research has shown a clear majority of New Zealanders would prefer the government to provide social services, especially in health and education.</p>
        
            <p>Just over 80 percent of New Zealanders trust the public service based on their own experiences.</p>
        
            <p>And levels of trust in the public service those in the private sector. All this suggests there is little appetite for a return to the days of peak privatisation.</p>
        
            <p>More broadly, some New Zealanders will also question Seymour's assertion that state assets should provide a return on investment.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from it not being possible to turn a profit on many of the assets a government needs to serve the needs of its citizens, there are costs associated with putting a market value on certain social goods and services.</p>
        
            <p>As Harvard political philosopher Michael Sandel has argued:</p>
        
            <p>hen money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life - decent healthcare, access to the best education, political voice and influence in campaigns - when money comes to govern all of those things, inequality matters a great deal.</p>
        
            <p>Furthermore, there is ample evidence of the ethical and operational shortcomings of applying the profit motive to public institutions such as prisons, hospitals and schools.</p>
        
            <p>Nor are markets themselves value-free, self-correcting mechanisms. In the material economy, they have a propensity to fail. When they do, the people who suffer most tend to be those least well-positioned to defend themselves.</p>
        
            <p>That is why the state performs certain functions: to make sure those unable to pay for privately provided goods and services are not denied them.</p>
        
            <p>The nature and extent of what the state should provide is quite properly a matter for debate. But those decisions affect everyone and should be decided in the public domain, not left to the managers and owners of private companies.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour also suggested a return to asset sales was justified by the country's current levels of public debt. He referred to "the other tribe" who are "building a majority for mediocrity - who would love nothing more than to go into lockdown again, make some more sourdough, and worry about the billions in debt another day."</p>
        
            <p>But as the right-leaning Maxim Institute points out:</p>
        
            <p>"The real risk in New Zealand is our very high levels of private debt, which includes household debt like mortgages, student loans, credit card, hire purchases, to buying a car in instalments  Compared to our relatively low levels of public debt our current household debt stands at 95 percent of GDP."</p>
        
            <p>According to the Treasury, current public debt levels are "prudent", although "an ageing population, climate change and historical trends mean governments have important choices to make".</p>
        
            <p>The risk of renewed asset sales and privatisation is that public debt might be reduced but at the expense of private debt increasing.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has responded by saying he was open to a conversation about selling state assets. While it was "not something on our agenda right now", he said, he hinted National may campaign on it ahead of next year's election.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>His other coalition partner, NZ First, has a long-held antipathy to selling local assets to offshore owners. And Luxon may also remember the result of the non-binding citizens-initiated referendum in 2013 when 67.3 percent opposed the potential sale of the state's energy companies.</p>
        
            <p>A niche party such as ACT can safely take policy positions that have little appeal beyond its core supporters. But that's not a luxury available to its major coalition partner, which started the year behind in the polls.</p>
        
            <p>On the other hand, National does not want to be outflanked any further by ACT. Asset sales, it seems, are destined to remain a perennial political fault line.</p>
