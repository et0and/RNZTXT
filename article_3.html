            <p>Six people have been arrested after two separate alleged supermarket thefts in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In one incident, police received a report a trio had allegedly left the supermarket in Highland Park in east Auckland without paying on Sunday afternoon, Inspector Rakana Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"Customers had alerted staff members to the theft after seeing them walk out without paying and load their vehicles with unpaid groceries.</p>
        
            <p>Cook said two siblings were arrested after trying to flee on foot.</p>
        
            <p>"A third person, a son of one of the others arrested, was taken into custody after being stopped a short distance away with a carload of groceries."</p>
        
            <p>It was estimated that the six trolleys worth of groceries the trio allegedly took was worth $16,000.</p>
        
            <p>A man, 35, is scheduled to appear in the Manukau District Court on 28 March charged with three counts of shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>A woman, 25, is charged with one count of shoplifting and will reappear in the Manukau District Court on 15 April.</p>
        
            <p>An 18-year-old will appear in the Manukau District Court.</p>
        
            <p>In a separate incident, police were alerted to three men leaving a supermarket on Manukau Road in Pukekohe with a shopping trolley full of meat products around midday on Saturday, Inspector Joe Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>"They then walked through the self-checkout without paying, while also threatening a member of the public who had confronted them during the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"The offenders left the store and loaded the stolen meat into a vehicle in the car park and drove away."</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Hunter said officers were able to find the vehicle because a member of the public noted the number plate and passed that information to police.</p>
        
            <p>"In Drury, a police unit signalled for the driver to stop on Great South Road which he did, and the stolen meat was found inside.</p>
        
            <p>Three men were taken into custody without incident," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The meat, valued at about $750, was recovered and returned to the supermarket.</p>
        
            <p>"Following enquiries, we have laid additional charges over an earlier incident at a P≈çkeno supermarket on 21 March where around $1000 in meat products were stolen," said Inspector Hunter.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, 39 and 25, were scheduled to appear in the Pukekohe District Court on 27 March facing multiple shoplifting charges.</p>
        
            <p>A third man, 28, was also set to appear on shoplifting charges but faced a separate charge of speaking threateningly.</p>
