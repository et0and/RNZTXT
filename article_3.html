            <p>The number of New Zealanders hampered by asthma or serious lung disease has grown by more than 40 percent in three years, new data shows.</p>
        
            <p>The 2023 Impact of Respiratory Disease in New Zealand report, released on Monday, reveals one in five New Zealanders are affected by a respiratory illness - equating to about a million people.</p>
        
            <p>The previous report, released in 2021, showed one in seven New Zealanders were affected, equivalent to about 700,000.</p>
        
            <p>Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ chief executive Letitia Harding pointed to two key factors in the figures: the Covid pandemic and improvements seen in the diagnosis of asthma and chronic lung disease.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see the prevalence of adult asthma as worse than what it was.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe we're identifying it earlier and more accurately which means people can go onto better medication which is now available.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't cure something like asthma."</p>
        
            <p>Respiratory disease accounts for one in 11 hospital admissions and is the third leading cause of death in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 restrictions had somewhat tempered the figures, particularly for more vulnerable groups, Harding said.</p>
        
            <p>"Those figures would've certainly been higher for people that we know Covid can be more devastating for and end in mortalities.</p>
        
            <p>"For the population we're looking at, those restrictions were certainly good."</p>
        
            <p>For adults and children, asthma rates for both categories uniformly sat at one in eight who were affected.</p>
        
            <p>"That's where we want to try and diagnose that early so we can get onto it effectively," Harding said.</p>
        
            <p>The report said the cost of respiratory disease to New Zealand was estimated at nearly $8.5 billion every 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a significant area that still needs attention."</p>
        
            <p>The Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ was pushing for urgent new and extended programmes to reduce "severe ethnic and socio-economic inequalities" in respiratory disease. Another recommendation was initiatives to improve housing quality.</p>
        
            <p>"The healthy homes are crucial," Harding said.</p>
        
            <p>"We hear so often from our specialists and nurse practitioners of kids who go in and out of hospital over winter ... they're in ED with several bouts of pneumonia.</p>
        
            <p>"That causes a devastating impact on the lungs.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to look at these cold damp homes."</p>
        
            <p>The return-to-school period also increased the risk of respiratory hospitalisation for children, and an estimated 360,000 school days were lost each year because of asthma.</p>
        
            <p>Around the country, the West Coast had the highest mortality rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while Tairāwhiti and Counties Manukau had the highest rate for bronchiectasis.</p>
        
            <p>The Mid Central region (Manawatū) had the highest asthma rate.</p>
        
            <p>Foundation medical director Professor Bob Hancox said it was clear that respiratory disease continued to cause "a great deal of suffering" for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>However, hospitalisations for asthma and COPD were trending down, exceeding the foundation's target of a 25 percent reduction by 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"This likely reflects the improvements in prevention and care of these conditions that the foundation has been advocating for years," Hancox said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we must acknowledge that far too many people still suffer unnecessarily from conditions that could be prevented or treated more effectively."</p>
        
            <p>The report's lead author Dr Lucy Telfar-Barnard said access to new data meant the true scope of respiratory disease in New Zealand was more explicit .</p>
        
            <p>"There are practical steps we can take like staying home when sick, keeping our flu vaccinations up to date, and ensuring good ventilation in our homes, schools, and workplaces."</p>
