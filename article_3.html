            <p>Rebels in Indonesia's West Papua region have proposed the terms of release for the New Zealand pilot taken hostage almost 18 months ago.</p>
        
            <p>The armed faction of the West Papua National Liberation Army kidnapped Phillip Merhtens in February last year after he landed a small commercial plane in a remote, mountainous area.</p>
        
            <p>The group has tried to use Mehrtens to broker independence from Indonesia.</p>
        
            <p>It is now asking the New Zealand government, including the police and army, to escort the pilot and for local and international journalists to be involved in the release process.</p>
        
            <p>Both Foreign Affairs and the minister's office say they are aware of the proposed plan.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, they say their focus remains on securing a peaceful resolution and the pilot's safe release.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to work closely with all parties to achieve this and will not be discussing the details publicly."</p>
