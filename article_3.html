            <p>Expect no let up in the quality of cricket from the Black Caps in the third and final one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Eden Park later on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Big wins in the first two games, by nine wickets in Wellington and 113 runs in Hamilton, secured the series against the tourists, but the dynamic of Champions Trophy selection looms of this third match.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen players will be named on Sunday morning to travel to the tournament to be played in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates next month.</p>
        
            <p>Batter Rachin Ravindra seems a certain selection, but he insists that the focus must remain on the here and now, starting with victory over Sri Lanka today, and a three nil series win.</p>
        
            <p>"No matter what cricket's ahead, no matter what big tournament's on the horizon, what matters right now is this moment, and for us that's to go to Eden Park and put on a performance for the fans," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra has been in good form in the series, with scores of 45 and 79, but the Wellingtonian is not satisfied, especially with some big matches just around the corner.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always ways you want to get better, there's always ways you want to improve and I think if we can keep doing that as a team, that's important."</p>
        
            <p>"But also it's being true to ourselves and playing the game we want to as Kiwis and we know no matter what, that even if its a dead rubber or not, we're still getting out there to give 100 percent," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Middle order player Mark Chapman has also been scoring nicely in the series, with an unbeaten 29 in Wellington before 62 off just 52 balls in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>The versatile Chapman has batted in several positions in recent years, but in this series he has been at three, the spot Kane Williamson, who's not played against Sri Lanka, normally occupies.</p>
        
            <p>Chapman has consigned that Williamson will come straight back in, no matter how well he performs, and he has tried to push that thinking to the back of his mind.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously Kane, is probably our best ever player in history, so if you're dropping out for him, you're letting someone in that's pretty handy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you try not to think about it too much, you sort of look at the challenge you've got in the here and now and you do your best in that moment."</p>
