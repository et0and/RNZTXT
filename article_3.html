            <p>Springboks v All Blacks</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 3am Sunday 1 September (NZT)</p>
        
            <p>Ellis Park, Johannesburg</p>

            <p>The All Blacks face their biggest challenge of the season so far when they meet their greatest opponents at ground zero of their monumental rivalry. The Springboks and around 60,000 fans await them at a place called "the cauldron of hell" by one local journalist - more commonly known as Ellis Park by rugby followers worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>This is no ordinary test match. It's the 107th time the All Blacks and Springboks have gone to war against each other, with a history behind them that transcends rugby and even sport itself. The bitterness of the past, the hope of one country's new dawn and the outright domination of the two sides is something unique, something that only New Zealanders and South Africans can fully understand.</p>
        
            <p>This is the heavyweight championship of rugby, and the bell is about to ring.</p>

            <p>Here are the two teams:</p>
        
            <p>Springboks: 1. Ox Nche 2. Bongi Nbonambi 3. Frans Malherbe 4. Pieter-Steph du Toit 5. Ruan Nortje 6. Siya Kolisi (c) 7. Ben-Jason Dixon 8. Jasper Wiese 9. Cobus Reinach 10. Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu 11. Kurt-Lee Arendse 12. Damian de Allande 13. Jesse Kriel 14. Cheslin Kolbe 15. Aphelele Fassi</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16. Malcolm Marx 17. Gerhard Steenkamp 18. Vincent Koch 19. Eben Etzebeth 20. Elrigh Louw 21. Kwagga Smith 22. Grant Williams 23. Handre Pollard</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks: 1. Tamaiti Williams 2. Codie Taylor 3. Tyrel Lomax 4. Scott Barrett (c) 5. Tupou Vaa'i 6. Ethan Blackadder 7. Sam Cane 8. Ardie Savea 9. TJ Perenara 10. Damian McKenzie 11. Caleb Clarke 12. Jordie Barrett 13. Rieko Ioane 14. Will Jordan 15. Beauden Barrett</p>

            <p>Just the two changes to the starting XV and they're both in the pack. Unsurprisingly, Scott Barrett comes back in at lock and captain, after missing the last two tests with a finger injury. Sam Cane also returns to the openside, in his first start since last year's fateful World Cup final in which he was sent off after 20 minutes. Sam Darry moves back to the bench while Samipeni Finau comes into the squad to cover loose forward.</p>
        
            <p>Rassie Erasmus has made nine changes to his side that beat the Wallabies in Perth; however, this was always going to be the case. There's been a lot of talk around Eben Etzebeth's involvement - first he was ruled out, then named on the bench, so it might not be much of a surprise to see him start, after all. All eyes will be on the "bomb squad" of Malcolm Marx, Gerhard Steenkamp, Vincent Koch, Etzebeth, Elrigh Louw and Kwagga Smith and what they can do when they come on.</p>

            <p>"Everyone knows how South Africa plays. Their kicking game is exemplary, the ruck work. They're playing a little bit more, there's a little bit of Tony Brown magic in there. They can play around you if they need to, so we're well aware of all their strengths." - All Blacks coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be stupid if we don't respect them. We'll be bad coaches, we'll be stupid players, we'll be an arrogant nation, we'll be put back in our place." - Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus.</p>

            <p>Sorry to have to bring it up, but this absolute grind of a game could have gone the All Blacks' way, had it not been for a couple of missed kicks. Cane's red card and a controversial TMO intervention also played their part, but really the Boks simply took their very few chances on offer and were happy simply to let the score increase by three at a time.</p>

            <p>While the Springboks are favourites - and rightly so - it is worth remembering the All Blacks actually have a pretty good record at Ellis Park. They've won three out of the last four played here and the last one was under extremely tense circumstances. If the All Blacks are going to pull it off, they need to have fixed their lineout issues, because the impressive scrum can't be relied upon entirely.</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks have Sacha Feinburg-Mgnomezulu starting at 10, which may well be an area to target, because if the All Blacks can force him to be subbed, the Boks will have to slow down their game to suit Handre Pollard.</p>
