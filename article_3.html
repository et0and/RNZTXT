            <p>People around the world have been flocking to vote for their favourite feathered fauna in Forest and Bird's Bird of the Century competition.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of thousands of votes have been cast, overwhelming the organisation. As a result, the announcement of the winner has been delayed.</p>
        
            <p>Last year the votes only topped out at just over 50,000.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after comedian John Oliver launched an international campaign to get the Pūteketeke, the Australasian Crested Grebe elected.</p>

            <p>He called his campaign "alarmingly aggressive," putting up posters around New Zealand announcing Pūteketeke as 'Lord of the Wings,' with billboards in cities such as Mumbai, Paris andTokyo.</p>
        
            <p>Forest and Bird chief executive Nicola Toki told Morning Report overall, the enthusiasm in the competition has been a blessing.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now, the entire world and especially New Zealand is facing a biodiversity crisis and part of that crisis is people not feeling connected enough or being able to celebrate the things that make our place so special," said Toki.</p>
        
            <p>"The more people talking about our native wildlife in New Zealand and how important that is, particularly off the back of another kind of election, is great to me."</p>
        
            <p>Toki said her team are working around the clock to sort through every single vote, with the winner announced after Wednesday morning.</p>
