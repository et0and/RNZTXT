            <p>Oji Fibre Solutions Penrose mill is permanently closing, the E tÅ« union says.</p>
        
            <p>Union spokesperson Joe Gallagher said the mill's last day would be 18 December and at least 72 workers at the mill had been affected.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter outside the mill on Wednesday said about 30 workers looked sombre as they went into a meeting about 8am.</p>
        
            <p>Oji Fibre Solutions said it was considering closing its Penrose mill, partly due to high power prices. Up to 75 workers would be affected.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, 230 workers at Winston Pulp International were told the sawmill and pulp mills near Ruapehu were both closing for good.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins called on the government to do more about electricity prices following the confirmation of closure. "I think this is a sign of market failure and something the government should get on top of very quickly," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the meeting, Gallagher told Morning Report workers were resigned to being told there was a closure.</p>
        
            <p>He said a combination of factors was behind the current situation, including power and gas prices, but also a lack of past capital investment.</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher said 50m in capital upgrades were needed if the mill were to remain open, Gallagher said.</p>
        
            <p>"They ruled that out as a solution.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the signal is quite clear that the announcement today will be a closure.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to support these workers and it's a pretty tough time, leading up to Christmas, to lose your job," Gallagher said.</p>
