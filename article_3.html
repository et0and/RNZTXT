            <p>A 34-year-old social media influencer has been accused of torturing her baby daughter and taking photos of her in "immense distress and pain" to elicit donations.</p>
        
            <p>She is also accused of defrauding donors of A$60,000 via GoFundMe.</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland mother was arrested at Logan, south of Brisbane, on Thursday and charged with administering poison with intent to harm, making child exploitation material and fraud.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with preparation to commit crimes with dangerous things.</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland influencer was arrested at Logan, south of Brisbane, on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that the person we have charged has administered these drugs, this poison, to increase that person's social media profile ... and therefore obtaining a financial benefit," Detective Inspector Paul Dalton said.</p>
        
            <p>Police will allege the child would have become "gravely ill" and could have died if she had stayed in the accused's care.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dalton said the child was now "going well".</p>

            <p>Police allege between 6 August 6 and 15 October last year, the woman gave medicine to her one-year-old daughter without medical approval.</p>
        
            <p>They allege the woman disregarded medical advice and "went to lengths to obtain unauthorised medicines", which included old medications prescribed to another person in the home.</p>
        
            <p>It's alleged the woman took photos and videos of her child in "immense pain and distress" to "entice monetary donations and online followers".</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dalton said police would allege the woman defrauded donors of A$60,000.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been dealing with GoFundMe and I understand through my investigators that they are making attempts to repay that money to the people ... who donated that money," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dalton said the child was initially in hospital for a "genuine, serious health reason".</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's important to note that the hospital staff must be extremely distressed and anxious about what happened here, and they've done nothing wrong at all," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be alleging the person has done what she's done in defiance of medical opinion."</p>
        
            <p>Police allege the woman "carefully concealed" what she was doing, until it was reported to police in October last year by medical staff at a hospital in Brisbane's south, where the child was being treated.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dalton said the child had suffered a "medical episode".</p>
        
            <p>"The experts have described that the child would have been going through severe emotional and physical distress and harm," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dalton said police took "immediate action" after the hospital staff reported their concern for the child.</p>
        
            <p>He said "a lot" of other people had been investigated but "the only evidence that we can establish to the satisfaction of the court is the lady we've charged".</p>
        
            <p>It will be alleged tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result on 7 January.</p>
        
            <p>The woman is due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday.</p>
