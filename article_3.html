            <p>The Solicitor-General has declined a police request to lay human trafficking charges against a Hawke's Bay man who is already facing charges of rape and exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, police believed they may have uncovered a human trafficking and migrant exploitation ring in the region, sparked by a "distraught" victim raising the alarm.</p>
        
            <p>In December, a now 45-year-old man was arrested and charged with unlawful sexual connection and rape.</p>
        
            <p>His interim name suppression was lifted in January, and Stuff reported he was named as Parminder Singh.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff also reported he denied those charges.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, a second alleged victim had come forward and Singh now faced further charges, including rape and exploitation of an employee, police said.</p>
        
            <p>In December, detective senior sergeant Sally Patrick told RNZ police believed migrant exploitation and human trafficking were also at play - but they first had to follow due process and seek the Solicitor-General's consent to lay the trafficking charges.</p>
        
            <p>That consent was not granted.</p>
        
            <p>"The acting deputy Solicitor-General declined consent on the basis that, on the material made available to Crown Law, there was insufficient evidence to prove such a charge at this time," the Solicitor-General's office said.</p>
        
            <p>The fact that sexual offending charges and exploitation charges had already been laid was considered as part of that decision, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Singh faced trial by jury, and was next due to appear at Napier District Court on 9 August.</p>
