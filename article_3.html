            <p>Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton has apologised to the Jewish community after allegations were made about a sergeant performing a Nazi salute in front of police recruits.</p>
        
            <p>Police allege a 65-year-old sergeant from People Development Command (PDC) made the gesture on two occasions this week at the Victoria Police Academy in Glen Waverley in Melbourne's south-east.</p>
        
            <p>PDC is the training unit for sworn members of Victoria Police from recruits through to executive leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Nazi salute is illegal in Victoria and carries a maximum penalty of $24,000 or 12 months' jail.</p>
        
            <p>Patton said the sergeant had been a police officer for 40 years and spent 16 years at the academy. He said he was in a state of disbelief when he heard the allegation.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought we're better than this, the Victorian community is better than this," Patton said.</p>
        
            <p>"It lets down our reputation. It disappointed me, it made me angry and I couldn't believe that anybody in this day and age would involve themselves in such appalling, abhorrent conduct.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to profoundly apologise to the Jewish community but also the community as a whole."</p>
        
            <p>Patton said the sergeant was suspended immediately and was being interviewed as part of a criminal investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"This occurs in a week when we saw people around the world coming together in solidarity to support the Jewish community, the Jewish people, when we're one year after the worst loss of life they have had since the Holocaust.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a time of profound sadness this week. The grief for the Jewish people has been [in] evidence and this will only exacerbate that grief and pain they're feeling."</p>
        
            <p>The first person found guilty of the offence, Jacob Hersant, will be sentenced in November after performing the gesture in front of the media outside court last year.</p>
        
            <p>It is alleged the police officer was on duty when she made the gesture on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.</p>
        
            <p>Last night, she was suspended with pay while a criminal investigation takes place.</p>
        
            <p>Professional Standards Command is investigating.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said Victoria Police would not comment further at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Association described the allegations as serious and highlighted that the accused member had yet to be interviewed over what was said to have occurred.</p>
        
            <p>But it said it supported the ban on the Nazi salute.</p>
        
            <p>"The Police Association has consistently condemned this offensive gesture and urged the government to toughen legislation and penalties against those who perform it," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"That stance applies to everyone in our community."</p>
