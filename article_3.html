        <h2>How AI is improving the lives of physically disabled people</h2>
        <p>
The benefits of AI outweigh the concerns, writes Eleanor Beidatsch, an ABC News journalist with spinal muscular atrophy. Video

            <p>When I was a baby, the doctors told my parents I would die by the time I was two years old.</p>
        
            <p>I was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy or SMA type 1, an incurable genetic condition that causes profound muscle weakness and difficulty breathing.</p>
        
            <p>This came as a devastating shock to my parents, and it started my mum on a quest to learn everything she could about my condition and find a way to prevent it from killing me.</p>
        
            <p>She was successful and now I'm a 31-year-old ABC journalist and palaeontology master's student at the University of New England.</p>
        
            <p>So, hats off to mum, she did a good job.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up with a profound physical disability in the 1990s wasn't easy though, especially when it came to education.</p>
        
            <p>I can't move my hands enough to write or type on a keyboard, so for high school and most of university, I dictated everything to a scribe who wrote for me.</p>
        
            <p>This didn't give me much independence and if the scribe was unavailable, I couldn't study well.</p>
        
            <p>But advances in technology since then meant I was able to access my laptop through bluetooth connection on my power wheelchair and I could start working and studying independently.</p>
        
            <p>I control my laptop through bluetooth and grasping the joystick between the index and middle fingers of my right-hand, move the cursor back and forth like a mouse.</p>
        
            <p>But it came with a cost.</p>

            <p>I developed a repetitive strain injury in my right hand from using it eight hours a day, and it started to impact both my workflow and ability to drive.</p>
        
            <p>So last year, my occupational therapist and I concluded I needed a different approach.</p>
        
            <p>I was provided with a pair of trial technologies that were funded by the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) that provide other options for accessing the computer.</p>
        
            <p>One is a mouse that is controlled by the movement of my head and gives my arm a chance to rest and recover.</p>

            <p>The other is an artificial intelligence-powered voice recognition software which I use to dictate my speech into text.</p>
        
            <p>The new technologies work in combination with the bluetooth joystick and together, they've meant I can use the computer for hours without tiring out and still be able to drive my wheelchair.</p>
        
            <p>I'm not the only one.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Ren has cerebral palsy and has been a pioneer in using assistive technology for years, but for simple tasks like turning on the TV he relied on support workers.</p>
        
            <p>Now, he tells the artificial intelligence (AI) to do it, and the software speaks for him.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead of waiting for my support worker I can ask it, 'hey Google, turn on my TV,'" Sam said.</p>
        
            <p>He uses a combination of switch controls and AI for daily activities which has given him more independence.</p>
        
            <p>Sam has returned to writing the book he started many years ago, because it's easier to write with dictation than using switches.</p>
        
            <p>The AI is built on speech recognition software, and it's not without privacy concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The manufacturer's website explains they can use the voice data however they want, unless you specifically opt out.</p>

            <p>According to AI expert Professor Daswin De Silva from La Trobe University, voice recognition software is at risk of hacks and confidentiality leaks.</p>
        
            <p>"An AI model can be hijacked or hacked, and this means the speech-to-text can be completely manipulated to serve malicious activity," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you use voice activation or authentication, which is used by some banks and other critical services, then [a hacker] can essentially conduct identity theft."</p>
        
            <p>Professor De Silver is familiar with the AI technology I use and said the benefits probably outweigh the privacy issues for people with disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>"I see it as a golden opportunity, because if you think of disability, there is a dependence on another human for certain daily activities that you would want to perform.</p>
        
            <p>"[With AI] the person with disability becomes a bit more independent and has more control, or autonomy."</p>
        
            <p>The AI has done that for me, and I've never used anything like it before.</p>
        
            <p>Occupational therapist David Harraway said software like this means people with non-standard speech can communicate, write and control things around their homes in a way other programs can't.</p>
        
            <p>"I think for a lot of people, it enables them to enter the world of text that might have been very difficult otherwise," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] s a pretty unique solution."</p>
        
            <p>The AI isn't free, and Harraway said even though you can access a trial, the price of subscription is a barrier for some people.</p>

            <p>"There's a free demo, but once that's finished, you'd need to have money for that yearly subscription."</p>
        
            <p>The subscription is almost $1200 a year, but mine is covered by the NDIS.</p>
        
            <p>For me, the benefits of AI outweigh the concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Since using AI and head control, I can commit more time to each task without getting tired and daily activities like walking my dogs are easier because my arm isn't in pain.</p>
        
            <p>Before, I would be tired just after writing a few thousand words which would take hours.</p>

            <p>I was wondering if I could have a career in journalism and a degree in palaeontology at the same time, or if I would have to choose between my job and study.</p>
        
            <p>With three different options at my disposal, I no longer have to choose.</p>
