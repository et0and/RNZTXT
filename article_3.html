            <p>Repair teams have fixed a tripped circuit, Transpower says, after a lightning strike cut power to at least 50,000 people in the eastern and central North Island - and the power is starting to be switched back on in some places.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile a severe thunderstorm warning for Horowhenua, Carterton, Tararua, Kāpiti Coast, Masterton and South Wairarapa was also in place until 6:45pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologists said severe thunderstorms were detected at 5:45pm near Ōtaki and the Tararua Ranges, which were moving south over the ranges and toward Featherston:</p>
        
            <p>"These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain and large hail."</p>
        
            <p>A thunderstorm warning was also issued for the Ashburton, Timaru and Mackenzie areas, with storms detected at 5:37pm near Mayfield, and moving south.</p>
        
            <p>One lightning strike had tripped the power supply to Hawke's Bay, Gisborne and Wairoa, the company said: a transmission tower had been hit.</p>
        
            <p>A Transpower spokesperson said workers have been working to restore power as soon as possible, although it was not possible to provide a timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope you can get back to enjoying your Saturday plans once your power is back on," the company said on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>The power would be restored gradually through the affected areas.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower said while the power supply was fixed, restoring it to each area safely would take time.</p>
        
            <p>"We know it's never easy to be without power, and especially at such a busy time of the year leading up to Christmas," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Lightning strikes are a regular hazard for our power system in New Zealand. While our system is pretty robust, from time to time a lightning strike does take out a circuit - it's impossible to protect against this."</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday afternoon, the power cut affected much of the central North Island, including all Firstlight Network customers in Gisborne and Wairoa.</p>
        
            <p>Line provider Unison said the outage had affected at least 50,000 people in Napier and Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a major outage. We are still trying to confirm how many people have been affected," a Firstlight spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council said they have sent a generator to the Haumoana pump station, to keep it working during the power cut.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team is on the ground monitoring river and stream levels across Hawke's Bay and is ready to deploy additional generators and/or portable pumps to other pump stations if required," a council spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ listeners have been texting in about the power outage.</p>
        
            <p>"What's happening with the power? Out in Clive, Napier ... perhaps even further," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"No power as far north as Gisborne," another person reported.</p>
        
            <p>Others on social media helped with brainstorming how to heat milk for babies to make it safe, during the power outages.</p>
        
            <p>Reports of a lightning strike affecting Transpowers power supply to New Zealands east coast.   No power here in Hawke's Bay. Seems like Cyclone Gabrielle all over again ‍</p>
        
            <p>The outage website for Unison was also reportedly down.</p>
        
            <p>MetService had warned of thunderstorms in much of the North Island and parts of the South Island, on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Thunderstorm warnings issued by the weather forecaster for the Bay of Plenty, South Waikato, Matamata Piako, Waipa, Taupō, Otorohanga and Rotorua were lifted by early Saturday evening, while a thunderstorm watch remained in place for the Canterbury Plains and High Country until 9pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain watches remained for Clutha, Tasman, and areas about Motueka, for late into Saturday night.</p>

            <p>⚠ A Red Severe Thunderstorm Warning has been issued for severe thunderstorms near the Four Peaks Range. These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain and large hail ⛈For more information: https://t.co/qHyE5zzql5 pic.twitter.com/byAQy9lQgD</p>
