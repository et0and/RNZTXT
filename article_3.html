        <h2>Auckland ‘referendum’ on Khalistan attracts thousands</h2>
        <p>
Thousands descended on Auckland's Aotea Square on Sunday to vote in a non-binding "referendum" on the creation of an independent homeland for Sikhs within India.

            <p>Thousands descended on Auckland's Aotea Square on Sunday to vote in a non-binding "referendum" on the creation of an independent homeland for Sikhs within India.</p>
        
            <p>The "referendum" was organised by US-based separatist group Sikhs for Justice, which has held similar ballots in cities in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>Sikhs for Justice president Avtar Singh Pannun was among several members of the group that had been in New Zealand for more than a month to mobilise support for the ballot.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is an important day for Sikhs of New Zealand as they are coming out to vote for independence of Punjab from India and establish the Sikh nation Khalistan," said Pannun, speaking to RNZ at Aotea Square. "All this is happening right at the heart of New Zealand."</p>

            <p>Sikhs for Justice was co-founded by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, whom the Indian government has described as a terrorist.</p>
        
            <p>The group has been banned in India since 2019 for alleged terrorism links and for "propagating anti-national and separatist sentiments prejudicial to the territorial integrity and security of India", according to the Indian government.</p>
        
            <p>Sikhs for Justice denies all terrorism charges, calling itself a human rights advocacy group.</p>
        
            <p>"The Indian government wants to suppress our voice for freedom. That's why it is trying to criminalise our activists, especially our series of referendums," said Bakhshish S Sandhu, co-founder of the group.</p>
        
            <p>"We are carrying out this referendum under the guidance of the Punjab Referendum Commission, which can testify on its authenticity," he said. "I think our series of referendums are setting a precedent for similar such exercises in the world."</p>

            <p>Paul Jacob, a Punjab Referendum Commission member, said the voting process was the same as the process that Sikhs for Justice followed in earlier "referendums".</p>
        
            <p>"The referendum is non-binding ... [but] it does give people an opportunity to come out and vote, and for Sikhs to raise the issue," Jacob said. "That's always valuable no matter how it turns out."</p>
        
            <p>Gurpatwant Singh Pannun addressed the gathering virtually, declaring that the next "referendum" on Khalistan would be held in Los Angeles on 23 March 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Mahabir Singh, who moved to New Zealand from India in 2014 and is a member of newly formed local group Patshahi Daawa New Zealand to provide support to Sikhs for Justice in organising the "referendum", said people had travelled a long way to Auckland to vote in Aotea Square.</p>
        
            <p>"There are many [Sikh] organisations in New Zealand," Singh said. "But nobody supported us when we went to them for help in organising this event. So, we formed our own group."</p>
        
            <p>Harsh Dhokiya led a small group of people opposed to the "referendum" who stood near the venue displaying an Indian national flag.</p>
        
            <p>"With all our limited means, we have conveyed our displeasure to the New Zealand government for letting this happen," Dhokiya said.</p>
        
            <p>Tātaki Auckland Unlimited (TAU) told RNZ earlier this month that TAU and Auckland Council recognised people's right to peaceful assembly under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that TAU remains apolitical in its own activities, including the venues, events and major cultural festivals it delivers on behalf of Auckland Council," a TAU spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"To do that, it must make decisions which might upset some groups - given the many political and human rights causes which people in our community feel passionate about."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, hundreds reportedly gathered at the Indian High Commission in Wellington to show their support for the South Asian nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
        
            <p>"As a peace-loving and law-abiding community [in New Zealand], we firmly believe in the principles of vasudhaiva kutumbakam - that the world is one family, or, as we say here, he iwi tahi tātou (we are one people)," said a participant named Manish.</p>
        
            <p>"[Our] gathering today reflected our shared dedication to fostering inclusivity and rejecting divisive forces that threaten our collective well-being."</p>
        
            <p>Although the Indian High Commission did not respond to requests for comment on the matter, Auckland's "referendum" on Khalistan was discussed during Foreign Minister Winston Peters' meeting with his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, in Australia on 6 November.</p>
        
            <p>Experts have warned of the negative impact the "referendum" would have on New Zealand-India relations.</p>

            <p>Harinder Singh, owner of Sher-e-Punjab restaurant in Auckland's Papatoetoe, said he had proudly retained an Indian passport.</p>
        
            <p>"I love India. That's why I still haven't given up my Indian citizenship. In India, all of us want to live together, whether we are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians or of any other faith," Singh said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no animosity between us earlier. But now India has changed. If one person of a particular faith commits any mistake, the person's entire family and people of his or her faith are punished," he said. "We don't like this. That's why I am here to vote in favour of Khalistan as a matter of my faith."</p>
        
            <p>Harinder dismissed assertions the "referendum" had created friction within the Indian community in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I have lots of Hindu friends who tell me [the] referendum is a particular issue for the Sikh community, which won't affect our love and brotherhood," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Most Hindus in New Zealand are very good. We have been friends for ages and will remain so even after this event, I am sure."</p>
