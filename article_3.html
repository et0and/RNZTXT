            <p>An Air New Zealand flight has been turned around after experiencing severe turbulence while trying to land in Dunedin on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a second flight from Auckland to Queenstown had to turn back after it was struck by lightning mid-flight.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ681 between Wellington and Dunedin attempted to land twice but then turned back to the capital.</p>
        
            <p>An airport announcement in Dunedin said it was due to severe turbulence and wind shear.</p>
        
            <p>One of the passengers, Megan, told RNZ several people vomited as the flight neared Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Passenger Jenny said the crew had been reassuring and everyone had been rebooked on later flights before relanding in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has a strong wind watch in place for coastal areas of Dunedin and Clutha until 5pm on Wednesday for possible severe southwest gales in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said challenging weather across the country was affecting flights.</p>
        
            <p>He confirmed flight NZ681 was unable to land due to strong winds.</p>
        
            <p>"Our customer care and airport teams are working to re-accommodate customers in both Wellington and Dunedin on the next available services," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said it was the only flight disruption to or from Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>It said the next flights in and out of Dunedin, shortly after 1pm and 1.30pm respectively, were going ahead as scheduled.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth 7-year-old Thijs was was on the flight with his mother and said it had been a bit scary. He said if their holiday was delayed they would at least get to see friends in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, NZ613 turned back after being struck by lightning on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It was undergoing engineering checks, and passengers were transferred to another plane.</p>
        
            <p>"Lightning strikes are not uncommon, and our pilots do train for this scenario," Morgan said.</p>
