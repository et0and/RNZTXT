            <p>A multi-tonne truck that rolled off a narrow, winding road and down a bank in Wellington's Aro Valley has been successfully rescued.</p>
        
            <p>The multi-tonne truck crashed down a bank on Thursday morning and landed only metres from occupied homes.</p>
        
            <p>Two huge cranes were brought in to salvage the wreck on Friday.</p>

            <p>Mortimer Terrace was closed overnight, with cordons in place, and ten residents were evacuated because of the risk the truck might fall on them.</p>
        
            <p>Linesmen had to cut down power lines above the scene of the truck crash for the cranes to fit on the narrow, winding road.</p>
        
            <p>A truck towed parked cars from surrounding streets to make room for the cranes.</p>

            <p>The driver was not inside when the truck rolled and no-one was injured.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it did not know the precise reason for the crash and said the investigation would be a matter for the police.</p>
        
            <p>The truck belonged to a subcontractor for Fulton Hogan and was used for vacuuming stormwater drains.</p>
        
            <p>Work to retrieve the truck began at 7am on Friday.</p>
