            <p>On a property next to the police cordon, resident Fia told RNZ he was sad to hear what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a quiet street, and sadly this happened... our neighbour, it's a bit scary."</p>
        
            <p>Fia said he didn't know his neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't talk, but their kids always play with our kids."</p>
        
            <p>Further up the road, Jeremy Armstrong said the area was usually safe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's normally a pretty quiet neighbourhood - it's very shocking."</p>
        
            <p>The arrested man was expected appear in Waitākere District Court on Monday and police were not seeking anyone else.</p>
