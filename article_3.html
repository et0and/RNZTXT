        <h2>Are you scared of being without your phone? You have nomophobia.</h2>
        <p>
Research by Deloitte found that about 20 percent of us check our phones more than 50 times per day. And this 'addiction' is affecting our brains.

            <p>Have you ever found yourself without your mobile phone and been struck with a sense of panic?</p>
        
            <p>If so, you're not alone - and that feeling has a name.</p>
        
            <p>No (no) mo (mobile) phobia (fear) is the anxiety or discomfort of not being connected to the digital world.</p>
        
            <p>It's a very modern phenomenon, given the rise of smartphones in the last two decades and their ever increasing integration into daily life.</p>
        
            <p>Phones have become not just a means of calling and texting, but also a payment method, a way of accessing government services and a source for entertainment - to name a few.</p>
        
            <p>Research by Deloitte found that about 20 percent of us check our phones more than 50 times per day.</p>
        
            <p>That's the equivalent of checking your phone "once about every 20 minutes of every waking hour".</p>
        
            <p>Sudden withdrawal is typically characterised by an elevated level of stress, according to Eric Lim from the University of New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Lim studied the impact of nomophobia after experiencing it himself. He's a big fan of cryptocurrencies and gets most of his news about them through X (the website formerly known as Twitter).</p>
        
            <p>"I feel that if I'm not keeping track of what's happening in the cryptocurrency world, I'm missing out," Lim said.</p>
        
            <p>"It just means that every time I put down the phone, a few seconds later I'll be picking up my phone and checking Twitter again and again."</p>
        
            <p>Lim and his colleagues looked at nomophobia through a survey of over 5,000 students at a university in China.</p>
        
            <p>The study found nomophobia and sleep deprivation were positively correlated and both negatively affected people's physical and mental health.</p>
        
            <p>Interestingly, responders who used one app deeply, rather than many apps lightly, were more likely to have poor sleep.</p>
        
            <p>"The user is more deeply captured by a specific activity within the phone that actually causes the individual to sacrifice sleep for that," Lim said.</p>
        
            <p>There is a debate about whether smartphones should be classified as addictive.</p>
        
            <p>But Lim said our phones have a reward system much like other addictions, such as drugs and alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"The smartphone is designed in such a way as to hijack your brain," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time you see a notification or you see something that is happening in the phone, a reward is forthcoming.</p>
        
            <p>In the sense that phone use is like an addiction, nomophobia is like withdrawal, Lim said.</p>
        
            <p>Phone addiction and nomophobia can also impact your attention span and quality of sleep.</p>
        
            <p>Sleep deprivation comes from delaying when you go to sleep because of phone usage, according to sleep researcher Grace Vincent from CQUniversity's Appleton Institute in Adelaide.</p>
        
            <p>"Light basically tricks your brain into thinking the sun is still shining," Vincent said.</p>
        
            <p>"So when you've got a device that's shining in your face, it can keep you awake.</p>
        
            <p>"That can cause you to delay your bedtime, especially if you're scrolling on your device at night."</p>
        
            <p>Vincent recommends not using your phone an hour before bedtime, opting for a book instead.</p>
        
            <p>She also recommends using an alarm to mark when you need to start heading to sleep and not keeping the phone by the bed.</p>
        
            <p>Lim found he had to replace his Twitter habit with books. He also made his phone screen monochrome (black and white) and as a rule doesn't look at his phone for the first two hours of any day.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that works way better, I can stimulate my mind with books," Lim said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's more healthy."</p>
