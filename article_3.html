            <p>When Eugene Dementyev heard a tap at his back door, he thought it was a cat - and was shocked to discover it was a kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>Dementyev lives in the Wellington suburb of Broadmeadows and was watching a movie with his wife when they heard a sound at the door.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought it was a cat, and it did look like a cat a little bit. But then we looked closer and it was a kiwi," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw it with the lights off, so we turned on the lights to have a better look and we saw it was a kiwi. It was quite large actually, I didn't expect it to be that large."</p>
        
            <p>Dementyev said the kiwi was looking right at him, before it turned away.</p>
        
            <p>The bird was in his back yard for a number of days, and found a place under the stairs where it slept during the day before emerging at night.</p>
        
            <p>The kiwi had been released at Terawhiti Station on the southwest coast, as part of the Capital Kiwi project which aims to restore a large-scale wild kiwi population to Wellington's hillsides. The release site is about 10km from the surburb of Broadmeadows.</p>
        
            <p>It's not the only kiwi to make a surprise visit in recent days. One of the flightless birds wandered into a sawmill near Whangārei on Monday morning and spent a few hours exploring before seeking out a dark spot under a workbench.</p>

            <p>Lucas James, a sparkie at Rosvall Sawmill in Whareora, said he was still bleary-eyed first thing in the morning, and was using the drill press in the workshop when he heard a scuttling sound behind him.</p>
        
            <p>"I turned around and there was a big kiwi running around the middle of the workshop. So I called all the guys, we had a look, and sort of panicked. We didn't know what to do."</p>
        
            <p>They closed the workshop doors to stop it into wandering into any machinery and called a few experts for advice, including the local Department of Conservation (DOC) office</p>
        
            <p>"They took a couple of hours to come out so the first three hours of my Monday morning I was on kiwi watch, making sure it didn't get out and get squashed by anything."</p>

            <p>The bird appeared unperturbed by its unusual surroundings, James said.</p>
        
            <p>"For a start, it was quite curious, it just cruised around for a bit. But as more people came in, it got a bit stressed, so we left it alone, it ran around for a bit and found a dark corner in the workshop and sat there for a couple of hours."</p>
        
            <p>He was surprised the kiwi sought out a sawmill, and could only guess it had been chased by a dog and was looking for a place to hide.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a noisy place and there's big forklifts going around everywhere. It's the last place I'd expect to see a kiwi running around. It was a really cool experience," James said.</p>
