        <h2>Man trapped for over 20 hours in Tasmania has leg amputated</h2>
        <p>

            <p>A 65-year-old Lithuanian man who had his left leg amputated at the knee during a rescue operation near Tasmania's remote south-west remains in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>The man, whose identity has not been disclosed, was part of an international group of 11 people embarking on a multi-day pack-rafting trip along Tasmania's remote Franklin River.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they believed the man's leg became trapped in a rock crevice on Friday afternoon while he was "scouting" the area on foot along the Franklin River's banks.</p>
        
            <p>He used a GPS-enabled device to call for help but remained trapped and partially submerged in water from the waist down for about 20 hours.</p>
        
            <p>Following several unsuccessful attempts to free the man, the decision was made by medical emergency crews to amputate his leg at the knee.</p>
        
            <p>The man was airlifted from the site, south of Frenchmans Cap, to the Royal Hobart Hospital on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed the man's family had been contacted and the remaining 10 people in the group have also been airlifted from the river.</p>
        
            <p>'Specialist equipment' used in rescue mission</p>
        
            <p>Police said the "complex" rescue mission involved an estimated 30 people across several different agencies.</p>
        
            <p>These included Tasmania Police, State Emergency Service, Tasmanian Fire Service, Ambulance Tasmania and Surf Life Saving Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>A fixed-wing aircraft from the Australian Marine Safety Authority was also deployed to provide communication coverage, due to limited reception in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple attempts were made on Friday and Saturday to free the man using "specialist equipment", including a wilderness rescue tripod - called an "Arizona Vortex" - to attempt to manoeuvre the man from the rocks; swift water harness equipment; and Tasmania Fire Service equipment, including hydraulic cutters.</p>
        
            <p>Ambulance Tasmanian intensive care workers, flight paramedics and specialist retrieval doctors were winched to the site to treat the man.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Assistant Commissioner Doug Oosterloo said the international group was "well-equipped and well-prepared" for a rafting trip, and the man was wearing a wet suit.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the significant amount of time in the water led to an increased risk of hypothermia.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man was kept warm and as comfortable as possible with extra clothes, hot food and drinks.</p>
        
            <p>"The beauty of Tasmania's wilderness is what attracts people to this state, but that wilderness is also some of the most challenging and rugged terrain in the world," Acting Assistant Commissioner Oosterloo said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if you are well prepared, even if you do take all necessary precautions, things can go wrong."</p>
