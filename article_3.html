            <p>A 50-year-old man has appeared in court following a serious assault on a police officer at an isolated Northland property.</p>
        
            <p>Taniora Peri was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and with resisting police when he made a brief appearance in the Kaikohe District Court on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded in custody until 22 October. No application for bail or name suppression was made.</p>
        
            <p>Judge John McDonald declined duty solicitor Steve Nicholson's request that his next appearance be in person, saying the security risk was too great.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, Peri will appear via audio-visual link from a remand facility.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to enter a plea at that time.</p>
        
            <p>Peri, an imposing man wearing a green jumper and with dreadlocks almost to his waist, stood impassively in the dock during his short appearance.</p>
        
            <p>He looked around the courtroom but did not appear to acknowledge anyone in the gallery.</p>
        
            <p>The drama began around 6.20pm on Monday when police say they were called to a property on State Highway 12 in Waimā, South Hokianga.</p>

            <p>Northland's top police officer, Superintendent Matt Srhoj, said the initial report involved a disorder incident between two people known to each other.</p>
        
            <p>One man at the address approached police with two weapons in his hands.</p>
        
            <p>Srhoj said officers fired a Taser at the man but he continued to advance towards them.</p>
        
            <p>One of the officers tripped and fell while retreating, and was then struck with a weapon.</p>
        
            <p>Srhoj said the weapons were not firearms but did not say what they were.</p>
        
            <p>Police were supporting the injured officer, who was assaulted unnecessarily while just doing his job, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The officer suffered moderate to serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A St John spokesman said two ambulances responded, and one person was transported to Bay of Islands Hospital in Kawakawa.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has requested a patient condition update from Health NZ.</p>
