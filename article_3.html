        <h2>'You learn to take a deep breath': Coming together in times of drought</h2>
        <p>
The rural sector in north Canterbury's Hurunui district describe how drought conditions and demanding economic settings have left them battling. Audio

            <p>In the second article of a two-part series, RNZ reporter Adam Burns and visual journalist Nate McKinnon meet with farmers and community leaders in north Canterbury about the ongoing drought, tough economic conditions and how the locals have been supporting each other during the period.</p>
        
            <p>Taking a deep breath.</p>
        
            <p>For one farmer, experience has taught him that a simple thing like this can be helpful in a time of crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Weka Pass sheep, cattle and deer farmer Richard Murchison has described the drought in the region, coupled with arduous economic conditions, as "one of the worst autumns he had seen" in his 40 years on farm.</p>
        
            <p>"Farm costs have gone through the roof and you've ended up with a drought," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's been very stressful."</p>
        
            <p>The rural sector in north Canterbury's Hurunui district have described how drought conditions and demanding economic settings have left them battling.</p>
        
            <p>The situation facing the local rural sector worsened when the all important rainfall failed to arrive during autumn, and then again in winter.</p>
        
            <p>It also comes amid high interest rates and soaring on-farm costs.</p>
        
            <p>And while the rural community in the Hurunui district have welcomed funding relief from the government, the locals have ramped up efforts in getting around each other.</p>
        
            <p>Sara Black and her husband run a 2400 hectare sheep and beef farm at Marble Point Station, between Culverden and Hamner Springs.</p>
        
            <p>They are fortunate enough that proximity to the Lewis Pass enables some rainy spill over from the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A recent bout of recent downpours have eased the situation, but they need much more in the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a pretty big deficit to fill," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though this takes a little bit of pressure off and puts a little bit of moisture back in the ground for spring, it's going to be the follow up rain or what happens in the next couple of months that will dictate how the season will go."</p>

            <p>Black understands the all-encompassing crisis facing farmers, holding multiple leadership positions in the local rural sector as chair of Federated Farmers North Canterbury Beef and Wool and chief executive of Amuri Irrigation Company.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though this area is used to the dry, we expect it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we don't expect it to go on and on.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like starting a 400-metre race and then finding yourself in the middle of an ultra-marathon."</p>
        
            <p>Richard Murchison runs a sheep, cattle and deer farm further south at Weka Pass.</p>
        
            <p>He described this year as "pretty tough" with both his deer and cattle production significantly down on previous years.</p>
        
            <p>Murchison also lost an employee because of injury, meaning he had to pick up the slack.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been in the game long enough that you learn to take a deep breath.</p>
        
            <p>"I think to myself 'we will get through this'.</p>
        
            <p>"But if you're starting out, this would've been psychologically really bad."</p>
        
            <p>Observing the wider community, Black said living in a state of uncertainty did take a toll.</p>
        
            <p>"We just have to wait and see what we get," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The mood of the district changes before and after rain ... there's definitely an easing of tension.</p>
        
            <p>"You know you've had rain there's a little bit of moisture you can bank for later in the season but when the next lot's coming you just don't know."</p>

            <p>Scargill beef and sheep farmer Andy Fox said getting off-farm entirely had its benefits during difficult periods.</p>
        
            <p>Fox said there was a drive for the local community to "look over the fence".</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes when you're really down in the bottom of the psychological hole, you don't actually get off-farm because you feel you can't.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we use networking and social events.</p>
        
            <p>"If someone is struggling, we pick up the phone and give them a call."</p>
        
            <p>In the end, there is some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>Although not "completely out of the woods", Murchison said grazing some of his ewes off-farm, with his remaining stock confined to three paddocks.</p>
        
            <p>"I fed them silage, and baleage, and grain and just kept them going from there and allowed the pastures to come away.</p>
        
            <p>"So now we're reasonably good."</p>
        
            <p>Murchison said the local community often looked out for each other.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was nothing wrong with making mistakes, but being "decisive early" was crucial.</p>
        
            <p>To help lift the spirits of under pressure farmers, a Farm Break event will be held in Scargill on Friday, featuring comedian Ben Hurley.</p>
        
            <p>The night will be hosted by former All Black front-rower Richard Loe.</p>
