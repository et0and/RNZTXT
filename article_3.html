            <p>Czech Barbora Krejcikova has called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at "unprofessional" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel.</p>
        
            <p>Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media. Wertheim has since been taken off the air indefinitely, the Tennis Channel told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>"As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary," world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.</p>
        
            <p>"This isn't the first time something like this is happening in [the] sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.</p>
        
            <p>"These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level."</p>
        
            <p>Wertheim apologised for the comments in a post on X, saying: "During a Tennis Channel studio show on Friday, I made some deeply regrettable comments off-air.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge them. I apologise for them. I reached out immediately and apologised to the player... I realise: I am not the victim here. It was neither professional nor charitable nor reflective of the person I strive to be.</p>
        
            <p>"I am accountable. I own this. I am sorry."</p>
        
            <p>The Tennis Channel told Reuters that Wertheim had been taken off the air indefinitely because of the inappropriate comment.</p>
        
            <p>"Tennis Channel holds its employees to a standard of respectfulness for others at all times, a standard that was not met in this moment," the network said in a statement adding they have also apologised to the Krejcikova.</p>
