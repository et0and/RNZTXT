            <p>Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson will address media following the announcement of his decision to retire at the end of the 2024 NRL season.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson, who will turn 34 next month, informed his teammates of his decision on Monday before confirming it publicly on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a decision that I've sat with for a while now and one I'm probably still coming to terms with," Johnson said when speaking with his teammates.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously still very raw but I'm so grateful to the club and to you boys who I get to come into work with every day with a smile on face. I have never taken any of it for granted.</p>
        
            <p>"The job (this season) is not over so, let's rip in and get back to doing what we do but I just wanted to let you all know first that at the end of the season, that will be me (done)."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson will address media with Warriors chief executive Cameron George and head coach Andrew Webster at 1:15pm.</p>
        
            <p>You can watch a livestream of the press conference at the top of this page. </p>
