        <h2>22 tonnes of cheddar missing after London's 'great cheese heist'</h2>
        <p>
"It seems like a really weird thing to nick," Jamie Oliver says, as truckloads of cheese seemingly vanish into thin air.

            <p>When a French supermarket placed an order at Neal's Yard Dairy in London, it seemed too good to be true.</p>
        
            <p>The London-based artisan cheese seller was ecstatic - the order for 22 tonnes of cheddar was one of the largest they had ever received.</p>
        
            <p>The sheer size of the order forced them to enlist three different cheese producers to meet the demand.</p>
        
            <p>But their initial reaction - that the whole thing was just too good to be true - turned out to be correct.</p>
        
            <p>There was no deal with a French supermarket chain.</p>
        
            <p>The 300,000 British pounds (NZ$650,367) owed was never going to be paid.</p>
        
            <p>And the 22 tonnes of clothbound cheeses have seemingly vanished into thin air.</p>
        
            <p>The fraudulent buyer, according to the team behind Neal's Yard Dairy, first approached them in July.</p>
        
            <p>They were told they were dealing with a "legitimate wholesale distributor" for the French retailer.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Holden's dairy farm in Wales was one of the three tasked with filling the order, which consisted of more than 950 cheese wheels.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd been going around, proudly, saying, 'Guess what, a French supermarket is buying our cheese'," Holden told the New York Times.</p>
        
            <p>"We never thought that would happen. Well, turns out, it hasn't."</p>
        
            <p>
Earlier this month, Neal's Yard Dairy took the theft public as a warning to anyone looking to buy cheese.

            <p>All the cheeses purchased, including "Hafod, Westcombe and Pitchfork" cheddars, were highly valued and in some cases award-winning.</p>
        
            <p>In Holden's case, he told The Independent, the recipe was 100 years old.</p>
        
            <p>"Our cheese is limited in quantity, but we had it in storage and we worked out [what we gave for the order] was the most we could spare," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The cheese was delivered by Neal's Yard Dairy to a warehouse in south-east London, where it was set to be collected by the distributor.</p>
        
            <p>Payment was due in the first week of October.</p>
        
            <p>When the money did not arrive, Neal's Yard Dairy tried to follow up with the distributor.</p>
        
            <p>But by that time, they said, all lines of communication had gone dead.</p>
        
            <p>Westcombe Dairy's Tom Calver told the BBC the process of making the cheeses "started almost three years ago".</p>
        
            <p>"The amount of work that's gone into nurturing the cows, emphasising the best farming practice, and transforming the milk one batch at a time to produce the best possible cheese is beyond estimation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>'For that to be stolen... it's absolutely terrible."</p>
        
            <p>After weeks of trying to track down the buyer for payment, Neal's Yard Dairy called the police.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Neal's Yard Dairy took the theft public as a warning to anyone looking to buy cheese.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently working with law enforcement authorities to identify the perpetrators of this fraud," they wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"In the meantime, we would like to put out a call to everyone within our esteemed community of cheesemongers around the world.</p>
        
            <p>'If anyone is offered or receives cheeses they believe may have been associated with this theft, particularly clothbound cheddars in a 10kg or 24kg format with the tags detached, please contact [us] so we can support the... investigation."</p>
        
            <p>They added that "despite the significant financial blow", they had still paid all three cheesemakers "in full".</p>
        
            <p>The announcement made international headlines and stunned members of the food world.</p>
        
            <p>Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver took to Instagram, urging his followers to also be on the lookout.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been a great cheese robbery," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the best cheddar cheese in the world has been stolen.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it's probably some wrong'uns."</p>
        
            <p>London's Metropolitan Police confirmed they were investigating the theft.</p>
        
            <p>A 63-year-old man has since been arrested "on suspicion of fraud by false representation and handling stolen goods", according to a Scotland Yard spokesman.</p>
        
            <p>The man was questioned at a police station in South London before being released on bail.</p>
        
            <p>No further details have been released about the man - or about where the 950 cheese wheels could have gone.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the suppliers involved have suggested trying to sell the cheeses in the UK, Europe or Australia would prove difficult for thieves.</p>
        
            <p>British food writer Patrick McGuigan told the New York Times: "It's a bit like... if you steal a Van Gogh painting, it's quite hard to sell it because everybody knows it's a Van Gogh painting."</p>
        
            <p>The cheeses may have been already shipped abroad to be sold to buyers in Russia or the Middle East, Mr Holden told media, "because people won't ask questions there".</p>
        
            <p>"I think if they tried to sell it closer to home, they'd find it difficult because the international artisan community is very connected," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If they tried to sell it in North America, where we sell a lot of Hafod, or even Australia, believe it or not, the balloon would go up because people would ask questions."</p>
        
            <p>Jamie Oliver, in his online appeal, also questioned what might happen to the stolen goods.</p>
        
            <p>"Are they going to un-peel it from the cloth, and cut it and grate it and get rid of it in the fast food industry, in the commercial industry?" he asked followers.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know. It seems like a really weird thing to nick."</p>
        
            <p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>
