            <p>New Caledonia Congress President Roch Wamytan has doubled down on indigenous Kanaks' aspirations to seek self-determination and lambasted France for "demeaning" the high-level Pacific leaders' mission to the French territory.</p>
        
            <p>New Caledonia government's pro-independence leader Louis Mapou this week put a pause on a Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) Ministerial Committee from travelling to the conflict-ridden territory after differences with Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The PIF confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that the deferment of a proposed visit by the prime ministers of the Cook Islands, Fiji and Tonga - Forum troika - was because of "a number of issues regarding due process and protocol" identified by the New Caledonia government.</p>
        
            <p>In an exclusive interview with RNZ Pacific on Wednesday, Wamytan acknowledged that the leaders visit was "very important" but blamed the French government for highjacking the process to serve its own purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"Their arrival was very important because they were supposed to lead a high-level investigation in order to find a sustainable conflict resolution for the crisis in Kanaky/New Caledonia," the Saint Louis great chief said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, this mission was postponed by the Pacific Island Forum because there's no consensus on the organisation and running of this office event."</p>

            <p>A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said they were pushing on with plans and have set up a committee for the visit despite Mapou retracting his blessing.</p>
        
            <p>France's top diplomat in the region, Veronique Roger-Lacan, also told RNZ Pacific Paris decides who enters the territory, even though New Caledonia shares foreign policy responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>"Paris is always open for dialogue," she said.</p>
        
            <p>But Wamytan called her comments "inappropriate", saying it was the New Caledonia government that originally "took the initiative to invite the PIF mission".</p>
        
            <p>"[Roger-Lacan's] comments were not appreciated because it amounts to telling local political leaders that it is France which is in charge," he said, adding "I find it unhealthy for a senior civil servant to welcome the troika without the President of the government. It will be demeaning to the function of our guest".</p>
        
            <p>"I invite the ambassador to be careful about the language that she uses, especially in the current context. It's a classic colonial stance."</p>
        
            <p>He said in theory, the law provided for these competences to be shared, but in practice, the interests PIF members take precedence over the interests of New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>He repeated that the French government intends to control the subject and the object of this mission.</p>
        
            <p>"[Paris wants] to instrumentalise their constituents into condemning the insurrection to discredit the demand for independence."</p>

            <p>Wamytan said once tensions ease and dialogue resumes between the parties, that is when leaders can "consider what comes next".</p>
        
            <p>Violent conflict began on 13 May after the French Parliament passed controversial amendments to its constitution that would unfreeze the electoral roll for local government election in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>It has resulted in more than a dozen deaths, and over 2000 arrests, including hundreds of arbitrary arrests and detentions.</p>
        
            <p>Wamytan said "every crisis has lessons" and people need to listen to the voices on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"The Kanak people will never give up their independence," Wamytan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Inequalities are more and more glaring despite all the agreements made and the public policies that have been decided based on this, we must rebuild, but certainly with a new vision of things, a lasting peace must be guaranteed.</p>
        
            <p>"And for this, we must understand once and for all, that New Caledonia is not France. We are in a process of decolonisation that the French state must bring to its conclusion."</p>

            <p>He said there was no other alternative.</p>
        
            <p>"The French State must resume an impartial stance in the management of the decolonisation process in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>"The French State must absolutely...lead our country to its full emancipation and sovereignty," Wamytan maintained.</p>
        
            <p>He claims that Paris has "stalled" the process because the Macron government is partial when it comes to the decolonisation process.</p>
        
            <p>"They make the democratic process unfair for indigenous people of Kanaky/New Caledonia, they maintained the third referendum while we were undisposed because of the loss of life and mourning," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Roger-Lacan has said previously that France's actions during the third and final independence referendum, under the Accord, were fair, although it was carried out during Covid-19 times when traditional mourning ceremonies were underway.</p>

            <p>The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Right released a statement on Wednesday, expressing alarm at the situation of the indigenous Kanaks.</p>
        
            <p>"We are particularly concerned by allegations concerning the existence of heavily armed militias of settlers opposed to independence," the experts said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that no measures have been taken by authorities to disband and prosecute these militias raises serious rule of law concerns."</p>
        
            <p>The UN experts have urged the French government to guarantee the rule of law and continue working with the Special Committee on Decolonisation and Kanak Customary authorities to respect the principle of the irreversibility of the Nouméa Accord.</p>
        
            <p>They said that the 1998 Nouméa Accord between the French government and the pro-independence movement led by the Indigenous Kanak People and the anti-independence parties of New Caledonia outlines a process for the gradual and irreversible transfer of power from France to New Caledonia, leading to a series of referendums on self-determination.</p>
        
            <p>"Agreements made under the Accord must be constitutionally guaranteed until New Caledonia achieves full sovereignty in accordance with France's commitment," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"The attempt to dismantle the Nouméa Accord severely undermines their human rights and the integrity of the overall decolonisation process."</p>
        
            <p>"The French government has failed to respect the basic rights to participation, consultation and free, prior, informed consent of the Kanak Indigenous Peoples and its institutions, including the Customary Senate," the experts have warned.</p>
