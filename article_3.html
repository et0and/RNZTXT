            <p>A man charged with vandalising a Rainbow crossing on Auckland's Karangahape Road has pleaded guilty and has been ordered to pay $16,093 in reparations.</p>
        
            <p>The pedestrian crossing was covered in white paint more than two weeks ago, just days after the rainbow crossing in Gisborne was vandalised.</p>
        
            <p>Ford O'Connor, 31, appeared at the Auckland District Court Monday morning and entered a guilty plea.</p>
        
            <p>Destiny church leader Brian Tamaki addressed the media outside earlier, saying O'Connor was married to his granddaughter and was a member of the church.</p>
        
            <p>Community magistrate Jan Holmes said she gave credit to the accused for the early plea and his willingness to pay the $16,093 for cleaning the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>No further penalties were imposed and O'Connor was discharged with conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the man's arrest, police had said they were treating the vandalism as a hate crime.</p>
        
            <p>Hate crimes, while recorded by police, are not stand alone offences but are seen as a motivating factor.</p>
        
            <p>Police's working definition of a 'hate crime' is as any offence that is perceived, by the victim or by any other person, to be motivate by hostility or prejudice based on a person's characteristic.</p>
        
            <p>This can be race, religion, sexual orientation, gender/transgender identity, disability, or age.</p>
        
            <p>Last week Auckland Pride called for a restorative justice approach to the offending, focusing on repairing relationships between victims, offenders, and the community while at the same time keeping considerations of justice in mind.</p>
        
            <p>Co-chair Quack Pirihi said solutions were needed that protected communities and built an equitable Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Pride co-chair Bhenjamin Goodsir said on Monday, after the sentencing, that reparations paid for paint, but didn't make rainbow communities safer.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to address the underlying homophobia and transphobia.</p>
        
            <p>All the court process had done was give Tamaki a platform to "spread hate and misinformation further", Goodsir said.</p>
        
            <p>Politicians from National, ACT and the Green Party have criticised the vandalism.</p>
        
            <p>"I was not initially aware the protest had occurred until I saw it on the AM show the following morning, but I suspected it could be one of the Destiny Church members," Brian Tamaki said.</p>
        
            <p>"Turns out, it was one of my family members."</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki said the painting over of the crossing was not a hate crime.</p>
        
            <p>He said he supported O'Connor's act of protest against what he called "rainbow washing" at the taxpayer's expense.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki said the rainbow crossings were confusing to pedestrians and drivers, and are "not right and not normal".</p>
        
            <p>Destiny Church will continue protesting in "multiple places" until the government take notice and "put an end to this madness", he said.</p>
