            <p>Auckland's Laneway Festival has had to cancel entry to under-18s at its 2025 event, despite already selling tickets to people aged 16 and 17.</p>
        
            <p>An application to admit younger patrons was rejected by the Auckland District Licensing Committee, organisers said in a written statement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the safe and successful inclusion of 16+ patrons at Laneway Festival 2024, the Auckland District Licensing Committee has rejected our application to allow 16 & 17 year olds at our 2025 event," they wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers said they worked closely with police, alcohol licensing inspectors, and the medical officer of health in "good faith" throughout the application process, and "did not anticipate this disappointing outcome".</p>
        
            <p>"We were looking forward to providing younger audiences with the opportunity to access great live music and are truly sorry this won't be possible at the 2025 event."</p>
        
            <p>Some young fans have expressed their disappointment online.</p>
        
            <p>"How can you be allowed to do this after tickets have come out? Shouldn't it be approved before heaps of people pay for tickets, hotels and flights?" one wrote on X.</p>
        
            <p>Others suggested the inclusion of more sideshows, as many of the hottest billed artists (like Charli XCX) are Laneway-exlusive performances.</p>
        
            <p>As the news comes just before the holiday period, under-18 ticket holders will have to wait for refunds to be issued by Ticketek between January 6 and January 18, 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Hi. We bought 6 tickets (3 adult and 3 U18). We’d like all of them refunded as the purpose of the purchase was to go with our children. How do we action this?</p>
        
            <p>there is ZERO reason you should have sold under 18 tickets without the proper permissions and licenses this is total bullshit</p>
        
            <p>insane that laneway festival were selling tickets to 16+ year olds when they didn’t have the license confirmed!! Like you’re gonna sell kids tickets for $200 when it wasn’t guaranteed that you could provide them a safe festival experience!!!!</p>
