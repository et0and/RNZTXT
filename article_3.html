            <p>Science, Innovation and Technology Minister, Judith Collins has announced a merger of weather forecasters, with NIWA taking over the MetService.</p>
        
            <p>However, MetService will remain New Zealand's authorised meteorologist, responsible for providing warnings and advice on severe weather.</p>
        
            <p>The decisions have been announced on an in-principle basis, with no firm date yet.</p>
        
            <p>Presuming all goes smoothly, it will mark an end to the long-running feud between the two organisations.</p>
        
            <p>The former Meterological Service was split in 1992, with Metservice taking over day-to-day forecasting and NIWA - the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research - taking over climate research and longer-term forecasts.</p>
        
            <p>The merger announced today was recommended in the Weather Forecasting System Review, which the government commissioned from the Sapere research group last year after the severe weather events.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said more work was needed, but the new approach would improve safety and support a future-focused forecasting system.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a strong weather forecasting system which combines weather forecasting science with land and hydrological system sciences through to daily public weather updates will help us meet the current and future demands of New Zealanders," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Bringing together the science around climate, weather forecasting, hydrology, and coastal hazards will improve our understanding and allow us to better prepare for, and respond to, severe weather events.</p>
        
            <p>"Extreme weather events in 2023 resulted in a tragic loss of life. These events cost nearly $12 billion in economic terms and $5 billion in insured loss."</p>
        
            <p>Treasury officials will work with the two forecasters and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA said it was pleased by the announcement and it anticipates legislation will be introduced in mid-2025 and timing will depend on the progress of the legislation through Parliament and the process that follows.</p>
        
            <p>"It will not happen overnight," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know our weather forecasting system is critically important, not only to give us warning of severe weather so that we can prepare, but for daily operations of the aviation, marine and energy industries and many businesses across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be critical to ensure adequate capability is in place to maintain continuity of weather forecasting services, particularly during this transition and this will be top of mind as we work through the process."</p>
        
            <p>MetService welcomed the next steps signalled by the government and believes the merger will provide the best weather forecasting service for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"As we look to the future, an efficient, effective and fit for purpose weather forecasting system is of increasing importance given climate change impacts. Integrating processes and systems that connect long-term climate science and research through to short term forecasting communications enables effective decisions and actions.</p>
        
            <p>We see this as an opportunity to have a more connected weather forecasting system that allows a better integration between climate science, forecasting, hydrology, and coastal hazards."</p>
