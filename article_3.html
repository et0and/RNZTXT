        <h2>David v Goliath: Drua-laced Flying Fijians to face All Blacks</h2>
        <p>

            <p>It is another proverbial David vs Goliath game for the 10th ranked side in world rugby.</p>
        
            <p>The Flying Fijians will have an uphill battle on almost all scorecards when they face the All Blacks in San Diego on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Test match experience between the two sides is one that stands out so clearly.</p>
        
            <p>It will also be the telling factor in the match, despite some Fiji rugby fanatics believing that the Fijians will be able to cause an upset, with the All Blacks rebuilding under new coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>While that is wishful thinking, the realities are staring every Fijian rugby supporter in the face.</p>
        
            <p>On Test experience alone, the All Blacks just have too much of that, with their match-day 23 boasting a total of 616 Test matches between them.</p>
        
            <p>Fullback Beauden Barrett leads the table with 125 games to his name, followed by vice-captain and number eight Ardie Savea (83), Anton Lienert-Brown (72), captain Scott Barrett (71) and brother Jordie Barrett (59).</p>
        
            <p>The Flying Fijians, on the other hand, have an average of five Test matches between them, with Semi Radradra, captain Waisea Nacagilevu, Viliame Mata, Mesake Doge, Frank Lomani and Albert Tuisue as players who have between 10 to 15 Tests under their names.</p>
        
            <p>While the Flying Fijians lost 45-32 to the Barbarians and won against Georgia 21-12 in their last two games, the All Blacks survived two torrid battles against fifth-ranked England at home.</p>

            <p>On Saturday, it will be the 12th time the two teams will meet, with thousands of Fijian fans from across mainland America booked to watch the game at the Snapdragon Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>It will also be the first on neutral soil since the teams first met in Suva in 1974, where the visitors won by a solitary point, 14-13.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji will be laced with 12 Drua players in its match-day 23 and young fly-half and former NZ schoolboy rugby star, Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 20, has been given the nod to pull the strings for the Fijians.</p>
        
            <p>Armstrong-Ravula, who scored 106 points and had a standout first year in the Drua colours, starts ahead of Caleb Muntz.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Mick Byrne said the team was set to tackle the All Blacks' "dynamic and physical style of play".</p>
        
            <p>He has emphasised building team cohesion as they prepare for their biggest Test in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>He told FBC Sports after the team training at the Jewish Academy's Camp Carmel Creek grounds on Wednesday that he was confident.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had a great opportunity to bond as a team here in San Diego, and the players have adapted well to the conditions," he was quoted saying.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the challenge ahead against the All Blacks, but we are focused on our strengths and what we can bring to the game."</p>

            <p>Byrne said they have fine-tuned areas they had identified in their preparation.</p>
        
            <p>"Physicality will be a key aspect of our game plan. We have worked hard to sharpen our set pieces and improve our defensive structure."</p>
        
            <p>Armstrong-Ravula is sure to have a real test going head-to-head against All Black playmaker Damian McKenzie.</p>
        
            <p>But an interesting battle can be expected between the loose trios of both teams, with the Fijians naming young Kitione Salawa along with Lekima Tagitagivalu and veteran Viliame Mata to face Savea, Luke Jacobson and Ethan Blackadder.</p>
        
            <p>The backline battles also are something to look forward to, with the Fijians having the veteran Radradra out on the wing with Jiuta Wainiqolo pairing him, leaving France-based Inia Tabuavou teaming up with Nayacalevu in midfield.</p>
        
            <p>Fullback Beauden Barrett will be a player to watch for the ABs, following his entrance in last week's Eden Park Test against England lifting the team's performance.</p>

            <p>The former Crusaders winning mentor has named half a dozen uncapped players, including Billy Proctor, who makes his All Blacks Test debut at centre.</p>
        
            <p>Proctor follows his older brother Matt into the All Blacks, and is one of six uncapped players named in the match-day 23, with hooker George Bell, prop Pasilio Tosi, lock Sam Darry, loose forward Wallace Sititi and halfback Noah Hotham all named in the reserves.</p>
        
            <p>"They have earned their opportunity; they have prepared well, and they are ready for Test match rugby," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a lot of respect for Fiji who will be fast and physical, and we are looking forward to the contest.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a superb week in in San Diego. Our leaders have fed off the younger players' energy and our focus is now on performing."</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks will feature eight players with Pasifika heritage in their match-day squad in Savea, Asafo Aumua, Tupou Vaa'i, Caleb Clarke and Sevu Reece in the starting fifteen while on the bench are Pasilio Tosi, Wallace Sititi and Emoni Narawa.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson has made 11 changes in total to the team that started against England at last week, but there is continuity and experience through the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Savea remains at No.8, first five-eighth McKenzie is set to bring up his 50th Test cap, while second-five Anton Lienert-Brown and fullback Beauden bring vast experience to the backline.</p>
        
            <p>Wing Narawa is back on the All Blacks team sheet for the first time since his Test debut against Argentina in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old was then ruled out of the All Blacks Rugby World Cup campaign after suffering a slipped disc in his back.</p>

            <p>But despite the odds stacked against the Fijians, former Flying Fijian and Fji 7s legend Waisale Serevi believes his fellow countrymen can cause an upset.</p>
        
            <p>Serevi visited the team during the week and said he was confident that they could match the All Blacks across the field.</p>
        
            <p>"Always grateful for the opportunity to support our Flying Fijians," he wrote in a Facebook post.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe it will be a very good game and we have a very good chance of upsetting our neighbours the All Blacks, as they are also in a rebuilding phase right now."</p>
        
            <p>Serevi said to beat the All Blacks, the Flying Fijians will need to start well and score points early.</p>
        
            <p>"If the boys start well, get the points early, work hard, defend the first three to four phases well and be patient on attack and defence, playing the full 80 minutes game, we will really have a good chance."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Test against the All Blacks is the best gauge for the team, who are also rebuilding following the 2023 Rugby World Cup under new coach Byrne.</p>
