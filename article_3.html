            <p>A man has been arrested in Auckland after a gun was fired outside Middlemore Hospital earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded to reports of an altercation in the hospital's carpark just before 6.30pm on 4 January, when a gun was reportedly fired from a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Shaun Vickers said it was fortunate that no one was injured.</p>
        
            <p>Officers from Counties Manukau CIB searched a property at the weekend and arrested a 34-year-old they believe was involved.</p>
        
            <p>He has been charged with committing a dangerous act with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and commission of an offence with a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear in Manukau District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were not ruling out further arrests.</p>
        
            <p>"Those allegedly involved showed no regard for the safety of those around them, given this occurred at a hospital," Vicker said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no tolerance and will continue to hold those to account who take part in this behaviour."</p>
