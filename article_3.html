            <p>A woman has suffered a serious shark bite while walking in knee-deep water in Southland.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old was bitten on the leg about 2am on Monday while in the estuary near the Riverton rugby grounds, a police spokesperson said</p>
        
            <p>"She received a significant laceration to her leg that required treatment from emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>"The culprit is possibly a sevengill shark, which are present in the estuary. The time of day is a possible factor."</p>
        
            <p>People needed to be cautious while in the water and conscious of their environment, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Riverton is a popular holiday destination, and police ask that anyone heading into the water follow safety guidelines and avoid late-night swims."</p>
        
            <p>A St John spokesperson said it was notified at 2.27am.</p>
        
            <p>An ambulance and a rapid response vehicle went to Leader Street.</p>
        
            <p>"We treated a patient in a serious condition and then transported them to Southland Hospital," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>According to NIWA, the sevengill shark "is a bit of a biter" and can become aggressive if provoked.</p>
        
            <p>"This shark has serrated teeth, which are slanted sideways with multiple sharp cusps."</p>
        
            <p>NIWA said they grew to three metes are are found all around New Zealand in shallow to deep waters, but were more common in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The sharks are browny-grey in colour and have small black and white spots with a white belly, NIWA said.</p>
        
            <p>Riverton Coastguard president Ross McKenzie said he was surprised to hear of a shark attack at the estuary.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as I am aware that's the first shark attack of that kind in the estuary around Riverton. I have been here around 20 years and it's the first I've heard anything like that," McKenzie said.</p>
        
            <p>However, local anglers saw and caught sharks quite regularly while fishing off the wharfs in Riverton, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're there all the time and the local fishermen and guys that go fishing off the wharfs do see them regularly especially at night.</p>
        
            <p>"You would reasonably assume you'd be safe wading around in knee-deep water, but you just don't know what's out there and it is their environment, not ours."</p>
        
            <p>Plenty of people flocked to the small seaside town over the holiday break and the wildlife in the marine environment was something to be aware of, McKenzie said.</p>
        
            <p>"But as I say this is the first one I've known of, I don't know the history in years gone by, but I don't think there have been any shark attacks in this area. One out of the blue you'd hope."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped it would not scare people away from their usual holiday spot.</p>
