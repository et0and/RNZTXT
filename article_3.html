            <p>Japan XV has scored a first-ever win over the M훮ori All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Ross Filipo had made a handful of changes to his team ahead of the match at Toyota Stadium in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>But they were not strong enough to catch up to the Japan side and never hit the front at any point in the 80-minute match.</p>
        
            <p>The final score was 26-14.</p>
