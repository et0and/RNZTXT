            <p>Media magnate Rupert Murdoch, 93, has married for the fifth time, his corporation, News Corp, confirmed Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Murdoch and Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old Russian-born retired molecular biologist, wed Saturday in a ceremony at his vineyard estate in Bel Air, California.</p>
        
            <p>Photographs of the newly married couple were released by News Corp.</p>
        
            <p>The couple announced their engagement in March.</p>
        
            <p>Murdoch was most recently married to model and actor Jerry Hall. They were wed in 2016 and divorced in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Zhukova is the ex-wife of Alexander Zhukov, a billionaire energy investor and Russian politician. Their daughter, Dasha, was previously married to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who used to own the Premier League soccer club Chelsea.</p>

            <p>In September, Murdoch stepped down as leader of both Fox News' parent company and his News Corp media holdings.</p>
        
            <p>His son, Lachlan, took his place in a media empire that spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics.</p>
        
            <p>In 1952, Murdoch inherited a newspaper in his native Australia from his father.</p>
        
            <p>Over decades, he built a news and entertainment enterprise that became prominent in the United States and Britain, including ownership of such notable newspapers as The Times of London and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        
            <p>Fox News Channel, the 24-hour network founded in 1996, has profoundly influenced television, becoming a popular news source among many conservative US audiences and politicians.</p>
