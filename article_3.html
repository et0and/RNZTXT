            <p>The Government has stepped in to make sure new mother's can still have toast and a cup of tea after the "mad" decision to cut the service in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of Wellington residents took to social media after tea and toast was taken off the menu in the region's maternity wards.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis told First Up the decision made her mad.</p>
        
            <p>"I just remember viscerally that first cup of milky tea and vegemite on toast after we delivered our first baby at Wellington Hospital and I remember being so grateful for that toast, it was like a gourmet meal, and looking at the nurse who delivered it as if she was a saint.</p>
        
            <p>"So when I heard that some women were being stopped from having that simple pleasure, that really frustrated me."</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti was also frustrated and had intervened to ensure women giving birth at Wellington would continue to get their toast, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>She didn't believe it was a matter of the financial crunch facing the health sector.</p>
