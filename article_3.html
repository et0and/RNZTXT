            <p>New Zealand beat Bangladesh by four wickets on the fourth day of the second test to level the two-match series at 1-1 as Ajaz Patel ripped through the Asian side with six wickets before his batting colleagues secured victory.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 137 to win on a treacherous track at Mirpur's Shere Bangla Stadium after Bangladesh's Zakir Hasan hit a battling 59, the tourists rode on Glenn Phillips' unbeaten 40 and Mitchell Santner's 35 not out to prevail.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of scrap," New Zealand skipper Tim Southee said. "It's nice to come out on the right side of it.</p>
        
            <p>"The guys trusted their ways. The way Phillips and Santner play, it's on the attacking side to the other players. And they did that."</p>
        
            <p>Phillips was dropped on nought by skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto but maintained his composure after the Black Caps were reduced to 69-6 before tea to build a seventh-wicket stand of 70 and earn his team a first test win in Bangladesh in 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>"We pride ourselves on fighting till the end and we did that," said man-of-the-match Phillips.</p>
        
            <p>"Our spinners did incredibly well, also Tim. The Bangladesh boys came back with intent. To bring that back and to chase 137 was pleasing.</p>
        
            <p>"The intent was there... Mitchell batted really well. He's got amazing hands, such a fluent player. Credit to him and all the boys."</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh had resumed on their overnight score of 38-2 but lost wickets cheaply in the morning as spinners Patel (6-57) and Santner (3-51) took advantage of the turn on offer to heap pressure on the batsmen.</p>
        
            <p>Patel produced a double strike in the 25th over to get rid of Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Nurul Hasan and leave Bangladesh in deep trouble at 97-7 but opener Zakir, who was starved of the strike as wickets tumbled at the other end, soldiered on.</p>
        
            <p>Zakir took Bangladesh past the 100-run mark and then brought up his half-century to muted celebrations before hitting Santner for a huge six, but the left-hander became Patel's fifth victim when he miscued a sweep.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts were dismissed for 144 before lunch in what was effectively the third day of a rain-affected contest in which an entire day was lost.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had dragged themselves back into the contest on Friday thanks to a fighting 87 by Phillips that gave them a slim eight-run lead after Bangladesh made 172 in their first innings.</p>
        
            <p>"The bowlers did a great job. Everyone chipped in the field as well," said Shanto. "There was an opportunity to win. I hope we learn from this match."</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh won the opening match by 150 runs in Sylhet for their first test victory on home soil against New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>They travel to New Zealand for three one-day internationals and as many Twenty20 matches this month.</p>
