        <h2>Fencers win Ukraine's first gold medal at Paris Olympics</h2>
        <p>
Going into the final leg, Olga Kharlan was thinking of Ukrainian troops fighting on the front lines as motivation. Then she heard the crowd chanting her name.

            <p>Olga Kharlan got the winning touch for Ukraine's first gold medal of the Paris Olympics, ripped off her fencing mask and sank to her knees.</p>
        
            <p>When she got up again, it was to dance on the piste wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and join teammates Alina Komashchuk, Olena Kravatska and Yuliia Bakastova in the celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Kharlan went in for the final leg of the women's team sabre final with South Korea, needing to turn around a three-point deficit to keep her team in the contest.</p>
        
            <p>She had been thinking of Ukrainian troops fighting on the front lines as motivation, trying to keep her own emotions in check "like a robot."</p>
        
            <p>And then she heard the crowd in Paris chanting her name.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't believe it. They're shouting 'Olga, Olga!'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful. Thank you, Paris."</p>

            <p>Facing South Korea's Jeon Ha-young, Kharlan said she realised the key right then was to relax.</p>
        
            <p>She did just that, and scored the eight points Ukraine needed for a 45-42 victory.</p>
        
            <p>"At some point I said 'I'm going to have fun, I'm going to enjoy this moment,'" Kharlan said.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoyed all the fencing and just went for it."</p>
        
            <p>It was Kharlan's second medal in Paris after an individual sabre bronze, and the sixth overall from five Summer Games for the country's most decorated Olympian. She had not won a gold medal since 2008 in Beijing, when she was 17.</p>
        
            <p>She will leave Paris with her two medals a year after she was disqualified at the world championships for refusing to shake the hand of a Russian fencer, something that put her Olympic qualification in jeopardy.</p>
        
            <p>The International Olympic Committee stepped in to allow Kharlan a direct spot at the Paris Games.</p>
