            <p>Carole Coade pleaded guilty to the murder of her partner, 58-year-old director Mark Henry Willis, after his body was found by police in their Tainui home in May last year.</p>
        
            <p>Her name suppression was lifted during her sentencing in the High Court in Dunedin on Thursday, in front of a packed courtroom.</p>
        
            <p>In a victim impact statement, his sister said the family was devastated and haunted by his senseless murder.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston said the murder was a brutal, frenzied attack.</p>
