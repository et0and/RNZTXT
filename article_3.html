            <p>Heavy rain and thunderstorms are forecast to lash parts of the North Island from Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>There has been a heavy rain watch in place for Northland from midday. Thunderstorms are also possible from Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Northland Civil Defence said it was monitoring the situation.</p>
        
            <p>The Far North District Council said its roading contractors would monitor flood-prone sites on Monday and would start checking drains if the weather watch was upgraded to a warning.</p>
        
            <p>However, heavy rain was expected to be widespread across the country later in the day, MetService meteorologist Ngaire Wotherspoon said.</p>

            <p>The government is changing rules to make it easier for lines companies to remove trees near powerlines, to prevent outages during high winds and storms.</p>
        
            <p>The move would ensure the power stayed on, particularly during severe weather events, Energy Minister Simeon Brown said. The changes will come into effect in September.</p>
