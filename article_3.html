            <p>Former rugby league star Jarryd Hayne may walk free from prison after his sexual assault convictions were quashed on appeal.</p>
        
            <p>The 36-year-old was found guilty in May last year of sexually assaulting a woman at her Newcastle home on the night of the 2018 NRL grand final.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third time he had been tried over the incident and the second time he was found guilty.</p>
        
            <p>His first trial ended in a hung jury, he was convicted after the second but then won an appeal, and the third trial resulted in this now-quashed conviction.</p>
        
            <p>The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal was split 2-1 over the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Stephen Rothman said the appeal succeeded on two grounds: one concerning the trial judge's decision not allow further cross-examination of the complainant and another concerning a direction to the jury about how to treat allegations the woman had lied.</p>
        
            <p>"The outcome is that the appeal from each conviction is allowed â€¦ and the court will quash the two convictions in order that there be a new trial," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether there in fact is a new trial is a matter for the Director of the Public Prosecutions."</p>
        
            <p>The Court of Appeal will hear arguments this afternoon about whether Hayne, who has been in prison since last year, should now be granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>During the trial the jury heard the woman had contacted Hayne via Instagram a little less than two weeks before their first in-person meeting and the messages progressed to a "sexualised" nature.</p>
        
            <p>It heard he arrived at the woman's home, having negotiated a A$550 taxi fare back to Sydney, and told the driver to wait outside.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard Hayne tried to kiss the woman, at one point grabbing her by the face, with "forceful" actions despite her telling him to stop.</p>
        
            <p>The jurors were told Hayne's charges were in relation to two forms of sexual activity - oral and digital penetration - and the complainant had said "no" and "stop".</p>
        
            <p>It allegedly lasted for about 30 seconds, and stopped when the complainant's genitals started to bleed.</p>
        
            <p>During the trial Hayne's barrister, Margaret Cunneen SC, said the activity was "entirely consensual" and he "didn't mean to cause her any harm at all".</p>
        
            <p>During the appeal Hayne's lawyers argued that messages deleted from the woman's phone showed that she was consenting and should lead to his acquittal.</p>
