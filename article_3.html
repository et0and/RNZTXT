        <h2>Jamaican sprinter says security delay caused missed semi</h2>
        <p>
Sprinting great Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce missed her Olympic 100m semi-final after sustaining an injury in the warm-up after security delayed her stadium entry.

            <p>Jamaican double champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce missed her Olympic 100 metres semi-final after sustaining an injury in the warm-up after her preparation was unsettled by security officials delaying her entry to the Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>Fraser-Pryce, competing at her fifth Games at the age of 37 and the winner of two golds, a silver and a bronze over 100m, had been due to run in the second heat but appeared as a "did not start" in the official lists.</p>
        
            <p>Social media footage later emerged of her - one of the most recognisable faces in the sport - and Jamaican team members arguing with officials who would not let their vehicle enter. American Sha'Carri Richardson also appeared in the video.</p>
        
            <p>Fraser-Pryce was shown saying: "They've changed the rules. We came through this gate before but now they're saying athletes who have left can't use this gate."</p>
        
            <p>Jamaican chef de mission Ian Kelly told Reuters later that there had been a delay but that Fraser-Pryce's absence was due to injury.</p>
        
            <p>"Mrs Fraser-Pryce was allowed to enter the warm-up track but from another gate from which she was directed to enter from," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no truth that she was not allowed to enter the stadium. Unfortunately she was not able to compete due to an injury sustained during her final warm-up."</p>
        
            <p>In Fraser-Pryce's absence, Julien Alfred of St Lucia won the semi-final and went on to claim victory in the final too, with Richardson taking silver.</p>

            <p>Alfred delivered a brilliant gun-to-tape performance to claim Saint Lucia's first-ever Olympic medal.</p>
        
            <p>Alfred made her usual slick start and remained clear in heavy rain on a sodden track to come home in a national record 10.72 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>World champion and race favourite Richardson took silver in 10.87sec but the American never really threatened and her compatriot Melissa Jefferson claimed bronze in 10.92.</p>
        
            <p>Richardson was slow out of the blocks and could not overhaul Alfred.</p>
        
            <p>It was almost a repeat of last year's world championships, when Richardson sneaked into the final as a fast loser and won the title from lane nine.</p>
        
            <p>There was to be no repeat this time, however, as Alfred hit her stride brilliantly and splashed home for a glorious gold.</p>
        
            <p>The United States' 28-year gold medal drought in the event goes on. Gail Devers was their last winner in 1996. Marion Jones was stripped of her 2000 Olympic gold for doping.</p>
        
            <p>It also ended Jamaica's stranglehold on the event after they won the last four Olympic golds and 10 of the 12 available medals.</p>
