            <p>More cases of powerline tampering in Christchurch have seen power cut to "more than 20" households two nights in a row, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police said recent incidents have occurred "close to schools, preschools, recreational facilities and residential streets".</p>
        
            <p>One of them - on Disraeli Street - was caught on CCTV camera, showing two men using a shopping trolley to cart off their haul. The noise of a grinder can be heard during the theft.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortunately no one has been injured at this stage, however Police remain concerned it is only a matter of time," said Senior Sergeant Roy Appley, echoing previous statements he has made over the past six months.</p>
        
            <p>"Tampering with powerlines places yourself and members of the public at risk of electrocution for a small return."</p>
        
            <p>Appley said power outages could have "devastating" effects on people who need it for life support and assisted breathing machines.</p>

            <p>Police said anyone who sees suspicious behaviour around powerlines should contact them on 111 immediately, or 105 after the fact.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Appley told RNZ the payoff was at best only about $10 a kilogram "and you need an awful lot of it to make a kilogram".</p>
        
            <p>In March he said the fact no one appears to have been killed doing it - yet - suggested those involved had electrical skills.</p>
        
            <p>The thefts began last year in the disconnected residential red zone, but have since spread to areas where the electricity is definitely live.</p>
        
            <p>There has also been a rise in reported incidents involving powerlines in Hawke's Bay.</p>
