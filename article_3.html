            <p>King Charles has paid a heartfelt tribute to those who took part in the D-Day landings, praising them for "replacing tyranny with freedom".</p>
        
            <p>"We are eternally in their debt," the King told an 80th anniversary commemoration.</p>
        
            <p>He was speaking in Portsmouth, one of the key departure points for the Normandy landings in June 1944.</p>
        
            <p>The King hailed the "courage, resilience and solidarity" of those who had taken part in D-Day and whose numbers were now "dwindling to so few".</p>
        
            <p>King Charles, with Queen Camilla and his son the Prince of Wales, was addressing a national D-Day commemoration held under blue skies on Southsea Common.</p>
        
            <p>The audience rose to their feet when veterans stood to make speeches and the Queen was brought to tears.</p>
        
            <p>In his biggest public speech since his cancer diagnosis, King Charles hailed the "greatest amphibious operation in history" and the courage of those who "must have questioned if they would survive".</p>
        
            <p>The King said their efforts to end "brutal totalitarianism" must never be forgotten.</p>
        
            <p>And he called on the present generation to honour those who had died, in ways that "live up to the freedom they died for, by balancing rights with civic responsibilities".</p>
        
            <p>Prince William delivered a poignant reading from the diary of Captain Alastair Bannerman, in which the soldier remembered his family as he headed towards the French coast on the morning of D-Day. Captain Bannerman survived the landing and the war, Prince William said, adding: "Too many never returned."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to some of the veterans later, Prince William was asked about his wife Catherine's recovery and said: "She'd love to be here today."</p>
        
            <p>Portsmouth was one of the embarkation points on the south coast eight decades ago, as Allied forces crossed the Channel to liberate France and Western Europe from Nazi occupation.</p>
        
            <p>The commemorative event heard from those who took part in D-Day, including Roy Hayward, who landed in Normandy on 6 June 1944 at the age of 19.</p>
        
            <p>Hayward, now aged 98, said he wanted to remember those who had "fought for democracy" and "to ensure their story is never forgotten".</p>
        
            <p>Last week the King met one of the veterans of the Normandy landings, Jim Miller, who at the age of 20 had gone ashore at Juno Beach.</p>
        
            <p>The King invited Miller to Buckingham Palace to personally hand him his 100th birthday card.</p>
        
            <p>"I am humbled to reach such a great number, especially when I think of those who fell on the Normandy beaches all those years ago," Miller said afterwards.</p>
