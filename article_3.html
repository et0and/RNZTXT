            <p>Increased parking enforcement on Stewart Island/Rakiura has been welcomed by a district councillor who says change was a long time coming.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Southland District Council endorsed public consultation for a draft roading bylaw which proposes stricter parking restrictions and a new one-way system.</p>
        
            <p>The parking issue has arisen on the back of people leaving their vehicles in popular parts of the island for extended periods - sometimes months at a time - while the one-way changes relate to streets near Observation Rock.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been trying to do this for years and years and years, particularly the one way street," Stewart Island/Rakiura ward councillor Jon Spraggon told councillors this week.</p>
        
            <p>"The parking one's been highlighted in more recent times."</p>
        
            <p>A report prepared for the meeting noted the main reason for people parking for extended periods was either shift work or leaving the island.</p>
        
            <p>Over Christmas, two contractors left a van outside the local airline office for six weeks, Spraggon said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the number of people on the island, there are far too many vehicles."</p>
        
            <p>The report listed Oban as a main problem area for parking, with nearby Golden Bay also a factor.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty new parking restrictions were set to be put in place alongside changes to 16 existing restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Although the council does not enforce parking in the district, Police have said they would be willing to fulfil the role on the island.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on changes to the bylaw will begin 10 October and end 10 November.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed amendments precede a full review of the bylaw scheduled for mid-2025.</p>
