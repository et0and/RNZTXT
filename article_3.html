            <p>Firefighters are trying to combat a scrub fire that has sent smoke clouds over beaches in the Coromandel, and forced the closure of a nearby road.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ said it received multiple calls to a scrub fire at Kūaotunu, on the peninsula's east coast, just before 4pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The area is popular with holiday-makers, with its population swelling at this time of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Late on Saturday night, FENZ Incident Controller Shane Bromley said authorities have had to close a road: "Due to the vegetation that is burning, and the steep hillside, we have closed Black Jack Road to keep motorists safe until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists are asked to please make alternative plans," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Seven fire trucks and two helicopters were fighting the blaze early on Saturday evening, with it covering 300 metres by 600 metres in size, and burning through pine slash and regrowth.</p>
        
            <p>By 8pm Saturday night, FENZ said the fire was about the same size.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would head to the scene, to help determine its cause.</p>
