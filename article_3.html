            <p>Four people, including two children, have been killed and three others injured following a stabbing in Queens, New York.</p>
        
            <p>Police called to the Far Rockaway neighbourhood in the early hours of Sunday found the victims in a home that had been set on fire.</p>
        
            <p>The male suspect stabbed two police officers before being shot by one of the injured officers.</p>
        
            <p>The suspect was taken to hospital but declared dead on arrival.</p>
        
            <p>In a press briefing at Jamaica Hospital, police confirmed that they received a 911 call at 5.10am local time, when a "young female caller stated that her cousin is killing her family members".</p>
        
            <p>Two officers were sent to the address on Beach 22nd Street where they saw a male walking out with luggage.</p>
        
            <p>When the officers tried to talk to the male he pulled a knife out, stabbing one officer in the neck and chest area, and a second officer in the head.</p>
        
            <p>One of the officers was able to take out his firearm and shot the suspect.</p>
        
            <p>When more officers were dispatched to the scene, they found an 11-year-old girl at the front of the house. She was taken to hospital but later died of her injuries.</p>
        
            <p>After the New York Fire Department arrived at the scene, emergency services found the bodies of three other people inside the house: a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old female, and a male in his 30s.</p>
        
            <p>A 61-year-old female was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital with multiple stab wounds.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe all victims died as a result of stab wounds and a kitchen steak knife was recovered from the scene.</p>
        
            <p>New York police named the suspect as 39-year-old Courtney Gordon, who had one prior arrest for domestic violence in the Bronx.</p>
        
            <p>He was visiting his family members in Queens at the time of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Police said that the investigation was ongoing, but that the person who made the 911 call was being interviewed at the police station.</p>
