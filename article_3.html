            <p>The man found guilty of sexually abusing two teens is taking his case to the Court of Appeal next year.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who is not a sitting MP, sexually assaulted two teenage boys he mentored at a sports club in the mid to late 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>He continues to deny any offending, after a jury found him guilty of eight charges of indecent assault in a week-long trial at the Auckland District Court in August.</p>
        
            <p>Judge David Sharp sentenced the man to two-and-a-half-years' prison and declined his application for permanent name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Ian Brookie has now confirmed the man will appeal his sentence, convictions and the District Court's decision to decline permanent name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown, the man's victims, RNZ, Stuff and TVNZ all opposed the man's continued bids for name suppression, arguing there were no grounds for it.</p>
        
            <p>All three challenges will be heard at the Court of Appeal in Wellington on 13 February. He has interim name suppression until that appeal is heard.</p>
