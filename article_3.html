            <p>The veteran TV journalist Bob McNeil has died at the age of 82.</p>
        
            <p>McNeil began his career in newspapers and radio but was best known for his 20-year stint as a reporter on TV3 - a role that took him to countless countries and made him a household name in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Colleagues paying tribute on social media this morning recalled his kindness, humour and empathy for the people he interviewed.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran TVNZ Pacific reporter Barbara Dreaver described him as "a damn fine journo and a gentleman", while former TV3 investigative reporter Karen Rutherford said he was "one of the kindest, most genuine journos with such great wit".</p>
        
            <p>Journalist David Farrier described meeting McNeil in 2020, when his old friend and mentor was already battling Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        
            <p>"He was the master of forming trusted relationships with pretty much anyone, loved, loved, loved stories, and using humour as a way to tell them," Farrier said.</p>
        
            <p>McNeil's first job out of school was at the Taranaki Daily News in New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>He trained at Palmerston North Teachers College in 1961-1962, and taught at various schools, mostly in Taranaki, until 1970.</p>
        
            <p>In that year he took a job at Radio Waikato in Hamilton, covering major news events such as the Springbok tour protests while working at 1ZH. In 1987 he joined radio 1ZB in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>A few years later, in 1989, he was hired as a news reporter by the fledgling TV channel TV3.</p>

            <p>He soon built up a reputation among his colleagues and the public for his kindness, wit and love of a good story.</p>
        
            <p>He retired from journalism in 2010 at the age of 67.</p>
        
            <p>McNeil was born in Wellington and spent his childhood in Otago, Taranaki and Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>He met his wife Jeanette during an OE in Britain. Their three children include Seven Sharp reporter Sacha McNeil.</p>
        
            <p>The funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.</p>
