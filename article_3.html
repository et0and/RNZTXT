            <p>Team New Zealand has proven - once again - that Kiwis can fly.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand side has won the America's Cup in Barcelona, becoming the first team in modern history to lift the trophy three times in a row.</p>
        
            <p>They won the best-of-13 series 7-2, crossing the finish line early on Sunday morning (NZ time) 37 seconds ahead of the British challengers.</p>
        
            <p>"[I'm] really proud of how the team just kept battling today," skipper Peter Burling said on the America's Cup livestream shortly after the win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's still just sinking in.</p>
        
            <p>"This team has obviously got a few bad memories from before my time of sitting on match points. To be able to get it done today... what an awesome feeling."</p>
        
            <p>For Team New Zealand sailor Nathan Outteridge, it was his first time being part of a winning team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a huge journey. I've loved every minute of it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so awesome to be here with everyone and achieve it, and looking forward to the celebrations tonight."</p>
        
            <p>British skipper Ben Ainslie said it had been an "amazing campaign" from Team New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they're the best team ever in the America's Cup, so it's quite some achievement."</p>
        
            <p>Ainslie thanked his team for "all the effort they've put in over the years", saying it had been a "hell of a road" to get to the finals.</p>
        
            <p>"[At the] end of the day, the better team won," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand boat, Taihoro, was given its name by iwi manaaki Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei.</p>
        
            <p>It translates to "to move swiftly as the sea between both sky and earth".</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand's most recent two America's Cup wins were in 2021 in Auckland and 2017 in Bermuda.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to that, the Kiwi sailors lifted the Auld Mug in Auckland in 2000 and San Diego in 1995.</p>
