            <p>Labour MP Duncan Webb has deleted a video from social media that featured pro-Palestinian protesters chanting at the prime minister: "How many kids did you kill today?".</p>
        
            <p>He had earlier stood by the post, saying the government should take a stronger stance on the Gaza conflict.</p>
        
            <p>It comes at an incendiary time at Parliament as MPs debate several contentious and emotive issues with both sides accusing the other of inflaming tensions.</p>
        
            <p>The Instagram video, posted by Webb on Friday, showed protesters marching through Christchurch holding flags and signs - some reading "Boycott Israel" or "Gaza is the Palestinian Holocaust".</p>
        
            <p>The clip began with the chant: "Hey [Christopher] Luxon, what do you say? How many kids did you kill today?"</p>
        
            <p>It went on to show Webb addressing the protesters, calling for an end to the demonisation of Palestinians and "the racism that underpins this entire conflict".</p>
        
            <p>"Stop the apartheid, the fundamentally racist premise that is the state of Israel, that divides the state on racist lines," Webb said.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop the hunger. Stop the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Stop the blockade of aid, of water, of electricity, of the fundamentals of life to the people of Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop the occupation. Stop the illegal taking of land."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked Webb on Wednesday morning whether creating and sharing the video of the chant was appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not words I would use, but there are very strong feelings out there," Webb said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I certainly think the government should take a much stronger stance on the conflict."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Morning Report on Wednesday, Labour leader Chris Hipkins had blamed Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in part for the poor behaviour and culture at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"The prime minister certainly doesn't lead by example when it comes to not using inflammatory political rhetoric and not attacking people in an ad hominem way, which he does on a near daily basis."</p>
        
            <p>Comment has been sought from the PM's office.</p>
        
            <p>Webb has courted controversy on social media before.</p>
        
            <p>In May, he apologised and deleted a tweeted jibe at ACT leader David Seymour: "Do you think [Seymour] doesn't like humus because it's too close to [Hamas]?"</p>
        
            <p>Separately on Wednesday, Labour issued a statement calling for the coalition to ban government agencies from purchasing goods or services from Israel's illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories of Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        
            <p>The International Court of Justice has ruled Israel's continued presence in the territories is unlawful. Labour says, as a result, action needs to be taken.</p>
        
            <p>Webb shared Labour's statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding: "we need a stronger stance from Luxon".</p>
