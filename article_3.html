        <h2>Why some MPs take a pass on KiwiSaver</h2>
        <p>
One couldn't afford it, another prefers to invest in his farm. Some MPs cite schemes that no longer exist. What's going on?

            <p>KiwiSaver is New Zealand's national superannuation scheme, intended to help more of us save for a comfortable retirement.</p>
        
            <p>But while more than 3.25 million New Zealanders have an account and more than $100 billion is invested, there are 11 members of parliament not invested.</p>
        
            <p>They include National Party's Melissa Lee, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, ACT's Mark Cameron and Labour's Barbara Edmonds.</p>
        
            <p>Edmonds said she had not joined the scheme because she could not afford to at first.</p>
        
            <p>"I was the sole income earner of a family of 10 and also supporting elderly parents."</p>
        
            <p>She was also paying for two family homes, because one is used for the parents.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in the process of looking for a scheme to join," she said. "But initially every dollar counted. Now we're in a position where we can plan more freely for that but the main reason is it's expensive to have a family of 10 and elderly parents. My focus was on trying to settle in, my kids are aged 10 to 20 and have a lot of extracurricular activity... now we are in a position where we are settled, with much more stable income, we know what our outgoings are and we're ready to start."</p>
        
            <p>Lee said she opted for a private superannuation scheme instead.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Cameron said he had decided to invest his income in his farming business.</p>
        
            <p>Simplicity was the most favoured KiwiSaver provider among those who had opted in to the scheme.</p>
        
            <p>Other default providers, such as ANZ, AMP and ASB were popular.</p>
        
            <p>Speaker Gerry Brownlee said he was a member of AXA KiwiSaver, and Labour's Jenny Salesa said she was a member of Tower's KiwiSaver. Neither scheme has existed under those names for more than a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Simplicity founder Sam Stubbs said people who were not in KiwiSaver were missing out on "free money".</p>
        
            <p>Those who contribute at least $1042 a year qualify for a $521 member tax credit.</p>
        
            <p>MPs also have access to a superannuation subsidy up to two-and-a-half-times their contribution to a maximum 20 percent of salary.</p>
        
            <p>A backbencher earning $168,600 contributing 3 percent of their salary would get a contribution of $12,645.</p>
        
            <p>"They may have an ideological opposition to it, they might have just not got around to it. They might not have had a job where they were defaulted into it," Stubbs said.</p>
        
            <p>The reference to schemes which had since been acquired by other providers reflected "how much attention they pay to it", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no logical reason why they shouldn't have it."</p>
        
            <p>There were many people in the wider population still not in the scheme, or not contributing, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The tragedy of that is that those are probably the people who most need it. The problem with KiwiSaver now, it's a wonderful scheme but it is exacerbating a wealth gap rather than narrowing it."</p>
        
            <p>Independent economist Shamubeel Eaqub said it reflected a tendency of New Zealanders not to be deliberate about their money.</p>
        
            <p>"Have you actively and deliberately made those financial decisions? That's really important for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Council of Trade Unions policy director Craig Renney said some MPs might not want to tie up their savings until they were 65, as KiwiSaver required.</p>
