            <p>AUKUS and foreign interference have been discussed as part of official meetings between Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Chinese Premier Li Qiang.</p>
        
            <p>Li is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit New Zealand in seven years. The trip coincides with the 10-year anniversary of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>He received a full official welcome on Thursday for the official meeting at Government House in Wellington, where a range of topics were discussed, namely - our two-way trade.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting also came against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions.</p>
        
            <p>China has made no secret of its displeasure toward the AUKUS defence pact - which New Zealand supports and has considered joining in a second-tier capacity.</p>
        
            <p>China's Ambassador to New Zealand has said joining would be akin to "taking sides".</p>
        
            <p>China's blighted human rights record has also caused friction.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, the full New Zealand parliament passed a motion expressing grave concern about China's treatment of Uighur Muslims.</p>
        
            <p>And the government this year denounced China for backing a cyber-attack on New Zealand's parliament years earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Both condemnations prompted fierce denials from the Chinese embassy at the time.</p>
        
            <p>But on Thursday, both leaders praised the longstanding relationship between the two countries, and committed to expanding cooperation on trade and investment.</p>
        
            <p>In a joint media conference, Luxon said trade, people, education and tourism linkages between the two nations had benefited both countries, supported economic growth and created jobs.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has much to offer China as a source of high quality food and innovative products and services, which can boost productivity and improve economic output."</p>
        
            <p>Li agreed it was important to expand cooperation on trade and investment.</p>
        
            <p>"China is ready to be part of New Zealand's endeavour to double the value of exports in the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>"The growth of our relations has not only benefited the two peoples but also contributed to regional peace, stability, and prosperity."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he also raised a number of issues important to "New Zealand's interests", including "issues on which our perspectives differ".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said it was probably a "50-50" split on whether the conversation was more about differences or shared interests.</p>
        
            <p>Li acknowledged those differences too.</p>
        
            <p>"Given our different national realities and stages of development, it is natural that we don't always see eye to eye with each other on everything. But such differences should not become a chasm that blocks exchanges and cooperation between us."</p>
        
            <p>Li did not front the media for questions, and it was in the stand-up that followed the media conference where Luxon alone confirmed AUKUS and foreign interference were put on the table for discussion.</p>
        
            <p>"We canvassed AUKUS, and they raised their concerns. And, you know, we raised a number of concerns and different differences that we have as well ... I expressed our view that foreign interference is something that we do not support from any country."</p>
        
            <p>The two leaders concluded the meeting with a host of agreements in the areas of trade, education and tourism, with China allowing visa-free visits for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will also be the guest country of honour at China's International Import Expo in Shanghai later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Li will continue his engagements in Auckland, meeting with Labour leader Chris Hipkins.</p>
