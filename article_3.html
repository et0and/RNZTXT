            <p>The Greater Wellington Council is considering raising public transport fares in the region by 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Chair Daran Ponter says they are caught between a financial rock and a fiscal hard place.</p>
        
            <p>"Do we ask passengers to pay more to use public transport, or do we hike rates even higher?"</p>
        
            <p>He said inflation and escalating expenses were to blame.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd never consider an increase of this size if we weren't also faced with tough choices about raising rates and cutting spending in this year's Long Term Plan."</p>
        
            <p>Metlink estimates a further 3.3 percent rates rise would be required if the fares did not increase.</p>
        
            <p>Public transport is jointly funded by central government and the regional council, with fares only covering about a third of costs.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Transport Committee chair Thomas Nash said while fares have stayed low, the cost of public transport has gone up significantly.</p>
        
            <p>"We have deliberately kept fare increases below the level of inflation over the last few years to protect people from cost-of-living pressures," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said a 10 percent increase would still leave public transport competitively priced compared to using private vehicles, once you take into account fuel, parking, insurance and maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>Fares increased by six percent across the region last year after no increase in 2022 or 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The fares would increase from the 1 July next year if regional councillors chose to proceed at the annual fares review on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Off peak and weekend fares on the Metlink network will remain half price as will travel for community services and total mobility card holders.</p>
