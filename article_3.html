            <p>She responded by adopting a conservative approach to her first run, leaving her placed sixth overall.</p>
        
            <p>"I would describe today's performance as solid, the first run - I definitely left a bit of time out there, I had some good sections but I was a little conservative," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like in the second run I really charged and went for it."</p>
        
            <p>Series leader Federica Brignone of Italy won from reigning Olympic champion, Sara Hector of Sweden.</p>
