            <p>Lake Hāwea residents are questioning why police didn't launch a homicide investigation until eight months after a woman died.</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill woman Karen Gaylene White died at her Lake Hāwea property on 8 March. She was 60.</p>
        
            <p>In November a homicide investigation was launched.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, police said she died from injuries sustained in a significant assault.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Regan Boucher said police were following positive lines of inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"Police believe people in the community hold important information about Mrs White's murder and we encourage those people to come forward."</p>
        
            <p>Residents told RNZ that the community was shocked and they wanted to know how it took so long to become a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>But they said they still felt safe in what was a small community of full time residents and holiday homes.</p>
        
            <p>Boucher said police this week returned to examine the Lake Hāwea property with scientists from the ESR but would not reveal further details about their investigation or what was found.</p>
        
            <p>In March, police initiated enquiries and treated White's death as unexplained, conducting a scene examination across the week that followed speaking with a number of people who may have been in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, police said they had been working to determine what occurred before her death and a homicide investigation was launched after their enquiries led them to believe she died in suspicious circumstances.</p>
