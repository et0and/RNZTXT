        <h2>Wellington's City to Sea bridge to be demolished after council vote</h2>
        <p>
It's an earthquake risk - though some experts disagreed - and council staff deemed the $85m strengthening cost too high.

            <p>Wellington City Councillors have voted to demolish the City to Sea bridge which connects the capital's waterfront and Civic Square.</p>
        
            <p>A seismic assessment found the bridge was an earthquake risk - though some experts disagreed with that - and council staff deemed the $85m price tag for strengthening it too high.</p>
        
            <p>They recommended the bridge be demolished and replaced by a large pedestrian crossing, with the option of building a new bridge in a future long term plan.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors voted for that recommendation at Thursday's environment and infrastructure committee meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Iona Pannett attempted to shift the decision to February next year, to give staff time to gather more information and develop a "cost effective solution" to strengthen the bridge.</p>
        
            <p>But her amendment was voted down.</p>
        
            <p>Committee chairperson councillor Tim Brown said those in favour of keeping the bridge lacked a "moral obligation" to people who could be standing on it in an earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tory Whanau said she loved the bridge, but believed in the officers' advice, and the council could not afford the remediation.</p>
        
            <p>The council's chief operating officer James Roberts said staff had already gathered the relevant advice and consulted with experts to arrive at their conclusion that the bridge needed demolishing.</p>
        
            <p>"We would be rehashing ground we've already gone through," Roberts said.</p>
        
            <p>Demolition was the cheapest option, and strengthening was not an affordable option within the council's budget, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the meeting, much of the discussion was centred on whether the bridge was considered "importance level 2" or importance level 3" (IL2 or IL3) under the building code - which is determined by risk to human life or the environment.</p>
        
            <p>Officers told the meeting when Civic Square reopened they expected there would be more large events which would see at least 300 people on the bridge.</p>
        
            <p>With that number of people, it was "clear cut" that it should be considered IL3 - therefore, in need of remediation, which was too expensive, they said.</p>
        
            <p>But in public participation at the beginning of the meeting, an experienced engineer told the council the bridge was not earthquake prone - because only buildings could be considered as such.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no legal requirement to strengthen it," said Bruce McLean, the man responsible for overseeing the construction contract for bringing the Town Hall up to building code.</p>
        
            <p>McLean cited a report from engineering firm Dunning Thornton which he said offered lesser strengthening options - cheaper than the $85m council estimate.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on behalf of Historic Places Wellington, Felicity Wong said to demolish the bridge would be "civic vandalism".</p>
        
            <p>There were a lot of options to fix up the bridge, but public consultation documents did not offer those options, she argued.</p>
        
            <p>However, council staff later said the consultation document explained why remediation was not considered a "reasonably practicable option", due to budget constraints.</p>
