            <p>The Navy says HMNZS Manawanui, the ship which sunk off the coast of Samoa, is not leaking oil.</p>
        
            <p>Navy Commodore Shane Arndell told Checkpoint on Tuesday the Manawanui was resting 30 metres underwater on a reef off the south coast of Upolu, and was not leading.</p>
        
            <p>He said divers on Tuesday confirmed the tanks were holding and there was no leakage, despite claims from locals oil had impacted marine life.</p>
        
            <p>The Samon government earlier on Tuesday said no leaks had been found.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 1000 tonnes of diesel fuel were on board HMNZS Manawanui when it sank, Rear Admiral Garin Golding told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy spill kit was being loaded on board vessel the Canterbury, due to depart to Samoa on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
