            <p>A review into how an application for an urgent passport renewal for a Wellington DJ was handled has found it could have been managed better, but there was no preferential treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Tessa Hills had won a competition to join British DJ Fred again.. (Fred Gibson) in Australia for his world tour, but needed her passport renewed.</p>
        
            <p>Fred again.. took to Instagram, pleading for help, and a senior official at the Department of Internal Affairs privately messaged him, saying it was being sorted out.</p>
        
            <p>Internal Affairs chief executive Paul James said an independent review found Hills' application was processed normally.</p>
        
            <p>But that the matter should have been handled better when it came to privacy and the use of social media.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no evidence of preferential treatment, nor of any DIA leader playing a role in the decision to grant the passport renewal," James said.</p>
        
            <p>"The urgent passport was processed in the normal way, by the normal people, and the urgent fee was paid."</p>
        
            <p>Recommendations from the review about privacy and social media were being implemented immediately.</p>
        
            <p>James said the urgent passport service was an important service.</p>
        
            <p>"From 1 October 2023 to 30 March 2024, there were 14,026 urgent same day passports issued, with 62 being granted on 26 March 2024, including the passport in question."</p>
