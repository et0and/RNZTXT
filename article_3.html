            <p>Four people have been plucked from the rocks and a rip in a helicopter rescue after they were pulled away from the beach by strong tides at Cape Farewell.</p>
        
            <p>Police, Coastguard and Surf Life Saving New Zealand worked together on the rescue, after they were told four people were in trouble in the water, shortly before 11am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The four had been swept out from Wharariki Beach by a rip, at the far north west tip of the South Island, Surf Live Saving NZ said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial reports were of two patients stranded on rocks, with a further two patients in the water," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The rescuers called in both the Search and Rescue helicopter from Nelson Airport, and a HeliMed helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>The HeliMed chopper was able to reach the scene first, and plucked all four people to safety, airlifting them to the beach.</p>
