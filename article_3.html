            <p>Gisborne Mayor Rehette Stoltz says it has been a "very stressful and absolutely nerve-wracking" time in the region as the three fishermen now face another night at sea.</p>
        
            <p>The search for the men has been postponed until first light tomorrow, says Maritime New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The ship was reported overdue on Monday afternoon. It had three people on-board.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the missing people were spotted by the bulk carrier, African Tiger on Tuesday afternoon, however, due to the severe weather conditions they were unable to be rescued.</p>
        
            <p>The 180-metre-long African Tiger was unable to remain on scene due to the deteriorating weather conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Those on board threw life rings and flotsam into the water in the area where the two men were spotted.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Defence Force's P8 Poseidon also dropped a life raft in the same area.</p>
        
            <p>Swells in the area were getting as high as six metres and winds were gusting up to 50 knots on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts were made by both boats and aircraft to keep track and rescue the two missing people, said Maritime New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>However, these attempts were not successful due to high winds and seas, and the people were still in the water.</p>
        
            <p>The severe weather affected rescue efforts significantly.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne Mayor Rehette Stoltz told Checkpoint she knew the family of one of the men.</p>
        
            <p>"[They're] a lovely group of men. Everywhere I went today, someone in Gisborne knows someone on that boat.</p>
        
            <p>"We're such a close-knit community and it is heartbreaking."</p>
        
            <p>As a community they were "praying for the safe return of our men", she said.</p>
        
            <p>She was not aware whether the men had a personal locater beacon on them.</p>
