            <p>The Environmental Protection Authority has issued an urgent alert for people to stop using weedkiller because of significant concerns about its effects on unborn children.</p>
        
            <p>The EPA began investigating Dacthal or DCPA herbicides last week after they were pulled off shelves in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>It is now urging people to avoid the herbicide, which is used to control annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in vegetable growing globally.</p>
        
            <p>Hazardous Substances Reassessments Manager Dr Shaun Presow said it issued the alert because it had serious concerns about the potential risks to people's health.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge anyone currently using a product containing chlorthal-dimethyl to stop and to consider alternatives.</p>
        
            <p>"If people can't avoid using these products, the EPA advises they take all precautions to avoid exposure for people who are pregnant or could be pregnant."</p>
        
            <p>This includes restricting access to sprayed areas and making sure nobody else is around during spraying Presow said.</p>
        
            <p>The US Environmental Protection Agency found a risk of thyroid hormone changes in the unborn children of pregnant bystanders, women who apply chlorthal-dimethyl, or those who enter treated fields after the substance has been applied.</p>
        
            <p>These changes can cause low birth weight and irreversible and lifelong impacts, such as impaired brain development and motor skills.</p>
        
            <p>Presow said the EPA had set up a working group to look at how this herbicide is being used here, and to take rapid action to ensure it continued protecting people's health and safety.</p>
        
            <p>"While this is happening, we have put out a red alert to ensure the public is aware of the potential risks."</p>
        
            <p>Presow said The EPA is consulting with those likely to be affected by any proposed additional rules around the use DCPA herbicides.</p>
