            <p>The Gulf Harbour ferry service is back to a full schedule of sailings from Monday, after years of frequent cancellations and reduced timetables.</p>
        
            <p>Ferry crew shortages meant many commuters were stuck using hours-long replacement buses or even taxis to take them the 50km by road from Auckland's central business district to the Whangaparāoa peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>Then last year Auckland Transport proposed canning the service altogether, prompting backlash from the community and a petition to keep it running.</p>
        
            <p>Now the service's problematic past appears to be behind it, but it will take time and effort to win back the trust of the locals.</p>

            <p>Monday was a beautiful morning in The City of Sails, with blue skies and still water.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh my god, it's a blessing for me. Because it just takes 45 minutes from here. I just get dropped off at the ferry terminal and walk to work, fantastic, " said local Geet Vashisth.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all gonna get behind it, we're all going to use it," said fellow commuter Kathy.</p>
        
            <p>Gulf Harbour is near the end of the Whangaparāoa peninsula, and the drive in peak traffic was a long and slow option for Vashisth.</p>
        
            <p>"You need to come with me in the car in the morning, and it will take forever to reach the city, or anywhere outside this area. But having a ferry is such a convenience."</p>
        
            <p>The extra sailings would take some cars off the roads, Kathy said, but she hoped Auckland Transport had not promised too much.</p>
        
            <p>"My biggest worry is that we've been set up for failure, with 24 ups and downs a day when they could barely service four."</p>

            <p>The newly beefed up timetable of 24 return trips includes morning sailings from Gulf Harbour at 6:30, 7:00, 7:30 and 8:30.</p>
        
            <p>Up until today there were only 2 to 3 sailings each day from Gulf Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>A one way trip costs $11.80 for an adult and $6.30 for a child, with a hopcard.</p>
        
            <p>But some commuters were caught out by the new timetable, which no longer had a 7:45 sailing.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't bother to check, I don't check the website every day, right. I said 'if there's no change it's 7:45' - but coming here I saw the ferry going away and I said 'bugger'," laughed one unlucky commuter.</p>
        
            <p>Although locals Checkpoint spoke to were happy to see their ferries back, they had not showed up in numbers yet.</p>
        
            <p>Only about 15 to 20 people boarded each ferry during the morning peak on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Albany ward councillor John Watson said it would take time to build those numbers back up.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lot harder building things back up than it is to let them run down," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>"So there's going to be a real campaign required now to attract people back. At one stage there, we were getting 18,000 boardings a month, which was really good."</p>

            <p>Auckland Transport public transport operations manager Duncan McGrory said they had worked hard to improve the service with their contractor Fullers360: "To make sure that they do have the right amount of people.</p>
        
            <p>"They do have the right amount of people, they do have some contingencies if they do have vessels that have mechanical issues."</p>
        
            <p>McGrory said he expected to see more people catching the ferry from Tuesday, as he said work from home arrangements often meant a slower start and end of the week for public transport.</p>
