            <p>Marlon Williams won Best Solo Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>But not long after, he said "something terrible" happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I broke the award. I dropped it on that hard concrete floor and it snapped in half," Williams told Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>He was nominated alongside Avantdale Bowling Club, Fazerdaze, Kaylee Bell, Princess Chelsea and Stan Walker.</p>
        
            <p>Williams was surprised by the win. "I'm shellshocked," he said.</p>
        
            <p>While receiving the award, he acknowledged his whƒÅnau and management team.</p>

            <p>He was also nominated for Best Music Video Content (taken by Anahera Parata - SHE) and Album of the Year (taken by The Beths - Expert in a Dying Field).</p>
        
            <p>Marlon likened the awards night to an AGM of music.</p>
        
            <p>"It's often the only time that people in the industry ever get to see each other, 'cause we're all out touring and sort of ships in the night really."</p>
        
            <p>But now it was about moving on to the next project.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm off to Australia to go and start a solo tour around there.</p>
        
            <p>"I was meant to go and play over the Covid period but I literally got turned away at the boarding gate when I was going to Australia last time, which was good because I didn't wanna get stuck in Melbourne."</p>
        
            <p>After that, he said he would put some time into writing and cutting a new record.</p>
