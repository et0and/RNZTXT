            <p>[Accused https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/501573/police-charge-erin-patterson-with-murder-over-deadly-mushroom-lunch-in-australia killer Erin Patterson] has formally pleaded not guilty to murder over the alleged mushroom poisonings of three of her relatives, and has elected to have her case "fast-tracked" to a Victorian Supreme Court trial.</p>
        
            <p>Patterson was charged with murder after the deaths of three guests who ate a beef Wellington at her home in the Victorian town of Leongatha last year.</p>
        
            <p>Her in-laws Don and Gail Patterson, Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson and her husband Ian Wilkinson fell gravely ill after eating the meal.</p>
        
            <p>A short time ago in the Latrobe Valley Magistrates' Court, Patterson entered "not guilty" pleas to three counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder.</p>
        
            <p>The case was adjourned to a directions hearing in the Supreme Court in Melbourne on 23 May.</p>
