            <p>A probe into pollution at a former chemical plant in New Plymouth concludes there is potential for contamination to exist which could affect human health and the environment.</p>
        
            <p>Ivon Watkins - later Ivon Watkins-Dow - made the herbicides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D at Paritūtū from 1960 through to 1987.</p>
        
            <p>The herbicides, which contained toxic dioxins, were a key component of Agent Orange - the defoliant used by the US military in the Vietnam War - which has been linked to cancers and birth defects.</p>
        
            <p>The Paritūtū plant was demolished in 2022, and Dow and its New Zealand-based remediation partner Tonkin & Taylor were involved in a clean-up process expected to take several years.</p>
        
            <p>Tonkin & Taylor was responsible for the just completed Preliminary Site Investigation (PSI).</p>
        
            <p>"It concluded that there is a potential for contamination to exist in surface soils, underlying soils, and groundwater (shallow and deep) which could affect human health, and/or the environment," Dow said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>It said the PSI was a significant milestone in the remediation project and would help it understand the history of the Paritūtū plant and the possibility for any contamination.</p>
        
            <p>Dow conceded the investigation "did not involve collecting samples from the site; however, information from the PSI will help to plan future sampling if required".</p>
        
            <p>The PSI involved a review of:</p>
        
            <p>Dow said information gathered and interpreted as part of the 137-page PSI would be used to help plan future soil and groundwater investigations and outline possible remediation measures.</p>
        
            <p>"We remain committed to transparency and community engagement throughout this remediation process. The next step involves a Detailed Site Investigation (DSI), which will focus on comprehensive soil and groundwater sampling to better understand current conditions at Paritūtū and whether there are any existing exposure pathways.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the process outlined in the published Remediation Road Map, remediation efforts will then commence where necessary."</p>
        
            <p>Dow said the Paritūtū PSI was a comprehensive report and had been reviewed and endorsed by an independent peer reviewer (Becca) appointed by Taranaki Regional Council (TRC) and tāngata whenua.</p>
        
            <p>The full Paritūtū PSI Report would be submitted to the TRC.</p>
        
            <p>A four-page summary of the report includes:</p>
