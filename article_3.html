            <p>A woman who suffered a heart attack died in Waikato Hospital because no one heard her alarm going off.</p>
        
            <p>The 84-year-old, who had been living in an aged care facility, was admitted to the hospital's emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain in February 2023.</p>
        
            <p>While waiting for a cardiology assessment, the patient was put on a bedside cardiac monitor.</p>
        
            <p>She later went into cardiac arrest, but it took ED staff several minutes to notice her monitor alarm had been activated.</p>
        
            <p>The patient was found unresponsive and resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.</p>
        
            <p>A coroner's inquiry into the death found the alarm volume had been turned down to an inaudible level. The inquiry was unable to determine who lowered the volume.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Ian Telford did not accept Health New Zealand (HNZ) Waikato's claim earlier intervention would not have changed the outcome. HNZ Waikato said the patient had an extensive cardiac history.</p>
        
            <p>But Telford said the death may have been prevented if the patient's arrhythmia was detected and treated quicker.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry also found the patient had not been checked on for two hours before she died.</p>
        
            <p>Telford said not being seen by a nurse for over two hours in a critical care setting like ED was not acceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"At the time of the critical event, the nurse-to-patient ratio that night was lower than the ratio recommended by the New Zealand Nurses Organisation and the College of Emergency Nurses New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>However, Telford said he could not determine if increased staffing would have made a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"Put simply, even if there were more staff on duty, they may have all similarly failed to hear or see the monitoring devices alarm."</p>
        
            <p>He recommended alarms for critical events in the hospital be audible and easily distinguished from other alarms.</p>
        
            <p>He said frequent non-critical alarms were distracting and resulted in "alarm fatigue".</p>
        
            <p>He also called for medical and nursing staff to be appropriately trained on using the monitoring system.</p>
        
            <p>He said HNZ Waikato had taken steps to ensure future patient safety, and therefore did not refer the case to the Health and Disability Commission.</p>
        
            <p>But short-staffing continued to be an issue for Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A patient who spoke to RNZ from their hospital bed said they had waited more than a month for cardiac surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, another patient waited more than 16 hours in the hospital's ED with suspected internal bleeding only to be referred back to their GP.</p>
        
            <p>And on Friday more than 600 nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, students, and administration staff walked off the job at the hospital over recruitment concerns.</p>
