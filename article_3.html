            <p>Hunger-striking inmate Dean Wickliffe will be released from prison after appearing before the Parole Board on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 77-year-old was taken to hospital on Monday after having refused food since 10 March, claiming he was beaten by multiple guards at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken to prison for breaking his parole conditions, because he was living in his car and not at an approved address.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared before the New Zealand Parole Board today after his recall hearing date was moved forward from 3 April, following requests from his lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Sam Vincent confirmed to RNZ that Wickliffe has been granted parole and his hunger strike was now over after 16 days.</p>
        
            <p>He said the 77-year-old remained in hospital, as reintroducing food would be a slow process, to be done with medical supervision.</p>
        
            <p>"He's lost a very large amount of weight," Vincent said. "He's still talking, he's still got energy, he's really impressive. But I'd say his abilities will be limited as he recovers, but I'm sure he will."</p>
        
            <p>He said the decision had come as a big relief.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really glad to see the parole board agree with us that he should be released. We hope that he can now go and live the rest of his life in peace."</p>
        
            <p>He could not confirm which address Wickliffe would be released to when he left the hospital, or whether it was the same as the one previously listed in his parole conditions.</p>
        
            <p>He is set to be released on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Vincent told RNZ Wickliffe's immediate release was "what we really needed".</p>
        
            <p>"We're relieved by this. He doesn't pose a threat to the community and he has good support around him."</p>
        
            <p>The board considered Wickliffe's accommodation and support proposal "adequately addressed the risk" and a full written decision would be available in 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Steve Abel viewed the hearing at Wickliffe's request and told RNZ his release was "very good news".</p>
        
            <p>"It's justice done, to my view. He should never have gone to prison in the first place, in this instance."</p>
        
            <p>Abel said Wickliffe was "stoic" when the judgement to release him was made.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the course of his time in prison, he has advocated for better prison conditions within the justice system, and in this latest instance, did that again.</p>
        
            <p>"That is something he feels very passionately about, that there needs to be a basic tenant of humanity in the way that prisoners are treated even while they're in incarceration - he is a strong advocate for that."</p>
        
            <p>Wickliffe's lawyers allege the 77-year-old's head was beaten into a concrete floor after he refused to enter his cell and be double-bunked.</p>
        
            <p>They are calling for the public release of the footage related to the incident.</p>
