            <p>The government wants to divide New Zealand along ethnic and economic lines, Chris Hipkins says, and he wants to be the leader who brings it together.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour Party voted this weekend to investigate a capital gains tax and a wealth tax, as well as deciding not to be involved in AUKUS - what Hipkins called a "principled position".</p>
        
            <p>The Labour leader closed the party's annual conference in Christchurch on Sunday by promising to get "back to basics" - jobs, healthcare and education.</p>
        
            <p>He said a "new Labour government" was needed to "bring the country together again for our next big fight, and that's a fight for a fair go for all New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>But he acknowledged Labour's working class roots, saying "working New Zealanders have always been integral to Labour's purpose."</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at why Labour was established, it was to make sure that those who are working actually get their fair share of the rewards from that work.</p>
        
            <p>"But we are also a party for all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the coalition government was "taking us backwards in a very big way - socially, economically, culturally and environmentally".</p>
        
            <p>National was happy to "divide the country in order to rule", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at some of the worst legacies of the Muldoon era, we're still grappling with those today. That was a government much like this current one, who is more interested in creating division than creating unity."</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill was decried by multiple Labour MPs over the weekend as being one of the causes of that division.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with Q+A on Sunday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said there was "more division" nowadays than when the coalition came to power and the relationship between the Crown and Māori was "probably worse".</p>
        
            <p>However, he laid the blame on the previous Labour government, saying it had made some "pretty horrendous decisions" affecting Māori - including the Māori Health Authority and Three Waters reforms.</p>
        
            <p>The division had "been building for some time", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a challenging time at the moment ... there's strong feeling on all sides of that debate."</p>
