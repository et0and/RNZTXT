            <p>The Mainland Tactix are on top of netball's ANZ Premiership after a sensational 58-53 extra-time win against the Central Pulse in a physical top-of-the-table clash in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The assured Tactix side produced a brilliant all-court display in extra-time to take the victory and go two points clear of the Pulse on the competition ladder.</p>
        
            <p>The tense match was tied at 51-all at the end of regular time after a goal-for-goal fourth quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse, who had led for three quarters, had their chance to take the win in the last 30 seconds of the fourth quarter, but desperate defence from the Tactix held them scoreless, sending the game into the decider.</p>
        
            <p>A defensive switch proved a masterstroke for Tactix coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek and paid off handsomely for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>The introduction of Kate Lloyd to goal keeper, Jane Watson to goal defence and Karin Burger to wing defence threw the Pulse off-guard and the Tactix pounced.</p>
        
            <p>That was on the back of goal attack Jess Allan replacing an injured Te Paea Selby-Rickit towards the end of regular time - the shooter injecting her speed and timing at the attack end to great effect as the Tactix went on to dominate extra-time 7-2.</p>
        
            <p>Producing a spectacle worthy of their status as the top two teams in the league, the Tactix and Pulse produced a riveting contest.</p>
        
            <p>In the Tactix midcourt, skipper Kimiora Poi played most of the match at wing attack in a switch with Erikana Pedersen.</p>
        
            <p>Poi and Pedersen worked tirelessly on attack and defence to send the ball into goal shooter Ellie Bird who scored 39 goals while missing just three attempts.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse rookie shooter Martina Salmon delivered another strong performance with superb feeding from Whitney Souness and Claire Kersten.</p>
        
            <p>But the defensive ball won by the Tactix defenders at the death proved the difference.</p>
        
            <p>Tactix skipper Poi said her players were confident they could compete under the pressure of extra-time.</p>
        
            <p>"We actually practised for extra-time this week in training," Poi said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a good crowd to back us to go all the way."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse captain Kelly Jackson said their effort came up short as they continue to miss a number of frontline players through injury.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse goal attack Tiana Metuarau, on the comeback from a foot problem, was injected with just six minutes to go.</p>
        
            <p>"We went goal-for-goal throughout that whole last quarter and that's the type of netball that we want to see out there," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately the Tactix just stepped it up a notch in extra-time and we didn't."</p>
        
            <p>The teams will meet one more time in the regular season in round 15 in Wellington on 22 July.</p>
