            <p>An Australian is among three United Nations observers and an interpreter who have been injured while patrolling Lebanon's southern border with Israel, according to Lebanese media, the ABC reports.</p>
        
            <p>Three United Nations observers and a translator have been wounded by shelling in Rmeish, southern Lebanon, the UN peacekeeping mission said.</p>
        
            <p>Lebanon's state news agency reported that an Israeli drone strike was behind the explosion, but the Israeli military denied it was responsible.</p>
        
            <p>The UN mission, Unifil, said those hurt were receiving treatment and that it was investigating the blast's origin.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after rising tensions along the unofficial Israel-Lebanon border.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Unifil said a shell had exploded near the group who had been on a foot patrol along the UN-demarcated Blue Line that divides southern Lebanon from Israel.</p>
        
            <p>It described the targeting of peacekeepers as "unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>No details have been given about the nationality of the observers or their condition. The Lebanese translator is reported to be stable.</p>
        
            <p>Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israeli "enemy drones" raided the area in southern Lebanon where the observers were wounded.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military denied this, saying in a statement: "Contrary to the reports, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] did not strike a Unifil vehicle in the area of Rmeish this morning."</p>
        
            <p>In recent days, tensions have again picked up along the unofficial border between Israel and Lebanon, with casualties on both sides.</p>
        
            <p>Israel and the armed group Hezbollah trade almost daily strikes across the border, which began with the start of the Israel-Gaza war following the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group with close ties to Iran and an ally of Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF would increase its attacks against the group in Lebanon, "shifting from repelling to actively pursuing Hezbollah".</p>
        
            <p>"Wherever they are hiding we will reach them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Israel has come under pressure from the US after it said it "cannot support" an anticipated large-scale ground offensive in Rafah on Gaza's border with Egypt, where there are more than a million displaced people.</p>
        
            <p>US President Joe Biden's administration has been raising concerns about rising civilian deaths in Gaza and humanitarian access to the territory, which the UN says is on the verge of famine.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, the IDF admitted killing two Palestinian men and burying their bodies with a bulldozer in "two different incidents" in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Al Jazeera published an edited video purportedly showing the incident on Wednesday. The BBC has not independently verified the video.</p>
        
            <p>The Israeli military said the two men approached their forces "in a suspicious manner" and did not respond to a warning shot.</p>
        
            <p>They were killed and buried with a bulldozer over concerns the men carried explosives, the IDF added.</p>
