            <p>Stricter policies for 2025 mean Formula One drivers could face hefty fines, suspensions and even championship points deductions for such indiscretions as swearing or making political statements.</p>
        
            <p>The FIA, the sport's governing body, published new guidelines for stewards in Appendix B of the 2025 International Sporting Code released on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>If a driver commits three such offences they are at risk of a "one-month suspension plus deduction of championship points".</p>

            <p>The regulations introduce penalties for "any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA" or its officials; for public incitement to violence or hatred; and for the making or display of political, religious and personal statements "in violation of the general principal of neutrality promoted by the FIA."</p>
        
            <p>Another regulation cites general "misconduct" as laid out in Article 20 of the ISC. That section covers the use of language or gestures that is offensive, insulting, coarse, rude or abusive.</p>
        
            <p>Fines at the F1 level range from 40,000 Euros ($NZ73,400) for a first offense, to 80,000 Euros for a second offense, up to 120,000 Euros for a third offense.</p>
        
            <p>The third offense also includes a one-month suspension and deduction of championship points.</p>
        
            <p>The Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) said it had "no comment on that matter for the time being".</p>

            <p>The changes mark the latest in a series of moves by the FIA which have been seen as attempts to stifle dissent or criticism of its president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent was a set of changes to the FIA statutes that opponents said would reduce accountability at the FIA, which were introduced in December at the end of a year in which a series of allegations had been made about the conduct of Ben Sulayem.</p>
        
            <p>And they come less than two months after GDPA director George Russell, the Mercedes F1 driver, said he and his colleagues were "a bit fed up with" the FIA leadership.</p>
        
            <p>Last November, the GPDA wrote an open letter to the FIA asking the governing body to treat them like "adults", saying it considered fines "not appropriate" for motorsport and asking for transparency about how the fines were spent.</p>
