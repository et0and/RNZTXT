        <h2>'It's what the competition needs' - reaction to Moana's first victory of the season</h2>
        <p>
Watch: even the beaten Hurricanes acknowledged the importance of Moana Pasifika's first win of the season.
</p>
        
            <p>This was a match that everyone had circled on their calendars and, like an awful lot of Super Rugby Pacific so far this season, it delivered. However, for Hurricanes fans it will be a bitter pill to swallow seeing two Wellington rugby legends sitting in Moana Pasifika colours, talking about how they engineered a 40-31 win over the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Something may make it a little bit easier is that Ardie Savea wasn't exactly doing cartwheels into the post-match press conference, and not just because he'd been forced from the field with a hamstring complaint. The former Hurricane was in a sombre mood, head bowed often as he acknowledged the mixed feelings about scoring a win over his old team.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually feel for the Canes boys, you know. At the same time, I'm proud of my boys," Savea said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm more happy for the brothers in the changing room. The last couple of weeks, we've been training hard. We've been going into some dark places in terms of our training and really looking in the mirror. And it's just nice to see them reap the rewards of their labour."</p>

            <p>Moana coach Tana Umaga, who was a section of Sky Stadium named after him in recognition of his glittering Hurricanes career, echoed his captain's sentiments after they bounced back from a tough loss to the Highlanders last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I think after the last week, we know that we let ourselves down a little bit by giving him the other team such a lead," Umaga said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we showed the heart in that game…we talked about playing our game, but also building moments, controlling the game, being patient."</p>
        
            <p>The moments were built in large part by flanker Miracle Faiilagi, and the control by first five Patrick Pellegrini, earning praise from their coach.</p>

            <p>"I've just seen a different Miracle (this season). We've asked him to really up his game around his role, and we know that he's good with the ball in hand, and we know what he can do as we saw tonight," said Umaga about Faiilagi's three-try heroics, meanwhile describing Tongan international Pellegrini's game as "outstanding".</p>
        
            <p>"And to be honest every opportunity he's got, he's taking it with two hands. He earned the right to get a start."</p>
        
            <p>Moana's win, coming after three entertaining losses, was something that Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw could at least see the bright side of.</p>
        
            <p>"It does feel like there's been a shift and I think long may it continue," said Laidlaw about the openness of this year's Super Rugby Pacific competition.</p>
        
            <p>"The last thing we want as a competition is runaway teams … as hard as it is for us right now, tonight Moana winning and the Drua are winning today, it's what the competition needs and wants."</p>
        
            <p>However, it's still a loss for the now 1-3 Hurricanes. Co-captain Brad Shields said it was a case of trusting the process.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the more we stick at it and the more we trust our system, the more we trust each other … then some of those little things that let us down, we'll start to switch and start to move. We know that we've got the right players. We know that we've got the right game plan. I think you've just got to trust and believe that you're doing the right stuff. And once that sort of clicks, then sometimes it's all you need."</p>
