        <h2>'Overkill': Gisborne man upset at closure of community garden due to asbestos</h2>
        <p>
The closure of a Gisborne garden due to asbestos contamination has upset a volunteer, who dedicated more than 20 years of his life to working the soil there.

            <p>The closure of a Gisborne garden due to asbestos contamination has upset a volunteer, who dedicated more than 20 years of his life to working the soil there.</p>
        
            <p>In late October, Gisborne District Council closed community-run Turanga Gardens indefinitely after asbestos was found in the area.</p>
        
            <p>It marked the end of a 22-year volunteer project which rejuvenated an area adjacent to the former Cook Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The demolition of that building in 1988 ultimately caused the downfall of the natural space, after bad weather exposed waste deposits which had been buried in the area.</p>
        
            <p>An independent report prepared in October said following heavy rain events earlier in the year - including Cyclone Gabrielle - two areas of the gardens slipped and displaced soil, exposing the contents of the landfill below.</p>

            <p>Asbestos containing material along with demolition waste in exposed areas raised "red flags" for the site, and remediation would be required for continued use.</p>
        
            <p>"Exposure of asbestos within walking tracks and pathways poses a significant risk to users of the site, including gardeners, mowers, maintenance workers and recreational users," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on this investigation, the entire Turanga Gardens site is considered highly likely to pose a risk to human health."</p>
        
            <p>The news has come as a blow to 78-year-old Ray Gowland who played an integral role in both establishing and caring for the space.</p>
        
            <p>Gowland said he travelled extensively with his late wife and enjoyed visiting gardens around the world.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped to create something similar for the people of Gisborne, and believed the closure was "overkill".</p>
        
            <p>"We've probably turned over every piece of soil in the area, and none of us have suffered from any symptoms," Gowland said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't do it for rewards and acknowledgements and payments or anything like that.</p>
        
            <p>"We love gardening and we just love to get in there and create something."</p>

            <p>Local Democracy Reporting asked the council if the site should have been tested earlier due to its location on the landfill.</p>
        
            <p>Council director liveable communities Michelle Frey said the gardens had not been subject to any formal monitoring programme because that was not required for sites with covered material.</p>
        
            <p>"Material was exposed in parts of the gardens as result of rain events. Council closed the gardens and commissioned a detailed site investigation of the site," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The area remains closed while considerations are made around the future of the site, and the costs involved."</p>
        
            <p>Frey said it was unlikely asbestos from the hospital buildings would have posed a risk to anyone walking through the gardens prior to closure.</p>
        
            <p>But there was a potential risk to people who had worked near the source of contamination.</p>
        
            <p>"However, even then, if asbestos was not exposed then there would have been a low risk."</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the gardens indefinite closure in October, the area had been closed following Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Options for remediating the site were being investigated by the council, but it was anticipated to be an expensive undertaking.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from the most recent issue, vandalism and plant poaching at the gardens have also made headlines over the years.</p>
