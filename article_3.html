            <p>With only hours to go until Election Day in the US, the presidential candidates are making their final arguments for the top job.</p>
        
            <p>The race for the White House between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump has already seen more than 78 million Americans cast ballots ahead of Tuesday's Election Day, approaching half the total 160 million votes cast in 2020, in which US voter turnout was the highest in more than a century.</p>
        
            <p>Trump will spend the day in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan, while Harris will spend the entire day in Pennsylvannia, a state seen as crucial to the election outcome.</p>
