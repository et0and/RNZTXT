            <p>A friend who was with a New Zealander when she was allegedly set on fire by her ex-partner in Australia says is glad she was able to be there with her friend.</p>
        
            <p>Destiny Otton-Rakuraku, 34, who grew up in Auckland, was taken to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with severe burns on 18 January.</p>
        
            <p>Emma Nguyen, her friend of 21 years, said she had flown over to Queensland to spend a week with her.</p>
        
            <p>They were on the balcony when Otton-Rakuraku's ex-partner came round.</p>
        
            <p>"I just sensed there was going to be danger when I saw him walk up the stairs to her house," Nguyen said.</p>
        
            <p>The 36-year-old man, identified by Australian media as Renata Manning, allegedly doused Otton-Rakuraku in petrol before producing a lighter and setting her on fire.</p>

            <p>He was charged with one count each of attempted murder and common assault, and appeared in court on 20 January.</p>
        
            <p>Nguyen told RNZ it was a horrific and traumatising situation, but she was glad she was with her friend.</p>
        
            <p>"The family are saying I was meant to be there - and I am grateful that I was," Nguyen said.</p>
        
            <p>In the minutes following the attack, Nguyen said she and one of Otton-Rakuraku's sons, who was also home at the time, were able to move her into a cold shower.</p>
        
            <p>She said neighbours heard the screaming and arrived in time to help her with directions for the emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, she said Otton-Rakuraku had undergone four surgeries in the past week, and her condition was stable but critical - she remained in an induced coma.</p>
        
            <p>"The main thing is, she's alive," Nguyen said.</p>

            <p>Family and friends had flown from New Zealand and around Australia to be with her, and Nguyen said she had only just returned to New Zealand herself.</p>
        
            <p>A GoFundMe page raising money for her recovery had exceeded $50,900 AUD by Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"She's so deserving of it," Nguyen said. "She needs to start a whole new life now, expecially with her two boys."</p>
        
            <p>The family would not be returning to that house - it was "not a safe place", Nguyen said, with too many bad memories.</p>
        
            <p>Otton-Rakuraku would not be able to work, either, "so all those funds will just be very helpful for her recovery ahead".</p>
        
            <p>Her recovery was expected to take at least a year, with at least another few months in hospital.</p>
