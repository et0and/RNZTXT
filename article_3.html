            <p>Smoke seen near Christchurch's Port Hills is believed to be from controlled burn-offs in surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after 3pm on Friday, fire crews rushed to the hills after reports of smoke in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A faint volunteer fire siren could be heard at the Christchurch Adventure Park around that time and multiple fire engines could be heard shortly after, a reporter on scene said.</p>
        
            <p>At 3.40pm, Fire and Emergency said crews had not found any signs of an active fire on the Port Hills.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe the smoke to be from controlled burn-offs that have been taking place in the wider area (not on the Port Hills themselves, where there is a total fire ban in place).</p>
        
            <p>"Thanks to everyone who was vigilant and called 111 this afternoon. It's the right thing to do. We are always ready to respond."</p>
        
            <p>On social media, Christchurch residents said there was a strong smell of smoke in locations such as Northwood, Hoon Hay and Barrington.</p>
        
            <p>Someone said there was a "bit of" smoke and ash in Allandale.</p>
        
            <p>"I drove from Avonside to St Martins and could see it all over the Port Hills 30 minutes ago. Now I'm home in Avonside and can smell it," another said.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are remaining vigilant after a massive fire broke out on the hills on 14 February.</p>
        
            <p>That fire quickly grew to 650 hectares in size and saw residents evacuated for days.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still investigating how that fire started.</p>
