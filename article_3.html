        <h2>School phone ban: How effective will it be?</h2>

            <p>A Wellington secondary school student believes the government's ban on phones in schools will only force students to be more underhanded and "sneakier" in order to use their devices.</p>
        
            <p>Monday's first day of term two sees the cellphone prohibition policy come into effect throughout the country, mandating schools to ensure students don't use or access to a phone during class time, lunchtime and breaks.</p>
        
            <p>There are some exemptions for health, learning support or special circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>National announced the policy two months before the election in order to "help students focus and improve their academic outcomes".</p>
        
            <p>During December's announcement, Minister of Education Erica Stanford said the ban would apply from term two, at which point all schools would be required to have a cellphone policy in place.</p>
        
            <p>But Flo Galvin, a year nine pupil at Wellington High School, has raised doubts over how effective the regulations would ultimately be.</p>
        
            <p>Flo (13) said while phones were a "problem issue" for teenagers, a blanket ban at schools was not the answer.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely addicted to my phone," she said. "Phones in schools, and phones generally, is a pretty big problem for teenagers, but I just don't know whether the ban and how they're trying to do it is going to be effective.</p>
        
            <p>"From experiences of going to a school where phones were banned and people are still on phones and using them, it just feels that nothing is actually going to happen."</p>

            <p>She said she observed students at her last school, which had a phone ban in place, sidestep the rules.</p>
        
            <p>"From what I knew, at least in my classes and people I knew, not many people followed the rule.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been talking about this to friends. [The policy] isn't actually going to mean that people aren't on their phones, it just means they'll be sneakier about it and won't be caught.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if it'll be harder to regulate, but I just don't think it will make a difference."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington High School outlined its reading on the policy last month, highlighting the "good educational and organisational uses" of cellphones at school.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to implement a policy that acknowledges those purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"If teachers request that students do not use phones in class, we expect our students to comply with that request, except where an exemption is in place.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, students will keep phones, and other small digital devices, silenced and out of sight when they are in class."</p>
        
            <p>Flo said although prohibiting phones during class time was "totally reasonable", she would prefer to have the freedom to use it during lunch breaks.</p>
        
            <p>"During break there's not much of a reason for it and being able to text friends and figuring out where to meet up during lunch is nice, especially in a really big school."</p>
        
            <p>However some leaders in the sector believe most students had bought into the new regulations.</p>
        
            <p>Secondary Principals' Association of New Zealand (SPANZ) president and Papatoetoe High School principal Vaughan Couillaut said many schools began phasing in the rules during term one.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say that students have been extremely compliant in the first part of term one and during the backend when we stopped the 'education' and moved into the 'implementation'.</p>
        
            <p>"People have seemed to have bought into it."</p>
        
            <p>At Papatoetoe High School, about five phone confiscations had occurred on an average day during term one, Couillaut said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not necessarily the same students, but those students are generally compliant."</p>
        
            <p>Couillaut said schools need to figure out gathering procedures, although most schools, including Papatoetoe, had opted for the "leave it in your bag" approach.</p>
        
            <p>"For a school of nearly 1800, I simply can't gather them all at the beginning of the day without eating into curriculum time."</p>
        
            <p>Another matter for school leaders throughout was around the care of students' devices, often valued at $1000-plus.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll get a bit dark and misty if a device gets lost or broken while it's confiscated and each school will negotiate that as it happens," Couillaut said.</p>
        
            <p>A pupil of Christchurch's Burnside High School that RNZ spoke to said the policy was a good move as it removed "distractions from the class".</p>
