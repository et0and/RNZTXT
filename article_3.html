            <p>Team New Zealand is top of the America's Cup preliminary regatta standings after two victories off Barcelona.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Burling's crew have actually had just one race so far, beating the British entry on Saturday (NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, their opponent Luna Rossa retired with a technical issue just after the start, while in another other race the French outfit did not even make the start line because of similar problems.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand has three points, Luna Rossa and American Magic two, Alinghi one and Britannia and France none.</p>
        
            <p>The defenders were on it right from the start against Britannia. The Kiwis tied the British up at the pre-start, forcing them off their foils in the final approaches to the start line. From there it was all one-way traffic, and the Kiwis romped to a 52-second win.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's second race, against Orient Express Racing Team (France), did not happen. The French had to retire ahead of the start with what skipper Quentin Delapierre described as a "major issue" that could not be resolved on the water.</p>
        
            <p>Delapierre confirmed they would be back for racing the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking afterwards, Blair Tuke - Team New Zealand flight controller and trimmer - was pleased but was looking at the bigger picture.</p>
        
            <p>"Well we had a great start against INEOS (Britannia), real battle there, they haven't been shy in throwing the boat around in the pre-start and we've been seeing that for a number of days now, and so we knew that was coming.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess we just got the better of them there with that last-minute double tack that we executed better, got on the inside of them and they flopped off the foils, so race over.</p>
        
            <p>"So good for us, it was a well-executed start. You know, we've come into this series really wanting to get the most out of it.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't get that many opportunities to get battle-hardened, so we are trying to get as much out of every race as we can, and we've certainly done that so far."</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand was scheduled to race Alinghi and American Magic on Sunday (NZ time).</p>
