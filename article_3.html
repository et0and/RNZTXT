            <p>After their Twenty20 series victory over Sri Lanka, the Black Caps now have a 1-0 lead over the tourists in the one-day format and can clinch that series in Hamilton on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, opener Will Young narrowly missed a century with the bat, while Matt Henry led the team with the ball, capturing 4/19, as New Zealand dismissed their opponents cheaply at Wellington's Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>The weather forecast in 'The Tron' is cloudy with a slight chance of rain, so fingers crossed we get a full day's play.</p>
