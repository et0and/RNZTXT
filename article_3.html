            <p>Oranga Tamariki has been given five new reporting instructions by the Children's Minister, including how many children in care access a social worker in a two-month period.</p>
        
            <p>How the ministry is performing across these new criteria will be publicly reported every quarter starting from the 2024/2025 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Minister Karen Chhour, in a letter to the chief executive Chappie Te Kani, said both her and New Zealanders are deeply concerned about Oranga Tamariki's performance.</p>
        
            <p>"My first and most important priority is to ensure Oranga Tamariki is relentlessly focused on the safety of children and young people in its care.</p>
        
            <p>"Too many children in the care of their family, or their caregivers, die every year in this country. It is a national disgrace," Chhour said.</p>
        
            <p>"In order to provide greater transparency about its performance, I have instructed Oranga Tamariki to report quarterly, starting from the 2024/25 financial year, on the following key performance indicators:"</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said improving Oranga Tamariki's performance starts with "good accountable leadership" but up until now there has been plenty of "finger-pointing" when there's a failure but no clarity about who is actually responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"A new approach is required. Key performance indicators and quarterly reporting, to the public, will encourage accountability and better performance in the entire organisation."</p>
