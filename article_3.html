            <p>Auckland water provider, Watercare, is defending a social media post encouraging women to take shorter showers, as other users call out the post for sexism.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Council-owned organisation made the post this afternoon, with the caption: "Ladies, we're all for showering in a fiery inferno, but 27% of your power bill is used to heat water."</p>
        
            <p>"So, let's keep it snappy to keep your wallet happy! 1 shower, 4 minutes - it's all you need #MakeEveryDropCountAKL" the post continued.</p>

            <p>The post was accompanied by a meme from the Mandalorian.</p>
        
            <p>X users, formerly Twitter, have lambasted the tweet, saying it is sexist to single out women.</p>
        
            <p>North Shore councillor Richard Hills reposted the tweet, writing: "This is sexist", and "This was not part of the water conservation strategy I asked Watercare to show me".</p>
        
            <p>1. This is sexist. 2. This makes zero sense. 3. This was not part of the water conservation strategy I asked Watercare to show me. 4. I usually love your work @watercare_nz but this is not it. 5. Deleting is probs a good idea. https://t.co/U4qIL6eujD</p>
        
            <p>One user commented, "Oh my god. Who on your social media post approved this?"</p>
        
            <p>While another wrote, "Are women the only ones to have hot showers?"</p>
        
            <p>However, Watercare has said it was part of the social media strategy targeting particular audiences.</p>
        
            <p>"From time to time, we do target particular audiences with our social media content to ensure it resonates with them," Watercare head of communications Rachel Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>"Men will not be exempt from our short shower messaging," she added.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said the post was part of a summer campaign called 'Make Every Drop Count', encouraging people to save water.</p>
        
            <p>"This particular post was inspired by a trend we'd observed on social media that claims women like their showers hotter than men," Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>Social media commentator Anna Rawhiti-Connell explained why people may be taking offence to the post.</p>
        
            <p>"First and foremost, what people are taking offence at is the assumption that is based on old-school gender stereotype about women taking longer to get ready than men.</p>
        
            <p>"The second thing they've done, is not only have they isolated one specific gender, but it's quite personal and individual, pointing the finger at individuals around their own water use."</p>
        
            <p>She said the word 'ladies' has tricky connotations, and the gender reference was unnecessary.</p>
        
            <p>"Ladies has quite an old school, rugby club feel to it. And I think women do often read that as quite a patronising term."</p>
        
            <p>Rawhiti-Connell said that the negative response may have also come from being given instructions around something personal.</p>
        
            <p>"There is something distinctly uncomfortable about a faceless brand reaching into your home like that to talk to you about something that you do when you're naked."</p>
        
            <p>The use of the meme adds to the post's sour taste, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think all of that compounds to make it a kind of awkward, cringe moment for people too."</p>
