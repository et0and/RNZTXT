            <p>The leaders of the main political parties have agreed to extend the current caretaker government arrangements - due to run out tomorrow - until a new government is formed.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, outgoing Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he agreed with Christopher Luxon that the Governor General will be advised to extend the current arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said under section 6 of the Constitution Act, current ministers must leave office at 11.59pm tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the writ has not yet been returned due to recounts, and negotiations to form a new government are progressing, the simplest solution is to roll over the current caretaker arrangements for a little bit longer," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said he had consulted with Luxon and had written to the Governor-General to advise her to reappoint the current ministry to operate in caretaker mode until the new government is appointed.</p>
        
            <p>"The reappointments will be made on the papers at about 1pm tomorrow - there will not be an appointment ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said ministers will continue in their existing portfolios, apart from Nanaia Mahuta, who will leave office on Saturday after failing to get re-elected.</p>
        
            <p>"Grant Robertson will be appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control. Willie Jackson will take over Nanaia Mahuta's delegations as Associate Minister for MƒÅori Development.</p>
        
            <p>"This solution to a constitutional quirk has been amicably agreed and we continue to consult closely with the incoming government on all key decisions," Hipkins said.</p>
