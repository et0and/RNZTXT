            <p>Five people died across Germany and a police officer was seriously injured from accidents linked to the powerful fireworks Germans traditionally set off to celebrate the new year, police said in a preliminary count.</p>
        
            <p>Germans celebrate the new year with a particularly intense usage of fireworks, which spurs a recurrent debate about outlawing the most powerful devices, given the high number of injuries each year, as well as the pollution and noise they cause.</p>
        
            <p>Some 13 law enforcement officers were injured as a result of the accidents this year, including one seriously, police spokesman, Florian Nath, said.</p>
        
            <p>Some 330 people were detained in the capital Berlin overnight, police said, adding that contrary to previous years, "there were no major violence or incidents".</p>
        
            <p>Near Paderborn in the northwest region of North Rhine-Westphalia, a 24-year-old man died after detonating a pyrotechnic rocket, according to local police, who believe the victim had made the device himself.</p>
        
            <p>In Oschatz in Saxony, a 45-year-old man died of serious head injuries when he set fire to a "pyrotechnic bomb". According to the police, it was a powerful F4 category firework, which requires a special permit to purchase.</p>
        
            <p>In the same eastern region of Saxony, a 50-year-old man died on the spot from head injuries in the town of Hartha when he tried to detonate a pyrotechnic pipe bomb, a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Near Hamburg in the north, a 20 year-old man died lighting a pyrotechnic firework.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, in Kremen near Berlin, a fifth man died from an "inappropriate manipulation" of pyrotechnics, according to local police. Three other people in the region were seriously injured in similar circumstances.</p>
