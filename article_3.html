            <p>Ex-tropical cyclone Alfred has been downgraded to a 'tropical low', according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.</p>
        
            <p>Violent winds have toppled power lines as Alfred inches towards Australia's eastern coast, swelling rivers, sparking evacuation orders and leaving about 39,000 homes without electricity.</p>
        
            <p>It crossed the islands off the coast of Queensland overnight, crawling towards the densely populated coastline at "walking speed", government forecasts said.</p>
        
            <p>No deaths have been reported, but the impacts are already being felt across southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were searching Friday night for a man who has been washed into floodwaters in northern New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Families have stocked up on essential items and have boarded their homes.</p>
        
            <p>More than 60 disaster-response personnel from New Zealand have headed to Australia to assist with the cyclone response.</p>
        
            <p>Gold Coast Pasifika community member Oketi Laurenson told Pacific Waves that the Pasifika community on Gold Coast are feeling anxious.</p>
