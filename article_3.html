            <p>A conservation group says commercial fishing changes are a win for the protection of seabirds.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 October, commercial fishers will have two options to continue fishing with surface long lines - they will have to use special hook-shielding devices, or simultaneously use three measures: bird-scaring devices, line weighting to sink hooks faster, and setting their gear at night.</p>
        
            <p>The new rules aim to protect critically threatened albatrosses and other seabirds from being caught accidentally. The existing rules only mandate two seabird mitigation measures.</p>
        
            <p>WWF New Zealand says it is welcome news, and will significantly reduce the risk of threatened seabirds getting caught in fishing nets as bycatch.</p>
        
            <p>"What's really important is that we continue rolling out the cameras on boats programme," spokesperson Caitlin Owers told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously that's kind of shone a light on the scale of the problem and the threats that our wildlife face, and we really need to be able to use that data to inform future fisheries management decisions."</p>
        
            <p>Scientific modelling, a review of the camera programme and public feedback led to the rule change.</p>
        
            <p>"It will significantly reduce one of the biggest threats they face, which is being caught as accidental by catch and fishing nets," Owers said.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's something we've been pushing for for a long time, and we're really pleased that the government's listened to the international evidence."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation and Fisheries New Zealand (part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment) will help fishers transition to the new rules.</p>
