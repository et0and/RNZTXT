            <p>St John is reminding people to stay safe in the water this summer, as families head to beaches, swimming holes, rivers and backyard pools.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, Hato Hone St John responded to 434 water incidents across the country - a 14 percent increase on the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>From December 2022 to February 2023, ambulance officers attended almost 200 - several of which were fatal.</p>
        
            <p>Topping the list of water hotspots requiring an ambulance last summer were Whangārei, Dargaville, Auckland's North Shore, Mt Maunganui, Hahei, Rotorua, Taupō, Lyttelton, Tairua and Warkworth.</p>
        
            <p>According to Water Safety New Zealand, 85 percent of drowning victims last year were male, with drownings from 'unintentional immersion' making up over 30 percent of the country's annual drowning toll for the five-year period to 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Drowning Prevention Auckland urged people to check the depth of the water and find a safe entry and exit point before they get in.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Nicola Keen-Biggelaar had advice if people find themselves in difficulty in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Float on their back as a first response using the Float First survival steps. Once their breathing is under control, they should let someone know they are in trouble by calling out or signalling with their arm."</p>
        
            <p>St John deputy chief executive - ambulance operations, Dan Ohs, said they had already seen a rise in water-related incidents as people flocked to beaches and swimming pools.</p>
        
            <p>"Our workload increases over summer, especially at popular swimming hotspots around the motu, and we want people to have fun in the water, but please know your limits and keep an eye out for whānau and friends so everyone can stay safe."</p>
        
            <p>Andy Everiss, St John district operations manager - Tāmaki Makaurau, said ambulance officers anticipated more callouts involving inflatable backyard pools.</p>
        
            <p>"This summer is anticipated to be longer, hotter and drier, and inflatable pools seem to be popular with families this year. A lot of these inflatable pools are quite big and deep, too, with high sides and ladders to get into them, so please make sure you don't take your eyes off your tamariki in and around that new inflatable pool you've bought for Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John wished everyone a safe and enjoyable summer and offered some tips on staying safe in and on the water.</p>
