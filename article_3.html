            <p>A former Destiny Church youth leader who sexually abused several young boys has been sentenced to six years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwa Hamiora-Te Hira plead guilty late last year to a number of sexual violation and indecent assault charges.</p>
        
            <p>The assaults took place over five years while Hamiora-Te Hira was working for youth programmes understood to be connected to Destiny Church.</p>
        
            <p>At the Manukau District Court on Monday, Judge Clare Bennett said the assaults appeared premeditated and were an egregious breach of trust.</p>
        
            <p>The sentencing was preceded by impact statements from six victims who described feeling betrayed by a person they believed was a role model.</p>
        
            <p>Hamiora-Te Hira's sentence of 76 months included a 25 percent discount for pleading guilty.</p>
