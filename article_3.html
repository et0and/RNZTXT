            <p>It would be nice to think Moana, the sea lion, was visiting the memorial for her great-grandmother, Mum, on The Esplanade at St Clair yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>But in reality, Department of Conservation coastal Otago biodiversity ranger Jim Fyfe said the heavily pregnant 11-year-old was just resting up in the sun, in preparation for having pups next month.</p>
        
            <p>"Moana loves hanging out around the nearby sand-sausages.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not because of the statue.</p>
        
            <p>"I've often speculated that the sea lions in the area look at the sand-sausages as giant sea lion goddesses.</p>
        
            <p>"These huge maternal-looking sand bags may be seen by the sea lions as something that is very securing and familiar."</p>
        
            <p>Fyfe said Mum was the first New Zealand sea lion to give birth on the mainland in 150 years - hence the memorial statue.</p>
        
            <p>He said Mum had a daughter named Suzie, who went on to have Teyah.</p>
        
            <p>"Moana is the youngest of Teyah's pups."</p>

            <p>At the moment, Moana and about 36 other pregnant females were moving further inland in a bid to hide from their yearling pups, which were being weaned off, so they could focus on the latest pups.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also coming up to the breeding season, so they're trying to avoid the attention of males as well.</p>
        
            <p>"In many places around the Otago coastline, we've got many females picking their favourite spots further inland.</p>
        
            <p>"So people need to be quite vigilant about them at this time of year - being in places that you wouldn't normally expect them, like tracks down to the beaches.</p>
        
            <p>"Our advice at this time of year is to keep your distance and be respectful of them.</p>
        
            <p>"If you can find a different route to bypass them, you should take it."</p>
        
            <p>Fyfe also recommended dog-walkers keep their dogs on leads from their car until they got down on to the beach to avoid any issues.</p>
        
            <p>Pupping would start about December 20 and people needed to be wary around the coastal region until the end of January, he said.</p>
