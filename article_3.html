            <p>Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill has made history after she was appointed Northern Ireland's first nationalist first minister.</p>
        
            <p>The DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly has been appointed deputy first minister.</p>
        
            <p>The return of power-sharing follows the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ending its boycott over post-Brexit trade rules.</p>
        
            <p>O'Neill told the assembly chamber it was "a historic day" which represented "a new dawn".</p>
        
            <p>Northern Ireland's devolved government was restored on Saturday - two years to the day since it collapsed.</p>
        
            <p>The DUP had boycotted devolved government for two years over post-Brexit checks on goods going between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
        
            <p>But, after striking a fresh deal with the government, they agreed to go back into power sharing.</p>
        
            <p>Under power-sharing rules, devolved government in Northern Ireland can only operate on a cross-community basis with the involvement of both unionists and nationalists.</p>
        
            <p>Similar to the cabinet at Westminster, the Northern Ireland Executive is the decision-making body for Northern Ireland and has powers to legislate on many areas.</p>
        
            <p>After O'Neill and Little-Pengelly were nominated as first and deputy first ministers, the following took up roles as ministers in the executive:</p>
        
            <p>Sinn Féin's Aisling Reilly and the DUP's Pam Cameron will serve as junior ministers in the executive office.</p>
        
            <p>The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - the fifth-largest party in the assembly, with eight assembly members - did not qualify to be part of the executive and instead has gone into opposition.</p>
        
            <p>The leader of the opposition, SDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole, said the party wanted to make the institutions "work effectively for the people of Northern Ireland".</p>
        
            <p>In the last assembly election in May 2022, Sinn Féin became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, entitling the party to nominate the first minister.</p>
        
            <p>Although the first and deputy first ministers hold a joint office and have equal power, O'Neill becoming first minister is seen a landmark moment for Irish nationalism.</p>
        
            <p>The prospect of a nationalist first minister "would have been unimaginable" to her parents' generation, O'Neill said after her appointment.</p>
        
            <p>O'Neill also said she was "sorry for all the lives lost during the conflict - without exception".</p>
        
            <p>"As first minister, I am wholeheartedly committed to continuing the work of reconciliation between all of our people."</p>
        
            <p>She added that despite her support for a united Ireland, she would "serve everyone equally" and promised inclusivity and respect for all as they "deliver and work together" as the public "rightly demands".</p>
        
            <p>"To all of you who are British and unionist - your national identity, culture and traditions are important to me," she added.</p>
