            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it is aware of reports that a New Zealand-Israeli citizen has died in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the government agency was currently seeking further details.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Herald reported that posts about the death had appeared online, with one image showing a wreath dedicated to the mother of a deceased person in Gaza who is identified to be a New Zealand citizen.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Jewish community stands together with you in this difficult time ... on the falling of your son," a tribute beside the wreath says.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
