        <h2>'Can't all be winners': Who should be recognised at school prize giving?</h2>
        <p>
It's important for children to learn how to lose well, but it doesn't mean they have not done well at school, a principal says. Audio

            <p>School prize giving season has arrived and an Auckland principal is reminding parents not every child can get an award.</p>
        
            <p>Matua Jonnie Black, the principal of Matipo Primary school in Auckland's Te Atatū Peninsula told Checkpoint, the school did get contacted by parents specifically asking for prizes to be given to their child.</p>
        
            <p>But Black said prize giving awards were not given to every student and there was a lot of different criteria for each award.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, for a sporting award we look at what a child has done for sports within the school.</p>
        
            <p>"We look at their sportsmanship, fair play, and aggregate that and figure out who the best recipient is - it's the same for academic awards."</p>
        
            <p>It was important for children to learn how to lose well, Black said, but it did not mean they had not done well at school that year.</p>
        
            <p>"We discuss the importance with children that we can't all be winners, even if parents don't discuss that with them at home, we make sure it happens here.</p>
        
            <p>"Children should be recognised for their achievements, but prize giving is for those children who do stand out."</p>
        
            <p>For parents who may be upset by their child not getting an award at prize giving, Black said to remember that was okay.</p>
        
            <p>"As a whānau always celebrate your child's success. I think it's important to still acknowledge success big or small."</p>
