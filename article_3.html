            <p>The police search for a 5-year-old autistic boy missing in the rural Hangaroa district of Gisborne is expected to resume at first light.</p>
        
            <p>The alarm was raised at 4pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has been told up to 300 people from the area joined in the search for Kaizer, supporting police and rescue teams from Wairoa and Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>It was called off around midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Family and friends of Khyzah - or Kaizer, according to police - who lives on a remote sheep and cattle station, have continued to look throughout the night.</p>

            <p>On social media, police said he was reported missing from a residential address in Tiniroto.</p>
        
            <p>"He is believed to have gone missing around 2.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>"He was wearing a green hunting and fishing long-sleeve top, a nappy, no shoes, and may be wearing black pants with skeleton bones at the front. "</p>
        
            <p>Local farmer Alex Campbell told Morning Report a missing child was every family's and every community's "worst nightmare".</p>
        
            <p>He was notified of the boy's disappearance late Sunday afternoon and there was a scramble from the local community to mobilise and search where they could into the night/</p>
        
            <p>The terrain had "everything imaginable" - including waterways, steep hills and forestry.</p>
        
            <p>It was also like "a needle in a haystack", Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>Search and rescue was back this morning and ground teams had started searching again - with every farmer in the area also out helping.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said he believed there was hope in finding the boy if he was on land.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information is asked to call 111 and reference event number P059617641.</p>
