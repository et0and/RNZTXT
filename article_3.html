        <h2>Trump suggests politician should face firing squad over foreign policy</h2>
        <p>
The former Republican senator says Trump's comment shows he is a "petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant".

            <p>Former U.S. lawmaker Liz Cheney says Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's violent comment suggesting she should face a firing squad for her foreign policy stance shows he cannot be entrusted with the White House and would target his enemies in office.</p>
        
            <p>Former President Trump, who faces Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election, called Cheney "a very dumb individual" and a "war hawk," noting that she and her father, former Republican vice president Dick Cheney, refused to back his third presidential run.</p>

            <p>"She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained to her face," Trump told supporters at a campaign event with former Fox News television host Tucker Carlson in Arizona.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has repeatedly vowed to investigate or prosecute his political rivals, including Cheney, as well as election workers, journalists and left-wing Americans, among others, and has said the military could be used against what he calls "radical left lunatics" if there is unrest on Election Day.</p>
        
            <p>One of the most high-profile Republicans to turn against Trump, Cheney has endorsed Harris in the 5 November contest, saying she crossed party lines to put the country before politics and calling Trump a "danger".</p>
        
            <p>"This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant," Cheney responded in a post on X on Friday, adding "#Womenwillnotbesilenced."</p>

            <p>Representatives for Trump's campaign could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Once one of the party's top leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives, Cheney lost her seat in Congress after backing Trump's second impeachment for his role in his supporters' 6 January, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol and then helping to lead the investigation into the attack.</p>
        
            <p>She has since campaigned with Harris, who must win over Republicans and independents - particularly in seven key U.S. swing states - in order to win.</p>
        
            <p>Democrats largely vilified Dick Cheney for his bullish defense of the Iraq War under former Republican President George W. Bush but warmly embraced him at a congressional commemoration one year after the 6 January attack. Bush does not plan to make an endorsement in the race.</p>
