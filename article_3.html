            <p>One of Northland's most notorious criminals will spend at least another year in jail after being denied parole for the eighth time.</p>
        
            <p>Keith Anthony McEwen was sentenced to preventive detention in 2007 for the abduction of a Dutch couple on their honeymoon, and the "cruel and sadistic" rape of the female tourist.</p>
        
            <p>The honeymooners had been sleeping in their van at Haruru Falls, near Paihia, when McEwen and an accomplice forced their way into the vehicle, threatened the couple with a shotgun, and demanded money.</p>
        
            <p>The victims were then subjected to a nightmarish ordeal as McEwen raped the woman and drove the bound couple around Northland, while he and his co-offender stopped at ATMs withdrawing money from their account.</p>
        
            <p>McEwen was arrested after a major police investigation. He pleaded guilty to rape, unlawful sexual connection, kidnapping, attempted stupefaction, and aggravated robbery.</p>
        
            <p>The case sent shock waves through New Zealand and the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday McEwen appeared before the Parole Board for the eighth time since 2017, with discussions focussing on a "relapse" in July last year when McEwen failed a drugs test after taking part in a release to work programme.</p>
        
            <p>The test detected the presence of methamphetamine, ecstasy and cannabis.</p>
        
            <p>McEwen's counsel said one-one-one sessions with a psychologist since the positive drug test had been "very successful", and he was a "compliant, model prisoner" who had not been disruptive for more than 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>He had also completed an adult sex offender course.</p>
        
            <p>Board member Dr Jeremy Skipworth was concerned, however, by the positive drug test, given that McEwen was using a form of methamphetamine at the time of the offending against the Dutch tourists.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disappointing that none of the previous treatment you've had, had any effect on your decision-making at that point."</p>
        
            <p>Skipworth was also concerned by what he regarded as McEwen's "flippant" responses.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't inspire confidence that you've given serious thought to what was a very serious lapse that's relevant to your risk."</p>
        
            <p>McEwen said he made no excuses for his drug taking.</p>
        
            <p>"I just had a weak moment, everybody was into it â€¦ I made a poor decision and I'm paying the consequences for it now."</p>
        
            <p>He said he no longer posed a danger to the public.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have harm in me any more. I might be a little silly, but to [do]harm to people again, that's not in me."</p>
        
            <p>The board declined parole and set a date of April 2025 for McEwen's next hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Board member Paul Elenio said McEwen's one-on-one sessions with a psychologist should continue, and ordered more re-integration training given that he had failed a drugs test both times he had been put on a release to work programme.</p>
        
            <p>"The board has been concerned about the rather dismissive way you've talked about the positive drugs test. We take these things very seriously," Elenio said.</p>
        
            <p>During McEwen's sentencing in 2007, Justice Tony Randerson said his sexual offending was ''cruel and sadistic in the extreme''.</p>
        
            <p>What should have been an exciting adventure in New Zealand for the Dutch tourists instead turned into a nightmare, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to imagine the horror you've perpetrated on this couple while they should have been enjoying their honeymoon. You've shattered their lives,'' Justice Randerson said.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the offending McEwen was not long out of prison for stealing irreplaceable jewellery, coins and relics from the Shipwreck Museum at Waitangi in 2000.</p>
        
            <p>The treasure had been recovered from shipwrecks such as the Elingamite, which sank at the Three Kings Islands in 1902, by the late Kelly Tarlton.</p>
        
            <p>The treasure, estimated to be worth $300,000, has never been recovered.</p>
