            <p>Pop star Dua Lipa is making a return to New Zealand for the first time since 2022 as part of a global tour.</p>
        
            <p>The three-time Grammy Award winner is set to come to Auckland's Spark Arena on 2 April 2025 for her Radical Optimism Tour.</p>
        
            <p>She will also play two shows in Australia during the 40-date tour.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old's third studio album, Radical Optimism, debuted on top of the UK Albums Chart and the Billboard's Top Album Sales chart. It peaked at number two on the New Zealand music charts.</p>
        
            <p>It became the biggest album debut from a UK artist in 2024 and garnered the highest week one sales from a UK female artist since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>It included hit singles 'Houdini', which topped Billboard's Dance/Electronic chart for 17 weeks, 'Training Season', and 'Illusion'.</p>
        
            <p>The 'New Rules' hitmaker also embarked on a short tour of arenas in Europe and headlined at Glastonbury.</p>
        
            <p>Her first solo stage in New Zealand, during her 2022 Future Nostalgia Tour, sold out quickly. She was also a special guest for Bruno Mars' Australia and New Zealand shows in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Tickets go on sale Friday 20 September at dualipa.com, and a presale is also available for fans who sign up.</p>
