            <p>Audrey Sonerson has been appointed the new Director-General of Health and Ministry of Health chief executive, a role she will hold for five years from 7 April.</p>
        
            <p>Her appointment follows the resignation of Diana Sarfati in February.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Public Service Commissioner Heather Baggott said Sonerson was a " trusted and respected public service leader with a track record of delivery and working effectively with ministers".</p>
        
            <p>"I have no doubt her leadership and skills are what the ministry needs right now. I am confident Ms Sonerson will quickly get on top of the presenting challenges. She has strong financial acumen and a relentless focus on efficiency, effectiveness and performance."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Sarfati said it was time to allow someone new to take up the mantle of "one of the most challenging and rewarding roles within the health sector".</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Commission said any delay in appointing someone to the position "could risk the Ministry of Health falling behind the reform programme, which would impact New Zealanders accessing the health system".</p>
        
            <p>Sonerson has been Acting Director-General of Health since 21 February and prior to that was Ministry of Transport chief executive and secretary of transport and chief executive since December 2022.</p>
        
            <p>She has previously held chief executive roles at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was deputy commissioner (Resource Management) at New Zealand Police and held two deputy chief executive roles at the Ministry of Justice.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2002 and 2012, Sonerson held a number of roles at The Treasury.</p>
