            <p>A cheesemaker from Scotland thinks he might have created the world's stinkiest cheese.</p>
        
            <p>The Minger - as it's been called - is a soft rind cheese created by professional cheesemaker Rory Stone.</p>
        
            <p>He describes the stinky cheese as being "brutal on the nose" but with a "gentle taste".</p>
        
            <p>But, he acknowledges it's not for everyone: "For some people, it's just too much; it's too smelly and they don't want it in the house."</p>
        
            <p>Stone and his family have been making cheese for more than 50 years, at their company in the Highlands of Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>He first invented the pungent cheese back in 2017 "We decided to go with the name 'Minger' instead of something fancy."</p>
        
            <p>"Some big supermarkets loved the product but wanted us to change the name.</p>
        
            <p>"We said 'no'. It's a minger - it's minging."</p>

            <p>The word 'ming' comes from the old Scottish English word for a bad smell, so if something is 'minging' it means it is 'smelly'. Nowadays it can also mean something is gross or ugly, or not very good.</p>
        
            <p>Although Stone can't say for sure that his cheese is the smelliest in the world, he thinks it's up there with the stinkiest of them.</p>
        
            <p>For shoppers worried about the pongy cheese in supermarkets, Stone said: "It's well sealed. So if you're just passing it in stores, you won't get the full effect.</p>
        
            <p>"But if you take it home and put it in the fridge, within half an hour it'll take over the room," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A pungent aroma of welly boot", according to Stone.</p>
        
            <p>He says if you smell farmer's wellies after they've spent a summer in them, it's a bit like that, because the bacteria used to make the cheese likes hot, dry places.</p>
        
            <p>For some people, it's "just too much" he says; it's too smelly and they don't want it in the house.</p>
