            <p>The police have stopped referring people to Destiny Church's Man Up and Legacy programmes after members had disrupted a number of events at the Auckland Pride Festival last month.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses had reported about 30 people were barricaded into a room in Te Atatū's library after men wearing 'Man Up' t-shirts had interrupted an event hosted by a drag king, who read a book to children about how rainbows are made, with costumes inspired by the sun, clouds and rain.</p>
        
            <p>Both the Man Up and Legacy programmes were part of the police's AWHI programme: a tikanga-based voluntary referral system used as a prevention tool to connect a person needing help with an appropriate service provider in their community.</p>
        
            <p>The programme is aimed at helping to prevent people from offending, reoffending, or becoming victims of crime or harm.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the police said it had undertaken a review to understand what referrals may have been made to either Man Up or Legacy programmes, which are affiliated with Destiny Church, following on from family harm-related events.</p>
        
            <p>"Both providers have now been removed from our AWHI system, and no further referrals will be made.</p>
        
            <p>"Police is committed to serving all our diverse communities, and we will now engage in a process to find replacement providers where required."</p>
        
            <p>In response, Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki said Man Up and Legacy restored families and broke cycles of crime, violence, and addiction.</p>
        
            <p>He said the police should work with them, not bow to political pressure.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki said there was "no investigation, no charges, no wrongdoing".</p>
