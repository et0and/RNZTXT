            <p>Long after his NZ Warriors teammates disappeared into the Mt Smart night, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad remains, sweeping out the locker room.</p>
        
            <p>The veteran fullback has just played a starring role in his 50th appearance for the Auckland NRL club, inspiring them to a hard-fought 14-6 win over perennial powerhouse Sydney Roosters at Go Media Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>He has run 30 times for 316 metres - 96 of them after contact and 73 on kick returns - broken seven tackles and assisted on both centre Ali Leiataua's tries.</p>
        
            <p>That's not a bad night of footy, but clearly, his contribution does not end at the final siren.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a journey," Nicoll-Klokstad, 29, admitted.</p>
        
            <p>"Happy to get 50 for the club, but more importantly the win."</p>
        
            <p>Seven years ago, he never thought he would reach a half-century of games for his hometown team.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, after suiting up seven times in his 2017 debut season, he could not crack the first-grade line-up at all the following season and was granted an early release to take up an opportunity with the Canberra Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>Trapped behind an all-star back three of fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, and towering wingers David Fusitu'a and Ken Maumalo, Nicoll-Klokstad could see his development stagnating at the club.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember playing my first game, looking up at the 300-game Warriors board and seeing Simon [Mannering]," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to be that guy, but that changed.</p>
        
            <p>"I went to the Raiders and thought I'd spend the rest of my career there, and now I'm back home."</p>
        
            <p>After 66 games for Canberra, his return to Auckland coincided with Tuivasa-Sheck's switch to rugby, but after a season, his friend and rival was back in the mix.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Andrew Webster has persisted with Nicoll-Klokstad in the No1 jersey, experimenting with RTS in the centres - where he had played for the All Blacks - and adding a sprinkle of Taine Tuaupiki whenever needed.</p>
        
            <p>After being squeezed out the first time, he's had to withstand calls from fans and media for Tuivasa-Sheck to return to the position where he won his Dally M Medal, while Tuaupiki continues to impress whenever he gets an opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more important to dive into your own game and what you do well, and that's what I've been doing really," Nicoll-Klokstad said.</p>
        
            <p>"I really enjoy having both those boys in the team and what they bring is different to what I bring to the team - I've just got to back what I'm bringing at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>An unfortunate, but timely pre-season injury to winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak has seen the trio of would-be fullbacks out on the field together so far this season, with each enjoying moments of brilliance.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very cool," Nicoll-Klokstad agreed.</p>
        
            <p>"I get on very well with both Taine and Roge, so it's nice."</p>
        
            <p>Amid all his stats on this occasion, his own most valuable moment probably came in the build-up to Chanel Harris-Tavita's go-ahead try.</p>
        
            <p>At the start of that set, Nicoll-Klokstad stayed down, suffering the effects of an apparent crusher tackle that went unpunished by referee Ashley Klein. Eventually, back on his feet, he popped up again a couple of tackles later for a telling run over halfway that gave his team momentum.</p>
        
            <p>The rest is history. Tuaupiki teased his markers a little on the right edge before Harris-Tavita put up a marginal chip-kick that he chased and claimed himself to plunge over for the try.</p>
        
            <p>Tuivasa-Sheck's big moment came 10 minutes earlier, when he made a despairing cover tackle that tipped Roosters flyer Dom Young into touch just short of the corner flag, then limped off with a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>Webster later revealed RTS had damaged the muscle a couple of plays earlier, but they could not sub him off quickly enough, as Sydney roared onto attack.</p>
        
            <p>"I was wondering why he hadn't dropped back for what we call 'pendulum' for our backfield stuff, then I got the gist that he might be injured," Nicoll-Klokstad admitted.</p>
        
            <p>"For him to stick out there and make a try-saving play like that… that's a game-winning play right there.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the type of athlete Roger is and to be able to rub shoulders with him in the same side is pretty special. He's a special player."</p>
        
            <p>Defeating the Roosters holds special significance and a certain symmetry for Nicoll-Klokstad. The result ended an eight-year drought for the Warriors against Sydney at Mt Smart - their 14-13 win in 2017 was his debut game for the club.</p>
        
            <p>"That's funny," he reflected.</p>
        
            <p>"My debut game we beat them and my 50th game - that's cool.</p>
        
            <p>"That was the first time since I've been back at the club in 2023 that we've beaten the Roosters.</p>
        
            <p>"They're always going to be a tough team, they're physical and they're always a top-four championship team, so we always know what they're going to bring."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors would do well to keep their humble fullback around for another 50 games to take full advantage of the good karma he brings to the locker room.</p>
