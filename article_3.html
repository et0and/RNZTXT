        <p>

            <p>The Desert Road between Turangi and Waiouru will close for two months over summer for repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi says because of the freezing temperatures, the section of State Highway 1 needs to be shut over the busy summer period from 6 January until the end of February.</p>
        
            <p>The repairs include rebuilding nearly 16 kilometres of road and replacing the deck of the Mangatoetoenui Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Detours are likely to take drivers around the Western side of Tongariro National Park and add about 40 minutes to their journey.</p>
        
            <p>Regional manager of operations and maintenance Roger Brady told Nine to Noon: "I acknowledge it's going to be hugely inconvenient for that period."</p>
        
            <p>Brady said the materials roading crews used didn't like cold weather so there was a small window to carry out the work at a warmer time of year.</p>
        
            <p>In effect, the work involved rebuilding the worst sections of the highway. It was part of the government's push to be "more efficient and effective in the way that we do things".</p>
        
            <p>"To remove the risk of potholes for years to come we've actually got to completly rebuild the road."</p>
        
            <p>It would be especially challenging for truck companies, however, the work was being done in part so the road would be better placed to handle the demands of heavy traffic.</p>
        
            <p>"The freight companies have been accepting and we appreciate it."</p>
        
            <p>There would be "soft closures" at each end to allow the likes of farmers, Fonterra and others to go about their business.</p>
        
            <p>It is part of a wider project - the SH1 TÄ«rau to Waiouru maintenance project which Waka Kotahi describes as one of the largest and most ambitious maintenance projects undertaken in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Accelerated maintenance will take place over a 16-month period.</p>
