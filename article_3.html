            <p>The number of benefits that were cut more than doubled in the September quarter compared to the same time last year, mainly due to missed appointments.</p>
        
            <p>Quarterly data from the Ministry of Social Development shows the number of sanctions issued in the latest quarter rose 133 percent to 14,409, compared with 6177 in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>It was also more than before the pandemic. The September 2019 quarter had about 4000 fewer cuts to benefits.</p>
        
            <p>MSD data showed the main reasons for the sanctions were people not attending appointments and to a lesser degree, failing to prepare for work.</p>
        
            <p>The quarter included a change to the traffic light system in August. That alerts people when they are not meeting their work obligations.</p>
        
            <p>A sanction is a reduction in a person's benefit as a result of not fulfilling work obligations.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Social Development Minister Louise Upston said monthly data showing a drop in sanctions from August to September this year indicated more beneficiaries were doing what was required of them.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was encouraging to see a decrease in the number of failures to meet obligations.</p>
        
            <p>With just one full calendar month of data, it was not possible to track trends or draw conclusions, with the traffic light system having taken effect on 12 August.</p>
        
            <p>The September quarter data showed there were 391,224 people on a main benefit, eight percent more than the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>Of those, 204,765 people were receiving Jobseeker Support, up 23,256 or 12.8 percent when compared to September 2023.</p>
