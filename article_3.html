        <h2>'The epitome of Wellington on a good day'</h2>
        <p>
And it's set to continue for the rest of the week.
</p>
        
            <p>After a shocking start to summer the capital's residents feel the season has finally arrived, with Tuesday shaping up to be a scorcher.</p>
        
            <p>While other parts of the country were ducking for cover Sam Boland said the capital was experiencing "the epitome of Wellington on good day".</p>
        
            <p>She, along with her two kids and their nana, were joining the hoards of people (not required back in the office) on Wellington's waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no wind, and it's going to be a glorious 25 degrees. We've just got to make sure we've got sunscreen on the children. It's going to be a scorcher."</p>
        
            <p>Nana Jenny Boland said after the wintry weather at the start of the month - "you couldn't go anywhere ... just the pits" - she was loving the chance to spend the day outside with her grandkids.</p>

            <p>And she wasn't the only one.</p>
        
            <p>At Oriental Bay public policy masters students Zelda Hepozdil and Hie Tran were bunking off to make the most of the summer weather.</p>
        
            <p>"After the past couple of weeks it's a feeling of 'finally'. That's why I'm at the beach, because normally I would be doing assignments."</p>

            <p>Around the corner at Freyberg Beach Gavan Riley was "basking" in the windless day, while Daryll Tibbitts said the weather had inspired him to bring his granddaughter into the city from Tawa.</p>
        
            <p>"This is primo. It's about time. Wellington hasn't had such good weather.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought let's go to the beach today. It's so beautiful."</p>

            <p>Although Monday's Wellington Anniversary Day was still 10 degrees lower than last year's record 29 degree high, the bluebird day was exactly what hobby photographer Adnan Rao had been waiting for.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's be honest, they say summer's here, but it wasn't really.</p>

            <p>"So, I've been waiting on these good days that everybody talks about ... and it just happened to be the national day for Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>In a 15 minute window on Monday, he managed to get his drone into the air above the iconic water fountain at Oriental Bay, and not only capture the city at its best, but also a seagull "who photobombed the moment".</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said the capital's good weather was set to continue for the rest of the week and into the weekend.</p>

            <p>She said while a southerly wind would bring cooler temperatures on Friday, a change to the north on Saturday and Sunday would see the mercury back in the 20s.</p>
