            <p>The Black Caps will need to chase down an imposing 218 runs posted by Sri Lanka in their innings in their third T20 match.</p>
        
            <p>NZ are looking to make it three from three and a winning start to the New Year against Sri Lanka, as they come off a commanding couple of wins at Bay Oval, but will have to overcome Sri Lanka's 218/5.</p>
        
            <p>A moment of silence was held with players and police officers before the match following the death of long-serving Nelson police officer Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming.</p>
