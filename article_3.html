            <p>Just hours after Police Minister Mark Mitchell was forced to correct the record in Parliament, the Prime Minister has had to do the same.</p>
        
            <p>During Question Time on Wednesday, Christopher Luxon was answering questions from Green Party co-leader James Shaw on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ruling that Israel must prevent acts of genocide in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>"What actions is the government taking to meet its obligations under Article 1 of the Genocide Convention in light of the recent ruling by the ICJ that found a plausible risk of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza?" Shaw asked.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a provisional finding, and it wasn't a plausible risk," Luxon responded.</p>
        
            <p>A number of MPs can be heard saying "yes it was" to Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>"Go read it, Chris. Have a read," said Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson.</p>
        
            <p>Later, Luxon rose again, seeking leave to correct his answer.</p>
        
            <p>"I said that there wasn't a plausible risk. What I should have said is that the court was not required to determine whether Israel had actually breached its obligations under the genocide convention.</p>
        
            <p>"Therefore, the court did not make any findings that Israel has actually engaged in genocidal conduct. However, the court found that there is a plausible case that Israel's conduct in Gaza may breach its obligations under the genocide convention. That will be the subject of a full and substantive hearing in the International Court of Justice."</p>
