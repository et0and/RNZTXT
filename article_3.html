            <p>A Rotorua holiday park manager wants the council to clamp down on freedom camping rules, saying users do not support local business.</p>
        
            <p>Users of one site claim otherwise and have detailed how they abide by rules and spend money on seeing the sights, shopping for food, and visiting local attractions.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua's All Seasons Holiday Park manager Tracie Thornborough spoke to Rotorua Lakes Council members at a meeting on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In her view, freedom campers did not support local businesses, and she wanted the council to do as others had in making efforts to ensure such tourists complied with the rules.</p>
        
            <p>Thornborough told councillors Rotorua has nine commercial holiday parks and eight freedom camping spots within 25 minutes of travel of each other.</p>
        
            <p>"These spots are not supporting local businesses as such, and there aren't just homeless living there."</p>
        
            <p>She did not believe freedom campers spent money in town, on small businesses, or on tourism, and said they negatively impacted the country's "clean green" image.</p>
        
            <p>While holiday parks paid "tens of thousands" in fees to the council to operate, she said freedom camping spots meant such businesses were bypassed.</p>
        
            <p>Guests staying at holiday parks felt safe, she said, and they acted as an i-site, "by telling them all the amazing things they can do in our beautiful town".</p>
        
            <p>Thornborough's view was that those guests then stayed longer and spent more money, which was aided by her park offering a third night free.</p>
        
            <p>She claimed some travellers never ventured into town from the freedom camping spots and said vans parked up at the Hamurana site didn't move for days.</p>
        
            <p>Thornborough looked at three spots on Tuesday night and counted 37 campers.</p>
        
            <p>While the rules were to stay for no more than two nights, she did not believe the council was moving freedom campers on as it would have to pay a callout fee and the parks and reserves team did not work after 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>She believed the council should also ensure only certified self-contained vehicles stayed, as other councils had.</p>
        
            <p>"If [the] council want to make the rules then they should abide by them."</p>
        
            <p>In her view, it should be a user-pays system and there should be no freedom camping spots "in a tourism destination".</p>
        
            <p>"They shouldn't travel over and stay for free."</p>
        
            <p>The council allows overnight parking at six council sites for two nights in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Only two are free, including the Hamurana site which has 10 spots for self-contained vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesman said active enforcement required considerable resourcing and therefore cost, and campers were often gone when it did get there after receiving a complaint.</p>
        
            <p>"If still there, people are spoken to, informed of available holiday parks and camping areas and moved on."</p>
        
            <p>There is a rural callout fee which is charged by a security firm. Inner-city callouts are covered by its Safe City Teams which operates until 10pm, and that will extend to 2am in summer.</p>
        
            <p>There are fewer than 100 car parks across all sites.</p>
        
            <p>Local Democracy Reporting visited the Hamurana camping site on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Among the overnight visitors were backpackers Dora Misek, from Croatia, and Dick Voorend, from the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua was the last stop in an 11-month trip around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Misek said she understood Thornborough's position, and said there were pluses and minuses to freedom camping sites.</p>
        
            <p>She believed most people respected the rules, including leaving things clean and tidy. From what residents had told her on walks, it was locals who left freedom camping spots untidy.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking about how freedom campers tended to spend money, she said it depended on where the sites were.</p>
        
            <p>For instance, the Hamurana site was opposite the springs, which the couple would pay to visit that morning.</p>
        
            <p>They rafted the Kaituna River the day before with a local operator.</p>
        
            <p>Voorend said they visit bars and restaurants near the sites they stayed at.</p>

            <p>Misek suggested a donation box be left at the sites to help pay for things such as maintaining the toilet facilities, and said if everyone put in $2 it would quickly add up.</p>
        
            <p>Across the car park were German backpackers Konstantin Barta and Sebastian Rosta.</p>
        
            <p>It was their first full day in the district and they were looking at local sights and considering going to Luge Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>The day before they had visited Kuirau Park, shopped in town, bought groceries and ate lunch at a Chinese restaurant.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's such a great opportunity to have these places.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see it's not messy. I've not seen any trash at any of these places," Barta said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had not stayed at one site longer than two nights.</p>
        
            <p>Rosta thought a donation box made sense.</p>
        
            <p>"Donate to this place and help keep it clean with that little amount of money."</p>
        
            <p>He thought the two-night rule made sense to allow other campers to use the space too, and did not believe many overstayed.</p>
        
            <p>The government is receiving submissions until 1 November on extending the freedom camping transitional period beyond June 2025 for privately owned, self-contained vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>A transition period will enable the existing self-containment certification requirements, known as a blue warrant, to be phased out and eventually replaced with the new requirements, known as a green warrant.</p>
        
            <p>These were issued for those certified after 7 June this year, and from 7 June, 2025, all vehicles will need to be certified with a green warrant under the new requirements, which include needing a fixed toilet as opposed to a portable one.</p>
