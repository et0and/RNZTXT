            <p>A Mongrel Mob member has been charged for displaying a gang sign on the dashboard of his car overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The new gang patch law came into force at midnight. The first person under the ban was caught at 12.03am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a Napier man, who was 51, had been issued with a summons to appear in court after officers spotted a large Mongrel Mob sign on the dashboard of his car in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>The sign was confiscated.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>New Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said the charging of a man overnight went "fine".</p>
        
            <p>Chambers was announced for the top job on Wednesday, and starts on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report there were no other incidents under the new legislation that he knew about.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, as time goes on, I would expect there to be more."</p>
        
            <p>When officers pulled over the car in Hastings, the man was not wearing a patch, Chambers said. But he said the man did have the sign on his dashboard which was against the new law.</p>
        
            <p>It was handled "fine, very professional, no issues at all," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell told Morning Report gang members, he believed from the Mongrel Mob, came out to test the law.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming out and trying to be defiant at midnight with a display of gang patch insignia and action was taken."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell was adamant the law would make the public and police officers safer.</p>
        
            <p>He said people criticising the law were "gang apologists".</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell believed similar laws were working in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to start using enforcement to clamp down on gangs and make it much more difficult to be a violent gang member in this country."</p>
        
            <p>Police officers support the new law banning gang patches, which came into force today, their union says.</p>
        
            <p>A new gang patch ban, as well as dispersal and non-consorting laws, took effect Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>People caught displaying gang insignia in public from today will be liable for a $5000 fine or up to six months imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association vice president Steve Watt told Morning Report an education and engagement programme with gangs had begun last month.</p>
        
            <p>"We're reasonably confident the police have got the resources in place, the process in place.</p>
        
            <p>"We are backing this legislation and ready to enforce it," Watt said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers supported anything that would disrupt gangs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>And he believed the legislation would make New Zealanders feel, and be, safer.</p>
        
            <p>Labour deputy leader Carmel Sepuloni told First Up the ban would not result in less gang members.</p>
        
            <p>"Fundamentally it's not going to change the situation with regards to gangs, so I think this is all just theatrics from the government trying to look tough on crime, the reality is it won't affect the reasons why people get into gangs."</p>
        
            <p>She saw some people with gang patches at the hīkoi on Tuesday and wondered what police would have done in that situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It could have been really harmful for everyone."</p>
