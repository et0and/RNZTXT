            <p>The New Zealand Agricultural Show in Christchurch will be cancelled this year because organisers say it's not financially viable.</p>
        
            <p>The Show has been held annually by the Canterbury A&P Association at the showgrounds in Christchurch each November since 1863.</p>
        
            <p>Association board chair Stewart Mitchell said it was sad news and the show's current business model was under review.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said twelve months of costs but only three days of revenue was not a good model by anyone's standards.</p>
        
            <p>He said livestock judging and competitions would still be held without the public crowd, as was the case in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic.</p>
