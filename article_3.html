            <p>Christchurch City Council chief executive Dawn Baxendale has resigned.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch City Council has released a statement saying Baxendale is leaving before her contract expires for personal reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Baxendale tendered her resignation last Monday, and the council accepted it at an unexpected closed door meeting last week.</p>
        
            <p>She started in the role late-2019 after undertaking the same role at the Birmingham council in Britain.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in November, Christchurch mayor Phil Mauger and Baxendale apologised for the way council handled the response to the stench caused by the Bromley wastewater treatment plant fire.</p>
        
            <p>An independent review of the council's response and recovery of the event, released last month, showed the council's response was substandard, particularly around addressing welfare concerns for affected residents.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
