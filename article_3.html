            <p>A large vegetation fire in Whangārei Heads in Northland has triggered Fire and Emergency response.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuations are underway for a number of homes nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were called shortly after 2pm Thursday to the blaze on Whangārei Heads Road between Onerahi and Tamaterau.</p>
        
            <p>Ten trucks and four helicopters are in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's Northland District manager Wipari Henwood says a number of houses are being evacuated, and crews are undertaking a reconnaissance flight to confirm how many structures are at risk.</p>
        
            <p>He says the fire is burning in a "problematic area", with numerous access points.</p>
        
            <p>Northland Fire and Emergency says if you have not been told to evacuate, but feel unsafe, please self-evacuate if you are able to.</p>
        
            <p>It has advised people affected by the smoke to close windows and doors and reduce outdoor exercise. Air conditioning should be switched to 'recirculate' or turned off and pets should be kept inside with clean food and water.</p>

            <p>A large amount of smoke can be seen at Whangārei Heads. A resident in the area says it is smoky.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident said the fire was scary and bigger than she had seen in previous years.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who did not want to be named, lives about a kilometre from the fire.</p>
        
            <p>She said she could see flames and several helicopters pouring buckets of water onto the fire.</p>
        
            <p>They have had bush fires previously, she said, but not at the scale she has seen today.</p>

            <p>Ryan Houbar lives near Whangārei's port and said the smoke from the fire had been drifting over from across the harbour and was visible from where he was at Port Nikau.</p>
        
            <p>"There's this big plume of smoke coming off it and it's coming down through where we are down at the port and it looks like quite a large fire. We can definitely smell it all down here and it's getting pretty hazy down here."</p>
        
            <p>The weather has been mostly dry for a couple of weeks, with all but a few instances of light showers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Doherty, a church deacon in Onerahi, said he was one of about a dozen people at a lookout at the end of the Whangārei Airport runway.</p>
        
            <p>From there they could look directly across the water to the fire at Waikaraka.</p>
        
            <p>He could see several helicopters at work, scooping water from the harbour and dumping it on the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"There's smoke billowing all across the airport, and down the other side of the harbour towards Oakleigh. It seems to be less intense than it was, which is a good sign."</p>
        
            <p>Through the haze he could see a number of homes on the hillside but they did not appear to be in immediate danger.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei District Council says Whangārei Heads Road is closed at the Beach Road intersection and motorists should use Mt Tiger Road to access Whangārei Heads.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
