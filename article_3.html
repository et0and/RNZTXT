            <p>A woman has died and another remains in a serious condition after a lightning strike hit a tree south of Sydney on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to a home on Old Razorback Road in Cawdor following reports two people were hit by fragments of a tree.</p>
        
            <p>Rosanna Hashem was treated at the scene, however she could not be revived.</p>
        
            <p>A second woman, also aged in her 40s, was treated by paramedics and taken to Liverpool Hospital, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Hashem, who owned cat grooming service The Groomery, died a day before her 44th birthday, according to a post on fundraising site GoFundMe.</p>
        
            <p>She has been described as a "devoted wife, a loving mother to four beautiful boys, and a passionate business owner."</p>
        
            <p>"Our beloved Rosanna Hashem was tragically taken from us in an unforeseen lightning incident on her property," Jemma from The Groomery said.</p>
        
            <p>"This devastating loss has left a profound void in the hearts of all who knew and loved her."</p>
        
            <p>In the company's online tribute she was remembered as the "heart and foundation" of the business whose "care, laughter, and kindness brought people together".</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past five years, she and her team poured their hearts into building a warm and trusted community, and her absence leaves an immeasurable void," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Tepra Woodward, a colleague from another business wrote on social media that her thoughts were with the team and Hashem's family.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a lovely member of the grooming community and will be missed," Woodward said.</p>

            <p>Customers shared the shock at the news of her death, paying tribute to her love of cats and how it came through in the dedication to her work, with many leaving messages on behalf of their pets.</p>
        
            <p>"Stormy and Raffles will miss her gentle, loving touch," one wrote, while another said: "Tiger and figher will miss your cuddle".</p>
        
            <p>Doreen Datta called Hashem a "cat whisperer".</p>
        
            <p>"Heaven has gained another angel ... Apollo will miss you immensely Rosanna. Rest in love," Datta said.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector David Kynaston from NSW Ambulance described the woman's death as a "freak incident".</p>
        
            <p>"Both women were sat 6 metres from a large tree, and this has been struck by a lightning bolt, which literally caused the tree to explode, sending debris all over the place," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a very traumatic and tragic incident for the family involved but also very confronting for emergency services."</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Kynaston said the incident was witnessed by young children.</p>
        
            <p>A report will be prepared for the coroner.</p>
