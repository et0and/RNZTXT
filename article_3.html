            <p>A 50-year-old Auckland man has been slapped with a $600 infringement after attempting to "body slam" an orca.</p>
        
            <p>A video shared to Instagram in February, and reported to the Department of Conservation, showed a man jump from a boat into the sea off the coast of Devonport near two orca.</p>
        
            <p>DOC principal investigation officer Hayden Loper said it displayed a shocking and stupid attitude to protected marine mammals.</p>
        
            <p>"The video left us genuinely stunned," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As well as the initial attempt to dive onto the animal, the man stays in the water and then swims toward it again in a second attempt to touch it."</p>
        
            <p>Loper said it was "extremely irresponsible".</p>
        
            <p>"This is stupid behaviour and demonstrates a shocking disregard for the welfare of the orca.</p>
        
            <p>"Orca are immensely powerful animals, and this really could have ended horribly - with either the startled whale being injured, or the man responsible being harmed by the aggravated animal.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very clear breach of the Marine Mammals Protection Act. Orca are classified as whales under conservation legislation and it is illegal to swim with, disturb or harass any marine mammal."</p>
        
            <p>Loper urged social media users to continue alerting DOC to content they believe breaches legislation protecting New Zealand wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the third case in recent years in which social media content has led to a successful prosecution for DOC and we greatly appreciate the tip-offs we get from the public," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who sees an incident they believe may breach conservation legislation can call 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 468).</p>
