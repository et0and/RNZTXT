            <p>Police have been hunting for a man who escaped custody in Taupō Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>Samir Derek Belhajjam, 30, fled from a police transport vehicle that was at a court building on Story Place on Monday about 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing green prison-issue shorts and T-shirt and an orange hi-vis vest at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The public have been asked not to approach Belhajjam, but to call 111 immediately if they see him.</p>
        
            <p>Police say he now faces a charge of escaping from custody.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō mayor David Trewavas told Morning Report everyone needed to be vigilant.</p>
        
            <p>People should check their garden sheds and backyards, Trewavas said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a big boat harbour, big marina there so there's all sorts of possibilities."</p>
        
            <p>Business was normal in the CBD Tuesday morning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Belhajjam is the second person to escape custody in the Waikato region in the last three weeks, after a prisoner climbed down a wall at Waikato Hospital in Hamilton on 23 December.</p>
        
            <p>That person was located.</p>
