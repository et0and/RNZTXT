            <p>In a heartfelt and community-focused event, All Blacks star Ardie Savea, returning from the USA, officially announced his move to Moana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>The 84 caps-and-counting for the men-in-black vice-captain, Savea admitted that the decision to sign for the franchise made up of Pasifika heritage players was made easier "with the help and guidance of God, and in wise people around me".</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty special to press the send button once I did announce it, to be able to represent my people, the culture," the number 8 said at a news conference in Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The event was attended by students from Tamaki College and Otahuhu College as well as Pacific media organisations and reporters. It was an intimate announcement, Savea specifically invited them, prioritising working with these kids, just like Ma'a Nonu did.</p>
        
            <p>"In my heart it's time to give back and be around the brothers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Savea has captained the All Blacks at the 2023 Rugby World Cup and in their historic 100th Test against the Springboks in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he will make the switch to play for Manu Samoa, Savea said that this is the closest he will get as he is on a journey learning about his own Pacific culture and roots.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish but I won't be able to because I obviously signed with New Zealand Rugby to 2027, and by that time I'll be 33, 34, so my legs will be old.</p>
        
            <p>"But my heart is I've always wanted to come…if I switch teams not come when I finished my career. I wanted to come when I'm still good. Even though I can't represent Samoa, I feel like Moana is my Samoa so I'm going to give it everything.</p>

            <p>"I'm gonna give it everything to be better to grow, to learn, get uncomfortable…to try to have a good next couple of years."</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika chairman and former All Black Laauili Sir Michael Jones said they wanted this movement to be bigger than rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always been about that, that's always been their why and they want to see young men and women in their community not only fulfill dreams but also to fullfill their God given potential in life and out there, whether that's education, journalism, business, politics, we're interested in, this is why we do what we do."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Laauli Tana Umaga said bringing a team specifically for Pacific Islands players "all the way from the front to the back" in a professionally led environment has taken a while to get started.</p>
        
            <p>"Not just for us now but to lay a path that was started long before us, and hopefully we can be sustainable and continue for those that are coming behind us."</p>
        
            <p>Savea joins his brother and former All Black, Julian Savea, at Moana Pasifika, after a season playing for the Kobelco Kobe Steelers in the Japan Rugby League One Competition.</p>
        
            <p>Savea is looking forward to the future ready to prove people wrong about his switch to Moana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm looking forward to most is proving a lot of people wrong. I'm fully honest…proving people that Moana Pasifika is a great team, and these great players, these great coaches in that team."</p>
        
            <p>Savea emphasised how his brother Julian was happy.</p>
        
            <p>"I gave him a phone call…and just told him, I'll be seeing you soon. I think he just woke up. He couldn't believe it. But he's happy.</p>
        
            <p>"It'd be cool to…we started together and it'd be nice to finish together."</p>
