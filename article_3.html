            <p>The small settlement of Karaka has been rocked by the death of a child in a driveway crash, a local councillor says.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Karaka Road, in rural south Auckland, about 3.30pm Saturday. However, the child died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Manurewa-Papakura Ward Councillor Daniel Newman said the community had been shaken by the death.</p>
        
            <p>"We're a tightknit bunch and this is a matter that will make people very affected, because of the loss of a child. That's an absolute tragedy."</p>
        
            <p>Newman said he was making enquiries about the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police closed part of Karaka Road while they investigated on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family involved, and we are ensuring there is support available for them at this difficult time," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Police have not released any further details about the child, such as their age.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was the second fatality of a child in a driveway in the space of a week.</p>
        
            <p>Last Tuesday, another child was killed in a driveway crash in the nearby town of Waiuku.</p>
        
            <p>According to government figures, New Zealand has one of the highest rates of childhood driveway deaths and injuries in the world.</p>
        
            <p>On average, a child is hospitalised every two weeks after being injured by a vehicle in a driveway, and five children die every year.</p>
        
            <p>Most children injured in driveway crashes are toddlers, with an average age of two.</p>
