            <p>Although the rain, hail and wind associated with the thunderstorms may not reach severe thunderstorm criteria, the thunderstorms are producing widespread frequent lightning which could cause localised damage and affect power and internet connections, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warns to take shelter immediately if severe weather approaches.</p>
        
            <p>The thunderstorms are expected to ease around 5pm.</p>
