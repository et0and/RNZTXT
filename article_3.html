            <p>World golf number one Scottie Scheffler was arrested and charged with the assault of a police officer in what he called a "chaotic situation" before being released in time to start his second round at the PGA Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Scheffler, who was placed in the back of a police car in handcuffs and later pictured in a jail-issued orange jumpsuit, said the early-morning incident was due to a misunderstanding with regards to traffic flow following a fatal accident in the area around Valhalla Golf Club.</p>
        
            <p>"This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers," Scheffler said on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I never intended to disregard any of the instructions. I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today."</p>

            <p>According to the police report, Scheffler was heading eastbound to gain access to the course and then pulled into the westbound lanes, where outbound traffic was flowing, to avoid backed-up vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>The report said the officer stopped Scheffler, who was in a marked player-courtesy vehicle, but that the golfer refused to comply and instead accelerated forward, dragging the officer to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Louisville police said the officer was taken to hospital after suffering pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Romines, a local attorney hired on Scheffler's behalf, said the golfer was charged with second-degree assault of a police officer, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding traffic signals from an officer.</p>
        
            <p>"He did exactly as he was instructed to do to enter the premises," said Romines. "We'll just deal with the court system as it comes."</p>

            <p>After finally arriving at Valhalla under a steady rain, Scheffler was greeted by plenty of encouragement from the fans and headed straight to the driving range.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the whirlwind of chaos and abbreviated warm-up, Scheffler opened his round with a birdie at the par-five 10th hole where his third shot from 97 yards out settled three feet from the hole.</p>
        
            <p>British Open champion Brian Harman, who is playing in a group with Scheffler, commented on the situation before setting out for the second round.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a wild morning," said Harman. "I don't know all the details but I know, knowing Scottie, that he is one hell of a dude and I sure am glad that he is going to be out here to play."</p>
        
            <p>Scheffler, who along with his wife welcomed their first child last week, is seeking his fifth win in six starts and a second consecutive major title.</p>
