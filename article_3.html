            <p>People who attended New Zealand's version of the Burning Man festival, Kiwiburn, are being asked to come forward with names of anyone they saw engaging in public sex or masturbation.</p>
        
            <p>The festival took place in Hunterville, Rangitikei from 22 to 27 January, and was attended by about 2400 people. The theme this year was "trash renaissance fair".</p>
        
            <p>On 3 February, the event's organisers posted a note on its website: "While it's undeniable that Kiwiburn was amazing this year, there was definitely some less than amazing behaviour that took place on the paddock."</p>
        
            <p>It asked anyone who "encountered unsavoury behaviour, such as non-consensual bum-slapping, trespassing, uncool language, theft, sex acts… or open masturbation" to come forward with names, times and locations.</p>
        
            <p>"We are keen to educate and to prevent these instances from happening at all, and we are more than happy to take action against any one person, but we need to know more. Otherwise this behaviour gets normalised and will happen again."</p>
        
            <p>It said "consent guardians" were roaming the festival throughout the night.</p>
        
            <p>A person who attended the event told RNZ - on the condition of anonymity - the inappropriate behaviour took place during the burning of the effigy, and children were present.</p>
        
            <p>They said traditionally everyone stripped down and ran naked around the fire, but people began having public sex and openly masturbating, and among those who witnessed it were a large number of young children under 10 years old, some of whom were crying and distraught, and were taken away by their parents.</p>
        
            <p>The person said in their many years of attending the festival, they had never experienced this kind of behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"These kind of acts go counter to the whole Burner ethos of consent and kindness."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were not aware of any incidents being reported.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwiburn's executive committee provided more information in a written response to RNZ, saying the safety of participants was of utmost importance: "We take safety very seriously, as well as striving for a strong consent culture."</p>
        
            <p>However, the size of the event - more than 2000 people - meant instances which "cross these boundaries are difficult to prevent at times".</p>

            <p>It said the conduct committee was dealing with "a few complaints of various seriousness and nature", but the details were confidential and its process thorough.</p>
        
            <p>Despite having more people on site than ever, it said there was no higher number or more unusual nature of complaints than in previous years.</p>
        
            <p>This year, out of almost 2400 people, there were about 40 children present - that is, under 16 years of age. But it had not been reported to the committee that any children witnessed inappropriate activities.</p>
        
            <p>"Parents should be aware that any Burn event can be an environment where R18 elements are present. Every effort is made to clearly mark these as such. Still, it is difficult to police every person and their actions, which would be true for every public space or event like us."</p>
        
            <p>Measures already in place included professional security guards, internal rangers patrolling around the clock, and for the first time this year, a consent hui for attendees.</p>
        
            <p>"Every event teaches us more, and of course we have a duty to act on learnings as well as make every effort to prevent safety breaches."</p>
