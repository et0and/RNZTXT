            <p>The Bay of Islands will welcome the New Year with a fireworks display launched at the stroke of midnight from a barge moored in the channel between Paihia and Russell.</p>
        
            <p>Optimum viewing areas include Paihia wharf and Maiki Hill lookout, and almost anywhere along the town's waterfront.The fireworks can also be seen from Waitangi, Ōpua and Russell.</p>
        
            <p>The show has been organised every year since 2002, apart from a break during the Covid pandemic, by Business Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland</p>
        
            <p>It's all happening in central Auckland on New Year's Eve. Head downtown - or up a maunga like Maungawhau/ Mt Eden - to see the spectacular annual fireworks display off the Sky Tower as the clock strikes midnight.</p>
        
            <p>If you're within view of the Auckland Harbour Bridge, you can enjoy the Vector Lights show. In the lead-up up to 12 o'clock, the bridge will turn a shade of teal to reflect the region's maunga, landscape and moana, and the display centres around the letters M and W to acknowledge the mana whenua of Tāmaki Makaurau. Maintenance work by NZTA means some of the display won't appear on the west side overarch.</p>
        
            <p>Some inner-city streets will be closed to vehicles later in the evening, so spectators are advised to use public transport. Buses and ferries will be running on a Saturday timetable, with extra buses operating after midnight. The last ferries to Devonport leave at 12.15am; and to Matiatia at 1am. With trains out of action, there is a bus replacement service available.</p>
