            <p>The incoming prime minister's office is one of a number of Auckland buildings vandalised by a pro-Palestine group in a call for politicians to support a ceasefire of the conflict in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>TƒÅmaki for Palestine splashed red paint on the buildings of six National MPs and ACT leader David Seymour's office overnight.</p>
        
            <p>It is calling the incoming government a "coalition of complicity" for failing to call for a ceasefire or condemn Israel's actions.</p>
        
            <p>It said the red paint represents the blood on their hands for the deaths of thousands in Gaza.</p>

            <p>Among the National Party offices vandalised were Christopher Luxon's, Judith Collins', and Paul Goldsmith's.</p>
        
            <p>Collins told RNZ she was disgusted and annoyed at the attack on her office, especially because there has been some movement in the situation in the past few days.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the group did a similar act, vandalising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the US Consulate offices.</p>
        
            <p>One person was arrested.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Israel's government and Hamas had agreed to pause fighting for four days to allow 50 hostages held in Gaza to be released in exchange for 150 imprisoned Palestinians in Israel.</p>
        
            <p>The war erupted after Islamist militant group Hamas entered Israel on 7 October and launched an attack.</p>
        
            <p>Israel retaliated with air strikes on Gaza, with thousands on either side killed.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been contacted for comment.</p>
