            <p>The attorney-general Judith Collins is "appalled" by the behaviour of a district court judge and her partner who verbally abused Winston Peters and other New Zealand first MPs at a function at Auckland's exclusive Northern Club last month.</p>
        
            <p>The Post reported Judge Ema Aitken, and her partner - former emergency doctor David Galler - were at a party for district judges at the exclusive club, when they gate-crashed Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters' private function.</p>
        
            <p>The Post reported Judge Aitken allegedly tried to enter the room as Peters was making a speech, and shouted "He's lying! How can you let him say that?".</p>
        
            <p>Galler is accused of blocking Peters' exit as he left the event and saying "You're doing a s... job in government".</p>
        
            <p>He is also accused of verbally attacking Casey Costello and party secretary Holly Howard.</p>
        
            <p>The Post said there was in addition an allegation of Galler asking as staff member of Indian Heritage: "Since when did we start allowing Indians to enter this club?". Galler is reported as unequivocally rejecting his comments were racist or intended to be racist</p>
        
            <p>Collins said she was aware of the incident and is "appalled by it".</p>
        
            <p>"I have told the Chief Justice that such behaviour is completely unacceptable and I expect it to be addressed," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had passed on to New Zealand First that what they experienced was "completely unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>Collins told media she would be writing to the Judicial Complaints Commissioner to make her position clear.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually really disgusted about what's happened and I don't think it's the sort of behaviour that I want to see in the judiciary"</p>
        
            <p>Collins said those responsible were "clearly either inebriated or just arrogant and offensive".</p>
        
            <p>Asked for his opinion, ACT leader David Seymour said the allegations as reported were "despicable" but it was up to the country's head judge "to uphold standards for the judiciary", not MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Chief district court Judge Heemi Taumaunu said he had spoken to Judge Aitken about the series of events.</p>
        
            <p>"The judge accepts that her behaviour on this occasion was inappropriate and rude and has subsequently apologised to New Zealand First and to the Northern Club," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Although I have not received any complaints, I have taken the proactive and unusual step of apologising unreservedly to New Zealand First on behalf of the District Court of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I have also made it clear to Judge Aitken that this was a regrettable, unfortunate, and unacceptable series of events, which she accepts."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Taumaunu said he could not comment on Galler's behaviour as he was not a judge.</p>
        
            <p>However, he added that Galler had apologised to him, and had advised that he had written to the Northern Club with an explanation of his actions on the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Galler has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether he might take any action in response, Peters demurred.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll know that when I've considered the matter," he told reporters at Parliament. "We don't rush to judgement here. We find out a few facts first."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First's director of communications Julian Paul had "no comment".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile The Post has also reported that barrister Michael Reed KC was at the function, and refused to stop taking photographs of NZ First guests, despite being asked to stop.</p>
        
            <p>A video published by The Post showed Reed being told he was not allowed to take photos, and asked to leave.</p>
        
            <p>The video showed Reed taking photos and telling people "I'm a member of the Wellington club and I have rights to [be] here".</p>
        
            <p>Collins said she was also disappointed in with what she considered the KC's "appalling behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>Reed has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The Northern Club's chief executive Michael Shah said it was a private club and could not comment on anything, whether it pertained to members or others.</p>
