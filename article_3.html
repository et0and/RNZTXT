            <p>A California motorist's attempt to bypass morning traffic by putting a mannequin in the passenger seat and driving in the carpool lane has resulted in fines instead.</p>
        
            <p>A California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer in Santa Fe Springs had pulled over the unnamed driver for crossing a double line when they noticed something strange about the passenger.</p>
        
            <p>"Officer Kaplan made an enforcement stop on this vehicle for crossing solid double lines only to realise the driver was the only occupant in the vehicle with their plastic friend," CHP Santa Fe Springs Police wrote on Instagram this week.</p>
        
            <p>"The goatee was sharp â€¦ just a little too sharp."</p>
        
            <p>The post was accompanied by a picture of the mannequin in question, sporting a hoodie and sunglasses.</p>
        
            <p>According to the statement, the driver was issued with a number of citations for carpool violations.</p>
        
            <p>The Santa Fe Springs Police joked some people had been asking, if they had a mannequin in the passenger seat, "does that count as a second occupant in the vehicle?"</p>
        
            <p>Their answer: No.</p>
        
            <p>"We've gotta give it to them, the appearance is next level modelling but at the end of the day ... plastic is plastic," they wrote.</p>
        
            <p>The post finished with a reminder: "Remember to plan ahead, know your route of travel, and the general challenges of your drive to avoid being in a rush or tempted to push your luck."</p>
