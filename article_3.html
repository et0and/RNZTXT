            <p>One of the world's largest-ever diamonds has been unearthed in Botswana.</p>
        
            <p>The 2492-carat gemstone mined by Canadian company Lucara Diamond Corp this week is believed to be the largest found in a century and the second-largest ever mined.</p>
        
            <p>Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi showed off the stone in his office, with the government confirming it was the biggest diamond found in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Lucara chief executive William Lamb said the company was "ecstatic" about the latest recovery from its Karowe Diamond Mine, which had produced diamonds of note since its inception in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>"This find not only showcases the remarkable potential of our Karowe Mine, but also upholds our strategic investment in cutting-edge XRT technology," he said in a statement.</p>

            <p>"This discovery reinforces Karowe's position as a truly world-class diamond mine and highlights the continued success of our operational and underground development strategy."</p>
        
            <p>The company credited X-ray technology installed in 2017 for identifying, retrieving and preserving mega diamonds deemed to be of high value.</p>

            <p>"It is overwhelming," Masisi said as he presented the diamond at an official ceremony at his office on Thursday, according to AP.</p>
        
            <p>"I am lucky to have seen it in my time."</p>
        
            <p>The value of the diamond - determined by a combination of its carats, cut, colour, and clarity - is yet to be determined.</p>
        
            <p>Botswana was the second-largest diamond mining country in the world, trailing Russia, and accounts for 20 percent of global production.</p>
        
            <p>The industry formed the foundation of Botswana's economy, having constituted more than 60 percent of total exports over the past two decades.</p>
        
            <p>Karowe Mine alone has produced four other diamonds of more than 1000 carats in the past 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, the 1109-carat Lesedi La Rona rough diamond was recovered from the site, which at the time was said to be the most valuable in the world, ultimately selling for NZD$85 million.</p>
        
            <p>Four years later came the 1758-carat Sewel√¥, which was ranked as the world's second largest until this week. It was sold to Louis Vuitton for an undisclosed amount.</p>
        
            <p>The Cullinan remained the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, weighing a whopping 3106 carats. It was mined in South Africa in 1905 and gifted to the British monarchy in 1907.</p>
        
            <p>The diamond was cut into nine large stones and close to 100 smaller stones, some of which became a part of the Crown's jewel collection.</p>
