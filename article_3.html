            <p>Pope Francis suffered a sudden episode of respiratory difficulty and was put on a breathing machine on Friday, according to the latest medical update from the Vatican.</p>
        
            <p>The episode was complicated by vomiting, some of which he aspirated, the Vatican said. Medical staff treated the aspiration issue before putting the pope on mechanical ventilation, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The Vatican added that the pontiff "remained alert and oriented at all times."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson later noted that he is not considered out of danger at this point.</p>
        
            <p>Francis was first admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital two weeks ago, after being plagued by a string of lung-related medical struggles, including bronchitis and then pneumonia. His current hospitalization is his forth, and now longest, stay since he became pope in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>The pontiff has suffered from lung-related issues for much of his life. As a young man, he suffered from severe pneumonia and had part of one lung removed.</p>
        
            <p>The Vatican has been releasing twice daily updates on the pope's health. On Thursday, it said that Francis' condition was "improving" but his prognosis remained unclear.</p>
        
            <p>The Argentinian leader's schedule has been cleared to accommodate his intensive medical treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Friday, the Vatican announced that the pope will not lead next week's Ash Wednesday service, marking the start of Lent, for only the second time in his 12-year papacy. A cardinal is expected to lead the service instead.</p>
