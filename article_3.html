            <p>Two men have been arrested in relation to a gang-related pub brawl that police believe led to the killing of Hori Gage in Palmerston North last year.</p>
        
            <p>Gage, who was 27, was shot in his vehicle on 6 August outside his Croydon Avenue property, while his children were present.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe that Gage's killing was a direct response to events at a Palmerston North bar on Main Street on 4 August, when several altercations occurred both inside and outside of the bar.</p>
        
            <p>Police said that culminated with a brawl between rival members of the Mongrel Mob and Black Power on Main Street. It also resulted in a senior Black Power member receiving stab wounds.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Sergeant Dave Wilson said the police investigation into Hori Gage's murder was continuing.</p>
        
            <p>"The arrests of those for events on Main Street on 4 August has been one part of this investigation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>An 18-year-old Wellington man is due to reappear in Wellington District Court on 26 January charged with injuring with intent to injure, relating to an assault on a bar patron inside the Main Street bar.</p>
        
            <p>A 25-year-old Porirua man is due to reappear in Porirua District Court on 12 January charging with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, relating to the stabbing that occurred outside on Main Street.</p>
