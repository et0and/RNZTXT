            <p>Auckland Council has voted against raising speed limits, in opposition to a government transport plan.</p>
        
            <p>The government wants to scrap blanket reductions on local streets, arterial roads and state highways by July next year, and plans to introduce a new speed limit rule by the end of September - reversing the previous government's blanket speed limit reductions.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Auckland Council's transport committee voted to oppose raising the speed limits back to 2020 levels and variable limits around schools in its submission to the government.</p>
        
            <p>Committee chair John Watson said the council had come down on the side of public safety, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children.</p>
        
            <p>In December, Transport Minister Simeon Brown said NZTA and the country's local councils had been directed to stop work on blanket speed reductions. Instead, to boost productivity and economic growth, the government was looking at variable speed limits that would function at different times.</p>
        
            <p>It is asking for feedback on the changes - including variable speed limits near schools for morning drop-offs and afternoon pick-ups.</p>
        
            <p>But Auckland is not the only council that has bucked the government's directions on the speed limit plan reversal.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough District Council has pushed ahead with a speed management plan this year containing a range of speed limit changes, including blanket 40kph speed limits outside schools.</p>
        
            <p>In May, blanket fixed speed limits began for areas surrounding schools in the small Taranaki town of Stratford.</p>
        
            <p>Following community consultation, in June, Tauranga City Council introduced permanent speed reductions in the city centre, as well as variable speed limits near schools during some times. The changes were made despite the plan being met with a warning from Simeon Brown that the government could reverse the changes.</p>
