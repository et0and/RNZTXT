        <h2>Govt won't say if gang members excluded from abuse in care compensation</h2>
        <p>
The government is refusing to say whether gang members could be excluded from compensation for abuse they suffered while in state care.

            <p>
Minister Erica Stanford says the government would be looking at the question of whether gang members would be eligible for any compensation for abuse they suffered while in state care.

            <p>The government is refusing to say whether gang members could be excluded from compensation for abuse they suffered while in state care.</p>
        
            <p>Work is currently underway on a new redress scheme for abuse survivors in line with Tuesday's formal state apology.</p>
        
            <p>All three coalition parties campaigned on cracking down on gangs and introduced a ban on gang insignia that kicks in next week.</p>
        
            <p>Asked on Wednesday whether gang members would be eligible for redress, the relevant minister, Erica Stanford, declined to say.</p>
        
            <p>"I have not made any decisions and neither has Cabinet. All of these things have to go to Cabinet," Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to tell you today what's in and what's out and how much, because we haven't made any of those decisions yet."</p>
        
            <p>Pressed again, Stanford said the question of whether gang members would be eligible was "one of the things that we have to be looking at".</p>
        
            <p>"There are lots of things that we have to take into account," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will do that through a Cabinet process."</p>
        
            <p>Asked directly whether Cabinet was discussing excluding gangs, Stanford replied: "You know very well I can't talk about what Cabinet is discussing."</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care, released in July, identified a significant link between state care and gang membership.</p>
        
            <p>"Gangs provided survivors with the care (that is, attachment and belonging) and protection that state and faith-based institutions should have given," the report said.</p>
