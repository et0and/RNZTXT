            <p>The NZ Breakers' slump has continued in the Australian NBL with a 111-94 loss on the road to the Adelaide 36ers.</p>
        
            <p>It is the New Zealand side's sixth successive loss and they now sit second to bottom in the standings with a seven and nine record.</p>
        
            <p>The scores were level after the first quarter, before the home side jumped out to a nine point lead at half time.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers closed to within two at three-quarter time but were then outscored 33-18 in the final quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Co-captain Parker Jackson-Cartwright had 25 points, while Adelaide's Kendric Davis hit a game high 36 points.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers struggled to find consistency on both ends of the court as the 36ers shot an impressive 54 percent from the field, including 51 percent from beyond the arc.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright also had eight assists while Tacko Fall added nine points, 10 rebounds and two blocks, helping the Breakers win the rebounding battle 40-37.</p>
        
            <p>However Davis was the standout performer on the night, pouring on 36 points on 62 percent shooting along with nine assists, while Montrezl Harrell returned from suspension with a double-double including 21 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Petteri Koponen said while he saw improvements, it still wasn't where they needed to be.</p>
        
            <p>"We fought for three quarters today. It was a little bit better but still not enough," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In these last losses we can't get stops and that's been a challenge. Adelaide shot the ball really well today and they're a really talented team.</p>
        
            <p>"When they shoot the ball like that, with over 50 percent from three, it makes it tough to stop. We need to use all the practice time we have to get better."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers travel home ahead of a long-anticipated return to Spark Arena in Auckland when they host Sydney Kings at 7.30pm on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a great day being back at Spark Arena and hopefully we can finish that day also with a win. I hope the fans are still there to support us and give us that extra boost we need."</p>
