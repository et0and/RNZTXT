            <p>The directors at Tipene Funerals say the latest arrest of an Auckland funeral director as part of Operation Lola is "not us".</p>
        
            <p>The first arrest saw former Tipene employee Fiona Bakulich plead guilty last month to mishandling human remains and obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>Police have now arrested a second person for mishandling burials, a man due to appear in Auckland District Court next week.</p>
        
            <p>Kaiora Tipene, a director of Tipene Funerals, posted a video on social media, shown sitting next to her husband Francis, saying she felt compelled to speak out after receiving concerned messages following the news.</p>
        
            <p>The pair featured in the popular reality TV show The Casketeers. </p>
        
            <p>"I just want to say, it's not us, e te whānau," Kaiora said in this latest video, posted on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Francis Tipene said their thoughts were with the affected whānau, and he hoped they were getting support.</p>
        
            <p>"We're here, we're still going strong, we have many, many families in our care that we need to take care of."</p>
        
            <p>Among the comments on the video is one from Marama Davidson, co-leader of the Green Party, saying: "Big aroha ki a koutou!!!"</p>
        
            <p>Responding to RNZ's request for comment on Friday night, Kaiora Tipene directed the reporter to the video.</p>
