            <p>The government says it will be considering different funding models to build new hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition deal with ACT commits the government to investigate build and lease-back arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>The new annual report for Te Whatu Ora shows "foundational" work to run hospital assets properly has still not been done.</p>
        
            <p>Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop said it was important to "keep an open mind as we investigate the most efficient and effective ways" to deliver health services.</p>
        
            <p>"Build and lease-back arrangements would entrust reputable, expert infrastructure developers with the building and maintenance of new and existing hospitals, which are then leased back to the public sector for long-term public use," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He would work with Health Minister Dr Shane Reti "to improve the speed and delivery" of major projects.</p>
        
            <p>Reti was waiting for advice from officials about the full portfolio of health infrastructure.</p>

            <p>"I will have a particular interest in the large-scale projects that are already underway and those recently announced," Reti said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"What I am keen to initially understand is where these respective major infrastructure builds are at, on the spectrum of project phasing, and what funding commitments have been made to date."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora's annual report shows one out of eight or nine big builds were rated "red", the worst category, and "may require a change in scope or funding to proceed".</p>
        
            <p>The other 88 percent of the 75 projects worth $6 billion were on track or "being actively managed to deliver as expected".</p>

            <p>On the redevelopment front, a lot of which was focused on regional hospitals, under half - 46 percent, or six out of 13 - of milestones were reached in the 2022-23 year.</p>
        
            <p>A design reset a year ago held this back.</p>
        
            <p>After a bad run of poor business cases that spat out muddled timelines and budgets, as revealed in OIA documents and reports, the agency said it had centralised and improved.</p>
        
            <p>"Strengthening of national functions and processes has enhanced the quality and practice of investment advice and monitoring," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ is promising to deliver a national asset management plan this month, but this is over a year after it was promised it would be delivered.</p>
        
            <p>The state of health assets still was not known, because "baselining" the estate had only just begun in 2023-24 and would take another three years.</p>
        
            <p>This itself comes three years after the first national stocktake of hospital assets reported back, to government fanfare, but with grim findings.</p>
        
            <p>Back then, the 2020 stocktake said: "The initial work in this current-state assessment lays the foundation for improving the quality of capital funding decisions, asset management and long-term capital investment."</p>
        
            <p>The new annual report said: "Asset levels of service, measures and targets for condition, fitness-for-purpose and use are required to enable asset performance reporting.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a large and complex task and we have yet to complete the national baseline assessments of condition."</p>
        
            <p>The facilities teams at Te Whatu Ora - themselves caught up in reform, overhaul and redundancies - have got as far as agreeing a "standardised approach" for assessing the likes of operating theatres, EDs, cancer, burns, and spinal units.</p>
        
            <p>Other "foundational pieces of work" that were still required include an asset management information system.</p>
        
            <p>How health facilities are performing remains patchy.</p>
        
            <p>"There is variability across the regions and a significant amount of work is required to implement standardised processes and practices to get to where we need to be," the annual report said.</p>
