            <p>A new train station building has opened in central Auckland for Te Huia and Northern Explorer travellers.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail has renovated the Parnell Rise 1930s building, which used to operate railway signals and is a few hundred metres away from The Strand platform.</p>
        
            <p>It now includes a new caf√©, waiting lounge, toilets and showers, and workspace area. Free WiFi will be available early next year.</p>
        
            <p>A new permanent mobility ramp has also been installed at The Strand platform.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail chief customer and growth officer Adele Wilson said there was a plan to have a 'scenic plus' offer on the Northern Explorer next year, with demand growing since the service restarted over a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>"The new station building will help deliver an even better customer experience for Northern Explorer and Te Huia passengers, while keeping a strong link to New Zealand's proud rail history."</p>

            <p>Waikato regional councillor Angela Strange, who is also chair of the Future Proof Public Transport Subcommittee, said Te Huia also was regularly hitting its weekday patronage targets.</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident any improvements - including new facilities such as this one - will see Te Huia go from strength to strength."</p>
        
            <p>From 8 February, Te Huia will have a third daily return service running on Thursdays and Fridays, where KiwiRail says demand has been highest, and a second return service on Saturdays.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said the new station building would later be available to be booked for events, and have an information counter, where customers could ask about Great Journeys New Zealand's offerings.</p>
