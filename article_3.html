        <h2>Support worker filmed clients, made 'inappropriate' video, watchdog finds</h2>
        <p>
Footage shows one disabled client told she "smells like a dead rat", while another was told she "looks like a devil".

            <p>A community support worker inappropriately filmed her disabled clients and made an animated video of one of them for her own entertainment, a health watchdog has found.</p>
        
            <p>A report by the Health and Disability Commissioner said the non-consensual photos showed multiple care home residents in various situations - sleeping and sitting on a couch, reading a newspaper, and at the beach.</p>
        
            <p>One video showed a woman punching herself in the face after the worker told her to go to her room.</p>
        
            <p>In another, the worker can be heard telling a different woman she was "stinking", while a male worker said: "You smell like a dead rat".</p>
        
            <p>The client spat at the second worker, who spat back at her, saying "if you spit, I'll spit", and, "you look like a devil".</p>
        
            <p>The first worker did not intervene or take any steps regarding her colleague's behaviour and did not report the interaction, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>She used a photograph of a male client to create an animated video that depicted him dancing while dressed in a rabbit costume. Another video of him was taken while he was upset after an argument with another client.</p>
        
            <p>The woman's estranged husband laid the complaint against her, after seeing the photos and videos.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had been sent the content by his wife, but she argued he had accessed them himself on her personal phone.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Commissioner Rose Wall said either way, the woman should not have taken the non-consensual photos and videos. She rejected the worker's claim that she took them as evidence of violent and erratic behaviour, noting they mostly showed the clients appearing calm.</p>
        
            <p>"The act of taking these photographs and video recordings was inappropriate and did not demonstrate respect for the consumers," Wall said.</p>
        
            <p>"In my view, the community support worker took these photographs and video recordings for an unnecessary and personal reason."</p>
        
            <p>She found the worker had not treated the clients with respect, and had failed to manage several incidents.</p>
        
            <p>The worker has formally apologised to the clients and their whƒÅnau.</p>
        
            <p>Wall recommended her employer, which was a "large provider of services for Whaikaha [Ministry of Disabled People]", use this case for training on personal mobile phone use and incident reporting.</p>
        
            <p>The disability service has since taken disciplinary action against the employee, the report said.</p>
