            <p>Twice a season's worth of rain within days caused mayhem in Otago this week, with evacuations, essential services disrupted, and roads damaged and closed.</p>
        
            <p>By 9am Friday, central Dunedin had recorded more than 130mm of rain in the previous 42 hours, twice their average October monthly rainfall. Niwa said it was the most rain one of their Dunedin rain stations had ever recorded - and it continued to fall through the day.</p>
        
            <p>Here's some of what was captured through Friday:</p>
