            <p>A group of young people occupying the rooftop of their youth justice facility could be seen ripping out insulation and wood from a small piece of pulled-up roofing.</p>
        
            <p>The group, on the roof at Korowai Manaaki in south Auckland's Wiri, claimed they were protesting because they weren't let outside. They also said they had not been fed.</p>

            <p>Oranga Tamariki Acting deputy chief executive youth justice services and residential care Iain Chapman said a group of 13 youths accessed the roof at around 6:40pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Nine were coaxed down overnight and on Tuesday morning, while four remained. However, an RNZ reporter at the scene said just two could be seen on the roof now.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to work with police to resolve this matter," Chapman said. "We can confirm there are no concerns for public safety."</p>
        
            <p>One young person was led past the front of the building by two guards, with arms behind his back. Another climbed down over a wall, out of sight - but appeared to be off the roof.</p>
        
            <p>Police officers who were earlier walking the perimeter have now gathered in front of the building.</p>

            <p>Despite initial reports suggesting the youths were demanding Big Mac combos from McDonald's, cigarettes and a getaway car, Chapman said the group "have made no requests or demands to our staff on site".</p>
        
            <p>A small piece of roofing appeared to have been pulled up and damaged, while two youths appeared to have climbed through a hole made in one of the buildings, before re-emerging.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were supporting Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Newstalk ZB, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said authorities will not cave to the youths' demands.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not coming down for KFC," Luxon said.</p>

            <p>"These are some of the most serious and hardcore young offenders."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time young people have climbed on to the roof of Korowai Manaaki, a similar incident in July 2023 was blamed on staff shortages.</p>
        
            <p>A damning report in July found staff at the facility were smuggling in contraband, roughing up children, and silencing any informants.</p>
