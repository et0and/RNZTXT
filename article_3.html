            <p>A rare penguin is getting fattened up in its new temporary home after travelling thousands of kilometres from Antarctica to the bottom of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>The black and white Adélie penguin - about 60cm tall and characterised by its flat head - was spotted on St Clair Beach, near Dunedin, on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation staff collected the fluffy, flightless bird and took him to the Opera penguin centre, run by the Otago Peninsula Eco-Restoration Alliance.</p>
        
            <p>Opera co-owner Jerad Halban said it was undergoing health tests as it was underweight and malnourished on arrival.</p>
        
            <p>"The time that he's in with us, we'll spend feeding him and getting him fattened up before sending him back into the wild," Halban said.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] Incredibly rare for us. We're so used to seeing the hoihos and the little penguins, but not this guy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very early days and since he's so rare, we're working really closely with the Department of Conservation and the Wildlife Hospital too."</p>

            <p>Made famous in recent decades by featuring in DreamWorks animated film series Madagascar, most of the world's 10 million Adélie penguins reside on Antarctic coasts, with about a third living around the Ross Sea, according to the New Zealand Birds Online encyclopaedia.</p>
        
            <p>There have been few sightings of the penguin in New Zealand, but two have been reported in January alone, possibly the same one - the latest at St Clair Beach, and the other at Monkey Island Beach, more than 60km west of Invercargill in Southland, on 4 January.</p>
        
            <p>"They've only been sighted four to six times [in mainland New Zealand], depending on which report you're seeing," Halban said.</p>
        
            <p>A Department of Conservation spokesperson said there was no way of knowing whether they were the same individual penguin. But Halban said either way, the centre was happy to have it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was reported a few days ago that he was down in Invercargill, in that area, and then made the journey up - so we don't know for sure why he's chosen to make the trip, but it's an incredible opportunity to be able to see one in person.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly for our whole staff, it's the first time they've seen one in person and it was just amazing to lay eyes on a bird that you wouldn't normally have the opportunity to see here."</p>
        
            <p>He said the centre was abuzz with the new arrival.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been getting questions about whether or not he has a name, and he does not have a name yet, so I'm sure that's something a lot of people would like to weigh in on."</p>
        
            <p>The unnamed Adélie penguin will be released when the Opera and the Department of Conservation are satisfied he has a clean bill of health.</p>
