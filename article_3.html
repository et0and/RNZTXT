            <p>New Zealand golfer Daniel Hillier's emotions were "bittersweet" after finishing a narrow runner-up at the rich Dubai Desert Classic.</p>
        
            <p>Hillier pocketed $1.8 million for finishing second behind England's Tyrrell Hatton at the World Tour event, with the pair having fought out a tense tussle over the final round.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old New Zealander held an overnight one-shot lead, but his one-under 71 wasn't enough to stave off Tyrrell, who carded 69 to finish on 15-under at the Majlis course.</p>
        
            <p>England's Laurie Canter was third, one shot behind Hillier on 13-under, while New Zealand's Ryan Fox faded slightly on the final day, shooting 72 to finish on nine-under in a share of 10th place.</p>
        
            <p>Hatton drew level on the third hole and took the lead on the fifth with birdies, and remained in front throughout the round.</p>
        
            <p>However, Hillier stayed close and almost forced a playoff on the 18th hole when sinking a nine-foot putt for birdie. Hatton responded with a five-foot putt to secure the title.</p>
        
            <p>World No.223 Hillier was a mixture of emotions after coming so close to a result which he had conceded would have been "life-changing".</p>
        
            <p>"It's bittersweet, that's for sure. Yeah, I didn't have my best today obviously but I fought hard all day. I'm just proud I've given myself a chance down the stretch.</p>
        
            <p>"Hats off to Tyrrell. He was pretty solid down the stretch there. He's class. Well done to him."</p>
        
            <p>Hillier's form has been modest since his maiden Tour win at the British Masters 18 months ago. He was determined to make a better start to the season.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely proved to myself that I belong here and I can compete when I'm on. So hopefully I can come back and try to get it another year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of my goals was to get off to a better start than I have the last couple of seasons. I've been playing catch-up in the second half of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"I've started off solid in Aussie and South Africa and then come here and put up one of my best performances. Absolutely stoked."</p>
        
            <p>Hatton said he felt "amazing" after securing a fifth Tour title.</p>
        
            <p>"I said earlier in the week, this is one of the events that you would like to have on your CV. It's such an iconic event for the World Tour.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to lie, I was pretty nervous on the back nine to be honest. I guess I just maybe wanted it a bit too much.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew the position I was in, and a little bit scruffy down the last. But yeah, to see that putt go in felt amazing. Just so happy to win."</p>
