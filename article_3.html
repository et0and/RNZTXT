            <p>An estimated 42,000 people from all around the country descended on central Wellington on Tuesday after a nine day hīkoi reached its final destination, the grounds of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>This morning, police said about 2000 people walked from Petone to the Wellington train station along State Highway 2, as part of the hīkoi mō Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>The group set off at 4am, with cars travelling slowly alongside in support.</p>
        
            <p>The final destination for Hīkoi mō te Tiriti was Parliament, at the end of a nine-day trek for many who oppose the Treaty Principles Bill, which is being sponsored by the ACT party.</p>
        
            <p>Those walking flew hundreds of tino rangatiratanga flags, while many drivers are tooted as they passed the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>Participants were aged from young children to the elderly.</p>
        
            <p>In the afternoon, supporters headed to Waitangi Park, where a post-hīkoi concert took place.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a sample of some of those taking part.</p>
