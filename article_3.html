            <p>New Zealand is missing its most successful Paralympian but it still has a lot of medal prospects as the 17th summer Games begins in Paris from Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>It is now the world's third biggest sporting event, in terms of ticket sales - only the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cups sell more.</p>
        
            <p>It brings together 4400 athletes and among them are 25 athletes who will represent this country in eight sports.</p>
        
            <p>So here is some information on how best to follow the Paralympics and the event's history and schedule.</p>

            <p>Since first competing at a summer Paralympic Games in Tel Aviv in 1968 New Zealand has won 201 medals, including 80 gold.</p>
        
            <p>The country's most successful Paralympian Dame Sophie Pascoe isn't competing having announced her retirement from competitive swimming following the birth of her first child earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>However, New Zealand athletes should excel in the likes of swimming, athletics and cycling.</p>
        
            <p>Long jump champion Anna Grimaldi, sprinter Danielle Aitchison, 400m runner and long jumper Will Stedman and Holly Robinson in the javelin and shot put are all contenders for the podium.</p>
        
            <p>Tupou Neiufi and Cameron Leslie in the pool and Nicole Murray, Anna Taylor and Devon Briggs in cycling also shape as medal prospects.</p>
        
            <p>There are 11 Paralympic debutants in the team, while shooter Michael Johnson will be competing in his sixth Paralympics.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow shooter Greg Reid is the oldest member of the team at age 62.</p>
