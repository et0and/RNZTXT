            <p>The family of an Aboriginal man whose TikTok has become a viral trend have labelled it "disgusting".</p>
        
            <p>The video, posted to Aurukun man Eric Yunkaporta's Tiktok account three years ago, is being downloaded and used as a "FaceTime prank".</p>
        
            <p>It involves TikTok creators filming themselves video-calling a friend or family member but instead of showing their face, they use Eric's TikTok to appear as though he is calling them instead.</p>
        
            <p>The trend - which is also appearing on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube - has received millions of views from users across the world. One video accumulated more than 22 million views alone.</p>
        
            <p>Another TikTok, which has since been removed for violating TikTok's AI policies, used artificial intelligence to edit Eric's face into a video depicting violence.</p>
        
            <p>Eric's cousins' Eloise and Leona Yunkaporta, who also live in the north Queensland community of Aurukun, say the family and wider community were shocked when they saw the video posted across social media platforms.</p>
        
            <p>"It's bullying and making a mockery out of First Nations people, and they don't understand how we feel," said Leona Yunkaporta, who is also a town councillor.</p>
        
            <p>"We got a shock when we seen our cousin's videos and his image on social media platforms without his knowledge and consent. It's wrong and it's not funny."</p>
        
            <p>"It's just very upsetting for us to see people making fun of him and he doesn't have a clue what's going on," Eloise Yunkaporta added.</p>
        
            <p>"We've explained most of the parts where this has gotten serious and he said, 'I don't want that [on there], I want to take it down."</p>
        
            <p>The community was already in the midst of grieving after the death of a young relative and an aunty recovering from a paralysing stroke.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't know what [this] is doing to him and how it's impacting his family and the extended family as well," Leona said.</p>
        
            <p>Eric Yunkaporta is a respected up-and-coming leader in his community, following in the footsteps of his father, who is one of the cultural knowledge holders of their clan.</p>
        
            <p>"Eric helps at the school doing spear making, building canoes and he holds cultural programs out on country. He learnt that from his grandad and their grandad," Eloise said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a humble person, he doesn't look for trouble or resort to violence when something like this happens."</p>
        
            <p>
A TikTok spokesperson said they had restricted some search terms to try and limit the reach of the videos.

            <p>Several First Nations content creators have also slammed the trend, calling it racist and echoing calls for it to be removed.</p>
        
            <p>Wiradjuri and Mununjali content creator Isaac Compton said that when he first saw the trend, it left a "bad taste in my mouth".</p>
        
            <p>"The butt of the joke is that a black man has stolen your phone, like that in itself should speak volumes. It's a stereotype that black people, black men, are thieves," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He added that the trend reflects the racism that still exists within society today.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been followed by security in a shop [where] my non-Indigenous friends have been able to walk out of said shop, but I've been pulled up and my pockets have been checked because racism is a problem here in this country," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If it was a white person with pearls, it wouldn't work but because it's a black person and it plays into that stereotype, that's why that trend works. So it's definitely problematic," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Eric's cousin agrees.</p>
        
            <p>"We are the First Nations people, and we still get belittled and deal with racism in this day and age, it needs to stop. We share Australia with all nationalities; that's what makes up Australia. So why are people being racist?" Eloise said.</p>
        
            <p>Palawa photographer Wayne Quilliam wants people to share his National Photographic Portrait Prize-winning photo of Eric Yunkaporta "to combat the extreme racism taking place online."</p>
        
            <p>Quilliam told the Indigenous Affairs Team the photo entitled Silent Strength was apt, recalling the first time he met Eric while he was taking part in a ceremonial dance.</p>
        
            <p>"He's so strong, but he had that powerful inner strength [that] very few people have, and since then, we've formed a beautiful relationship."</p>
        
            <p>Quilliam said people needed to reflect on how they treat one another online.</p>
        
            <p>"Opening up and sharing yourself is one thing, but to denigrate another individual by using their image, without their permission, without them being involved in the process, is pretty average," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you really want to understand who Eric and his family and his community are, work with us, work towards creating something a little bit more positive."</p>
        
            <p>Some content creators have publicly apologised for their contribution to the trend but Eric's cousins say Australians need "to do better".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little too late because it's caused a lot of upset within our family. We appreciate them apologising but I just hope they or whoever else doesn't do this to another person," Eloise said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not only the videos but the comments are just revolting. It makes us sick to our stomachs."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>In response to questions from the ABC's Indigenous Affairs Team, a TikTok spokesperson said they have restricted some search terms to try and limit the reach of these videos.</p>
        
            <p>"While using or sharing someone else's content does not breach our community guidelines, we have taken action on this content, making it harder to find and ineligible for the For You Feed.</p>
        
            <p>"Some search suggestions relating to this topic will also not be visible."</p>
        
            <p>But on Friday, videos using Eric's face could still be found.</p>
        
            <p>The TikTok spokesperson said that users "agree that your content can be used and shared by others on TikTok" and suggested people could "limit" this by putting accounts on private.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's independent national regulator for privacy, the Office of the Information Commissioner, and the regulator for online safety, eSafety, both said this content did not fall within their remit.</p>
        
            <p>"Basic digital civility includes seeking someone's consent when using their image online, but this does not constitute a violation of the Online Safety Act unless intimate images are shared without consent," eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.</p>
        
            <p>Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said in a statement, "The videos are distasteful and disrespectful" and "We are reviewing our options."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the communications minister said the government was working with platforms "to make it easier for Australians to raise their issues and complaints directly with social media companies and get a response or an action."</p>
        
            <p>Isaac Compton said he wasn't a stranger to online racism, and when his followers started to grow, it 'really affected' him. After a conversation and support from friends, he decided to reframe his mindset.</p>
        
            <p>"It can seem like it's only happening to you because there's such an influx of it. But someone once said 'you know they're just upset because you're black and deadly' and it was like a light went off in my head," Compton said.</p>
        
            <p>"So don't give that your energy. If someone is calling you a racist name or writing something racist in your comment section, you've already won because you've upset them enough by existing and being a proud Indigenous person."</p>
        
            <p>The other ways he protects himself online is by curating his algorithm and restricting comments on his posts.</p>
        
            <p>"Hold your finger down on the video and hit 'not interested', or now there's a dislike button, and that'll get it out of your algorithms," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Limit who can comment on your videos - or stay out of the comment section altogether.</p>
        
            <p>"Get to one of these cultural festivals, events or rallies. Go sit with your family. Nothing makes me feel more proud and more Indigenous than being amongst my people," he said.</p>
