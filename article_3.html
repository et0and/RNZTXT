        <h2>Why so many felt the earthquakes clustered around Taupō</h2>
        <p>
The series of shakes began just before 6pm on Thursday and continued on and off throughout the night.

            <p>A GNS scientist says a cluster of small earthquakes around Taupō were quite close to the surface - which is why so many people felt them.</p>
        
            <p>The series of shakes began just before 6pm on Thursday and continued on and off throughout the night.</p>
        
            <p>GNS scientist Ery Hughes said despite the earthquakes topping out at just above magnitude three it was the shallow depth of the shakes that left residents rattled, with some at a depth of just 3km.</p>
        
            <p>GeoNet designated the earthquakes as 'weak', but the system does not take into account how shallow the earthquakes were and how close people lived to them.</p>
        
            <p>Some residents took to social media platforms to discuss the shakes, with one user writing that they were "Woken up by the 3am shake".</p>
        
            <p>Another user wrote "How long has this been going on for?".</p>
        
            <p>Some even said that they "were waiting for a big one to come".</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said while earthquakes could be expected in geothermal areas such as Taupō, that was not necessarily a sign of volcanic activity.</p>
        
            <p>The rate of earthquakes was higher than usual, but they were continuing to monitor activity in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes also advised that anybody with concerns regarding earthquakes or volcanic activity should visit the GeoNet website for more resources or Civil Defence preparation website getready.govt.nz.</p>
