            <p>French film legend Alain Delon has died at the age of 88.</p>
        
            <p>The actor was a star of the golden era of French cinema, known for his tough-guy persona on screen in hits including Le Samourai and Borsalino.</p>
        
            <p>"He passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family," a statement released to AFP news agency said.</p>
        
            <p>Delon has been in poor health in recent years and become a virtual recluse. More recently, the breakdown of his family had been making headlines in France.</p>
        
            <p>Once described as the most beautiful man in the movies, Delon starred in hits from the 1960s including The Leopard, Purple Noon and Rocco and his Brothers.</p>

            <p>From the 1990s, his film appearances grew rare, but he remained a fixture in the celebrity columns.</p>
        
            <p>In total, he appeared in more than 90 films during the course of his career.</p>
        
            <p>A statement from his family said: "Alain Fabien, Anouchka, Anthony, as well as [his dog] Loubo, are deeply saddened to announce the passing of their father.</p>
        
            <p>"He passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family."</p>

            <p>Le Parisian newspaper called Delon "a legend of the cinema", while Liberation described him as "a leading figure of cinema, symbol of shadowy masculinity, the actor with crazy charisma".</p>
        
            <p>Delon's last major public appearance was to receive an honorary Palme d'or at the Cannes film festival in May 2019.</p>
        
            <p>At the event, he made an emotional speech in which he appeared to bid farewell to cinema.</p>
        
            <p>More recently, the breakdown of his family had been making headlines in France.</p>
        
            <p>His three children had laid their mutual grievances before the media in a series of insults, accusations, lawsuits and secret recordings.</p>
        
            <p>It included disagreements over his medical treatment.</p>
        
            <p>In April this year, a judge placed Delon under "reinforced curatorship", meaning he no longer had full freedom to manage his assets.</p>
        
            <p>Delon also made headlines in February of this year when French police seized 72 firearms and 3,000 rounds of ammunition from his home. Prosecutors said he did not have a gun licence.</p>
        
            <p>A shooting range was also found at his Douchy-Montcorbon mansion.</p>
        
            <p>BBC News has contacted Delon's representatives.</p>
