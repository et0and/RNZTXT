            <p>The Resources Minister says he has every right to shout back at people if he is being yelled at in public.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday about 30 people marching in central Wellington protesting the proposed repeal of the oil and gas ban confronted Shane Jones, yelling at him and calling out "shame".</p>
        
            <p>Jones told Morning Report he was allowed to yell right back.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis want to know that politicians like me aren't going to cower away, I mean you're allowed to protest but I should be allowed to wander down the main street without being called an f...ing sell-out and also subject to some pretty gross language.</p>
        
            <p>"So if you're going to dish it out to me be prepared to receive it back."</p>

            <p>No new oil and gas fields are likely to be discovered in the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>That is according to the government's own advice on repealing the oil and gas exploration ban.</p>
        
            <p>The latest modelling, urgently released under the Official Information Act and obtained by RNZ, said in the short term repealing the ban was not likely to significantly bolster gas supplies from existing fields, either.</p>
        
            <p>But Jones said New Zealand had "to keep the lights on and industry flourishing right up to 2050 and beyond".</p>
        
            <p>Jones described it as "another arrow in the quiver".</p>
        
            <p>"The bottom line is New Zealand will no longer legally prohibit investing in this particular segment of the economy."</p>
        
            <p>The energy system would face ongoing challenges and all options were needed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to rely on coal from Indonesia until such time as bio-energy is an economically credible alternative - no one in 2018 when [former prime minister] Jacinda Ardern cancelled the industry thought we'd be reliant on Indonesian coal but there you are."</p>
        
            <p>Jones disagreed with the statement that people would be less likely to develop green energy sources such as wind and solar if they thought more gas would be coming on stream in 10 years time.</p>
        
            <p>It was a contingency option, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Really all we're doing is reversing a ban that came from some fatuous thinking that was reflective of sadly, the thinking of that side of politics which is in my view antagonistic towards fossil fuels at a time we need more options on the table until we can fully fund the transition."</p>
