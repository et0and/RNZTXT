            <p>New Zealand sailors Erica Dawson and Micah Wilkinson have claimed Olympic bronze in the Nacra mixed multihull in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>The duo finished eighth in the final, but took the medal on points.</p>
        
            <p>Their closest competition for the bronze heading into the race was Great Britain, who were disqualified for a false start.</p>
        
            <p>The Brits were unaware of their indiscretion, and raced on until the umpires pulled them out.</p>
        
            <p>Italy took the gold while Argentina won silver.</p>

            <p>The French cruised to the finish, well out in front of the rest of the pack, but were out of medal contention and finished in fifth place overall.</p>
        
            <p>There were some late concerns over wind strength and a potential abandonment as it dipped below five knots, but the race was completed without further drama.</p>
        
            <p>The win took New Zealand's medal tally to 11.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Sky Sport after the race, Dawson said the duo were in a state of disbelief and happiness.</p>
        
            <p>"I just can't believe it. It's so cool."</p>
        
            <p>Wilkinson said the pair had raced together for five years and only medalled at one event.</p>
        
            <p>"To do it when it matters is an incredible feeling."</p>
