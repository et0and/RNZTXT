        <h2>Luxon's chief press secretary resigns</h2>
        <p>
The departure means the prime minister's office will be without its two most senior press secretaries by Christmas.

            <p>The prime minister's chief press secretary has resigned almost 10 months to the day since the Coalition government was formed.</p>
        
            <p>Former New Zealand Herald and Stuff Wellington business editor Hamish Rutherford started in the role in April 2022, while Christopher Luxon was opposition leader.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon often refers to his own business credentials and not having worked in politics previously, which would have made Rutherford's own background and experience an appealing hire at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Rutherford moved into the top communication job in government when the Coalition formed in November last year.</p>
        
            <p>He notified the press gallery at Parliament on Wednesday that he would finish in the job at the end of this year, after it had become clear he did not want to stay on for the full term.</p>
        
            <p>He said it had been an honour to work for Luxon and was looking forward to spending more time with his young family.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's office will be without its two most senior press secretaries by Christmas as Rutherford's deputy, Jasmine Higginson, is about to go on maternity leave.</p>
        
            <p>There are two other press secretaries in the office - Lesley Hamilton who formerly worked for then-Prime Minister John Key, and Matt Young, who is relatively new to politics.</p>
