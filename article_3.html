            <p>A trial in Hamilton to allow some park space to rewild will end later this month when the grass is finally mowed.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City Council parks delivery manager Duncan MacDougall said they had a range of goals for the trial, which allowed the grass to grow in parts of 13 different parks, including about 1 percent of the green space which was usually mowed.</p>
        
            <p>"The trial aims to enhance biodiversity, create some spontaneous play opportunities in these parks, and look at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from mowing and associated activities."</p>
        
            <p>In some parks the council added wildflowers to the naturally growing grasses and plants, so poppies and daisies could be seen flowering in some of the rewilded areas.</p>

            <p>MacDougall said the trial will help the council evaluate land management techniques in the future.</p>
        
            <p>The council will survey residents, measure greenhouse emissions from maintenance vehicles and collect biodiversity data to assess the no-mow trial' success.</p>

            <p>The trial had so far received mixed feedback from the public.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a few people who have raised concerns, particularly about the visual amenity of the sites and the changes in the use from being an open space to a long grass area," MacDougall said.</p>

            <p>However, he said the council had received letters of support from parents and dog walkers who were happy with the trial and supported the changes.</p>
        
            <p>MacDougall said the areas would be finally mowed by the end of January.</p>
