Chariots of Fire could be the most recognisable Olympics-related movie, and is slow-moving by today's standards but still warrants a watch, film critic Sam Hollis says.

            <p>If the razzle and dazzle of the rain-soaked opening ceremony and the tension of the first competitions haven't got you in the athletic spirit - pull up a footrest and heat up the popcorn, RNZ has the perfect itinerary of Olympic Games and athletic themed flicks.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ producer and movie critic Sam Hollis has taken a broad sweep, to pick his top 5 movies with Olympic Games or athletic themes.</p>
        
            <p>"When I think of the Olympic Games I think of things like commitment to mastering something, blood sweat and tears, that raw determination to be the best," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping here there'll be some obvious pics, but hopefully some less obvious ones that people will want to check out too."</p>
        
            <p>I, Tonya (2017)</p>
        
            <p>Stars Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding, who became infamous in the 1990s when she was connected to the assault of her rival skater Nancy Kerrigan in the run up to selections for the US Winter Olympics team. "What makes this one really memorable is the mockumentary-style it takes on, where Tonya's breaking the fourth wall and serving as the narrator to her story ... it's just showing you a lot of the context to her life of how she ended up where she did," Hollis says.</p>
        
            <p>Available on TVNZ+.</p>

            <p>Free Solo (2018)</p>
        
            <p>A National Geographic documentary following the story of rock climber Alex Honnold as he attempts to be the first person to free solo climb (without ropes or safety equipment) the famed El Capitan rock wall in California's Yosemite National Park. "The way it's filmed ... is unbelievably immersive. You feel like you're right there on the wall with him, and it's also a really fascinating psychological study into the mind of a hard core adrenalin junkie - why does he do this?"</p>
        
            <p>Available on Disney Plus.</p>
        
            <p>Chariots of Fire (1981) </p>
        
            <p>Based on the true story of two British runners competing in the 1924 Olympics, this film picked up four Academy Awards. Hollis says it offers an interesting window into some of the social and political issues of its time, and "I do think it's worth checking out, even if I think it's a little bit on the meandering side."</p>
        
            <p>Watch it on Disney Plus.</p>
        
            <p>Whiplash (2014)</p>
        
            <p>While it's about a drummer striving to master the art, Hollis picked it for this line-up as: "If there was every a movie about someone obsessing over mastering a particular practice that really captures the level of drive that it takes, this is that movie. "It takes a really in-depth look at the relationship between coach and player ... it's so intense and shocking that by the end I guarantee you will feel like you've just finished watching a nail-biting sporting event."</p>
        
            <p>Watch it on TVNZ+ and Amazon Prime.</p>

            <p>A figure skating comedy stacked with comedy big names and starring Will Ferrell and Jon Heder.</p>
        
            <p>After being given a life-time ban on competing as singles figure skaters, two flamboyant athletes with big egos pair up to skate as a team. "I think this is a really good laugh and a nice easy watch," Hollis says.</p>
        
            <p>Available on Apple TV+</p>
        
            <p>Bonus pick: Hollis says skiing film Downhill Racer (1969), starring Robert Redford and Gene Hackman is another often-recommended Olympics-related flick, and is next on his list to watch.</p>
