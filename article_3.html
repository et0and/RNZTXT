            <p>A mānuka honey-based skincare company endorsed by one of the Kardashian sisters has escalated its trademark battle against a small start-up with a similar name.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi cosmetics company Manuka Doctor has appealed the Intellectual Property Office's (IPO) earlier decision to allow the Whataroa-based essential oils business to trade under the name of Manuka Medic.</p>
        
            <p>Manuka Doctor told the High Court at Wellington this week that the names were too similar and would likely confuse consumers.</p>
        
            <p>But Manuka Medic believed any reasonable customer would not mix the two.</p>
        
            <p>Manuka Medic founder Rory Hill told NZME it had been demoralising having to fight a financial Goliath when he was just trying to get his business off the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"I figure they have a bit of money to spend and can afford to see how effective an appeal can be," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Seems like they've got money to burn and are just throwing darts at the wall."</p>
        
            <p>Hill claimed Manuka Doctor's attempts to stop him from using the name was an effort to monopolise mānuka and its health benefits.</p>
        
            <p>His company began in 2018 after Hill moved from Queenstown to the West Coast where he found his sensitive skin cleared up when around native mānuka trees.</p>
        
            <p>From there, he and his dad began distilling the bushes in an old dairy vat they turned into a still and started selling the essential oil at markets and through Hill's website Blackburn Botanicals.</p>
        
            <p>However, when he went to register the brand name Manuka Medic he was taken to the IPO by Manuka Doctor.</p>
        
            <p>Manuka Doctor has been selling skincare products containing extracts from the mānuka plant for nearly a decade and in 2016 it announced Kourtney Kardashian as one of its brand ambassadors.</p>
        
            <p>In an ad by Manuka Doctor, the eldest Kardashian sister, who was recently in New Zealand with her husband Travis Barker and his band Blink-182, said she had been using the products for years before the company asked if she wanted to represent the brand.</p>
        
            <p>Kardashian continues to back the products.</p>

            <p>At the appeal, Hill's counsel Matt Sumpter used the analogy of a multi-storey car park to describe the trademark law in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He said the lower level spaces were wider and reserved for larger, more distinctive, and often made-up names like Google or Microsoft.</p>
        
            <p>"As you get higher up the building, the spaces get narrower because they have less distinctiveness," Sumpter said at the hearing.</p>
        
            <p>"If you choose a mark that has a descriptive quality to it then you have to park at the top of the building, and you have to accept that someone might park next to you.</p>
        
            <p>"They might even clip your wing mirror."</p>
        
            <p>Sumpter submitted no one could keep the word "mānuka" to themselves and pointed to other traders who used the word such as Manuka Clinic, Manuka Health and Manuka Care.</p>
        
            <p>"In taking some care, consumers of mānuka-based products are to be given some credit. They are quite simply unlikely to mix up Doctor and Medic when making a considered purchase of relatively expensive therapeutic items," Sumpter said.</p>
        
            <p>"No reasonable consumer is likely to mix the marks up because they look or sound the same."</p>
        
            <p>Sumpter submitted Manuka Doctor was attempting to assert control of the "central message and idea" of mānuka oil as a health product.</p>
        
            <p>"But in doing so it reaches too far. It has no right to stretch its narrow monopoly wider than the law allows," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Manuka Doctor's lawyer Greg Arthur, KC, used Sumpter's analogy against him in his submissions.</p>
        
            <p>"They're clipping the wing mirror and confusing the point," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if the car spaces are narrow it's still possible for the car next to you to come too close and this is one of those times."</p>
        
            <p>Arthur's submissions centred on the two trademarks being linguistically similar, having the same cadence and that the average consumer would likely get them mixed up.</p>
        
            <p>He said trademarks should be compared by a consumer's imperfect recollection rather than a direct side-by-side comparison.</p>
        
            <p>"There would be a number of shoppers who would react to seeing Manuka Medic by saying 'I think that's what I bought recently', or 'I think that's what my friend purchased'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a likelihood of confusion."</p>
        
            <p>Arthur said the company accepted the word "mānuka" had a descriptive element but did not describe the products it sold.</p>
        
            <p>"It has the therapeutic benefit of mānuka but it is not mānuka," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If my product registration was mānuka then we'd have a problem, but it's not.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not hanging our hat on mānuka, we're hanging our hat on the entirety of the trademark."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Paul Radich, who heard the appeal, will release his decision in the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>NZME editorial note: Correct spelling of mānuka includes a macron above the 'a'. However, neither of the two companies in this story uses a macron in its trademark. When referencing a trademark or brand in relation to these companies NZME has omitted a macron, but when reference is made to the mānuka plant itself we have used one.</p>
