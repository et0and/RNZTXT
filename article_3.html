            <p>Pacific leaders and medical practitioners in Aotearoa New Zealand say they are saddened and "surprised" but supportive of Sir Collin Tukuitonga's decision to resign from his government advisory roles.</p>
        
            <p>"I really don't want to work for this government. I have no confidence. They are not going to treat Pacific people well and I want to be free to speak up and speak out," Sir Collin told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Former minister of Pacific peoples Aupito William Sio was admittedly "surprised" by Sir Collin's resignation but said: "I fully understand it".</p>
        
            <p>"It is better that he is outside not chairing the [Te Whatu Ora] Pacific Senate. As a professional and clinician you want that voice to critique the government's new direction in terms of health," Sio said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Pacific health national director Markerita Poutasi said: "We wish Sir Collin well and thank him for his support during the establishment phase of the Fatu Fono Ola (Pacific Health Senate)".</p>
        
            <p>Sio said the resignation had caused "some nervousness within the Pacific community".</p>
        
            <p>''They [Pasifika] need a strong sense of certainty from this government. There is some mixed messaging coming from different ministers.</p>
        
            <p>"National is trying to unite those divergent views. It is quite hard and messy. We would hope as voters that they become a co-ordinated government that speaks with one voice and not three different voices."</p>

            <p>It was still "early days," but recent decisions by government were telling, Sio said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are quite content to allow for a minority group to die from smoking and say well it is their personal responsibility, without any regard to the data that shows how addictive the drugs are in cigarettes and it is hard for anybody to stop."</p>
        
            <p>Sio was "really pleased" that Dr Shane Reti was minister for pacific peoples and minister for health, because he believed Reti was "well suited" for the roles.</p>
        
            <p>Although he suspected there may be more resignations to come, Sio said it was important for some to remain to "fight from inside".</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said along with Steve Maharey and other public servants who had resigned, Sir Colin's decision showed those involved in Māori and Pacific health had absolutely no confidence in the government.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's sending out a very loud message on where the government needs to straighten itself up and delivering to the rest of the population instead of just those that have funded their parties."</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch-based Pacific community advocate Melissa Lama said she was "very sad and gutted" that Sir Collin had stepped down.</p>

            <p>Although she "understood his perspective and respected his courage and heart", she was adamant to get back into the public sector and influence policies for Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>"I am willing to work in this space. I haven't been in the sector for three years but I want back in because of the changing government. I feel like this is the time we need to hold space for Pacific people."</p>
        
            <p>Lama said it seemed "very unfair" that he had to step down.</p>
        
            <p>"There has got to be a better way so we can still have a voice for our community.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Collin should not have to leave his space to speak authentically for our people and I hope that will change in the public sector."</p>
        
            <p>She hoped that the government would "listen to the voices of the people".</p>
