            <p>Habitat-printing robot birds, water-filtering sewer submarines, and flying bikes launched on waste heat thermals are just a few of the 100-plus bonkers ideas artist and industrial designer Steve Mushin is suggesting to our cities to address climate change.</p>
        
            <p>In his first picture book, Ultrawild: an audacious plan to rewild every city on earth, Mushin argues that the climate crisis demands radical creative thinking for our cities.</p>
        
            <p>Mushin began working on the book while employed as a project manager and designer at Ceres Environment Park in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>While a team carried out research on composting toilets, he started working on some "whacky ideas" and spin-off projects around composting and waste disposal.</p>

            <p>"That's really the genesis of this book - I was working on real-world projects and bit by bit I started developing funny little sketches in the margins, and that developed over time and became the book."</p>
        
            <p>One of the technologies in Ultrawild is a "compost cannon", which collects faeces - or "humanure, as it's described by poo experts" - for use in compost cannonballs.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the waste is used to produce gas, which is then used to propel the cannonballs - which are guided by GPS - into the air.</p>
        
            <p>"[Then we] drop them in the urban environment where we need some nutrients and compost."</p>
        
            <p>Mushin says some of the ideas in Ultrawild are a little ludicrous, but that is what is needed to tackle the issues facing our planet.</p>
        
            <p>The world needs to be transformed "incredibly fast" in the face of climate change and the biodiversity crisis, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Brain science suggests that being playful with ideas - pushing ideas in your mind, taking an idea, playing around with it, doing back-of-a-napkin calculations, being as playful as possible with that idea, being ludicrous with that idea - is kind of a mental yoga for creativity.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in order to transform our world as fast as we need to, we need to embrace ludicrous ideas - as an exercise for ourselves and to push our creative thinking so that we can rapidly transform cities, so that we can find the ideas we need to change."</p>
        
            <p>The book is being described as a dazzling achievement by leading climate scientist Professor James Renwick.</p>
        
            <p>As well as an exercise in thinking, it is the personal story of Mushin coming to grips with the severity of the devastation occurring to our ecosystems. </p>
        
            <p>Released in November by Allen and Unwin, Ultrawild won the nonfiction category of the Storylines Notable Book Awards for children and young people in 2023. </p>
        
            <p>Mushin has also designed the playground sculpture park projects Terra Wonder and Wombalama Wild Garden in Melbourne, which feature colossal mechanical creatures, including a bus-sized millipede.</p>
        
            <p>He was awarded an Australian Design Honours for work in sustainability design education in 2015 and works between Melbourne and Wellington.</p>
