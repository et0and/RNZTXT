            <p>A Canadian woman has been sentenced for her role in a central North Island crash which saw members of a hockey team injured.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday at 10.30am, emergency services were called to the scene of a two vehicle crash on the Napier-Taupō Road, State Highway 5 near Rangitaiki School Rd.</p>
        
            <p>A van was carrying a group of Canadian hockey players who had been playing at under-16 and under-18 competitions in Hawke's Bay and were on their way to Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released by police on Thursday, it said Renee Kelly Vanry from West Vancouver was attempting to overtake a slower vehicle near a left-hand bend, with less than 100 metres visibility.</p>
        
            <p>The van was still on the opposite side of the road when a Jeep rounded the corner and collided with it.</p>
        
            <p>The force of the impact caused the van to become airborne, landing backwards in a ditch across the road.</p>
        
            <p>Neither driver was injured, but four passengers in the van suffered a range of serious injuries and another seven were assessed and discharged that day.</p>
        
            <p>Of the four, one had flown back to Canada, with another due to return home this week, while two remained in hospital in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The police said all face many months of recovery.</p>
        
            <p>Vanry, 57, appeared in Tauranga District Court on Thursday and was sentenced on four charges of careless driving causing injury - relating to the serious injuries four of her passengers sustained - and another charge of careless driving - relating to the overtaking manoeuvre that caused the crash.</p>
        
            <p>She was disqualified from driving for six months and ordered to pay $1000 for emotional harm to each of the four victims, and $1500 for emotional harm to the other driver.</p>
        
            <p>Six other charges were withdrawn.</p>
