            <p>A man charged with the murder of woman on a bus in Onehunga has appeared in court.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the woman who died has been identified as Auckland woman Bernice Louise Marychurch.</p>
        
            <p>Marychurch suffered multiple stab wounds while on a moving bus on Church Street, and died at the scene on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Kael Leona, 37, is charged with her murder, and appeared in the Auckland District Court in front of Judge Steve Bonnar on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Leona handed himself into police on the North Shore on Thursday after an extensive search through Onehunga and Mount Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Marychurch was named in court documents as the victim of murder.</p>

            <p>Leona will next appear in the Auckland High Court on 13 November on the charge of murder, and three other charges, which were allegedly committed afterwards, but are unrelated.</p>
        
            <p>They are burglary, strangulation, and threatening to kill.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown prosecutor noted that family of the victim had been present in the court, but were not in the courtroom as Leona appeared.</p>
        
            <p>Leona did not apply for name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>He also will appear on 15 November in the Auckland District Court on two breach of release conditions and two charges of obstructing police.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Acting Detective Inspector Alisse Robertson said police will continue to be visible at transport hubs across Auckland this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport has also announced that extra transport officers have been deployed to the route the bus was taking when the incident unfolded on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Maungakiekie-TƒÅmaki Local Board chair Maria Meredith told Morning Report the Onehunga community had been on edge after another death in the Auckland suburb in August.</p>
        
            <p>There was relief in the community that a man had handed himself in to police regarding the incident, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers working on the inquiry would still like to hear from anyone who witnessed the attack.</p>
