        <h2>Green Party cancels meeting over Darleen Tana</h2>
        <p>
The last-minute cancellation comes as the former Green MP takes a bid to prevent being thrown out of Parliament to court.
</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party has agreed to cancel this weekend's meeting on whether to invoke the waka-jumping law to have MP Darleen Tana removed from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Last week the former Green MP filed for an injunction seeking to stop the party holding its meeting, planned for this Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Tana appeared at the High Court at Auckland on Thursday alongside her lawyer Sharyn Green.</p>
        
            <p>Green told Justice Simon Moore both parties had reached an agreement and would defer to a substantive hearing until 12 September.</p>
        
            <p>Until then, the Green Party had agreed not to go ahead with its meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"You've been able, between the two of you, to sort out the road forward," Justice Simon Moore said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for your obvious co-operation."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Swarbrick said the party would defer the meeting until legal proceedings were concluded.</p>
        
            <p>"The Greens have no desire to be caught up in protracted legal proceedings and are doing everything we can to ensure things progress without undue delay," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will, unfortunately, not be able to confirm a new date until we are confident in the appropriate conclusion of legal proceedings."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said the party would continue to be transparent about the proceedings.</p>
