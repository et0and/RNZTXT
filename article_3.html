        <h2>Why is the popularity of crate beers increasing?</h2>
        <p>
A growing demand for crate beers in recent years appears to defy the trend of declining alcohol consumption rates.

            <p>A growing demand for crate beers in recent years appears to defy the trend of declining alcohol consumption rates in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>The Swappa Crate has been around in New Zealand for more than 100 years, and is commonly found in student flats, sports clubs, and farm sheds.</p>
        
            <p>The wooden box, holding 12 745ml bottles of beer, requires a deposit on your first purchase; when it is returned with the empty bottles, subsequent crates come at the cost of the beer only. Meanwhile, the bottles are washed, refilled and sent back to the stores.</p>
        
            <p>The Swappa Crate scheme is run by the Associated Bottlers Company, or ABC, which is jointly owned by the country's two largest breweries: Lion and DB.</p>
        
            <p>ABC general manager Philip Barlow said the demand for crate bottles reached its peak in the 1970s, but then began to decline with the rise of kegs and cans.</p>
        
            <p>"But from 2015 we actually have been seeing a bit of a growth," Barlow said.</p>
        
            <p>He said other than in 2020, with liquor stores having to close during lockdowns, sales had been steadily increasing year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Lion said its crates were growing around 3 percent volume growth year on year, with the on-premise channel driving most of that thanks to a strong presence of the 745ml bottles in sports clubs.</p>
        
            <p>That bucks the trend of beer consumption in New Zealand in recent years, which has slowly been declining.</p>
        
            <p>The latest Stats NZ data shows the total volume of beer available in 2023 fell 4.4 percent compared with 2022.</p>

            <p>Since 2017, there's also been a shift in market preference regarding the strength of beers, with the majority sold now sitting between 4.35-5 percent ABV, overtaking the sales of those in the alcohol bracket below. All of the crate beer brands available sit in that lower bracket, at around 4 percent ABV.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Barlow said there were two main reasons.</p>
        
            <p>"The green ethic and the fact you're buying refillables, with reusing the best form of recycling [is one], however, there's [also] a financial benefit to using crates in that it is a cheap way to buy beer," Barlow said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not the boutique type beers, but we have a very loyal customer base."</p>
        
            <p>He said sales tended to be strong in regional New Zealand, though the South Island had a particularly good showing, having returned more crates in 2023 than in previous years.</p>
        
            <p>While Swappa Crates have always had a reliable market in regional New Zealand, the introduction of Crate Day in 2009 saw the large bottles gain more publicity.</p>
        
            <p>Crate Day was started by commercial radio station The Rock, with those taking part encouraged to consume a crate beer with friends on the first Saturday in December.</p>
        
            <p>Barlow said ABC was never involved in the promotion of the event, and it had unfortunately taken on a life of its own, with The Rock ending the promotion in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea was to share a crate with your mates over a barbecue, but now it's turned into a bit of a binge drinking thing; it sort of developed into something that it wasn't intended to be."</p>
        
            <p>Barlow said the growth in crate beer demand seems unrelated to the event, and both Lion and DB have always distanced themselves from it and promoted responsible drinking.</p>
