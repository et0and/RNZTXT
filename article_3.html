        <p>
About one in 10 drug samples KnowYourStuffNZ tested this year were not what they were sold as or thought to be.

            <p>A drug checking service has warned festival goers that partaking in risky drug taking could put a downer on their fun.</p>
        
            <p>KnowYourStuffNZ general manager Casey Spearing said combining MDMA, also known as ecstasy, with alcohol was one the most widespread high-risk behaviours they saw at summer festivals.</p>
        
            <p>Spearing said a University of Otago study this year found most users were consuming 7 to 9 standard drinks while taking MDMA.</p>
        
            <p>"We know high-risk drug practices like mixing drugs or taking very high doses are going to cause harm at festivals this summer."</p>
        
            <p>She acknowledged there were risks involved in taking any substance, including alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>But she said there were measures people could take to look after themselves and their friends if taking drugs.</p>
        
            <p>"No drug use is completely safe.</p>
        
            <p>"But there are some ways of using drugs that are more safe than others."</p>
        
            <p>If taking MDMA, Spearing suggested substituting alcoholic drinks with flavoured fizzy water or non-alcoholic beer.</p>
        
            <p>"You won't miss the alcohol and you're reducing your risk when taking MDMA."</p>
        
            <p>She said the service was looking into what concerning substances might be circulating over the summer.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing MDMA being substituted for synthetic cathinones, sometimes called bath salts, some funky ketamine analogues, and a variety of other things."</p>
        
            <p>She said China recently banning the production of several novel psychedelic substances could have knock-on effects here.</p>
        
            <p>"When production stops there's usually stock left over. We'll probably see some of that entering the illicit market.</p>
        
            <p>"We can expect new compounds to be produced to get around that ban. So we could see some new and unexpected things arriving."</p>
        
            <p>About one in 10 drug samples KnowYourStuffNZ tested this year were not what they were sold as or thought to be.</p>
        
            <p>Spearing recommended always getting drugs checked by them or another drug checker even if purchased from a trusted person.</p>
        
            <p>She added that reagent tests were not always accurate.</p>
        
            <p>"Results from a reagent test are less reliable than visiting an actual drug checking service.</p>
        
            <p>"It's relatively easy to fool these tests and drug dealers know this."</p>
        
            <p>She told people to check High Alert, New Zealand's drug warning system, for the latest updates.</p>
        
            <p>At upcoming festivals, Spearing urged people to keep an eye on others.</p>
        
            <p>"Have a conversation with mates before taking anything; how are you feeling, what's going on in your life, are you on any medication that might interact?</p>
        
            <p>"Put a plan together and decide who is going to be your sober tripster. That person is invaluable if something goes wrong."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was also crucial to know the warning signs of any substance you are taking and when to get help.</p>
        
            <p>She said taking time to hydrate could save people from a gnarly hangover.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of a hangover is sleep deprivation.</p>
        
            <p>"Buy electrolytes, watch your water intake, and watch your body temperature."</p>
        
            <p>The drug checking service is celebrating ten years of harm reduction in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Spearing said the organisation had been operating in a "grey area" since 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"Our goal has always been to offer a confidential and non-judgemental conversation about drug use."</p>
        
            <p>Three years ago, New Zealand started allowing organisations such as KnowYourStuffNZ and the NZ Drug Foundation to legally operate drug checking services.</p>
        
            <p>This New Years, KnowYourStuffNZ are attending AUM, Northern Bass, and Twisted Frequency.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Drug Foundation would be covering drug checking at Gisborne's Rhythm and Vines.</p>
        
            <p>But Spearing said there continued to be not enough testing equipment to meet demand.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had to turn away multiple New Years events, particularly in the South Island and the Bay of Plenty, where we are providing pre-festival clinics instead."</p>
        
            <p>The service planned to hold clinics in Mount Maunganui in conjunction with Tauranga City Council, and in the Wanaka Queenstown area in conjunction with Rhythm&Alps and the Queenstown Lakes District Council.</p>
        
            <p>Spearing said several spectrometers needed to remain in cities to serve non-festivalgoers.</p>
        
            <p>She said they there were 11 spectrometers in the drug checking organisations shared pool, and they borrowed another three over New Years from educational and scientific institutes.</p>
        
            <p>"The spectrometer issue always comes up over New Years.</p>
        
            <p>"All we need is another two or three spectrometers and we'd be able to go to very New Years festival."</p>
        
            <p>She said a spectrometer could cost upwards of $50,000.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love more spectrometers but it's quite a stretch to buy more without more funding."</p>
