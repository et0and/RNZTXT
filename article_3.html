            <p>When the weather turns cooler, many of us switch from cereal and smoothies to a warm bowl of porridge for breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>Porridge - or oatmeal, as it's known in North America - has been a breakfast staple for hundreds of years in northern Europe. In Asia, a variation made from rice known as congee has a similarly long history.</p>
        
            <p>However, while nutritionists love to sing its praises, some people might find that a bowl of porridge leaves them feeling hungry.</p>
        
            <p>Why is that? And how can we make porridge a more filling dish?</p>
        
            <p>Yes, according to Emma Beckett, an adjunct senior lecturer at UNSW and a nutrition scientist at FOODiQ Global.</p>
        
            <p>"Oats are very nutritious," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"They are high in beta-glucan, which helps reduce cholesterol and might help with blood pressure and blood sugar control.</p>
        
            <p>"Oats have lots of fibre, which is good for the gut and the gut bacteria that keep us healthy. They have a diverse range of nutrients, particularly manganese, copper, and B vitamins, and they have lots of bioactives, [which are] compounds in whole foods that have health benefits, including those that act as antioxidants."</p>
        
            <p>Standard porridge - oats cooked in water and served with a splash of milk and a sweetener, such as honey or brown sugar - is rich in complex carbohydrates.</p>
        
            <p>"But it is low in fat and protein, which stimulate signals of fullness and satisfaction - the science word is satiety - so it can leave some people feeling hungry again quickly," Dr Beckett says.</p>
        
            <p>The type of oats you use also matters.</p>
        
            <p>Quick and instant oats are more processed than rolled or steel-cut oats, which means that while they're faster to prepare, they're also quicker to digest - which will leave you feeling hungry sooner.</p>
        
            <p>There are several ways to make porridge more filling.</p>
        
            <p>One option is to add ingredients high in protein and fat to increase satiety.</p>
        
            <p>Nutritionist Jessica Cox says with these additions, "it takes the porridge longer to break down in our digestive system, therefore keeping us fuller for longer".</p>
        
            <p>She suggests adding a scoop of protein powder, nut butter, or a handful of chopped nuts or seeds - particularly high-protein hemp seeds - to your porridge.</p>
        
            <p>And while it may raise eyebrows, adding an egg is another effective way to boost the amount of protein in your porridge.</p>
        
            <p>"Before you add the milk to your porridge, tip it into a small bowl and whisk an egg or two into it, and then pour that into the oats as they're cooking," she says.</p>
        
            <p>The result is porridge that has "a creamier, custard-like consistency".</p>
        
            <p>Dr Beckett suggests adding a source of fat to the dish, such as full-cream dairy milk. "Don't be tempted to just go for water as the lower-calorie option," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"Or don't just eat porridge - have porridge and a glass of milk, or porridge and an omelette."</p>
        
            <p>And finally, changing the base grain is another way to supercharge your breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>"Traditional porridge is usually oats, but you can use other grains that are naturally high in protein, like a millet porridge or a buckwheat porridge," Cox says.</p>
        
            <p>Other oat alternatives include quinoa or brown rice.</p>
        
            <p>The good news is, "these grains are a lot more accessible in the supermarkets now," she says.</p>
