            <p>Sherwood School has closed and said this was due to a "bomb threat we received via email".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they were making enquiries into emails of a concerning nature directed to a number of organisations in TƒÅmaki Makaurau today.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working to establish the origin of the emails and have yet to establish any actual threat to any organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff are working with those impacted and each organisation may respond differently according to their individual circumstances and the information available to them."</p>
