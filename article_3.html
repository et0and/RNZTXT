            <p>Three households have self-evacuated as firefighters battle multiple wildfires in two rural areas of the Waitaki District.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the fires were reported shortly after midnight.</p>
        
            <p>In the Nenthorn area, about 30km from Middlemarch, Fire and Emergency incident controller Bobby Lamont said crews had been working on three separate fires, burning in windy conditions.</p>
        
            <p>With two of the fires they were focused on protecting buildings and had limited options for other firefighting until daylight, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Lamont said three households had self-evacuated and told anyone else in the area feeling uneasy or unsafe about remaining in their homes to also leave.</p>
        
            <p>Three helicopters, three tankers and five additional crews would be brought in during the morning.</p>
        
            <p>He said Nenthorne, Ramrock and Butter and Egg Roads were all closed.</p>
        
            <p>There was also a fire burning in the Earthquakes area about 7km from Duntroon, estimated to be about 20ha in size.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Commander Phil Marsh said no structures were at risk and two helicopters and heavy machinery would be working on the fire this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke from the Earthquakes fire was noticeable in Oamaru and prompted several 111 calls earlier this morning, he said.</p>
