        <h2>Call for four-lane highway between Auckland and Kaikohe</h2>
        <p>
A thinktank is urging the government to upgrade the "dilapidated" SH1 as soon as possible to unlock Northland's potential.

            <p>Building a four-lane expressway from Auckland to Kaikohe could benefit the region by more than $500m a year and the government should start work now, a report has found.</p>
        
            <p>Those are among the findings of a report commissioned by the Northland Corporate Group (NCG), representing five of the region's biggest companies, and written by thinktank New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) .</p>
        
            <p>The report's authors said "robust and resilient" road connections were needed to unlock Northland's potential, and urged the government to upgrade the "dilapidated" State Highway 1 between Auckland and Whangārei as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>That could be followed by making the road between Whangārei and Kaikohe four lanes.</p>
        
            <p>The report was launched at Whangarei's Semenoff Stadium on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>NCG co-chair and Northpower chief executive Andrew McLeod said Northland's resources and proximity to Auckland meant the region was well positioned to contribute to the national economy.</p>
        
            <p>However, decades of chronic underinvestment and patchwork upgrades to SH1 had isolated Northland and tarnished the region's business reputation, he said.</p>

            <p>McLeod applauded the government's commitment to a new four-lane route around the Brynderwyn Hills, and to four-laning the highway from Whangarei to Port Marsden, and Warkworth to Wellsford.</p>
        
            <p>"But greater ambition is needed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The NCG was calling for a wholesale upgrade of SH1 from Auckland to Whangārei and beyond to Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>"Without that, we're stuck in a loop of piecemeal upgrades creating bottlenecks and backlogs that will continue to be the chokehold on our economic potential," McLeod said.</p>
        
            <p>He also called on the Government to use its new fast-track consenting to accelerate construction of the Northland Expressway, given the fragile nature of the current highway and the likelihood of increasingly frequent extreme weather.</p>
        
            <p>McLeod said building "critical road linkages" between Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty had led to economic growth, improved social outcomes and more residential development in those regions.</p>
        
            <p>The same could happen in the North, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rob Kirwan, managing director of Culham Engineering, said his company moved 25,000 tonnes of steel up and down SH1 each year.</p>
        
            <p>The Brynderwyns closure meant trucks had to travel via Dargaville, adding an extra day, and costs that couldn't be recovered, to the journey.</p>
        
            <p>Kirwan said he'd seen many reports calling for a better roads over the years, but this one was different.</p>
        
            <p>That was in part because most political parties agreed the highway needed to be fixed.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't wait any longer. We just need to get around the table to central government and get them to help us get this going."</p>
        
            <p>Kirwan said the next step was for Northlanders to make their voices heard by converging on social media, their MPs and government.</p>
        
            <p>Murray Jagger, chairman of Northport and Marsden Maritime Holdings, said given the chance Northland could solve many of Auckland's growing pains.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei had the only deepwater port in New Zealand with room for expansion - but shipping lines had backed away from using it after the highway's repeated closures.</p>
        
            <p>Jagger said he had watched the transformation of Hamilton, from provincial centre to thriving city, as the Waikato Expressway was built.</p>
        
            <p>"The vitality it's brought to the region is huge, and Northland will be exactly the same. As soon as you bring connectivity, all of a sudden you've got vitality and people will want to move here."</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Addressing Tuesday's launch, Northland MP Grant McCallum said the current government was focussed on infrastructure and getting things done.</p>
        
            <p>It had brought back Roads of National Significance and introduced fast-track consenting to speed up major projects, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The authors of the Te Tai Tokerau Northland Expressway report found building a four-lane road all the way to Kaikohe would bring "quantified monetary benefits" of $299m to $562m a year by 2050.</p>
        
            <p>Those benefits arose from reduced travel times for people and freight, fewer weather-related closures, and fewer serious crashes.</p>

            <p>Average travel speeds would increase from the current 67km/h to 80-90km/h, the duration of road closures would drop by 50-100 percent, and deaths and serious injuries would fall by 33-67 percent, the report predicted.</p>
        
            <p>It noted however, that the expressway could increase carbon emissions due to increased road travel.</p>
        
            <p>The report took into account the findings of a major survey of 800 Northland businesses carried out in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>More than half said a four-lane highway would increase their revenue and reduce costs by at least 5 percent, half said they would hire more staff, and a third would bring forward more than $100,000 of investment.</p>
        
            <p>Based on those survey results, the report's authors estimated Northland businesses would lift their productivity by 2.5 percent, and Northland's GDP would increase by $2.1 billion per year by 2048.</p>
        
            <p>The expressway would also boost GDP in the rest of the country by an estimated $1.2 billion.</p>
        
            <p>While no costings have been done for a four-lane Northland Expressway, the authors noted similar projects had cost between $30m and $60m per kilometre.</p>
        
            <p>That would make a total cost of $5.5 billion to $11.1 billion, with the 98km Warkworth-Whangārei section costing an estimated $3.0-$5.9b and the 86km from Whangārei-Kaikohe about $2.6-$5.1b.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, the famously expensive, 56km-long Transmission Gully project near Wellington cost $1.5 billion, while the 128km Waikato Expressway came with a price tag of just over $1.6 billion.</p>
        
            <p>The report writers said the government should start work immediately on a detailed options appraisal, design, and full cost-benefit analysis.</p>
        
            <p>The government should also investigate the use of private financing to accelerate the project, they added.</p>
