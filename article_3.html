            <p>The owners of an Auckland restaurant once ranked one of the best fine dining establishments in the world has announced it will be closing soon.</p>
        
            <p>The Grove, which "serves modern New Zealand food with a French twist" on Wyndham Street, will open its doors for the last time on 1 March.</p>
        
            <p>"After two unforgettable decades, it's with a heavy heart that we announce the closing of The Grove Restaurant," owners Michael and Annette Dearth said on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision was not made lightly, but as we reflect on the past 20 years, we are overwhelmed with gratitude for the incredible journey we've shared with you.</p>
        
            <p>"From humble beginnings to achieving accolades beyond our dreams, we are immensely proud of what we've built - a place where people come together to celebrate milestones, share meals, and create memories that will last a lifetime."</p>
        
            <p>The Grove in 2018 was ranked number nine in the Traveller's Choice Awards on the international travel website Trip Advisor.</p>
        
            <p>Before then, the restaurant won accolades at the Metro Peugeot Awards and the Cuisine Good Food Awards, and was named one the best 100 hundred restaurants in the world by French ranking and restaurants guide La Liste.</p>
        
            <p>"The Grove has been more than just a restaurant - it's a family. And you have been at the heart of it all, so we thank you," the Dearths said.</p>
        
            <p>They also own waterfront restaurant Baduzzi, which will remain open.</p>
        
            <p>Michael told the NZ Herald there were "a lot of reasons" for shutting The Grove.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been such a fight - from the pandemic, to so much uncertainty [with the] global financial crisis and extreme weather events where suddenly vegetables cost more than protein…</p>
        
            <p>"To produce what our expectations are for this restaurant and to keep up with those expectations that we have and that other people have for The Grove... you know, there's only so much we can charge."</p>
        
            <p>When the renewal of their lease came up, the Dearths told the Herald they did not want to commit to another six years.</p>
        
            <p>Famous guests they have served included Pat Benatar, Michael Stipe, Eva Longoria and Sir Ian McKellen.</p>
