            <p>A 13-year-old has been charged with murder over the fatal stabbing of a Dunedin high schooler.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager, who cannot be identified due to their age, is due to appear in court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the Dunedin Bus Hub, on Great King Street, just after 3pm Thursday as students were heading home from school.</p>
        
            <p>A 16-year-old Trinity Catholic College student was rushed to hospital but later died from his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Police found a knife at the scene and were working to figure out what led to the stabbing.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Coastal Area Commander Inspector Marty Gray said security staff were working at the bus hub when the incident took place.</p>
        
            <p>They quicky intervened when they noticed the altercation, Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have been aware of anti-social behaviour at the bus hub for some time and have been working closely with the Dunedin City Council, Otago Regional Council and other partners to address this issue.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been extra CCTV put in place, as well as security staff patrolling the area.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have increased our foot and car patrols in the area focussing on peak times to ensure high visibility of police officers."</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem was expected to be carried out on Friday and next of kin were still being told.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Kallum Croudis said police wanted to hear from anyone who had photos or footage of what happened.</p>
