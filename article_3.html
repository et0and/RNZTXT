            <p>A new photograph of Prince Louis taken by his mother has been released to mark his sixth birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Catherine, the Princess of Wales, is receiving treatment after a cancer diagnosis.</p>
        
            <p>After the controversy over changes to a Mother's Day family photograph, Kensington Palace has assured that this picture has not been edited.</p>
        
            <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are grateful for birthday messages for their son, says a palace spokesman.</p>
        
            <p>With calls for Catherine to be given privacy while she has cancer treatment, the palace says it was aware of the difficult balance in then releasing a birthday photo of Louis, but decided to put out the picture as a way of thanking those who had sent birthday wishes.</p>
        
            <p>The photograph of Louis, who is fourth in line to the throne, was taken in Windsor in the "last few days" says the palace.</p>
        
            <p>The smiling picture of the schoolboy prince was published on social media with the message: "Happy 6th Birthday, Prince Louis! Thank you for all the kind wishes today."</p>
        
            <p>This has been an "unprecedented time" for the Prince and Princess of Wales and their young family, says the palace, as Catherine continues her recovery.</p>
        
            <p>In January she had abdominal surgery and subsequent tests had resulted in a cancer diagnosis, with treatment beginning in late February.</p>
        
            <p>A family photograph taken by the princess for Mother's Day in March ended in controversy as photo agencies withdrew the picture over concerns that it had been digitally manipulated.</p>
        
            <p>That fed a frenzy of social media conspiracy theories - and when Catherine released a video statement revealing her cancer diagnosis, it was recorded independently by BBC Studios.</p>
