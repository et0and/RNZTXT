        <h2>NZ football youngster set to play on world stage in Barcelona</h2>
        <p>
At just 9-years-old, Joaquin Hollis will play at a Barça Academy competition in April.
</p>
        
            <p>Nine years of kicking a ball around at the local park has led to this moment for Joaquin Hollis - one of only 10 New Zealand players under 10 to be chosen to play on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>The 9-year-old has been selected to play football in Barcelona this April, at a competition run by Barça Academy, the junior programme associated with internationally recognised football club Barcelona FC.</p>
        
            <p>Joaquin attended an experience camp that was held by Barça Academy in Wellington at the beginning of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The academy is for children and young people between four and 18 years of age, with the aim of providing comprehensive football training.</p>
        
            <p>After the camp wrapped up, Joaquin's father, Sam Hollis, received a call from the organisers.</p>
        
            <p>He initially thought Joaquin had been selected to attend another training camp at the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"They mentioned they were going to be selecting some kids for an end of year experience camp," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They didn't mention anything about a world cup".</p>

            <p>However, Joaquin had been selected as one of just 10 players in New Zealand invited to the Barça Academy World Cup as part of the Under 10's team.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very, very proud moment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an awesome phone call to take."</p>
        
            <p>He had first noticed Joaquin's talent two years earlier, on a family trip to the park.</p>
        
            <p>"These three kids came along, they had a football and suggested we play against each other," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[Joaquin] basically schooled them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was running rings around them".</p>
        
            <p>"I was like - wow, he's pretty good!"</p>

            <p>Jamie, Joaquin's step mum, said most parents thought their children were talented, but it was another thing to have his talent recognised by professionals in Barcelona.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really a credit to his effort, hard work and skill," she said.</p>
        
            <p>After Barcelona, Joaquin will continue with his passion for football, returning home in time for the local football season to start in May.</p>
        
            <p>He would continue training with his coach, which he had done for the past six months.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to give him every opportunity," said Sam.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the same time I don't want him to overdo it.</p>
        
            <p>"I want him to enjoy the game and have fun with the game."</p>
        
            <p>Joaquin's family have set up a Givealittle page to cover travel, accommodation and tournament fees.</p>
