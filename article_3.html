            <p>Plans to redevelop a north Auckland golf course and country club have hit yet another snag, with an investor seemingly looking to pull out their money as challenges mount.</p>
        
            <p>An application was made by a creditor to the High Court to put the owner of the Gulf Harbour Country Club, Long River Investments, into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>It was made by Inovagen Limited, which lists itself as a property investor with the Companies Office.</p>
        
            <p>The court was to hear the application on April 24, but that is understood to have been delayed to May 16 at the request of Long River.</p>
        
            <p>Long River's director Wayne Bailey said he had "no comment" to make when approached by Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>The club has been surrounded in controversy, facing fervent opposition from local residents who formed a society to challenge any possible redevelopment into housing.</p>
        
            <p>Legal counsel for the Keep Whangapāraoa Green Spaces society, Chris Gedye, said it had been revealed in court that the club had $48 million in outstanding debt.</p>
        
            <p>He said that Long River had also faced claims in the Disputes Tribunal from club members seeking their fees back.</p>
        
            <p>Alarm bells first rang for residents when the club was purchased by developer Gregory Olliver.</p>
        
            <p>Their fears were realised when members received a letter saying the club would close, and a subsequent application was made to Auckland Council to sell off the northern half of the course.</p>
        
            <p>It said the land would "be sold to fund the golf course redevelopment over a more sustainable footprint".</p>
        
            <p>In the application, Long River urged the council not to allow local residents to have their say.</p>

            <p>That's because there would have to be further applications down the line to develop the land because of an encumbrance that prevented it from being used for anything other than a golf course for a thousand years.</p>
        
            <p>However, Auckland Council's appointed commissioner recently ruled that the application would be notified and open to submissions from the public.</p>
        
            <p>Long River claimed in the application that it had "contracts in place" to purchase land adjacent to the course that would give it a more consolidated footprint.</p>
        
            <p>However, Stuff then revealed that deal had already fallen through, with the supposed vendor, Hopper Developments, having received its own resource consent to develop the land.</p>
        
            <p>The commissioner cited this as a reason for notification in her decision, noting works on the site "called into question the ability to purchase and use this land as the applicant suggests".</p>
        
            <p>Developer Gregory Olliver bought the country club in 2021 but was shortly after banned from being a company director for four years by the Registrar of Companies over an unrelated $836,000 earthworks bill that went unpaid.</p>
        
            <p>Its present director is Wayne Bailey, an accountant.</p>
        
            <p>A recently released decision from the Disciplinary Tribunal of the NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants shows he has now been suspended from practising as an accountant for four years.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey argued in the tribunal he ought not to be struck off entirely because he was intending to move overseas and would not be working.</p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless the tribunal decision said he "compromised the very standards that the profession is built on; integrity and independence".</p>
        
            <p>Bailey was alleged to have transferred funds from a client's trust to his own company's account without required approval, and described a valuation as "independent" when in fact he had an interest, among other "particulars".</p>
        
            <p>"His actions in each of the particulars tells of a very poor standard of practice and well below that which is acceptable in the profession," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"The tribunal considers he blurred the lines of objectivity and independence and acted in an increasingly stark situation of conflict with his clients as time progressed.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Bailey fell into amalgamating his business interests with those of his clients and, when matters deteriorated between them, they fell into conflict and he preferred his own interests over theirs."</p>
        
            <p>Bailey plead guilty and was ordered to pay $63,299 in costs.</p>
