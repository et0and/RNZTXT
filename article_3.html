            <p>Former US president Donald Trump made a triumphant entrance during the first night of the Republican National Convention, receiving a raucous ovation from the party faithful two days after a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his right ear.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 Republican National Convention kicked off this morning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, two days after the assassination attempt on former US president.</p>
        
            <p>Trump walked in with a thick bandage over the ear as the crowd chanted "Fight! Fight! Fight" and pumped their fists, a reference to his reaction in the moments after he was wounded.</p>
        
            <p>During a radio interview, former White House physician Ronny Jackson said the bullet that grazed Trump took part of the top of his ear off.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate.</p>
        
            <p>Vance - who once described Trump as "America's Hitler - would be vice president if Trump beat sitting president Joe Biden in the November election.</p>
