            <p>An Irish civil jury has found that UFC superstar Conor McGregor is liable of sexually assaulting a woman in a Dublin hotel room in December 2018.</p>
        
            <p>McGregor was ordered by the High Court in Dublin to pay the victim 248,000 euros (NZ$443,000).</p>
        
            <p>No criminal charges came from the incident which allegedly occurred after the two met at a Christmas party in Dublin. The woman said McGregor forced her onto a bed and choked her.</p>
        
            <p>A paramedic treating the woman's injuries the following morning testified that he had never seen such intense bruising on a victim, reported BBC News.</p>
        
            <p>The woman said she then let McGregor do what he wanted to because she feared for her life and that she would not see her daughter again.</p>
        
            <p>"He let me go and I remember saying I was sorry, as I felt that I did something wrong and I wanted to reassure him that I wouldn't tell anyone so he wouldn't hurt me again," the woman said in court.</p>
        
            <p>She alleged that McGregor put her in a choke hold multiple times and later said, "Now you know how I felt in the Octagon where I tapped out three times," in reference to a UFC bout in which he had to admit defeat.</p>
        
            <p>McGregor has denied the accusations, saying that the two had consensual sex. He said in court of the chokehold allegation, "It is a full-blown lie among many lies. How anyone could believe that me, as a prideful person, would highlight my shortcomings."</p>
        
            <p>The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for just over six hours before deciding against McGregor's version of events.</p>
        
            <p>The woman reported the incident to the police at the time, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, citing insufficient evidence and an unlikely chance at a conviction.</p>
        
            <p>After the verdict, McGregor did not speak to reporters but posted on social media that he will appeal the decision.</p>
        
            <p>"The judge's instruction and the modest award was given for assault, not for aggravated or exemplary damages. I am disappointed that the jury did not hear all the evidence that the DDP reviewed. I am with my family now, focused on my future. Thank you to all my support worldwide," he posted.</p>
        
            <p>McGregor, 36, and his longtime fiancee, Dee Devlin, have four children.</p>
        
            <p>McGregor has not fought in UFC since sustaining a broken leg during a July 2021 loss to Dustin Poirier.</p>
        
            <p>The Ireland native is a former featherweight and lightweight champion with a record of 22-6, including 19 wins by knockout.</p>
