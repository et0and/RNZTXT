        <h2>'Very, very special' - Monfils on record-breaking ASB Classic win</h2>
        <p>
Gaël Monfils walked off Stanley Street a winner on Saturday, taking home a title that he'll cherish for a long time.
</p>
        
            <p>After a week of upsets, it took a cool and experienced head to prevail at the 2025 ASB Classic. In fact, you can't get much more experienced than Gaël Monfils, the 38-year-old veteran of 21 seasons on the ATP tour.</p>
        
            <p>In fact - the win meant that he broke the record held by Roger Federer as the oldest man to win an ATP tournament, not that Monfils actually knew it as he lifted the trophy on centre court after his 6-3 6-4 win over Zizou Bergs of Belgium.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know, you just told me," he said when informed that he'd just made tennis history.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a different record and you're always pleased to have a record, but I want to do more," he laughed. That means the Frenchman certainly has no plans to slow down as he approaches 40, remarking earlier in the week that the only thing diverting his attention from tennis was the desire to spend time with his family. However, since his wife is world number 23 Elina Svitolina, it's likely that his career is far from over.</p>

            <p>Monfils' week was certainly one that started off in a scratchy fashion and got progressively better, he said he had "ups and downs for sure".</p>
        
            <p>"The first match was, not a great match, but I was happy the way that I pushed myself to come through this win," he said in regard to his 1-6 7(7)-6 6-3 win over Pedro Martinez.</p>
        
            <p>"And at the end, it got me the title. So I'm very pleased and very happy with that."</p>
        
            <p>Monfils revealed he'd been troubled with an injury during the week.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a back problem, a little bit. We've been working quite a lot, because the pain that goes in or around the abs in the back. So honestly, thanks to (my team) and, at the end of the day, I showed great motivation, also through the week for my team."</p>

            <p>Injury or not, Monfils' body of work was that of a player that was using both his vast experience and learning a lot about the conditions and his opponents at the same time. All of the players he faced seemed to try and run him around using drop shots and it didn't work, as Monfils seemed to know in advance exactly when it would happen.</p>
        
            <p>Monfils also expertly controlled the pace of each match by sending half-cocked forehands and backhands that demanded an extra amount of effort to send back, often to only hit the net or go long.</p>
        
            <p>In short, Monfils pulled Bergs, Martinez, Jan-Lennard Struff, Facundo Diaz Acosta and Nishesh Basavareddy into his end of the pool and forced them to sink or swim.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very happy about that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been playing solid tennis, very consistent even today. It was a little bit different conditions… but I felt like, with first day with windy conditions… I could manage a little bit different."</p>
        
            <p>Monfils was also humbled to be greeted on court with a haka and presented with the tournament taiaha by representatives of the local Ngāti Whātua iwi.</p>
        
            <p>"I really love that, I respect that, you know. I felt the energy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when you have the chance to be really close to them, you feel the energy. To feel it through your body is very special. So I'm very happy that I could experience that, once in my life."</p>
