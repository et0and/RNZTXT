            <p>Angry residents booed and threw eggs at Spain's King Felipe as he visited the Valencia region, where more than 200 people have died in devastating floods.</p>
        
            <p>Some in the crowd shouted "murderers" when Felipe visited Paiporta, just outside of Valencia city, along with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and regional governor Carlos Mazon</p>
        
            <p>After they posed for a photo, the crowd began hurling insults at the king and Mazon. The crowd surged towards the king who tried to shield himself with an umbrella.</p>
        
            <p>Confronted by one resident, Felipe remained calm and lowered his umbrella to listen to him as police struggled to control those gathered.</p>

            <p>At least 214 people are now confirmed dead from the floods and the toll may climb higher. One of the latest confirmed dead was a 70-year-old woman whose body was found more than 12 kilometres from her house</p>
        
            <p>The slow and uncoordinated response to the crisis has infuriated many in Valencia.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday local time, Sanchez ordered 5000 more troops to help with salvage efforts in flooded areas, calling the storm the "worst natural disaster" in the county's history.</p>
        
            <p>He addressed the anger and frustration at the slow response by authorities, admitting it was "not enough".</p>
        
            <p>"I know that. I know that there are severe problems and shortages," he said. "That there are still collapsed services. Municipalities buried by mud. Desperate people searching for their relatives. People who cannot access their homes. Homes destroyed and buried by mud.</p>
        
            <p>"I know we have to do better and we have to give our all."</p>
