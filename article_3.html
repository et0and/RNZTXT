            <p>Russia has charged four men it says carried out the attack in a Moscow concert hall that killed at least 137 people.</p>
        
            <p>The suspects were marched blindfolded into a Moscow court to face a charge of committing an act of terrorism.</p>
        
            <p>The Islamic State group said it carried out Friday's outrage at Crocus City Hall, and posted video from the attack.</p>

            <p>Russian officials have claimed, without evidence, Ukrainian involvement. Kyiv says the claim is "absurd".</p>
        
            <p>The men appeared in court on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>They were named as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov.</p>
        
            <p>Video showed some of them being marched blindfolded by masked police into Basmanny district court in the Russian capital. All appeared to have been injured.</p>
        
            <p>Mirzoyev and Rachabalizoda's eyes were blackened and the latter's ear was heavily bandaged - reportedly from it being partially severed during his arrest.</p>
        
            <p>Fayzov was brought into court in a wheelchair and appeared to have an eye missing, according to the Reuters news agency. Fariduni's face was badly swollen.</p>
        
            <p>A court statement on the Telegram messaging service said Mirzoyev was a citizen of Tajikistan and "admitted his guilt in full". Rachabalizoda, whose nationality was not disclosed, also "admitted guilt", it said.</p>
        
            <p>All four are to be held in detention until at least 22 May, the court added.</p>
