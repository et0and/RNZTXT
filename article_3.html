            <p>Ireland Highlight - Played in every game of the Grand Slam winning side in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Snapshot - At 18, Aki worked as bank teller to provide for his first child, prior to signing for Counties Manukau in 2011 and winning a Super title two years later with the Chiefs. Was eligible for both New Zealand and Samoa, but took his talents to Ireland which caused a stir in traditional Irish rugby circles In 2014, Aki was recruited to Connacht, the club winning the Pro12 in 2016. Has racked up numerous records in the United Rugby Championship, including most defenders beaten. Became eligible in 2017 on residency, making his debut against the USA. Quickly made his mark, making 17 tackles as Ireland beat South Africa by a record 38-3, he became a colossus of the Irish backline, selected for The British & Irish Lions Tour of South Africa in 2021, starting in the third test and was in imperious form at the 2023 World cup, scoring a cracker against the All Blacks in the quarterfinal. Regarded among the best midfielders in the game today, and our greatest Kiwi export to Europe.</p>

            <p>Snapshot - Another from the sensational Junior All Blacks class of 2011, Anscombe led the Under 20 side to World Cup glory with a tournament high 84 points. Touted as the Blue's saviour at ten, he was soon shunted by the franchise after one year and made his move south to the Chiefs where he featured at fullback in the 2013 title-winning campaign. Qualifying for Welsh residency through his mother, Anscombe joined Cardiff in 2014 and made his international debut in 2015. A central figure in Wales' 2019 Six Nations victory before a serious knee injury put him out of action from 2019 to 2021 and limiting his time at Ospreys. Moved to Japan in 2023 but a groin injury saw him back in Wales just two weeks later. Joined Gloucester this year and rediscovered his form and reclaimed his test jersey.</p>

            <p>Snapshot - Played for New Zealand Secondary Schools before making his Taranaki debut in 2012 and the Hurricanes in a year later. Moved to the Blues in 2015, Gibson-Park never quite racked the top echelon of halfbacks in Aotearoa. Won the NPC with Taranaki in 2014, but with TJ Perenara and Aaron Smith preferred for the All Blacks, in 2016 Gibson-Park moved to Ireland and joined Leinster after winning s Super Rugby title. He became eligible through residency in 2020 and made his debut against Italy that same year.
