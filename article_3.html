            <p>A man who allegedly blew nearly six times the legal breath alcohol limit was on a zero-alcohol licence, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The Hawke's Bay man was allegedly driving dangerously before midday on Thursday when police pulled him over.</p>
        
            <p>"This shows the importance of breath-testing every driver, regardless of the time, whether they appear intoxicated, or the reason we've stopped them," Bay of Plenty road policing manager Inspector Logan Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is just one example of the intoxicated drivers being caught across the district, with our staff seeing some ridiculous levels."</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old man is due to appear in the Taup≈ç District Court on 11 September facing a charge of driving contrary to a zero-alcohol licence and excess breath alcohol.</p>
