        <h2>Wholesale interest rates 'collapse' - here's what that means for borrowers</h2>
        <p>
Wholesale interest rates have "collapsed" - but retail home loan rates are likely to follow at a slower pace.

            <p>Wholesale interest rates have "collapsed" - but retail home loan rates are likely to follow at a slower pace.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank economists have pointed out that the two-year swap rate hit a low of 4.19 percent last week, the lowest it had traded in just under two years and well below the recent peak of more than 5.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That is being driven by a market expectation that the Reserve Bank is planning cuts to the official cash rate (OCR) much quickly than it has previously signalled.</p>
        
            <p>"Market traders are now pricing 15bps [basis points] of cuts in August," Kiwibank's economists said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a 60 percent chance of a rate cut in just a couple weeks' time. And looking ahead, traders have priced in just over 75bps of cuts by November. That's a whopping three cuts."</p>
        
            <p>They said it made sense in the context of weaker economic data - but it was unlikely that the Reserve Bank would be willing to change its tone and cut so quickly.</p>
        
            <p>If it wanted to see inflation back within its 1 percent to 3 percent target band, November would be the earlier rate cuts could happen, they said.</p>
        
            <p>ASB senior economist Chris Tennent-Brown said he could not argue "at all" with the direction that wholesale markets were moving, although his team also still expected rate cuts not to begin until November.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk is always at times like this once you get convinced that rate cuts are coming you think why not now and why not go heaps?"</p>
        
            <p>Once cuts began, it was unlikely that there would be a "straight line all the way to lower", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We think every meeting is live and we have swung around quite a bit to price in a lot of action over the next year or so - people are fixing for quite short terms, which makes sense as a strategy."</p>
        
            <p>Retail rates would not move markedly lower until the official cash rate shifted, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we'll see some movement later this year then more steadily though the course of next year."</p>
        
            <p>But he said the five-year rate was probably not likely to move a lot, because it was already down by about a full percentage point and had not risen as much as some of the other rates to begin with.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said the average borrower did not need to worry about what was happening on wholesale markets.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of the movement was driven by foreign hedge funds placing "very large bets" that the Reserve Bank was going to cut.</p>
        
            <p>"There hasn't been much, if any, offsetting flow. If we were getting mortgage flow in the two-year, we would be paying the two-year rate as banks but we're not, we're getting six-month to one-year flow, so we don't need to hedge that with six-month or one-year swaps, because we are getting term deposit rates for six months to one year. That's a big part of the market missing," Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>"When hedge funds come in and place large bets, there's not a lot on the other side, so the moves have been exaggerated."</p>
        
            <p>He said he could not imagine the Reserve Bank cutting in August given it was contemplating an increase in May.</p>
        
            <p>"We're playing the man not the ball here, it certainly makes for some interesting discussions."</p>
        
            <p>Most households and businesses were probably sticking to the mantra of "survive until 2025" - knowing that interest rate cuts were very likely on the horizon, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, it's not so much the timing as the magnitude, how many cuts are they likely to deliver? We're saying they could easily deliver 200 [bps]."</p>
