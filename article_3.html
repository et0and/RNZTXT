            <p>There is a high risk of avalanches in parts of the South Island this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Dangerous conditions were forecast in Arthur's Pass, Aoraki/Mt Cook, Ōhau, Queenstown, Wānaka and Mount Aspiring National Park, following heavy snowfall on Friday that shut schools, closed roads and cut off power to thousands of homes.</p>
        
            <p>Mountain Safety Council chief executive Mike Daisley said back-country skiers, snowboarders and climbers should check the Avalanche Advisory before heading out.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely do [check it] this weekend if you're going into those central South Island areas. It's probably the weekend for a bit of in-skifield enjoyment, rather than back country."</p>

            <p>There was a high risk of danger in Aoraki / Mt Cook, and Ohau, where there were "very dangerous conditions", and travel in avalanche terrain was not recommended.</p>
        
            <p>In Arthur's Pass, Two Thumbs, Nelson Lakes, Queenstown, Aspiring, Wānaka and Fiordland the risk was "considerable", with dangerous conditions and "conservative decision-making essential", the Avalanche Advisory said.</p>
        
            <p>The risk at Craigieburn Range, Mt Hutt, Tongariro and Taranaki was "moderate", with heightened avalanche conditions on specific terrain.</p>
        
            <p>The warnings did not apply to people going to a ski field, where any avalanche dangers were professionally managed, Daisley said.</p>
