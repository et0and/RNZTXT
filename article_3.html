            <p>Actor David Soul, best known for his role in the television series Starsky & Hutch, has died at the age of 80.</p>
        
            <p>His wife, Helen Snell said he died on Thursday "after a valiant battle for life in the loving company of family".</p>
        
            <p>"He shared many extraordinary gifts in the world as actor, singer, storyteller, creative artist and dear friend," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"His smile, laughter and passion for life will be remembered by the many whose lives he has touched."</p>
        
            <p>The US-born actor was best known for his role as Detective Kenneth "Hutch" Hutchinson in the classic crime-solving series Starsky & Hutch.</p>
        
            <p>He starred opposite Paul Michael Glaser in the series, which ran from 1975 to 1979.</p>
        
            <p>He and Glaser reprised their roles in the 2004 remake Starsky & Hutch, starring Ben Stiller as Starsky and Owen Wilson as Hutch.</p>
        
            <p>Stiller paid tribute to Soul by reposting a clip from the original TV series on X (formerly Twitter), accompanied by the message: "Defining 70's cool. Rest in peace x."</p>
        
            <p>Soul was also known for his roles in Here Come The Brides, Magnum Force, The Yellow Rose and Salem's Lot.</p>

            <p>The author Stephen King, who wrote the horror novel that Salem's Lot was based on, said he was "sorry to hear" of Soul's death.</p>
        
            <p>He also appeared in several British television programmes including Holby City, Little Britain and Lewis. In 2004 he obtained British citizenship.</p>
        
            <p>But he turned down the chance and the lucrative pay cheque to appear on reality television shows, telling the Sunday Times: "These days anybody is a celebrity and, frankly, there's nothing to celebrate."</p>
        
            <p>The actor and singer, who was married five times, was arrested in the 1980s for attacking his then wife, Patti Carnel Sherman, who was seven months pregnant at the time.</p>
        
            <p>It was his first offence and charges against him were dropped after he completed a probationary diversion programme.</p>
        
            <p>Soul later spoke of his regret and visited prisons to talk to inmates about domestic violence.</p>
        
            <p>Born in Chicago on 28 August 1943 as David Solberg, he spent his childhood between South Dakota and post-Second World War Berlin.</p>
        
            <p>His father Dr Richard Solberg, a professor of history and political science and an ordained minister, moved them to Berlin where he was a religious affairs adviser to the US high commission.</p>
        
            <p>Before he found fame as an actor, Soul started his professional career as a folk singer, warming up audiences for stars like Frank Zappa, the Byrds, and the Lovin' Spoonful.</p>
        
            <p>He picked up an interest in music as a teenager in Mexico, where his father was a professor at a college for young diplomats.</p>
        
            <p>There, he was befriended by a group of radical students who gave him a guitar and taught him the indigenous songs of Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>Upon his return to the US, he found some success playing those songs around Minneapolis - but it was only when he donned a mask and hid his face that his career really took off.</p>
        
            <p>As "The Covered Man", he was signed by the William Morris Agency and appeared on the TV talk show circuit, including multiple appearances on the highly rated Merv Griffin show.</p>
        
            <p>But when he decided to lose the mask and reveal himself, bookings dwindled and he turned to acting instead.</p>
        
            <p>Soul appeared in Star Trek, Here Come The Brides, Perry Mason and Johnny Got His Gun, throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>He got his break as an actor as officer John Davis in Clint Eastwood's police yarn Magnum Force, about Inspector Harold Callahan, which led to the role in Starsky & Hutch.</p>
        
            <p>Later, after the success of Starsky & Hutch, he returned to music, putting out four albums of soft rock ballads in the late 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>They produced two UK number one singles, Silver Lady and Don't Give Up On Us, snapped up by adoring fans of his TV persona.</p>
        
            <p>A New York Times review of his first post-fame concert in 1977 described "camera-wielding teenage girls charging the stage" amidst "the flicker of hundreds of exploding flashcubes and a continual squealing".</p>
        
            <p>The fervour ended after his arrest and rehab, after which he only recorded one further album - 1997's self-released Leave a Light On.</p>
        
            <p>Soul was married five times, including to actresses Sherman, Mirriam Solberg, Karen Carlson, and Julia Nickson, and had six children.</p>
        
            <p>He met Snell while performing in Deathtrap, when she was doing public relations for the play, and described her as his "soulmate".</p>
