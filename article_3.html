        <h2>Hezbollah, Israel exchange heavy fire after deadly Israeli strike</h2>

The Israeli military says it struck about 290 targets, as the conflict sharply escalates.

            <p>Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy fire into Sunday, with Israeli warplanes carrying out the most intense bombardment in almost a year of conflict across Lebanon's south and Hezbollah firing rockets deep into northern Israel.</p>
        
            <p>The Israeli military said it struck around 290 targets on Saturday, including thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels, and said it would continue to hit more targets.</p>
        
            <p>Israel closed schools and restricted gatherings in many northern areas and ordered hospitals there to transfer their operations to facilities with extra protection from rocket and missile fire.</p>
        
            <p>There were no government directives from Lebanon on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The conflict - which sharply escalated over the past week - has raged since Hezbollah opened a second front against Israel after Israel went to war with Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, triggered by the Hamas-led rampage in southern Israel on 7 October.</p>

            <p>Sirens sounded across Israel all night as multiple rockets and missiles were fired from Lebanon and Iraq, most of which were intercepted by Israeli aerial defence systems, the military said.</p>
        
            <p>Several buildings were struck, including a house badly damaged near the Israeli city of Haifa. Rescue teams treated wounded but there were no reports of deaths. Residents had been instructed to stay near bomb shelters and safe rooms.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah said it targeted the Israeli Ramat David Airbase with successive barrages of missiles, in the deepest strikes it has claimed since hostilities began.</p>
        
            <p>An official in the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a grouping of Iran-backed armed factions, said they launched cruise missile and explosive drone attacks at Israel at dawn on Sunday as part of "a new phase in our support front" with Lebanon.</p>
        
            <p>"Escalation in Lebanon means escalation from Iraq," the official said.</p>
        
            <p>The move will stoke fears the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon could spiral into the rest of the region.</p>
        
            <p>The U.N. special coordinator in Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasscharet, said in a post on X that "with the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer".</p>
        
            <p>The escalating attacks come less than 48 hours after an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah commanders in a suburb of the Lebanese capital. The death toll from that strike had risen to 45, the Lebanese health ministry said on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah said 16 members including senior leader Ibrahim Aqil and another commander, Ahmed Wahbi, were among those killed on Friday in the deadliest strike in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's army said it hit an underground gathering of Aqil and leaders of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces, and had almost completely dismantled its military chain of command.</p>

            <p>The attack levelled a multi-storey residential building in the crowded suburb and damaged a nursery next door, a security source said. At least three children and seven women were among those killed, according to the health ministry.</p>
        
            <p>Friday's strike inflicted another blow on Hezbollah after two days of attacks last week, in which pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded.</p>
        
            <p>The death toll in those attacks, widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, has risen to 39 with more than 3,000 injured. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.</p>
        
            <p>In what it said was the initial retaliation for the attacks with the exploding devices, Hezbollah posted on its Telegram channel on Sunday that it had launched rockets at Israeli military-industry facilities.</p>
        
            <p>Israel quickly responded, striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the military said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah says it will keep fighting until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>U.S. officials say that is unlikely anytime soon. Israel wants Hezbollah to cease fire and withdraw forces from the border region, adhering to a U.N. resolution signed with Israel in 2006, irrespective of any Gaza deal.</p>
        
            <p>In southern Lebanon on Saturday, people described huge explosions that lit up the night sky and shook the ground as Israel carried out its latest strikes.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who said last week Israel was launching a new phase of war on the northern border, posted on X: "The sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes."</p>
        
            <p>Tens of thousands of people have left their homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in October in sympathy with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>With at least 84 people killed in Lebanon over the past week, the conflict toll in the country since October has surpassed 750 during the worst Israel-Hezbollah flare-up since a 2006 war.</p>
