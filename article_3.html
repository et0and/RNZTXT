That is despite two papers from police that raised the matter with him.

            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell is adamant he has not seen warnings from police about gang members training at gun ranges when he agreed to changes loosening gun club regulations.</p>
        
            <p>That is despite two papers from police that raised the matter with him.</p>
        
            <p>The Arms (Shooting Clubs, Shooting Ranges, and Other Matters) Amendment Bill includes new provisions that allows non-pistol shooting ranges to only be inspected by police when the range operator is applying for their initial enrolment, and then once every five years.</p>
        
            <p>This marks a shift from the current regime, which allows inspections at any time so long as the operators are given seven days' notice.</p>
        
            <p>The bill had its first reading in late September and is going through a consultation process at select committee, set to report back in February.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's police spokesperson Ginny Andersen questioned Mitchell in Parliament on Thursday about his commitment to tackling gun-related crime, and whether he was concerned about the Police Association publicly saying they were aware of gang members using shooting ranges.</p>

            <p>The association's president Chris Cahill last week told a select committee about that happening - including since gun laws were tightened in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Andersen asked Mitchell if he stood by his previous comments in Parliament on 18 and 19 September.</p>
        
            <p>"How does he reconcile telling the House on two separate occasions that gang members were not practising on gun ranges when a police email on 9 September 2024 released under the Official Information Act states, 'I've included images of those gang members shooting .50 calibre in the South Island, one being overseen by a senior NZ Pistol shooter'," she asked.</p>
        
            <p>He responded: "Because at the time the question was asked, that's the advice that I had".</p>
        
            <p>However, a memo had been provided to Mitchell on 30 April highlighting the need for police to continue to be able to inspect ranges on a frequent basis.</p>
        
            <p>The copy provided via the Official Information Act did not, however, include confirmation the minister had seen it.</p>
        
            <p>"Such activity was disclosed during consultation on the current regulations," the memo said.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, a recent publicly available social media post showed field rifle shooting experiences being offered to individuals wearing gang patches."</p>
        
            <p>Another OIA response - this one signed off by Mitchell - showed he was provided with another warning from police about the risks of reducing the number of inspections, but not evidence it was happening.</p>
        
            <p>It pointed to two operations being actively investigated which "highlight the risk of gangs and organised criminal groups using shooting clubs and ranges to develop their skills using firearms".</p>
        
            <p>This was followed by longer section, redacted to maintain free and frank advice to ministers by the public service.</p>
        
            <p>Andersen's questions in Parliament on Thursday grew more pointed.</p>
        
            <p>"How does he explain not having that information when it was provided to him in briefings on those occasions?"</p>
        
            <p>His response was dismissive.</p>
        
            <p>"When the member asks me a question in the House, I'll respond with the information I've had at the time. It's very simple."</p>
