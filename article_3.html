            <p>New Zealand powered out to first position at the start, but the German crew sneaked up on them approaching the 250m mark.</p>
        
            <p>Germany then edged out in front to set up a thrilling finish.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington's crew proved too quick however, getting to the line in one minute and 32 seconds.</p>
