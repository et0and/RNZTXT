            <p>Speaking after the race, McKenna expressed surprise at his win: "It's still a bit too hard to believe, it's pretty emotional.</p>
        
            <p>"You never imagine that you can win, everything has to go so perfect."</p>

            <p>Two thousand athletes lined up along the shoreline of Lake Taupō at first light to brave the choppy water.</p>
        
            <p>Local iwi Ngāti Tūwharetoa rowed a waka to the shore, challenging the competitors with a rousing haka.</p>
        
            <p>While professional athletes complete the race in eight to nine hours, many competitors were expected to be cycling and running well into the night.</p>
        
            <p>The final cut-off is 17 hours after the starting gun, which will be 1am on Sunday morning. Organisers say there will still be hundreds of supporters cheering on competitors, until the last one crosses the finish line.</p>
