        <h2>Daffodil memory meadows to flush Waikato parks with yellow</h2>
        <p>
Two Waikato parks are being turned into memory meadows that will be awash with daffodils this spring, in a pilot programme by the Cancer Society.

Two new daffodil meadows will be planted soon, to create spring displays in support of the Cancer Society, and support their Daffodil Day fundraising.

            <p>Two Waikato parks are being turned into memory meadows that will be awash with daffodils this spring, in a pilot programme by the Cancer Society.</p>
        
            <p>Over the next two weekends, 20,000 daffodil bulbs will be planted in Hamilton's Hinemoa Park and Te Awamutu's Sculpture Park.</p>
        
            <p>And the Cancer Society said they hope to roll out similar memory meadows in other regions next year.</p>
        
            <p>Staff from local real estate business Lodge have supported the Cancer Society's Daffodil Day for several years. Marketing manager Kevin Walker said when they talked with the charity last year they wondered if people's engagement with the day could be fostered in a different way.</p>
        
            <p>His team thought it could be more meaningful if people were involved in planting the daffodils.</p>
        
            <p>"You always feel a bit more connected to something you have been a part of, rather than just getting the end result," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Daffodils have long been the icon of the Cancer Society in New Zealand, but it was hoped the establishment of the memory meadows would reconnect people with their message.</p>
        
            <p>"What is a lovely aspect about daffodils is that they are recognised as the symbol of hope across the world," Cancer Society chief executive Helen Carter said.</p>
        
            <p>Walker agreed, and said daffodils were a sign of hope after a long winter.</p>
        
            <p>"On Daffodil Day you get the beautiful daffodil, but it all starts in autumn when the weather is turning and things are starting to look a bit weary.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like when you get your cancer diagnosis and it's dark times. But you plant this bulb of hope ... from this mess sprouts beautiful daffodils. It really is a symbol of hope that things will get better," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>The Cancer Society said the daffodils would not be picked, but left for everyone to enjoy, and signage at the two parks would be put up to let people know about the connection.</p>
        
            <p>People would be able to make a donation and to nominate who a bulb is in honour of, which would be displayed at each memory meadow.</p>
        
            <p>The bulbs to be planted come from the council's park planting budgets with extras donated by Lodge to make sure there would be a beautiful show.</p>
        
            <p>Waipa District Council park operations team leader Matt Johnston said when the council was approached by the Cancer Society about creating a memory meadow it was an easy decision to get on board.</p>
        
            <p>"It just sounded like a great, simple way to acknowledge that the community is touched by cancer in so many ways," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said the actual planting of the daffodils was happening the old fashioned way, with a trowel and some keen green fingers.</p>
        
            <p>"So we need plenty of numbers down there on the day.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody is invited to come down and plant their memory - either of someone, or just a great memory you shared with someone who had a cancer journey."</p>
        
            <p>Walker said they want the event to be a positive day of creating fond memories, so that in spring there will be a beautiful place to remember.</p>
        
            <p>Johnston said that the planting will be tracked on the council's asset map so that when current staff are long gone the daffodils will still be secure to bloom each spring.</p>
