        <h2>Australian crowds show their boorish side at tennis open</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - It's local supporters at the Australian Open who have been the worst behaved, with actions like booing Novak Djokovic after his shock injury retirement, says tennis writer Dave Worlsey.

            <p>Analysis - The Australian Open 2025 has been the talk of the sporting world and not always for the tennis.</p>
        
            <p>Players such as Nick Kyrgios, Danielle Collins and Novak Djokovic inspired the crowd for their own benefit or detriment at this year's tournament, and it proved a bit too hot to handle.</p>
        
            <p>The semifinal retirement of Djokovic was a shame for the sport and for a 10-time champion. Fighting to stay in the match, the Serb dropped the first set again Alexander Zverev and was forced out with a leg injury which had troubled him in the previous match.</p>
        
            <p>When he left the court Djokovic was booed by a crowd who had paid big money to watch the match, but it's sport, and never certain how long or competitive it will be.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev had to step up and ask fans to show respect. Basically the Rod Laver spectators were rude to a champion player.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic later said he understood the crowd had paid money for a competitive semifinal and didn't get it, but he couldn't continue in the match.</p>
        
            <p>Surely deep down he must be feeling a little betrayed by a crowd and a city he had given so much to over the years.</p>

            <p>Earlier in the tournament Nick Kyrgios was happy to have the crowd roaring their support for him in his first-round loss to Brit Jacob Fernley, who even had first serve faults loudly cheered and copped constant abuse. However, Kyrgios questioned the umpire if a decision didn't go his way or made comments about it.</p>
        
            <p>The Aussie crowds also gave it to another Brit in Jack Draper as he battled with Aleksandar Vukic. Draper took it on the chin and kept his head even as the match went the full distance. He could have complained to officials about the noise before, during and after points, however he wisely kept his focus and eventually won.</p>

            <p>American Collins didn't accept any booing when facing Aussie Destanee Aiava. She hit back and took on the crowd tenfold.</p>
        
            <p>She became the 'Ugly American,' the 'Karen' of the tennis circuit for many and the 'villain' a sport sometimes needs by putting her hand up to her ear, telling them to kiss her backside and that they paid for her holiday.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic thought it was great for the sport but has so often had to work to gain crowd support.</p>
        
            <p>It didn't make Collins look good, not that she cared, but it also showed that tennis is not the gentile sport of polite applause anymore. New Yorkers will give heat to anyone at the US Open, the French can be insolent and lack patience, while Wimbledon still holds to tradition.</p>
        
            <p>It appears to be local supporters at the Australian Open who have been the worst behaved.</p>
        
            <p>The Brazilian fans who passionately supported youngster Joao Fonesca were flamboyant, loud, but quietened in time for the start of each point.</p>
        
            <p>The same can be said for the French fans who have been in full voice supporting veteran Gael Monfils, totally behind their player but accepting of letting the point begin.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps the Australian Open needs to look at some education for its own fans? Or should players just accept that boorish behavior is a part of the sport?</p>
