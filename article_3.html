            <p>Philip Polkinghorne looked up "leg edema after strangulation" the day after his wife's death, a court has heard.</p>
        
            <p>The former Auckland eye surgeon is on trial, accused of murdering his wife Pauline Hanna in 2021 and staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown argues Polkinghorne strangled his wife and went to great lengths to stage her death as a suicide. But his defence argues Hanna ended her life after after struggling with depression for many years.</p>
        
            <p>Police detective Andrew Reeves told the High Court in Auckland on Friday that Polkinghorne used the search engine Duck Duck Go to get information about strangulation on 6 April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said Duck Duck Go was designed to be untraceable, but police were able to recover the search result.</p>
        
            <p>After seizing Polkinghorne's electronic devices, Reeves said police also found he accessed WhatsApp minutes before calling police the day Hanna died, but these messages were deleted.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said all of Polkinghorne's WhatsApp messages before 5 April were deleted, which he found odd.</p>
        
            <p>After his first police interview on 5 April, Detective Reeves said Polkinghorne searched on Safari how to delete iCloud storage. Polkinghorne deleted phone call logs three days after Hanna died, Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves also analysed USB drives belonging to Polkinghorne. He said one had saved images of knot-tying techniques.</p>
        
            <p>Another had a photo of a meth pipe with "Sweet Puff" written on the side. Polkinghorne could be seen in the reflection of the photo.</p>
        
            <p>"He's naked while taking a photo," said Reeves.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the trial, the court heard the meth pipe was found at Polkinghorne's workplace, Auckland Eye.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation by Auckland Eye could not determine the owner of the pipe.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said Polkinghorne regularly messaged Sydney escort, Madison Ashton, and another sex worker after his wife died.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Reeves said Ashton told Polkinghorne what to wear to his wife's funeral.</p>
        
            <p>"Do not wear a f***ing bow tie at the funeral."</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said Polkinghorne booked flights to visit Ashton in Australia between 20 April and 2 May 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He said Polkinghorne and Ashton discussed living together.</p>
        
            <p>Ashton was found with Polkinghorne at a luxury lodge in Mt Cook in April, where police seized her phone.</p>
        
            <p>On 12 April, Polkinghorne also contacted another sex worker known as Rachel/Alaria that he had thought about Ubering to her, Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>In court, defence lawyer, Ron Mansfield KC, read out a document found on Hanna's laptop, created in March 2019.</p>
        
            <p>In the document, Hanna wrote that after a dinner the couple got into an argument.</p>
        
            <p>"I talked too much in the car coming home. The rest is ugly and I don't know what to do.</p>
        
            <p>"Then all hell breaks loose - I have not behaved as he wanted - and I cry - I am gutted, been holding it in for so long.</p>
        
            <p>"He is angry and doesn't want to know me or my issues or me for that matter."</p>
        
            <p>Hanna wrote she could not live after Polkinghorne called their marriage a waste of time.</p>
        
            <p>"HURT HURT HURT- in fact wrecked. All these years, 27, did I get it wrong that he was the only person who truly loved me as his number 1.</p>
        
            <p>"I was number 1 in someone's life - as he was in mine. Have we got that wrong? God what a prospect - I cannot live if that is the result that I got it wrong."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Graham Lang told the jury it was getting the the "sharp end of the trial", but said it was too early to come to any conclusions.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues on Monday.</p>
