            <p>NSW Police have arrested veteran broadcaster Alan Jones following an investigation into alleged indecent assault and sexual touching offences spanning two decades.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement NSW Police said Child Abuse Squad detectives executed a warrant at the 83-year-old's luxury Sydney apartment at Circular Quay about 7:45am.</p>
        
            <p>The State Crime Command's Child Abuse Squad established Strike Force Bonnefin in March to investigate a number of alleged indecent assaults and sexual touching incidents between 2001 and 2019.</p>
        
            <p>A search warrant is continuing.</p>
        
            <p>Jones had a broadcasting career spanning more than 35 years, with the shock jock dominating Sydney's airwaves for decades.</p>
        
            <p>He started his media career as morning news presenter for 2UE in 1985.</p>
        
            <p>Jones is best-known for his programme on Sky News and breakfast radio show on Sydney radio station 2GB, which he joined after leaving 2UE in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>He was the morning broadcaster for the station for 18 years until May 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Jones's contract with Sky News Australia was not renewed in November 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The shock jock later joined streaming news channel ADH TV, which features a slew of conservative political commentators.</p>
        
            <p>His last show on the streaming station aired in November 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Before his broadcasting career, Jones was speechwriter and senior adviser to then prime minister Malcolm Fraser for three years.</p>
        
            <p>He became Australian rugby union coach in 1984 and coached Australia to victory in 102 matches over four years, including winning the 1986 Bledisloe Cup.</p>
