            <p>Analysis - Some 45 years ago, a team of staff and students at Wellington Polytechnic designed and built a desktop computer with an operating system customised for the needs of New Zealand schools.</p>
        
            <p>The Poly-1 was far ahead of international competition, but New Zealand failed to capitalise on the opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, public investment in a new knowledge-based industry ran counter to both "Think Big" industrial policy and the emerging neoliberal agenda in government.</p>
        
            <p>As New Zealand looks to scale up investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies, the story of the Poly-1 has enduring lessons about research and innovation policy - and the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration.</p>
        
            <p>The Poly-1 was designed in 1980 as a learning device and teacher support tool.</p>
        
            <p>It was advanced for its time with colour graphics and powerful processors. It incorporated a networking feature, enabling up to 32 workstations across multiple sites to communicate over a real-time connection.</p>
        
            <p>Its tough, rounded fibreglass case with carry handles and integrated keyboard was ergonomically designed to handle the rigours of classroom use.</p>
        
            <p>A range of bold colour options were meant to make it more relatable for children.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty working prototypes were built in less than a year. A large group of volunteer teachers worked over the summer break to integrate course content and ensure it was ready for use in classrooms.</p>
        
            <p>In 1981, the Department of Education signed a NZ$10 million purchase agreement for 1,000 units per year over a five year period.</p>
        
            <p>The Poly-1 went into production under Polycorp, a joint venture with Lower Hutt-based Progeni.</p>
        
            <p>Manufacturing was backed by the state-owned Development Finance Corporation venture capital fund.</p>
        
            <p>Polycorp was poised for scale with a field-tested product and unique distributed learning model. Wide deployment in classrooms would position New Zealand as leading the world in maths education and applied computing.</p>
        
            <p>Voicing outrage at this use of public funds, corporate lobbyists began publicly attacking "bureaucrats and boffins".</p>
        
            <p>Privately, they put pressure on ministers sympathetic to a nascent deregulation agenda. They argued only the market could properly decide which computers were used.</p>
        
            <p>In 1982, then prime minister Robert Muldoon's cabinet scuttled the deal, halting higher volume production and discarding two years of work.</p>
        
            <p>The beneficiary of the broken contract was Apple, which targeted New Zealand as its first education market outside the United States.</p>
        
            <p>It gave away free Apple II computers to schools, then followed up by offering larger volumes to the Department of Education at below cost.</p>
        
            <p>The Apple computers were unsupported by curriculum resources, lacked teacher training and were soon obsolete.</p>
        
            <p>By the mid 1980s, the rollout of computers in classrooms stalled as the Fourth Labour Government prioritised administrative reforms in education.</p>
        
            <p>Schools were left on their own to deal with hawkish IT vendors and distributors.</p>
        
            <p>Relying on an underdeveloped market to serve the growing demand for computers in education led to anti-competitive practices and a devaluing of the teaching expertise behind the software and services.</p>
        
            <p>It's unlikely the Poly-1 would have survived through the early 1990s as cheap IBM-compatible clones became widespread. But its ultimate end was a consequence of finance rather than technology.</p>
        
            <p>The collapse of the government-owned Development Finance Corporation in a complex tangle of failed property investments left Progeni directly exposed as a debtor to the BNZ, which was also teetering on the edge of collapse.</p>
        
            <p>In late 1989, Progeni was forced into receivership by the bank, which asset-stripped the company and sold it at a nominal value.</p>
        
            <p>The current government has recently announced major structural changes to New Zealand's research and innovation system, including a new Public Research Organisation focused on advanced technology.</p>
        
            <p>Institutional reform is much needed and long overdue, but significant challenges remain.</p>
        
            <p>A narrow focus on science and technology driving economic growth is not enough. More attention to detail is needed to bridge from current capacity to a desired future state.</p>
        
            <p>The Poly-1 required collaboration with industrial designers and teachers to become market-ready - and the same is true today.</p>
        
            <p>Successfully commercialising research in AI and other advanced technologies requires contributions from experts across design, social science, arts and business.</p>
        
            <p>Like personal computers in 1980, AI is a new category with contested meanings. This has an impact on policy and the reception of new products.</p>
        
            <p>Discussions about state-led innovation often default to arguments about picking winners. But direct support for industries and firms is only part of the broader picture.</p>
        
            <p>In order to see economic and public benefits of investment in AI, the government has a role to play in co-ordinating interdisciplinary efforts across sectors. This requires visions for the future that are a practical response to the needs of individuals, businesses and communities.</p>
        
            <p>Countries like New Zealand have so far been consumers rather than producers of current generation AI.</p>
        
            <p>Changing this balance requires willingness to learn from past mistakes to support leadership in both innovation and regulation.</p>
        
            <p>Poly-1 still has lessons to teach us.</p>
