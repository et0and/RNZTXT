            <p>Multiple places across the South Island have been hit with heat alerts but temperatures are set to drop and rain watches are in place this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>MetService placed heat alerts for Blenheim, Christchurch and Dunedin on Saturday, will all three locations forecast to hit 31 degrees Celsius.</p>
        
            <p>Other areas in the South Island with a heat alert included Ashburton, which was forecast to reach 30C, Timaru with 29C and Motueka with 28C.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, only Auckland was hit with a heat alert and forecast to reach levels of 28C.</p>
        
            <p>But while Auckland will continue with the hot weather over the weekend, it was a different story for the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>An active front will bring brief heavy rain to the west of the South Island, as well as strong northwest winds to exposed parts of central and southern New Zealand, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain warning was in place for Fiordland, north of George Sound and Westland, south of Haast from 12am to 4pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there could be up to 110 millimetres of rain on the ranges with peak rates of 15 to 25 mm per hour.</p>
        
            <p>There were also multiple heavy rain watches in place, including for Fiordland south of George Sound, Westland between Haast and Otira, and the headwaters of the Otago Lakes and Rivers.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, there were also strong wind watches for Wairarapa, Wellington, Fiordland, Southland, Stewart Island and Clutha, and Canterbury High Country.</p>
        
            <p>Other places in the South Island will also feel temperatures drop, MetService said.</p>
