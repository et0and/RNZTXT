            <p>Rotorua MP Todd McClay says he has no qualms about calling in police reinforcements to deal with gangs.</p>
        
            <p>New special search powers are now available to police, to quell gang tensions.</p>
        
            <p>Last week three men aged between 28 and 35 were arrested in the city following what police describe as an unprovoked attack and stabbing.</p>
        
            <p>The trio has been charged with aggravated robbery, wounding with intent and participating in an organised criminal group.</p>
        
            <p>Police are also investigating a shopping centre carpark shooting that left a man with gunshot wounds to his legs.</p>
        
            <p>They believe both crimes are linked to organised criminal groups or gangs.</p>
        
            <p>Changes to the law mean that if there is a gang conflict police can apply to the courts for a more general warrant that allows them to search cars, houses or properties for weapons.</p>
        
            <p>Last week the court granted those powers.</p>
        
            <p>McClay said it was a concern that gang membership numbers were up throughout the Bay of Plenty and in many parts of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"These gangs that are often younger men feel emboldened and the real tragedy here is the harm that can be caused to you know law-abiding citizens and the public."</p>
        
            <p>Local police were taking their responsibilities seriously and working hard, McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was obvious to locals that police had additional pressure put on them and were struggling due to the number of people sent to Rotorua - where hotels were used as emergency housing under the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>That, combined with a greater gang presence in the city over the last few months, had led him to speak to Police Minister Mark Mitchell asking for additional help, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We do need the equivalent of reinforcements or you know extra police on the ground, questions about long-term policing in Rotorua are separate to this, it's actually some work needs to be done now because our police need some help."</p>
        
            <p>The police minister had made it clear where police put their resources was an operational matter, but said he would raise it with them, McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>There were times when there were just not enough police officers on duty in Rotorua, he said.</p>
        
            <p>McClay said it was not something he would normally ask for as a local MP but in this case the police needed extra help.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua was not a dangerous place but the public were very worried about the situation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're seeing gang patches more, they know when someone wears a gang patch they've got that because they've committed a crime and there's victims out there and you know they are worried."</p>
        
            <p>Taking gang members patches off them was one of a number of tools which included the use disbursement orders and non-association orders which allowed the police to push back, he said.</p>
