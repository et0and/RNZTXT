            <p>A second large fire in a week has broken out at an abandoned Auckland country club and is being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ were called to Gulf Harbour Country Club just before midnight on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>At its peak, 17 fire trucks were at the scene and more than 50 personnel.</p>
        
            <p>The clubhouse was "well involved" on arrival and the first crews at the scene quickly called in more help, Assistant incident commander Shaun Pilgrim.</p>
        
            <p>The building was now a "complete write-off" and crews still had about six hours worth of work ahead of them to fully extinguish the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze was being treated at suspicious and there were "similarities" with Saturday's fire.</p>

            <p>That included "things that aren't adding up that could make the cause suspicious".</p>
        
            <p>FENZ group manager Phil Larcombe told Morning Report the fire took a lot of trucks away from responding to weather-related callouts overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got our fire investigator turning up there fairly soon this morning, but at the peak of the fire last night, we had about 18 appliances up there and about 70 people sort of working on the site there.</p>
        
            <p>"Crews are still there, just monitoring. Obviously as we do, we don't walk away until we're confident that everything is out. And obviously keeping a secure presence on the scene to make sure that the scene is preserved for our fire investigators also."</p>

            <p>Seven fire trucks remain at the scene at firefighters work to fully extinguish the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to assist at 11.52pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a scene guard would remain in place until a fire investigator could attend the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone with footage or information that may assist is asked to contact police via our 105 phone service, referencing job number P058799465.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time within a week that the country club has caught fire.</p>
        
            <p>A golf shop was found on fire before 3am on Saturday, 18 May.</p>

            <p>Local resident Greg Taylor, whose home was about 400 metres from the scene of the fire, said he woke to see the blaze from his bedroom window.</p>
        
            <p>"It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was not too surprised given the buildings had been empty since the middle of last year.</p>
        
            <p>He feared the main country club building would be next.</p>
        
            <p>"The building itself is completely abandoned, just about every window's been smashed."</p>

            <p>Residents had reported it to police and the council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The club, a former training ground of world champion Lydia Ko, was abruptly closed last July.</p>
        
            <p>Plans to redevelop the golf course and country club have been off and on, and an application was made to put its owners into liquidation in April.</p>
