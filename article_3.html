            <p>US President Joe Biden will announce in his State of the Union speech on Thursday that the US military will construct a port on Gaza's Mediterranean coast to receive humanitarian assistance by sea, senior administration officials said.</p>
        
            <p>The officials also said at a news briefing that Hamas is delaying a new deal with Israel on releasing hostages because it has not agreed to free sick and elderly hostages, the officials told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>In his speech to Congress, Biden will announce that he has ordered the US military "to undertake an emergency mission to establish a port in Gaza, working with like-minded countries and humanitarian partners," one of the officials said.</p>
        
            <p>The port, which would be temporary, would increase the amount of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the war-battered enclave by "hundreds of additional truckloads" per day, the official said, adding that the United States would coordinate security with Israel.</p>
        
            <p>It also would work with the UN and humanitarian aid organisations that "understand the distribution of assistance within Gaza," the official said, adding that initial supplies would come from Cyprus.</p>
