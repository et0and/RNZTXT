            <p>Police dropped road spikes on an Auckland motorway in error, causing seven passing cars to have their tyres popped.</p>
        
            <p>The incident at 3.30am Friday has prompted a refresher talk for officers about how to store spikes properly.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Jim Wilson said officers put the "Tactical Deflation Device" (TTD) on the roof of their car to make room for a man they were arresting.</p>
        
            <p>But they forgot to put the spikes back and they fell across several lanes of the Southern Motorway near Greenlane.</p>
        
            <p>Seven vehicles ran over them.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said members of the public phoned police but as those first calls were coming in, other staff were already on the road, clearing the spikes.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said everyone with a damaged car will be reimbursed.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a regrettable situation and our staff have made a genuine mistake," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, we will be having further discussions with our staff highlighting the learnings from this incident around storage of TDDs," he said.</p>
