            <p>Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza, including that of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, U.S. President Joe Biden said late on Saturday (local time).</p>
        
            <p>"Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. "I am devastated and outraged."</p>
        
            <p>The Israeli military said in a statement early on Sunday that the bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino had been brought to Israel.</p>
        
            <p>At least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since 7 October, the enclave's health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The war was triggered when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, clashes broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank as Israel pushed ahead with a military operation in the flashpoint city of Jenin. Hundreds of Israeli troops have been carrying out raids since Wednesday in one of their largest actions in the West Bank in months.</p>

            <p>"He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world," Biden said.</p>

            <p>His parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, "have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable", Biden said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express," the president said.</p>
        
            <p>Biden vowed that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages."</p>
        
            <p>Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement, "I strongly condemn Hamas' continued brutality, and so must the entire world".</p>
        
            <p>Harris, the Democratic candidate running to succeed Biden, said she and he would never waver in their commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden said he was "still optimistic" about a ceasefire deal to stop the conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're on the verge of having an agreement," he said. "It's time this war ended."</p>
        
            <p>Biden added that "people are continuing to meet".</p>
        
            <p>"We think we can close the deal, they've all said they agree on the principles."</p>
