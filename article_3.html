            <p>All Blacks utility back David Havili is the new Crusaders Super Rugby captain.</p>
        
            <p>Havili takes over from All Blacks skipper Scott Barrett, with the Crusaders coach Rob Penney deeming it too demanding for the lock to hold both roles.</p>

            <p>Havili has played 128 games for the franchise since debuting in 2015. He was named vice captain in 2020 and has long been part of the Crusaders leadership group.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old, who plays mostly in the midfield, also captained his provincial side Tasman to victory in the 2019 and 2020 NPC seasons.</p>
        
            <p>He has captained the Crusaders on a temporary basis before years when Barrett was unavailable for selection.</p>
        
            <p>Returning to Crusaders training week after his fifth All Blacks end of year tour, Havili will lead the franchise next Friday in their first pre-season game against the Blues at Kirwee Rugby Club.</p>
        
            <p>The son of former Nelson Bays rugby representative Bill Havili, David was born in Nelson, but raised in nearby Motueka.</p>

            <p>He has played 30 tests for the All Blacks scoring nine tries.</p>
