            <p>Phoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano cut a disappointed but proud figure in the post-match media session after his side's 2-1 loss to Melbourne Victory. He hinted at what was to come for his breakout team, revealing that Oscar Zawada's 99th minute goal will be the last the Polish striker scores in a Phoenix shirt.</p>
        
            <p>"You won't see Zawada here next season," was Italiano's response when asked about the makeup of his team in the 2024-25 A-League.</p>
        
            <p>"The available money that we have doesn't allow us to retain every player that we want. It's unfortunately because we've done well this year that the markets obviously push the value of those players up."</p>

            <p>It is also not an unfortunately new situation for the Phoenix either, with squad turnover high in the A-League, but Italiano was confident the majority of his team would be retained.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be a group next season, with a majority of players tonight that have taken part. Might be two or three players that leave, maybe more. But what's more important is that we've got that experience now, that foundation to move the club forward. So, if anyone says we can't finish in the top two, we can lean back on this. Little details will get us over the line."</p>
        
            <p>The first-year head coach put the loss down to a few factors, most notably one "uncharacteristic mistake" that led to the corner kick that Victory substitute Chris Ikonomidis nodding home that silenced the 33,297-strong crowd. He also said Alex Rufer was "brave" for taking a second half penalty that was saved by Victory goalkeeper Paul Izzo.</p>

            <p>"I'm never going to question a professional player that has to be scrutinised by… all the idiots on social media that think they know better. If someone wants to step up and they miss, they miss. It happens all the time."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano praised the bumper crowd at Sky Stadium, the club's biggest ever.</p>
        
            <p>"That was great, I had chills coming out. That was the best feeling of scoring in the last minute, that I've had in my life. I've been lucky, I've been to a Super Classico game, I've been to a World Cup, but that was just an amazing feeling I'll never forget and hopefully the fans will never forget. The energy of the whole stadium was electric.</p>

            <p>"It's a dream of mine to think that one day, every game is like that. It's possible in Europe, South America… I just think the league can get healthy enough to have that rivalry and every game can be sold out."</p>
        
            <p>That dream will benefit from the upcoming entry of Auckland FC into the A-League, a fixture that is already being hyped as a big draw for next season. However, Italiano has his mind on going one step further with the Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the group needed this, fuel for next year… we really need to make the most of this experience. They're going to use that for next year, especially the young guys."</p>
