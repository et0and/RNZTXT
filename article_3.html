            <p>The Hurricanes have won a clinical and ruthless 47-12 victory over the Highlanders, at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>It's a big win for the Hurricanes, who are now a perfect six from six to start their season, unbeaten at the top of the Super Rugby Pacific table.</p>
        
            <p>This one had the potential to be an absolute shootout, because the Hurricanes had got to where they were on the table so far by simply trying to score as many points as possibly could at all times.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Clark Laidlaw's approach before this game seemed to be putting as much trust in his young players as possible and it has been working, but this week they welcome back some serious firepower in Cam Roigard, Kini Naholo and Du'Plessis Kirifi.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Highlanders were their own worst enemies last weekend in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Tanielu Tele'a, who was a standout so far, was suspended and Jermaine Ainsley injured. But Ethan de Groot was back to offset that.</p>
