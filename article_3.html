            <p>The world champion White Ferns have been welcomed home by whānau, friends and more than 100 fans.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off their 32-run win over South Africa in the T20 World Cup final, the team went on to play three ODIs against India.</p>
        
            <p>The team was greeted by applause and cheers as they arrived at Christchurch International Airport on Friday afternoon.</p>

            <p>Young fans got a chance to put questions to the team at a Q&A afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"You are my idol - who are your heroes?" Teagan, from South East Ōtautahi, asked.</p>
        
            <p>"My idol is sitting up here with me," White Ferns spin ace Eden Carson responded.</p>
        
            <p>"Suzie Bates. Suzie coached me 10 years ago now, I've been able to have her as a coach and then play with her in the [Otago] Sparks and then now to be able to represent New Zealand alongside her is pretty cool."</p>

            <p>Bates said the enormity of what the team achieved had only sunk in as they arrived home to supporters and loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time New Zealand had won a white ball tournament since 2000, when the White Ferns claimed the World Cup and the Black Caps took home the Knock-Out Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably the first time it's really sunk in today and seeing all the young girls and boys wanting to get autographs," Bates said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what it's all about. When I was young I loved watching the White Ferns and Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty awesome to be a world champion and every time I hear that you have to pinch yourself. I think the next few days being back at home and celebrating with all the young fans is going to make it all the more special."</p>
        
            <p>
More than 100 whānau and friends greeted the team.

            <p>Despite the team posting 158 in their 20 overs, Bates said it was not until the final over of South Africa's chase that the win became clear.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember with eight balls to go Melie [Kerr] came past and said 'Make sure you enjoy this' - I didn't quite then. But in the last over every ball Eden bowled I looked at Sophie [Devine] with a slightly bigger smile knowing we were close, but it wasn't until that last ball that I really let myself enjoy it. And to be next to Sophie - that's something I'll never forget, to have that moment together and finally get that world cup that we've been chasing for so many years."</p>
        
            <p>Home town hero Lea Tahuhu said it was surreal.</p>
        
            <p>"It took a little while to sink in, it still hasn't really sunk in ... but it's just something you dream of achieving and when a dream like that comes true, you're left speechless."</p>
        
            <p>The team would now embark on a nationwide Trophy Tour, starting in Dunedin on Saturday.</p>
