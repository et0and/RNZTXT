            <p>New Zealand powered out to first position at the start, but the German crew sneaked up on them approaching the 250m mark.</p>
        
            <p>Germany then edged out in front to set up a thrilling finish.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington's crew proved too quick however, getting to the line in one minute and 32 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>After getting out of the water, the women hugged each other tightly in celebration.</p>

            <p>Speaking to Sky Sport, Brett said she was "so proud" of her boatmates.</p>
        
            <p>"That was an epic race and I'm just so excited."</p>
        
            <p>Vaughan said she was "so grateful" to the other three women.</p>
        
            <p>"Being a part of this team is absolutely the best."</p>
        
            <p>Hoskin said the plan was to "stay in our own boat" and trust the strategy that had been put in place.</p>
        
            <p>"So proud, like it takes a lot of courage to do that. So we're really happy."</p>
        
            <p>Carrington said the team, and everyone behind them, had put a lot of work into the Olympic campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an incredibly special moment, especially to just be able to do it on our biggest stage, so yeah, it's surreal.</p>
        
            <p>"You just don't know when you line up. You never know what the results are going to be be. So it's amazing when you can come through, as we have."</p>
