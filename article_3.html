        <h2>Students taught to use fire extinguisher amid New Caledonia unrest</h2>
        <p>
Kiwi Emma Roylands says the university is "very worried" rioters will come and "burn things just as a middle finger to the state".

            <p>A Kiwi studying at the University of New Caledonia says students have been taught to use fire extinguishers as firefighters are unlikely to come help if there is an emergency.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as days of unrest followed a proposed constitutional amendment which would allow more French residents of New Caledonia to vote - a move that pro-independence protesters say would weaken the indigenous Kanak vote.</p>
        
            <p>Six people have been confirmed dead so far and there are reports of hundreds of people injured, numerous fires and mass looting in New Caledonia's capital Nouméa.</p>
        
            <p>Emma Roylands is one of several international students at the university in Nouméa and said everyone was getting a bit "high-strung".</p>
        
            <p>"There's this high-strung suspicion from every noise, every bang that 'is that somebody coming to the university?'"</p>
        
            <p>Roylands said a roster had been set up so that someone was constantly up overnight, looking over the university campus.</p>
        
            <p>Nights had become more quiet, but there was still unrest, she said.</p>

            <p>The vice president of the university had visited yesterday to bring students some cooking oil and expressed the concern the university has for its expensive technology, Roylands said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are very worried that people come and they burn things just as a middle finger to the state.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been told that 'if you see a fire, it's likely that the firefighters will come so we will try and manage it ourselves'."</p>
        
            <p>Roylands said water to the part of Nouméa she was in had not been affected but food was becoming an issue.</p>
        
            <p>The university was providing food when it could but even it was struggling to get access to it - snacks such and oreos had been provided.</p>
        
            <p>But the closest supermarket that was open had "queues down the block" that could last three or four hours, Roylands said.</p>
        
            <p>She was seeing "absolutely crazy things that I've never seen in my life".</p>

            <p>That included people holding guns.</p>
        
            <p>"It is quite scary to know just 20 seconds down from the university there are guys with guns blocking the road."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, the Defence Force (NZDF) said it would fly into New Caledonia to bring home New Zealanders while commercial services were not operating.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said New Zealand was waiting for the go-ahead from French authorities, based on safety.</p>
        
            <p>"Ever since the security situation in New Caledonia deteriorated earlier this week, the safety of New Zealanders there has been an urgent priority for us," Peters wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
        
            <p>"NZ authorities have now completed preparations for flights using NZDF aircraft to bring home New Zealanders in New Caledonia while commercial services are not operating.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ready to fly, and await approval from French authorities as to when our flights are safe to proceed."</p>

            <p>Roylands praised the response from New Zealand, saying other countries had not been so quick to help its citizens.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had received both a call and email from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade asking her if she was in immediate danger and if she needed assistance straight away.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone she had spoken to at the university seemed impressed with how New Zealand was responding, she said.</p>
