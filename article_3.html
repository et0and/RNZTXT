            <p>Crusaders prop Owen Franks has had his yellow card from Friday night's 14-10 loss to the Hurricanes upgraded to a red.</p>
        
            <p>Franks, 36, was sinbinned in the dying moments of the match, when he took out Hurricanes forward Justin Sangster with a head high shoulder as Franks entered a ruck.</p>
        
            <p>Franks will now appear before judicial committee tonight unless he takes an early guilty plea.</p>
        
            <p>The loss to the Hurricanes leaves the defending champions sitting 11th in the 12 team competition, just above the Western Force with both sides having failed to win any of their four opening games of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Franks only returned to the Crusaders this year, having last played for the Christchurch-based franchise in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He was playing for Toulouse in France's Top 14 competition and prior to that was with the Hurricanes.</p>
