            <p>The mass exodus of New Zealanders is likely to continue until interest rates drop, a recruiter says.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data showed a net migration gain for the year ended May of 82,800, the lowest annual gain since March last year.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said the numbers were prone to revisions and had to be treated with caution, but all the same the trend was clear.</p>
        
            <p>"The slowdown in net migration is being driven by both sides. Arrivals remain at historically high levels, but they are down from the peak seen early last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Meanwhile, departures of New Zealanders in particular have been trending higher, and are above pre-Covid levels."</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 143,000 non-New Zealand citizens arrived in the 12 months ended May, with 60,100 departures.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ noted a record 85,600 New Zealand citizens left the country during the year, with China, United Kingdom, and Australia the top destinations.</p>
        
            <p>"This likely reflects a combination of delayed travel plans and the relatively robust jobs market in Australia compared to the slowdown in New Zealand," Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>For the month of May, there was an estimated actual net loss of 2000, the first since June 2022, although when seasonally adjusted that turned into 1400 gain.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland-based recruitment agency Customise Talent Partners looks at employment opportunities across a range of sectors, including sales, marketing, finance and procurement.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Michael Viner told Checkpoint their agency had seen an improvement on the first quarter, but it was clear things were "still a little bit choppy out there", and he believed that would continue until interest rates dropped.</p>
        
            <p>"I think things have settled down in terms of mass redundancies ... I think if you're saving a company money or you're making a company money then you're in demand."</p>
        
            <p>The latest migration statistics were "quite phenomenal", Viner said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think most of the time when we talk about brain drains we talk about a lot of sort of the younger generation, and I think in the last couple of months it's families and experienced executives leaving.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of my friends are moving over [to Australia], some of them without roles to go to ... I think people are just taking the plunge."</p>
        
            <p>There could be several factors behind that decision, including redundancy and lack of long-term opportunities in their industries.</p>
        
            <p>"Unemployment's a lot lower over there, the economy seems to be going a lot better, probably a lot more opportunities. We're also seeing some of the big corporations centralising debt, New Zealand operations over to Australia as well. So it's all causing a bit of a push and I think it's a bit of a trend as well."</p>
        
            <p>Arrivals from India, the Philippines, and China remained the largest source of migrants.</p>
        
            <p>ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley said the slowdown would help the Reserve Bank's concerns strong population growth would boost economic activity and inflation pressures.</p>
        
            <p>"The migration flows will keep boosting the pool of available workers in the short term, while employment growth is drying up, reinforcing that labour market slack will increase."</p>
        
            <p>Annual migrations net gains peaked at a record 136,600 in October last year.</p>
