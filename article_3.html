        <h2>Supermassive black hole sends out mysterious flashes</h2>
        <p>
The flashes have been increasing in speed over the past two years.

            <p>A supermassive black hole 270 million lightyears away has surprised astronomers by sending out x-ray flashes that have increased in speed.</p>
        
            <p>An international team of astronomers have been monitoring the black hole and according to NASA, they have detected features that have never been seen before.</p>
        
            <p>Over two years astonomers detected x-ray flashes coming from the black hole, known as 1ES 1927+654, which were steadily increasing in speed, NASA said, from every 18 minutes to every seven.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first ever measurement of its kind around a supermassive black hole, NASA said.</p>
        
            <p>Astronomers had been watching the black hole since 2018 when plasma which made up its corona, disappeared.</p>
        
            <p>"Many teams have been keeping a close eye on it ever since," Eileen Meyer, an associate professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) said.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2018, the black hole had returned to a quiet state, until April 2023, when a team led by Sibasish Laha at UMBC and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre, noted a steady months-long increase in low energy x-rays.</p>
        
            <p>Researchers believed the most likely reason for this change would be due to a spinning white dwarf star orbiting around the black hole and getting close to its edge without falling in.</p>
        
            <p>Megan Masterson, a graduate student in physics at MIT, who co-led the discovery, said if that was the case, the white dwarf would be the closest thing researchers know of around any black hole.</p>
        
            <p>"This tells us that objects like white dwarfs may be able to live very close to an event horizon for a relatively extended period of time."</p>
        
            <p>If so, the white dwarf would be sending out gravitational waves which could be detected in the future.</p>
