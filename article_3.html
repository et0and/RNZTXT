            <p>A Bluebridge Cook Strait ferry had to turn back after it hit a wharf as it was leaving Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Harbourmaster Grant Nalder said the ferry departed about 8.15am on Wednesday and hit the southern end of Glasgow wharf.</p>
        
            <p>The Connemara was sailing towards the entrance to the channel when the operator Straits NZ made decided the vessel should turn back.</p>
        
            <p>"The company made the decision that they wanted a closer look at the ship so they brought it back into the berth," Nalder told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said there was "a decent dent" on the hull and a "very small hole" above the waterline.</p>
        
            <p>The risk was low given the size of the hole, its height above the water, and that it was going into a relatively small compartment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were able to safely disembark once the ferry returned to port.</p>
        
            <p>Repairs to the vessel were likely to be carried out in the afternoon and the ferry was expected to be back in service on Wednesday evening, Nalder said.</p>

            <p>A CentrePort spokesperson said following the incident involving Connemara, engineers were on site assessing damage to Glasgow Wharf.</p>
        
            <p>Glasgow Wharf was the back-up wharf for StraitNZ Bluebridge ferries and would be unavailable until engineers provided clearance that it was safe to use, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Connemara is now berthed at the main ferry berth used by StraitNZ.</p>

            <p>Passengers delayed by damage to Bluebridge ferry Connemara. Cyclists Glenice Powell and John Patchett were worried they may not make it Blenheim before dark.</p>
        
            <p>Another passenger, Heidi Meister, said she was annoyed at being told her 1.30pm sailing was cancelled due to the damage to the earlier ferry, but after queuing at the busy check-in desk she was later told it would only be delayed.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Bridges did not mind the extra time in the capital and he was off to the bar across the road.</p>
