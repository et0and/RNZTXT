            <p>The Green Party has launched a petition urging the new government to not restart offshore oil and gas exploration.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has promised to repeal the country's ban on exploring for new oil and gas reserves off the coast.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader James Shaw said reversing the ban- introduced in 2018 was unscientific and dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>Burning more fossil fuels would take the country backwards in dealing with the climate crisis, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Re-starting oil and gas exploration makes no sense. The idea that New Zealand's wind and solar need gas to underpin energy security is a myth being spread by the fossil fuel industry itself," Shaw said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Five years ago, backed by a massive people-powered campaign, our Government banned fossil fuel companies from drilling for oil and gas in New Zealand's ocean. Today we ask everyone to stand with us to tell this government that the oil and gas ban has to stay."</p>
        
            <p>Fossil fuels were not the future and New Zealand's focus should be on phasing them out and getting to 100 percent renewable energy as soon as possible, Shaw said.</p>
