            <p>Police are asking the public to help identify a man caught on CCTV footage at an illegal campsite in Egmont National Park/Te Papa Kura-o-Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) has been aware of the 10m by 10m bush clearances in the northwest side of the park near Pukeiti since July.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Ranger Cameron Hunt said that with the help of police, they discovered a campsite, several clearings in the area and a pile of rubbish.</p>
        
            <p>"This man's face is clearly shown in the CCTV image and we'd like to speak to him about what's happened here.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe someone knows who he is, and we'd welcome any information which helps us identify him."</p>

            <p>Cameron said whoever set up the camp had gone to some trouble, taking in 200 litre plastic water tanks, a 44-gallon steel drum, five car batteries, a small fridge, a gas cooker and even constructing a basic platform, or floor, from ponga logs and plywood.</p>
        
            <p>"This person is obviously pretty organised and quite committed to whatever they were doing."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who can identify the man in the picture is urged to contact Cameron Hunt on 027 246 1083 or by emailing chunt@doc.govt.nz.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Conservation Act, it is illegal to fell or remove trees, shrubs or plants on or from public conservation land.</p>
        
            <p>It can result in a fine of up $100,000 and two years in jail. If the offending continues, further fines of $10,000 a day can be imposed.</p>
