            <p>Three months after launching a Serious Incident Review into the death of a Filipino carpenter at Buller Hospital, Health New Zealand (HNZ) has informed his widow.</p>

            <p>HNZ confirmed it had contacted Licelie Lozano on Wednesday afternoon. It made contact just hours after Patient Voice Aotearoa chair Dr Malcolm Mulholland urged Health Minister Dr Shane Reti to intervene and Dr Reti told HNZ he expected it to engage "appropriately and compassionately" with Leo Lozano's widow.</p>
        
            <p>HNZ denied Dr Reti's directive had prompted it to contact her.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't require a direction from the minister, we have always intended to be in contact with his family," a spokeswoman told The News. "As Mr Lozano presented as a casual patient, it has taken us time to track down the correct contact details for his family.</p>
        
            <p>"Contact has now been made after we were able to get hold of a correct number which means we will be able to have ongoing communication with Mrs Lozano. Our sincere condolences are with the family."</p>
        
            <p>The News asked HNZ why it took over three months to find Licelie Lozano's contact details - and then only on the day the minister intervened - when the details were available from several people including Mulholland and this reporter.</p>
        
            <p>HNZ did not respond.</p>
        
            <p>Mulholland said he was glad Licelie Lozano was now learning about the review into her husband's death directly from HNZ "but I'm angry about what it took for that to happen".</p>
        
            <p>"Health New Zealand most likely received a call from the Health Minister's office, after being publicly humiliated for not having the decency to get her easily obtainable contact details and either taking the short time to write an email or pick up a phone," Mulholland said.</p>
        
            <p>"For Mrs Lozano to be contacted some three months after her husband had died, and after the review had been launched, is unacceptable. Some staff at Health New Zealand are clearly either heartless or incompetent."</p>
        
            <p>Leo Lozano, 51, died of a burst aorta on 17 July, hours after being sent home from Buller Hospital diagnosed with a stomach ulcer and high blood pressure. He had been working in Westport since February 2023 to support his family in the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>His death has left his wife and four children without a husband, father and sole bread-winner.</p>
        
            <p>Licelie Lozano told RNZ a fortnight ago that she had had no information from HNZ about the review or any contact from HNZ. At the time, HNZ said the family would be included as the review progressed.</p>
        
            <p>Leo Lozano's death is also subject to a Health and Disability commissioner complaint and a coronial inquiry.</p>
