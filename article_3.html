            <p>IHC has confirmed the death of disability rights advocate Sir Robert Martin KNZM, in Whanganui.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, Sir Robert said he was both proud and humbled to receive a knighthood for services to people with disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>He was the first New Zealander with an intellectual disability to be knighted and had served on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert also held roles with Inclusion International and was national self advocacy advisor and trainer for IHC New Zealand between 1991 and 2010.</p>
        
            <p>His early years were spent in institutional care.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Disabilities Issues Minister Louise Upston paid tribute to Sir Robert, saying New Zealand had lost a true legend.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government's thoughts are with his wife Lynda, family and community, those he has worked with, the disability community in New Zealand, and the disability community internationally," Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>"As the new Minister for Disability Issues, I did not have the chance to work with Sir Robert, but I am familiar with his advocacy for disability rights and that former mnisters worked to support his election to the United Nations Committee. It was a proud moment for New Zealand when he was elected to this important role. I join former mnisters in offering condolences," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many disabled people in New Zealand and internationally are living better lives because of Sir Robert's achievements and commitment, and they will be mourning his passing while celebrating his legacy."</p>
        
            <p>IHC chief executive Ralph Jones said his contribution to the community was unequalled.</p>
        
            <p>"I have known Sir Robert for many years and his achievements were remarkable. We served together for many years on the Council of Inclusion International.</p>
        
            <p>"He made a real difference to the lives of people with disabilities both in New Zealand and overseas. It's an incredible legacy."</p>
        
            <p>In a post to Facebook, People First New Zealand Ngā Tāngata Tuatahi said Sir Robert's legacy would continue with his advocacy for disability rights and deinstitutionalisation, nationally and internationally.</p>
        
            <p>"We know Sir Robert's passing will come as a shock to many, especially to our People First members. During this time, it is important to share your grief and feelings with your family, friends and support networks. Our Regional Coordinators are also here if you need someone to talk to."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert was a lifetime member and told RNZ in 2019 he wanted a leader that looked and sounded like him, and when there was not one, he decided to fill the gap.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why I fought tooth and nail for the likes of People First, the only organisation in New Zealand that speaks for, and on behalf of people with learning disabilities."</p>
        
            <p>YES Disability Resource Centre said on Facebook Sir Robert was "an incredible advocate, mentor and role model to many".</p>
        
            <p>"We will be forever grateful and always remember his generosity of time and sharing of his story to change the world for others.</p>
        
            <p>"Our love and prayers to his family."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert is survived by his wife Lynda.</p>
