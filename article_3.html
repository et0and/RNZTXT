            <p>A business owner seriously injured in a robbery in Auckland on Sunday evening was struck in the head three times with a hammer, an anti-crime campaigner says.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a store on Kolmar Road in Papatoetoe about 5.45pm, and said the attackers left the scene in a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Dairy and Business Owners Group chair Sunny Kaushal understood five offenders who were armed broke into Pooja Jewellers.</p>
        
            <p>"They have hit the business owner with the hammer three times on the head, and also with a knife on his forehead. He was hospitalised and as per the latest information he has been stitched and was waiting for the scan, but he is out of danger," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A worker and a family member in the store at the time were also injured in the robbery, Kaushal said.</p>
        
            <p>He said a video posted on social media appeared to show three young children in the store at the time of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>It also appeared to show one of the workers approaching the offenders with what looked like a sword.</p>
        
            <p>The shop was very well protected with a cage structure out the front but offenders still forced their way in, Kaushal said</p>
        
            <p>"It's been very traumatic for the family, this incident leaves behind huge trauma, destruction and pain."</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand should be the safest country in the world and these shop owners are working hard and they're doing everything that needs to be done to keep on trading and also safeguarding as per the guidelines of the authorities - still they are not safe. Every business owner, shop owner is feeling and living in fear everyday."</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal said jewellery stores were continuously being targeted and in Papatoetoe this was the third jewellery store that had been attacked in the last three months.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to see more patrolling, more enforcement out on the street. This is the responsibility of the government, the police to make the community safer. This is not something that is new, it's been happening for a long time and it's gone out of control."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced 63 additional police officers would be deployed in new Community Beat Teams acrcoss Auckland's three policing districts over the next two years.</p>
        
            <p>Nobody should have to fear walking down the street or worrying about whether their store would be ramraided, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sick of it, Kiwis are sick of it, and it's unacceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Police Inspector Keki Wilson said enquiries remained ongoing to locate the offenders and their vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are working to piece together exactly what occurred, we are speaking with a number of witnesses and will conduct a scene examination."</p>
        
            <p>"Violent incidents like these rightly cause concern, and Police is committed to holding offenders to account."</p>
        
            <p>Police said one person in the store was taken to hospital with serious injuries.</p>
