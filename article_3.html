            <p>The driver of a car that fatally hit a long-serving Nelson police officer early on New Year's Day is expected to face multiple serious charges when he appears in court tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming was one of two officers struck by a vehicle in Nelson's Buxton Square. She later died from her injuries, while her colleague Adam Ramsey remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Two members of the public were also injured in this incident - one woman received a broken arm and a man who came to assist police was injured in his shoulder. A third police officer was assessed for a concussion and discharged from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming and Ramsey were patrolling the square on foot about 2am, when a vehicle sped towards them and collided with them. The vehicle then turned and drove at a police car, ramming it.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old driver of the vehicle was tasered and arrested at the scene, and is due to appear in Nelson District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said this was a "unprovoked and senseless" attack, and the driver would be charged with "serious criminal offences".</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said other officers and members of the public gave first aid to the injured victims.</p>
        
            <p>He said Fleming was a widely respected police officer with 38 years front-line service.</p>
        
            <p>"My absolute priority is to ensure our people and their families are supported as best they can be, during this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Police Minister Mark Mitchell both paid tribute to Fleming, and Nelson MP Rachel Boyack called the death "devastating news".</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was long involved in local sport and coached netball at Nelson College for Girls. The team paid tribute to "the bedrock of our netball programme for over a decade".</p>
        
            <p>Flowers were laid outside the police station in Albion Square.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Nick Smith said, "I invite Nelsonians to show their support for our police by laying flowers at the flagpole."</p>
        
            <p>A book of condolence for Fleming has been made available at Nelson Cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>"The Cathedral will be open from 8.30am to 7pm each day for anyone to record their condolences to this outstanding police officer," said Cathedral Reverend Steve Jordan, himself a former police chief of 30 years service.</p>
        
            <p>"The Cathedral flag will also be flown at half-mast in honour of Senior Sergeant Fleming," he added.</p>
        
            <p>The Cathedral's Sunday service at 10am will feature a two-minute silence and singing of the National Anthem.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's death raised the number of officers to have died in the line of duty in New Zealand to 34.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association president Chris Cahill said the toll was just a number, and behind it were 34 people and families who were affected forever.</p>
        
            <p>Police did a dangerous job, and while assaults on officers were common, they did not expect to be confronted with this level of violence, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Enquiries into Fleming's death were ongoing, but it appeared the officers had little chance of avoiding what was a surprise attack, Cahill said.</p>
        
            <p>"The circumstances known to date, it's very hard; you've got  determined offender who's using a motor vehicle as a weapon, it's almost impossible, and you just don't expect to be confronted with that level of violence and you're pretty limited to be able to protect yourself."</p>
        
            <p>Police will be brought in from other regions to help investigate Fleming's death.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said a thorough investigation lay ahead, and staff from outside Nelson would help with the inquiry because of the emotional strain on local officers.</p>
