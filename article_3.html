            <p>A pilot winched from the ocean after ditching his plane off the coast near Golden Bay was uninjured, according to the rescue pilot who found the man.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Marlborough Rescue Helicopter Trust pilot Deon Edgar says the man was located floating at sea around 11 miles off the coast, having ditched his plane following an engine failure.</p>
        
            <p>Edgar said the man had been in the water for about an hour when they found him.</p>
        
            <p>He said the plane had sunk by the time they located the man, but he had managed to communicate his coordinates via a mayday call.</p>
