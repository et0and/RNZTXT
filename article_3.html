            <p>Fire and Emergency says a vegetation fire in a Whitby reserve in the Wellington suburb of Porirua has been contained, but is not yet out.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said some houses were evacuated as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Fourteen crews worked to fight the fire in the Spinnaker Reserve in Whitby from about 2pm and it was contained by about 3.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was reported at around 1.40pm, and was around 480sqm in size at 2.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>People are asked to stay away from the area, so trucks can get through.</p>
        
            <p>The entrance to Mercury Way is blocked by police.</p>
        
            <p>It is very windy.</p>
        
            <p>There is some smoke in the area, so those nearby should keep their windows closed.</p>

            <p>Whitby resident Ethan Oliver said he arrived home about 2pm, when he noticed people in the street watching a "big puff of smoke up over the hills".</p>
        
            <p>He said the fire brigade had been called but was not yet on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The fire itself was in the reserve, but "pretty close" to his house, he said, and when he went out the back he saw a big plume of smoke and fire curling up the bases of some trees in the reserve, about 2m in height.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't like a big fire bank or anything, but it was just starting to get going. I was like, oh okay well, hopefully the boys get here and sort it out, aye."</p>
        
            <p>He said luckily the wind was pushing the fire back up the hill, away from his house, but the conditions were dry.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been real hot the past couple of days, so it would have been a tinderbox back there."</p>

            <p>Police at the scene of the fire have told RNZ residents are not being asked to evacuate at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>The restricted fire season was declared for Porirua and KƒÅpiti Coast on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who wants to light an outdoor fire now needs to apply for a permit from Fire and Emergency.</p>
        
            <p>District Manager Brett Lockyer said those areas had become extremely dry since the beginning of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a very risky time of year for wildfires, so we're asking everyone to help us keep Wellington District's people, property and environment safe from fires this summer."</p>
