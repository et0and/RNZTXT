            <p>Rail remains on the agenda in Canterbury, despite a lack of government support.</p>
        
            <p>Hearing panels from the Greater Christchurch Partnership (GCP) and the Canterbury Regional Transport Committee (CRTC) deliberated Thursday on the draft Canterbury Regional Public Transport Plan 2025/35.</p>
        
            <p>Items discussed included mass rapid transport in Christchurch, a regional rail service and extending public transport to towns like Amberley and Ashburton.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Canterbury (ECan) senior strategy advisor Len Fleete said 800 submissions were received on the draft plan, with 75 percent in support of the general direction.</p>
        
            <p>He said most of the changes to draft plan were due to changes in direction from Waka Kotahi and central government policy.</p>
        
            <p>Reduced public transport funding in the National Land Transport Programme (NLTP) 2024/27 has also trimmed ambitions.</p>
        
            <p>The possibility of regional passenger rail south of Christchurch stays, but any updated blueprint will remove the timeframes for laying new track.</p>
        
            <p>While she liked many of the changes, Christchurch city councillor Sara Templeton expressed disappointment at the removal of the timeframes for the rail projects.</p>
        
            <p>''[These] projects are crucial for our future and that's why we included them in the Greater Christchurch Spatial Plan (adopted last year). It feels like a backward step.''</p>
        
            <p>But she was pleased to see the rail projects remaining as part of the overall vision in the draft plan.</p>
        
            <p>''It is important that we have our own vision, rather than just considering what the present government's priorities are, because governments change and we need to be ready for opportunities when they arise.''</p>
        
            <p>ECan councillor Grant Edge said there was little option but to toe the line.</p>
        
            <p>''The changes are due to direction outside our control, but we obviously do need to deliver under the guidance of the government.''</p>
        
            <p>Submitters in towns outside of Greater Christchurch, including Amberley, Little River and Ashburton, expressed a desire to be considered for public transport in the future, and this was acknowledged in the amendments proposed by the councillors.</p>
        
            <p>At present, Timaru is the only town outside of Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri, which has a subsidised bus service.</p>
        
            <p>Pets could soon be allowed on Canterbury buses, while bike racks are back on buses after issues last year and Mana Whenua aspirations were discussed.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 800 submissions, 753 expressed views about pets on buses, with around 60 percent in support.</p>
        
            <p>There were concerns about allergies, the size of pets and a fear of dogs.</p>
        
            <p>Submitters were not in favour of passengers having more than one pet.</p>
        
            <p>
The future of public transport in Canterbury was discussed at two separate meetings in Christchurch on Thursday.

            <p>Staff will update ECan's public transport code of conduct to address these concerns, with the suggestion a passenger could take two pets (such as kittens), if they were in a carrier.</p>
        
            <p>Last year ECan banned bikes on buses due to concerns from NZTA about front mounted bike racks obscuring headlights.</p>
        
            <p>ECan staff said the concerns have been addressed and all buses will be required to have a front mounted bike rack able to carry at least two bikes.</p>
        
            <p>Templeton said the plan needed to be more explicit in its support of Mana Whenua aspirations for public transport to link maraes and kƒÅinga nohoanga.</p>
        
            <p>The recommendations from the two panels will now be referred to ECan when it adopts the final plan in July.</p>
