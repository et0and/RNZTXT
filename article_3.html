            <p>A Wellington woman whose parked car was crashed into by a bus resulting in the vehicle being written off is furious at the response she got from the bus company.</p>
        
            <p>Early this year, Laura Nalder arrived home in Churton Park to find her car on the footpath, the back corner crushed in and with yellow paint visible.</p>
        
            <p>Her neighbour had seen the whole incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Our car was parked on the street outside our house. A bus accidentally turned into a small side road around the corner, and then when it realised it had made a mistake, backed out of that side road into our car, and then immediately drove off," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The car, which had been her grandmother's, was written off.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty heavily damaged, and they cannot possibly have not noticed it happened."</p>

            <p>Nalder is one of 88 people in Wellington whose parked cars were hit by buses in the past nine months.</p>
        
            <p>Tramways Union secretary and Wellington bus driver Kevin O'Sullivan said the numbers were no surprise, with drivers having near misses every day.</p>
        
            <p>"There's just so many things going on. If you ride a bus and stand there by the front you'll see for yourself, there's a lot going on."</p>
        
            <p>What has come as a surprise to car owners is the fraught process of getting someone to take responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder called Metlink which runs the bus service, but it referred her to Tranzurban, which operates the buses.</p>
        
            <p>It did not want to talk to her.</p>
        
            <p>"They were annoyed that I'd got in touch them, and I was pretty unimpressed that that was their response when I called them.</p>
        
            <p>"It was like, 'how did you get this number, why are you calling us?'"</p>
        
            <p>After an email exchange she sensed it was a losing battle and gave up on the $500 of insurance excess she was owed.</p>
        
            <p>Similar experiences have been aired on social media with people complaining about poor customer service and slow responses, including one person who said it took two months to get a payout.</p>
        
            <p>Tranzurban and Wellington's other main operator Kinetic both declined to be interviewed.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Kinetic said the process for dealing with buses hitting parked cars was clear.</p>
        
            <p>"Accidents are recorded on a third-party Accident Recording Card and attached to the damaged vehicle if no one is in it. The Kinetic operations control centre is then immediately advised, and a motor vehicle accident form is completed on return to depot which then commences the insurance process."</p>
        
            <p>Tranzurban said its response was equally thorough.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a robust internal process for reporting incidents and accidents involving Tranzurban services.</p>
        
            <p>"Tranzurban arranges repairs for vehicle damage confirmed through our insurance provider, who liaises with the other party and their repairer."</p>
        
            <p>But crash data from this year has found that some bus drivers left notes, some took down details, and other collisions - like Laura Nalder's - went completely unreported until car owners got in touch.</p>
