            <p>A swimmer has died after being pulled from a rip at West Auckland's Piha Beach.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said a report came through at about 3.30pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>CPR was given to the person on the beach, but they died near the scene, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with their family and loved ones."</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving New Zealand (SLSNZ) said two lifeguards responded to the incident and a second person had also been rescued.</p>
        
            <p>The death would be referred to the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>The death came as Surf Life Saving New Zealand (SLSNZ) issued a message to the public about never underestimating the conditions after a near-miss also at Piha Beach.</p>
        
            <p>There had been a "dramatic" rescue at Piha on Monday, SLSNZ chief executive Steve Fisher said, which led him to issue a reminder about safety around water.</p>
        
            <p>Two lifeguards were training on the beach when they saw three people on boogie boards in a deeper area of the shore bed, Fisher said.</p>
        
            <p>The lifeguards offered the three young men help but they refused the offer, not realising the danger they were in.</p>
        
            <p>Moments later, a large wave swept the men off their boards and into the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Panic set in. Without their floatation devices, the men realised their predicament and began shouting and wildly waving their arms in the air," Fisher said.</p>
        
            <p>The lifeguards were able to get the men back to shore but they had swallowed a lot of water and had to be taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"People drown at unpatrolled beaches. Don't overestimate your abilities, and don't underestimate the conditions. Please swim between the flags at a patrolled beach. If the flags aren't up, don't go in," Fisher said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always better to be safe than sorry. Each fatal drowning in New Zealand leaves families, whānau, and communities devastated. We all have a responsibility to address our drowning toll, and the best way to do that is by making sensible decisions when it comes to our coastlines."</p>
