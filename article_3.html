            <p>Wellington Phoenix striker Oskar Zawada is leaving the club because he does not fit with coach Giancarlo Italiano's plans for the future.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old Polish linchpin scored the 99th minute equaliser for the Phoenix in their 2-1 semi-final defeat to Melbourne Victory yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>His heroics coming off the bench thrilled more than 33,000 fans in Wellington on Saturday night as their season was cut short in extra time.</p>
        
            <p>But coach Giancarlo Italiano said the club could not afford to keep him, despite Zawada keeping the team in the running in the second leg semi-final clash.</p>
        
            <p>"You won't see Zawada here," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we've done well this year the market has obviously pushed the value of those players up."</p>
        
            <p>"I want to reinvest some of that money into some of the younger players that I want longer term."</p>
        
            <p>Zawada scored an impressive tally of 22 goals for the club since joining the Wellington side in August 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He scored 15 goals in the 2022/23 season, but was limited by serious injury problems in his second year.</p>

            <p>Australian media reports have linked Zawada in a move to Auckland FC, and his goal scoring attributes would make him an obvious target for the new A-League side.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he had signed elsewhere, Italiano said: "I don't know, you'll have to ask him."</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington coach confirmed veteran striker Kosta Barbarouses was in his sights.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pretty confident I'll keep Kosta," Italiano said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very happy here and he deserves another contract."</p>
        
            <p>"I won't speak too much to the money side because that's not for me."</p>
        
            <p>Italiano suggested some A-League clubs would be closing their wallets due to financial constraints.</p>
        
            <p>"Every club is in a different position. There are some clubs still spending a lot of money next year. There are some that unfortunately need to make some cuts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a very good owner, a very good football committee. They put a lot of investment into the club."</p>
        
            <p>"They'll want to be competitive again, again with an re-emphasis on youth, a re-emphasis on trying to build on what we've done. We'll just plan accordingly."</p>
        
            <p>"The general trend will be a lot of tightening of budgets," Italian said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix director of football David Dome told RNZ Zawada would be picked up by either an A-League club or possibly from a team further afield.</p>
