            <p>A football stadium DJ has apologised for playing 'Last Christmas' by Wham!, potentially knocking more than 7000 people out of cult game Whamageddon.</p>
        
            <p>Players try to avoid George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley's 1984 hit for as long as possible before Christmas Eve and are eliminated once they hear it.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Facer, DJ at Northampton Town, was criticised for playing it at the home game against Portsmouth on 2 December.</p>
        
            <p>"I never knew people took it so seriously," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Whamageddon started about 10 years ago, and has grown in a popularity through social media.</p>
        
            <p>It now has set rules, a dedicated website and merchandise.</p>
        
            <p>The game's rules state: "While we can't stop you from deliberately sending your friends to Whamhalla, the intention is that this is a survival game. Not a Battle Royale."</p>
        
            <p>Facer, known as DJ Matty, played the song during half-time in the League One clash at Sixfields, attended by 7215 people.</p>
        
            <p>"I gave it a spin, thinking it would be quite funny to wipe out 7000 people who couldn't avoid it, but clearly it isn't funny," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a bit of an insult on Twitter, light-hearted, [saying] it was not a nice thing to do, and apparently that was quite tame to what was being said in the stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"So I officially apologise to everybody whose Christmas I've ruined."</p>
        
            <p>He has promised not to play the song during the home game against Fleetwood Town, to avoid upsetting fans of the Lancashire side.</p>
        
            <p>He told BBC Radio Northampton: "I can take on the chin with my home fans and Portsmouth, but I don't think I'll be playing it again.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a shame people in professions like mine can't play Wham! until [late] December, but it's a game and we all have to jump on board."</p>
        
            <p>'Last Christmas' reached number two on its release, finally reaching the top spot on 1 January 2021.</p>
