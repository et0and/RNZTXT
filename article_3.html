            <p>A fire at a Kāinga Ora apartment block in Auckland, which left dozens of flats without power and water, is now being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>The fire at the complex in Ōtāhuhu started in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Six tenants had to be evacuated from the three-storey building, within a residential complex on Albert Street.</p>
        
            <p>And as a result of the fire, 56 flats lost power and water.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the fire was being treated as suspicious and the cause was under investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora earlier said no one was injured and it had arranged alternative accommodation for the people who were displaced.</p>
        
            <p>It was still assessing the extent of damage to the building.</p>
        
            <p>The agency had not yet confirmed if power and water had been restored to all the flats.</p>
