            <p>A prisoner who is on a hunger strike after allegedly having his head beaten into a concrete floor by prison guards has been sent to hospital and is suffering from kidney issues, his lawyers say.</p>
        
            <p>Dean Wickliffe, who has spent a lifetime in and out of prison, has been on hunger strike since 10 March - a total of 14 days - after he was allegedly beaten by guards at Spring Hill Prison for refusing to enter his cell.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken to prison when he was found living in his car after being made homeless, a breach of his parole requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Annette Sykes & Co solicitor Sam Vincent told RNZ that Wickliffe was still not eating and was struggling to walk.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that he's got impaired kidney function now, we found that out over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"We have sought medical information from the prison as requested by Mr Wickliffe, but we haven't received that yet."</p>
        
            <p>Vincent said Wickliffe went to hospital on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"That seems to be where he needs to be so that his condition doesn't drastically deteriorate. That's about as much as I know about his medical."</p>
        
            <p>Vincent said they have been told by the prison the incident has now been referred to police.</p>
        
            <p>A Corrections spokesperson said the alleged assault had been referred to police and a staff member placed on special leave.</p>
        
            <p>They said Wickliffe had been taken to hospital but could not comment further due to their obligations under the Privacy Act.</p>
        
            <p>Wickliffe's parole hearing is still scheduled for 26 March.</p>
