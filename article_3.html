        <h2>Call for time limits on Pharmac's drug assessment process</h2>
        <p>
"Our processes are just making us fall further and further behind," said Cancer Society chief executive Rachael Hart.

            <p>The Cancer Society says it is great to see the new government invest in cancer drugs, but it also needs to ensure the drug-buying agency acts more quickly to save lives.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday marks World Cancer Day. Cancer Society chief executive Rachael Hart said National's promise to pay for 13 cancer treatments should make a difference, but Pharmac's processes also need to be overhauled.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to have investment in cancer drugs as New Zealand is behind, but it's not the end of the story. Pharmac processes are really slow compared to other countries - on average, to assess a cancer drug, it takes 860 days, more than a year longer than Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Our processes are just making us fall further and further behind. It's great to have investment in medicines, but actually we need a fix to the system as well."</p>
        
            <p>Hart said the new government has indicated it will look at Pharmac, but the Cancer Society also wants it to give Pharmac fixed timelines in which to assess new medicines, especially those that are life-saving or life-prolonging, and provide more funding certainty.</p>
        
            <p>Hart also said the national travel assistance scheme is not fit for purpose.</p>
        
            <p>The reimbursement travel rate for cancer patients is 28 cents per kilometre, "woefully below" the Inland Revenue's 95 cents per kilometre allowance for business use, while the accommodation rate is $100 a night.</p>
        
            <p>Hart said cancer patients are spending huge amounts of money just getting to their appointments, and fixing the scheme needs to be a priority for the government.</p>
        
            <p>About 25,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in New Zealand every year.</p>
        
            <p>In June last year, a Te Whatu Ora spokesperson told RNZ there was "an urgent need" to review the National Travel Assistance Scheme to ensure equitable access to health services. However, the transition from a system based on 20 district health boards, with variations in access to care, would take time.</p>
