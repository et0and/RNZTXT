            <p>An alleyway being used by criminals to flee and hide from police in Hastings is to be closed permanently in around six weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to close the alleyway, which runs between Oliphant Place and Bledisloe Street, was made at a Hastings District Council meeting on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The decision was unanimous, with councillor Damon Harvey asking that the council look at speeding up the process which he said had taken 12 to 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after complaints of damage to properties and fences, trespassing, theft and burglary from residents adjacent to the alleyway.</p>
        
            <p>Council papers said the "alleyway provided a link for such activity as decamping from the police".</p>
        
            <p>A bend about halfway down the alleyway meant there is no clear sightline from one end to the other, or around the bend.</p>
        
            <p>"The location where the alleyway widens creates a 'hide point'.</p>
        
            <p>"Users going from Oliphant Place to Bledisloe Street would not be able to see anyone in this 'hide point'. It is also poorly lit and adjacent boundaries have high solid fencing and plantings with no through visibility between the properties and the alleyway."</p>
        
            <p>The alleyway is also covered in graffiti and litter.</p>
        
            <p>However, a nearby resident didn't agree with the closure as he said the alleyway was safe and he used it.</p>
        
            <p>A property owner adjacent to the alleyway told the council there "are a very low number of pedestrians (20 per day on average) that use the alleyway to go to and from Raureka School.</p>
        
            <p>The resident said pedestrian numbers increased from time to time, although "this is due to the alleyway being used for illegal purposes".</p>
        
            <p>Council papers say the Oliphant Place to Bledisloe Street alleyway is directly opposite the Bledisloe Street to Wall Road alleyway.</p>
        
            <p>Both alleyways form a pedestrian link between Wall Road and Oliphant Road.</p>
        
            <p>The closure of this alleyway will mean that pedestrians will need to use Bledisloe Street and Cobham Street to get to and from Oliphant Road meaning an additional 300 metres walking distance.</p>
