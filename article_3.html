There has been plenty of vibrancy and eclecticism on display, band tees, or attire influenced by club culture.

            <p>Another bumper crowd, brimming with colour, has descended on Christchurch's Hagley Park for Electric Avenue's second day.</p>
        
            <p>Following a rapturous atmosphere on Friday, many have either joined in the fanfare, or backed up their efforts from the previous day.</p>

            <p>Actually there was a range of inspiration on show.</p>
        
            <p>"The hot pink was all about just being free and comfortable and wild," Naidu said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just looked around online and I was just like 'I like that'. There's a colour theme obviously," Te Huia said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a boho kind of girl. I just like dressing up, it's fun," Quay said.</p>

            <p>"It's Will's first festival and my second festival. We know some people were going to be dressed very different, but we wanted to be outstanding. I've seen a lot of people in 'Duk' shirts but none as vibrant as this. The 'Duk's are out in full force today."</p>

            <p>"My get-up is inspired by my national people which is Samoa, so I've got the nice Hawaiian shirt, including the lei, and the Samoan flag, which is my culture. I'm just here for the vibe. I don't know any of the artists to be honest, I'm just catching up with friends."</p>

            <p>"Well I'm a bit of an old raver so that's where the pants come from. The hat I made with my daughter Billie, because we've always wanted to see Empire of the Sun together, and that was the first time they came to New Zealand. My daughter told me they were coming so I got us tickets. And they were here yesterday and we were right at the front. In the morning we made the hat, kind of in honour of Empire of the Sun because they always have some pretty cool head gear. They were incredible last night," Struan Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was on my Dad's shoulders for "Walking on a Dream" and we were right up front, and he looked straight at me while I was wearing a light up hat. It was f**king awesome," Billie Robertson added.</p>

            <p>"My daughter told me that I look like Chappell Roan today, which is a compliment. No real inspiration just fun," Jen Evans said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just trying not to look my age," Hamish Evans said.</p>
