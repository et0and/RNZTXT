            <p>Fifteen years after its launch, the annual indigenous triathlon, IronMāori, is entering a new stage as its founders step aside.</p>
        
            <p>IronMāori was founded in 2009 by Heather Te Au-Skipworth and Wayne Skipworth to promote health, well-being, and longevity in Māori communities.</p>
        
            <p>The wero (challenge) of running the Hawke's Bay based triathlon will now be taken up by whānau-based social support agency Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga after the mauri of the event was passed to them.</p>
        
            <p>IronMāori founder Heather Te Au-Skipworth said she thought she would feel heavy letting go of the kaupapa, but the strength of the team at Taiwhenua had made it much easier.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really hard to let go of something that you love, so I don't think I'll ever let it go. I'll always be there in support because by handing it over it's because I want it to grow," she said.</p>

            <p>Handing it over will allow the IronMāori to reach out to other communities outside of the Hawke's Bay, something Te Au-Skipworth said she couldn't do alone.</p>
        
            <p>Te Taiwhenua o Herataunga Chief Executive Waylyn Tahuri-Whaipakanga said she feels the responsibility of running IronMāori ahead of the next triathlon in November.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of responsibility that needs to be taken in the next month and build up confidence and trust with the network that Heather has surrounded herself with."</p>
        
            <p>She said IronMāori is alive and well and has grown from 200 participants to 3000.</p>
        
            <p>Tahuri-Whaipakanga said Taiwhenua has plans to expand the event and may look to hold triathlons outside the Hawke's Bay rohe, while continuing to uphold the central kaupapa of IronMāori, which is health and well-being.</p>
        
            <p>"IronMāori is a positive kaupapa that people can join and no one's going to say 'well how long have you been overeating for...?'</p>
        
            <p>"It's about hey get some shoes on, get your swimsuit on and get your bike out or one thing out and start, just start," she said.</p>
        
            <p>That idea was echoed by Te Au-Skipworth.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's the non-judgemental environment that IronMāori offers, when people come [they're] not seen as the colonised whakaaro (idea) of skinny, not skinny, old, young.</p>
        
            <p>"You're seen being able to arrive as who you are and feel comfortable with who you are, with no expectations from anybody except yourself.</p>
        
            <p>"For us in the kaupapa it's about never asking people what's the matter with them, but rather what matters to them."</p>
