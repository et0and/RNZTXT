            <p>Men aged over 45 made up 58 percent of the provisional total of 90 preventable drownings in 2023, and Water Safety NZ (WSNZ) wants more resources targeted at the "hard-to-reach bunch of blokes".</p>
        
            <p>"We are still seeing an unacceptable number of preventable deaths, especially among older New Zealand males who continue to make risky choices around water," WSNZ CEO Daniel Gerrard said.</p>
        
            <p>The number of drownings last year was above the 10-year average of 82, but lower than 2022's 94 preventable drownings.</p>
        
            <p>Males accounted for 83 percent of those who drowned in 2023, WSNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Unintentional slips and falls led to 29 of the drownings, while in 19 cases people were swimming or playing in the water.</p>
        
            <p>Drownings linked to powered craft dropped to four from 21 in 2022, and was lower than the 10-year average of 11.</p>
        
            <p>It was hoped messages such as the "Just Wear It" lifejacket campaign, run in conjunction with Coastguard NZ, were beginning to be listened to, WSNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 90 drownings, 26 were at beaches, 24 in rivers, 11 in pools and 11 offshore.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland and Waikato both had above average drownings, with 26 and 16, respectively.</p>
        
            <p>The 12 drownings in Hawke's Bay were three times higher than average for the region, with the increase partly due to flood-related incidents, WSNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Drownings dropped in Northland to four from 18 in 2022, and was below the 10-year average of 11.</p>
        
            <p>Drowning numbers remained distressingly high, and immediate and robust action was needed, Gerrard said.</p>
        
            <p>WSNZ wanted a three-pronged approach, with one prong targeted towards older men.</p>
        
            <p>More resources were needed to expand meaningful messaging to "this hard-to-reach bunch of blokes", Gerrard said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every child needed to be taught at school how to float and move in the water, and to be given a basic understanding of the country's waterways. And floating wasn't just for children. Everyone should understand its importance."</p>
