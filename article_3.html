            <p>A business group in Auckland wants Burger Fuel to do more than just blame a "mechanical fault" for one of its cars hitting people at a parade yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle, which was part of the Avondale Santa Parade, rolled slowly into two pedestrians standing in front of the main stage.</p>
        
            <p>The two pedestrians received moderate to serious injuries and were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Three people - including two children - were also pulled from the Burger Fuel car and assaulted, receiving minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Avondale Business Association Marcus Amosa said Burger Fuel should admit the driver's mistake, say sorry, and promise to fix things.</p>
        
            <p>He said the vehicle was creating skid marks, raising concerns from the public about cars moving around in a small space where there were kids present.</p>
        
            <p>A Whau Local Board member said she heard the MC of the Avondale Christmas parade yelling stop shortly before the car hit pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>Local board member Catherine Farmer was at the parade and described hearing the parade's MC yelling 'stop' and telling people to call an ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>"The MC started yelling out 'stop, stop, go back, stop!' and then I heard him say 'we've got to get Fire and Emergency here, we've got to get ambulances,'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then there was just a general melee."</p>
        
            <p>Burger Fuel was approached for comment.</p>
