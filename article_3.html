            <p>Around 1000 people on Parliament's front lawn are calling on the government to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who spent the first 12 years of her life there addressed the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>She said Gaza used to be like Wellington, full of love and light.</p>

            <p>Multiple groups are behind today's demonstration, including Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa and Justice for Palestine.</p>
        
            <p>They say more than 10,000 children and infants have been killed since the start of the attack on the Gaza Strip on 7 October - the equivalent of 36 average sized New Zealand primary schools.</p>

            <p>More than a thousand protesters sung waiata to close the demonstration.</p>
        
            <p>Samira Zaitoun from one of the groups behind the protest, Justice for Palestine, told the crowd songs could express emotions that could not be put into words.</p>
        
            <p>The singing was followed by further chants of "Free, free Palestine".</p>
