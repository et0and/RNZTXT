            <p>The US gymnastics team has a new breakout star - bespectacled, Rubik's Cube-solving 'pommel horse guy' Stephen Nedoroscik.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old gymnast specialises in the pommel horse, which demands strength, rhythm, and precision.</p>
        
            <p>When he stepped up to the apparatus on Monday night, for the men's artistic gymnastics team final, he delivered a clutch performance, rousing the crowds watching in the arena and at home.</p>
        
            <p>With one 40-second routine, Nedoroscik helped secure the team a bronze medal - its first since 2008 - and became an overnight internet sensation.</p>
        
            <p>Nedoroscik had the final routine in the last rotation of the Olympic final.</p>
        
            <p>His less than one minute on the apparatus was the only thing standing between the US team and a medal.</p>
        
            <p>As he hopped off after scoring 14.866, his fist shot straight into the air and the crowd erupted. He did what he had come to Paris to do.</p>
        
            <p>The internet also took notice of the gymnast from the state of Massachusetts.</p>
        
            <p>Soon, he was being referred to as Mr Pommel Horse. His girlfriend changed her profile on X, formerly Twitter, to "Ms Pommel Horse".</p>
        
            <p>Fans also discovered one of his hobbies: solving Rubik's Cubes. He finished one in less than 10 seconds the day of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>In a interview on Tuesday, Nedoroscik told NBC's The Today Show that solving the puzzle is "stress relief".</p>
        
            <p>"I love to solve it - it's just fun," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Social media users compared him to Clark Kent, Superman's alter-ego who wears glasses.</p>
        
            <p>Nedoroscik, waiting for his routine, sat on the sidelines in glasses, before taking them off to compete.</p>
        
            <p>"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team," one user wrote in a viral post.</p>
        
            <p>"He just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years."</p>
        
            <p>NBC's Olympics X account called him "the Clark Kent of pommel horse".</p>
        
            <p>Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, which can cause double vision.</p>
        
            <p>In a 2022 post on TikTok, he showed his followers how his condition allows him to alternate which eye is the dominant eye.</p>
        
            <p>He told The Today Show he thought the memes about him are "awesome" and represent "the people that wear glasses well".</p>
        
            <p>He was asked how he was able to carry out Monday's routine without his glasses, though he has competed in prescription goggles in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not necessarily clear," he said of his vision.</p>
        
            <p>"But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [the glasses] on, they're going to fly somewhere."</p>
        
            <p>In the end, he said, it's "all about feeling the equipment".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything."</p>
        
            <p>Nedoroscik will compete again in the individual event, the men's pommel horse final, on 3 August.</p>
