            <p>Five teenagers have been arrested after two cases of drivers fleeing through Auckland, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Officers found a stolen vehicle travelling through Manurewa at about 10.40pm on 1 January, police area commander Inspector Joe Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>The driver fled, but the police Eagle helicopter followed the vehicle, which was reported to be "speeding, driving dangerously and running multiple red lights," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It had to be spiked twice, losing two tyres in Roscommon Road in Wiri before entering State Highway 20 at Kirkbride Road and finally coming to a stop.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver continued to flee before the vehicle was spiked again on Wallace Road, MƒÅngere Bridge."</p>
        
            <p>Police said it was incredibly fortunate no one on the roads had been seriously injured during the incident.</p>
        
            <p>An 18-year-old was arrested, and was scheduled to appear in court later in January charged with failing to stop, dangerous driving and unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Less than an hour later, officers tried to stop a vehicle in Takanini that was being driven with no headlights on and a broken window, before that driver also fled, Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter watched as it travelling along State Highway 20, and its tyres were spiked at the Waterview tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>Four young people aged between 13 and 16 were taken into custody.</p>
