        <h2>All Blacks Rugby Championship campaign: what we learned</h2>
        <p>
Analysis: Scott Robertson's side wrapped up the Rugby Championship with a win over the Wallabies - here's the key talking points.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis: The second chapter of Scott Robertson's new regime has finished after the All Blacks' 33-13 win over the Wallabies at Sky Stadium in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>They didn't win the Rugby Championship - which is worth mentioning first, because success is the first standard the All Blacks are judged on - however, as always, there is more to it after the three win/three loss campaign.</p>
        
            <p>The team breaks up for now, with many players set to feature in the NPC next weekend, before reassembling for a very tough-looking end of year tour. But here's what we can talk about in the meantime:</p>
        
            <p>Robertson was refreshingly adamant the All Blacks could've won all their games had they not come up short in some key moments. That was no more apparent than in the opening loss to the Pumas in Wellington, where everything that could have gone wrong did in almost comical fashion in the last 15 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>In South Africa, it was a different story, as the losses there felt like they were almost unavoidable due to the Springboks' class. But really, there wasn't much in both results, despite them being played in front of electric and intimidating home crowds.</p>

            <p>The one thing the All Blacks can't be moaning about too much is the amount of time they've spent playing a man down. All the yellow cards they've earned were fully justified, and a lack of adaptation to the sort of strict reffing interpretations that permeate test footy - in a way they don't in Super Rugby Pacific - is a worry.</p>

            <p>While some of his selections have been a talking point, Robertson's class of new players cannot be argued with. Wallace Sititi has been outstanding, and Cortez Ratima not far behind, while Sam Darry and Billy Proctor have made the most of their opportunities, too. Pasilio Tosi is another great example: his shift off the bench in the second Bledisloe match showed he's still got the talents of the loose forward he used to be, with a couple of excellent turnovers.</p>

            <p>It was a special occasion to see Sam Cane get his 100th test cap, but it's unlikely the man himself was particularly confident of that happening back in May. Cane wasn't even playing, let alone in the All Black conversation, but Robertson's lifeline will see him bow out on happier terms than how it was looking like his career would end last year. Much was also made of TJ Perenara's last match at home in Wellington - but with an eye to the future, what does Robertson do with them now?</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure, both of them will be going on the end of year tour in some capacity, because Robertson confirmed there will essentially be two teams assembling for the first two tests in Tokyo and London. The All Blacks XV is also headed away so that means around 70 players will be used over the schedule. Of course, all eyes are on the three big weeks against England, Ireland and France - all teams with a point to prove against the All Blacks.</p>

            <p>The capital has copped it recently in the media and the reasons why are too complicated for a column like this. But what can be reported in a very straightforward manner is the atmosphere for Bledisloe II at Sky Stadium was easily the best for an All Blacks home test since the last Lions tour. The combination of a nice day, an anticipated fixture that turned into a good watch, and the farewells to Cane and Perenara saw the full house burst into song at every opportunity and roar the All Blacks home. Perenara said afterwards how surprised the All Blacks were with the response from the Wellington public, and how it positively affected their performance. Long may that sort of attitude continue from All Black fans.</p>
