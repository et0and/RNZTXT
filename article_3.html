            <p>A man has been arrested and charged after an incident in Taupō last week that saw five schools and a kindergarten locked down.</p>
        
            <p>Police said at the time they were called to the Hilltop area after receiving reports of "an altercation between a man and a woman who were both armed with knives".</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Detective Senior Sergeant Ryan Yardley said a man was also reported to have been "agitated and armed with a firearm" in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A car and a gun were seized during the incident, which saw the armed offenders squad and police dog unit called out.</p>
        
            <p>The schools were locked down and streets cordoned off while the incident unfolded.</p>
        
            <p>Police later issued a public plea for information about the man's whereabouts, saying he should "come forward sooner rather than later".</p>
        
            <p>Yardley said a 28-year-old man was arrested in Counties Manukau on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in the Manukau District Court today on firearms charges relating to the Hilltop incident.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this was a distressing incident, and police worked incredibly hard to bring this man before the courts," Yardley said.</p>
