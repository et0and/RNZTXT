            <p>New Zealand golfer Ryan Fox sits poised five shots off the lead in a share of eighth place at the midway point of the US Masters at Augusta National.</p>
        
            <p>Fox was just two strokes off top spot at the turn midway through his second round on Saturday morning but three bogeys early in his back nine in wild, windy conditions saw him card a two-over 74.</p>
        
            <p>He struggled to make greens in regulation but fought hard with his short game to leave him within sight of the leaders heading into the weekend, with Americans Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau and Max Homa all on six-under.</p>
        
            <p>Homa, who had never broken 70 at Augusta until wrapping up his weather delayed first round early on day two, was quickly back out on the course and on the move with birdies at the second and fourth.</p>
        
            <p>From there the 33-year-old went into full damage control mode, carding 13 pars and a single bogey to happily sign for a one-under-71 as gusting winds and firming conditions limited scoring chances.</p>
        
            <p>Homa's total was matched by LIV Golf powerhouse DeChambeau, who muscled his way through Amen Corner with birdies at 12 and 13.</p>
        
            <p>DeChambeau had set the early target on Thursday, carding his best ever Masters round of seven-under 65 but was unable to find any momentum until making the turn.</p>

            <p>Homa has six wins on the PGA Tour but has never been able to produce anywhere near his best at the majors.</p>
        
            <p>In four visits to Augusta he has missed the cut twice and his best finish a tie for 43rd last year.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, as if Tiger Woods has not already enjoyed enough success at Augusta National, he added his name yet again to the Masters record book as his 24th consecutive made cut at the major marked another tournament milestone.</p>
        
            <p>Woods has never missed a Masters cut as a professional and now the 48-year-old sits alone atop the record list at Augusta National with one more consecutively made cut than fellow Masters champions Gary Player and Fred Couples.</p>
        
            <p>The five-times Masters champion fired an even-par 72 to sit one-over and comfortably inside the cut line.</p>

            <p>But Woods, who said he will enjoy some time later on Friday to appreciate his latest accomplishment, was naturally looking at the bigger picture.</p>
        
            <p>"It means I have a chance going into the weekend. I'm here. I have a chance to win the golf tournament," said Woods.</p>
        
            <p>"I got my two rounds in. Just need some food and some caffeine, and I'll be good to go."</p>
        
            <p>Coming into the Masters, Woods had played just 24 holes of competitive golf this year given his physical limitations and he faced a daunting 23-hole test of endurance on Friday after his opening round was suspended on Thursday due to darkness.</p>
        
            <p>And so, less than an hour after finishing the final five holes of his first round, Woods went back out hoping his injury-ravaged body, including the ankle he had fused last year, would hold up on a hilly and taxing Augusta National layout.</p>
        
            <p>But the greatest golfer of his generation, who has nothing left to prove, looked comfortable and showed several flashes of his artistry on a course he knows better than any other golfer in the field.</p>
        
            <p>"I was forced to get up-and-down a few times today, and I was able to do that," said Woods.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of those chip shots I was able to get up-and-down because I left it in the perfect spot, and that's understanding how to play this golf course."</p>
        
            <p>Woods last played a full weekend at the Masters in 2022 when he struggled through pain and carded a pair of career-worst 78s only 14 months after a car crash that nearly resulted in doctors amputating his right leg.</p>
        
            <p>While Woods appears fit enough to play this weekend, it will definitely be yet another ultimate test for a golfer who has had very few competitive reps in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm tired," said Woods. "I've been out for a while, competing, grinding. It's been a long 23 holes, a long day."</p>
