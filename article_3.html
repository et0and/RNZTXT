            <p>A long-serving Taupō District Councillor has admitted to drink driving.</p>
        
            <p>Anna Park appeared in Auckland District Court on Friday afternoon, after failing a compulsory breath test on the Control Gate Bridge in Taupō in November.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement sent by her lawyer, Park said she takes full responsibility for her lapse in judgement.</p>
        
            <p>"I am deeply sorry for the disappointment and hurt my actions have caused to my family, friends, colleagues, and the wider community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am committed to learning from this mistake and earning back the trust I have lost. deeply sorry for the disappointment and hurt her actions have caused."</p>
        
            <p>Park said she did not seek name suppression because she believes in being fully accountable and taking responsibility for her actions.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said she sought to protect her family from undue public attention by having the case heard out of town.</p>
        
            <p>Park was first elected to Taupō District Council in 2010.</p>
