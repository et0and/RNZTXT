        <h2>Long-term Plan: South Aucklanders on what's important to them</h2>
        <p>
More than 22,000 individuals in the region provided feedback, with 2200 of those living in the south Auckland wards.

            <p>The establishment of an Auckland Future fund, targeted rates and the disapproval of leasing airport shares were some proposals South Aucklanders felt strongly about in the council's Long-term Plan (LTP).</p>
        
            <p>The month-long public submissions on Auckland Council's LTP came to an end in March, where Aucklanders were asked to have their say on options and trade-offs of activities and services delivery for Auckland over the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>More than 22,000 individuals in the region provided feedback, with 2200 of those living in the south Auckland wards.</p>
        
            <p>Ōtara-Papatoetoe Local Board chairperson Apulu Reece Autagavaia praised those that took the time to be a part of the process for Auckland's future.</p>
        
            <p>"However, overall, across the city our area had less feedback compared to census data," Autagavaia said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know our people are often busy trying to make ends meet, pay bills, keep a roof over heads etc, that giving feedback to a council consultation is not a primary focus."</p>
        
            <p>The LTP set out a central proposal which spanned a wide range of hot topics, from transport, drinking water and storm water, to parks and community, city and local development, environmental management and economic development.</p>

            <p>The consultation document also presented alternative options to 'pay more, get more' or to 'pay less, get less' than the central proposal.</p>
        
            <p>According to council's summary of the LTP consultation, feedback was received from 22,079 individuals, 391 organisations, 14 mana whenua and nine other Māori organisations and 5485 pro-forma responses.</p>
        
            <p>For South Aucklanders in the Māngere-Otahuhu, Manurewa, Ōtara-Papatoetoe, Franklin and Papakura local wards, there was strong support for the establishment of the Auckland Future Fund, but against the leasing of Auckland Ports.</p>
        
            <p>Transport, parks and community, funding of council services through port profit, and rates for natural environment, water quality, climate action transport and refuse collection also received strong support.</p>
        
            <p>There was less support for proposals on water, city and local development, economic and cultural environment, council support and recycling charges for schools.</p>
        
            <p>Autagavaia said for his ward, rate increases would impact households more than others, due to limited discretionary income to absorb rates increases and rise in cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>"However, when the feedback data is further detailed, our community clearly ask for more and better council services and facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of our communities depend on council services and any cuts could be detrimental to our community."</p>

            <p>He was especially encouraged by youth groups in his ward who went out and gathered hundreds of public submissions from their peers.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe it was the Ōtara Youth Hub who was contracted to do so at PolyFest," Autagavaia said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is reflected in more representative feedback according to age demographics, compared to previous feedback."</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the Franklin ward strongly backed the targeted rate of $52 a year, to help pay for pathways and trails in the district.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed paths would mainly be in urban areas and connect with existing paths as well as the wider public transport network.</p>
        
            <p>The Franklin, Papakura, and Manurewa local boards reserved their comments about the LTP submissions, until after a business meeting later this month.</p>
