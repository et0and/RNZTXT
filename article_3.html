            <p>A Canadian based oil and gas company has had a modest gas find in Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Energy Corporation (NZEC) said it had tapped a new supply in the existing Tariki field, but further testing will be needed to assess the full extent of the supplies.</p>
        
            <p>"The Tariki-5A gas development well has confirmed there is significant additional producible gas remaining in the Tariki sands higher in structure than was previously accessed," chief executive Michael Adams said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where NZEC is listed, it said it would move to set up processing facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"Management of New Zealand Energy expects the reservoir to be able to deliver at least 10 terajoules per day (nine million cubic feet per day)."</p>
        
            <p>Production around those levels would equate to about 3 percent of the country's current annual gas output.</p>
        
            <p>"This is sufficient to exceed the requirements of the gas sales agreement between the Tariki joint venture and Genesis Energy."</p>
        
            <p>The onshore Tariki field is largely depleted and jointly owned by NZEC and L&M Mining, but it has been earmarked as a gas storage facility, which the company said it would start to work on.</p>
        
            <p>Genesis Energy has taken a right to develop up to 10 PJ (petajoules) of gas storage with the Tariki joint venture, so gas can be stored for use during winter months.</p>
        
            <p>Genesis Energy was forced to buy gas from the country's biggest industrial user, Methanex, during the winter power scare in a short term deal that ended in October, because of a shortage of local supplies which forced it to burn more coal at the Huntly power station.</p>
        
            <p>A minority shareholder in NZEC, Monumental Energy, told RNZ in September that it was "excited" by the potential of the Tariki drilling.</p>
