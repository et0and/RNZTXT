        <h2>Giuliani charged, Trump named as co-conspirator in Arizona fake elector scheme</h2>
        <p>
The indictment stems from efforts to reverse Joe Biden's victory in several states in 2020, based on Trump's false claims that he had been re-elected.

            <p>A grand jury has charged 18 people with allegedly taking part in an Arizona fake elector scheme to re-elect then-US President Donald Trump in 2020, the state's attorney general said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The court papers list a "former US president", Trump, as an unindicted co-conspirator.</p>
        
            <p>The indictment stems from efforts to reverse Democrat Joe Biden's victory in several states in 2020, based on Republican Trump's false claims that he had been re-elected.</p>
        
            <p>The names of seven defendants are redacted in an indictment that names 11 others. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.</p>
        
            <p>Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani is among those indicted, said his spokesperson Ted Goodman, although the former New York mayor's name is redacted.</p>
        
            <p>"The continued weaponisation of our justice system should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country," Goodman said.</p>
        
            <p>"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 US presidential election."</p>
        
            <p>The indictment also identifies one defendant as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.</p>
        
            <p>Representatives for Meadows and Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
            <p>US presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.</p>
        
            <p>In Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 votes - a majority of total 538 electoral votes.</p>
        
            <p>Arizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be Arizona's electors for Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Arizona was one of seven states where Trump allies sought to award those state's electoral votes to Trump, even though those states were won by Biden.</p>
        
            <p>The false electors scheme figures in two criminal trials, in Washington, DC, and Georgia, charging Trump with unlawfully seeking to overturn Biden's victory.</p>
