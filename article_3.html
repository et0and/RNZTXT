            <p>A 37-year-old woman has denied charges of neglect and possession of a drug utensil, following the death of a young infant in north Canterbury last year.</p>
        
            <p>Yixia Chen appeared in the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday, in front of Judge Michael Crosbie.</p>
        
            <p>She was granted interim name suppression following her initial court dates in early December, however, this has now lapsed.</p>
        
            <p>Chen has pleaded not guilty to two charges, one of neglect and the other of possession of a glass methamphetamine pipe.</p>
        
            <p>She was remanded on bail ahead of a scheduled case review hearing on 17 March.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to an address in Oxford, in the Waimakariri district, on the afternoon of 5 August 2024 after the baby, Kevin Chen, died.</p>
        
            <p>In November, police told RNZ the death was not being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>A month later a police spokesperson confirmed baby Kevin's death remained "unexplained".</p>
        
            <p>Chen was charged on 3 December.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene examination and a post-mortem examination has since been completed, and subsequent enquiries have led police to laying charges of ill-treatment of a child under 18," a police spokesperson said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents showed police alleged the neglect took place between 4 May and the date of the infant's death.</p>
        
            <p>Failure to provide basic care likely leading to death is punishable by a maximum of 10 years' jail.</p>
