            <p>Animal-rights protesters have attacked a portrait of King Charles, in a London art gallery.</p>
        
            <p>Two protesters stuck posters on the glass covering the painting.</p>
        
            <p>The painting itself was unharmed, said the Philip Mould Gallery, and there were no arrests.</p>
        
            <p>The striking red artwork by Jonathan Yeo, unveiled last month, was the first official painting of the King since his coronation.</p>
        
            <p>The Animal Rising group said its supporters had stuck posters to the glass protecting the painting, in what they described as a "light-hearted" action.</p>
        
            <p>They pasted over the royal portrait with a picture of Wallace, a character from the Wallace and Gromit animations.</p>
        
            <p>It was a protest message criticising the welfare standards of RSPCA "assured farm" status, with King Charles a patron of the RSPCA.</p>
        
            <p>"With King Charles being such a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, we couldn't think of a better way to draw his attention," said Daniel Juniper of the campaign group.</p>

            <p>The gallery, which has been showing the painting to the public for free, said the incident was over quickly and no harm had been done to the artwork.</p>
        
            <p>The Metropolitan Police said they had not been called, but in response to footage on social media, officers had visited the gallery to make inquiries.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff at the venue were spoken to. They confirmed no damage had been done to either the painting or the glass that covered it," said a Met statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The protestors were asked by staff to leave following the incident, which they did.</p>
        
            <p>"The gallery did not wish to report a crime and as such there is no further action by police."</p>
        
            <p>The painting drew much public attention when the King unveiled it in Buckingham Palace last month.</p>
        
            <p>Painter Jonathan Yeo had included an image of a butterfly, to symbolise metamorphosis and rebirth and the King's support for environmental causes.</p>
        
            <p>The RSPCA said it was "shocked by this vandalism", a distraction from its work helping animals.</p>
        
            <p>"We remain confident that our RSPCA Assured scheme is the best way to help farmed animals right now, while campaigning to change their lives in the future," a spokeswoman said.</p>
