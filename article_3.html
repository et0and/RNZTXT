            <p>A teen who held his victims hostage at a remote Southland farmhouse with an airgun said acts of violence "gave him a rush better than drugs".</p>
        
            <p>Jacob Wi, 18, was before the Invercargill District Court this week on seven charges stemming from an incident in which he carried out a prolonged beating of one hostage, threatened to kill two others and fired an airgun at police.</p>
        
            <p>Wi and his 21-year-old girlfriend had been permitted to stay at another young couple's one-bedroom home in Ermedale for eight days, the court heard.</p>
        
            <p>On the afternoon of 20 July, the defendant started consuming alcohol, cannabis and LSD.</p>
        
            <p>When the three others finished work, the two couples went out to visit the grave of the 21-year-old's mother.</p>
        
            <p>An argument began after the girlfriend told her then- partner not to drink at the site, and continued as the group arrived back at the cottage.</p>
        
            <p>The other man went to bed as the defendant and his girlfriend continued arguing, with her telling him she wanted to break up.</p>
        
            <p>Wi began assaulting the sleeping man, punching, kicking and kneeing him in the head in an attack which lasted about an hour, the police summary said.</p>
        
            <p>The defendant later complained of having a sore foot from kicking the victim so hard, the court heard.</p>
        
            <p>After the two women tried unsuccessfully to pull Wi off his now bruised, bleeding and concussed victim, they were told to take refuge in the other room.</p>
        
            <p>Wi turned to them next and held a 30cm kitchen knife inches away from their chests and demanded they hand him an air rifle, or he would stab them.</p>
        
            <p>Holding the weapon, he told his three victims they were not allowed to leave and fired off a couple of practice shots.</p>
        
            <p>The police approached the house about 5am, when the defendant fired shots at them, telling them to "f ... off".</p>
        
            <p>Two hours later he released his hostages and after another hour he discarded his air rifle, as well as several knives, and was arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Judge David Ruth said Wi had referred to the hostages as his "little b .....s".</p>
        
            <p>In a pre-sentence report before the court, the defendant said he accepted, and seemed unfazed by, a term of imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>"You thought prison was where you should be and you did what you needed to get there," the judge said.</p>
        
            <p>Wi said committing crimes of this nature "gave you a rush better than drugs did".</p>
        
            <p>Counsel Paige Noorland said after reading the report, any discount for remorse was "off the table".</p>
        
            <p>The judge gave the teenager credit for his youth due to the "developmental status of young people".</p>
        
            <p>On the three charges of kidnapping as well as assault with intent to injure, threatening to kill, discharging an airgun near a dwelling and making use of a firearm, Wi was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison.</p>
