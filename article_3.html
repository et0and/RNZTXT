            <p>Lydia Ko is back in the top ten of the women's world golf rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Ko won the season opening LPGA tournament in Florida yesterday, her first victory on the tour in more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>Ko the HGV Tournament of Champions by two shots.</p>
        
            <p>That victory has resulted in her rising three spots to number nine.</p>
        
            <p>This time last year Ko was number one, but she went through a difficult 2023 where she managed just two top ten finishes.</p>
        
            <p>She has played 11 years on the LPGA Tour and has now won 20 titles and is just one win away from being eligible for the tour's Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout her career 26-year-old Ko has always remained positive.</p>
        
            <p>"As much as the season was not the way that I would've wanted going into 2023, I felt like I still finished strong," Ko told LPGA.com.</p>
        
            <p>"That gave me good momentum for this year. Just like how 2022 was an unbelievable year and 2023 was a huge question mark, like you can turn it around really quickly. I'm just going to keep working at it."</p>
        
            <p>Ko is just the 29th player in LPGA history to earn 20 or more career wins and is the seventh woman to win 20 LPGA titles before turning 27.</p>
        
            <p>She could earn her next win at this week's Drive On Championship, another event close to her home in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Ko has previously said she may consider retiring if she makes it into the Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>Lilia Vu of the United States remains world number one.</p>
