            <p>The government has announced its new top-priority approach for families with children in emergency housing, while signalling a stricter approach for those accessing it.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop, Social Development Louise Upston and Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka announced the moves in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Priority One category will mean families with dependent children in emergency housing for longer than 12 weeks would automatically move to the top of the waitlist.</p>
        
            <p>It was set out as a policy in National's election campaign, and ticks off another of the items on the coalition's 100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>However, Upston signalled it would come alongside a stricter approach to allowing people into emergency housing in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time as introducing Priority One we'll also be strengthening the verification processes for those entering emergency housing, reviewing eligibility settings, and introducing new obligations," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said verification, eligibility, and limits to the ability for officials to use discretion for applicants for emergency housing would be done before August.</p>
        
            <p>"MSD staff assessing anyone applying for emergency housing will increase their scrutiny of whether they have unreasonably contributed to their immediate emergency housing need, whether they have taken reasonable efforts to access other housing options and whether they have previously paid their emergency housing contribution.</p>
        
            <p>"This will include escalating for further consideration by a manager on a case-by-case basis, and making a grant for one to four days - as opposed to the current options of seven to 21 days - to enable further scrutiny before a grant is approved for a longer period."</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said the government was committed to ending large-scale use of emergency housing motels, and returning them to a rarely and briefly needed last resort.</p>
        
            <p>"Solving emergency housing won't be easy and it won't happen immediately. Bold and radical steps will be required. We'll be exploring a range of options including better support to prevent the need for emergency housing in the first place, as well as for those who exit.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be applying a social investment lens to this problem, targeting support where people need it and looking at innovative options like social bonds."</p>
