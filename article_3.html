            <p>Eight people have been charged after an investigation by the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) "found a network of corruption" in the gambling sector in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The DIA said it found collusion between class 4 venue operators, corporate societies and grant recipients.</p>
        
            <p>It said the charges "relate to the misappropriation of Class 4 (gambling) grant funds, theft of gaming machine proceeds and offering benefits to secure Class 4 (pokie) venues with improper conditions".</p>
        
            <p>Three people appeared at the Napier District Court today, charged with a range of offences under the Gambling Act 2003 and Crimes Act 1961.</p>
        
            <p>The charges allege that the defendants, who were in management positions at several community organisations and within the Class 4 gambling sector, abused their positions to fraudulently obtain or misappropriate hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant funding and other benefits.</p>
        
            <p>One pleaded not guilty and two were remanded without plea.</p>
        
            <p>"Criminal networks that operate in a regulated environment such as class 4 gambling, commit this type of offending with full knowledge of the law. They ultimately take away grants from compliant and honest organisations and give the gambling sector a bad name." DIA director gambling Vicki Scott said.</p>
        
            <p>"Prosecutions of this kind help us ensure the integrity and fairness of the gambling system."</p>
        
            <p>The three defendants have been remanded and are due to appear in court over the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>The five remaining defendants have had their cases adjourned until February.</p>
