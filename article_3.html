            <p>By Daniela Relph, BBC News</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - It has been a challenging few weeks for the Royal Family.</p>
        
            <p>The health problems of both the King and the Princess of Wales have raised questions around what Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace want the public to know.</p>
        
            <p>Their advisors are trying to navigate the appetite for information, the social media speculation and the need to protect two people who are not well.</p>
        
            <p>It is all proving quite the dilemma.</p>
        
            <p>The spotlight has shone even brighter in recent days after the Prince of Wales withdrew at short notice from a memorial service in Windsor for his godfather, King Constantine of Greece. He was due to give a reading, and his name was on the order of service.</p>
        
            <p>But less than an hour before the event was due to start came a message from Kensington Palace.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, the Prince of Wales is no longer able to attend the service this morning due to a personal matter," it said.</p>
        
            <p>This was surprising. Prince William lives on the Windsor Estate. He had a job to do at the service. It was his godfather being remembered.</p>
        
            <p>Immediately the rumour mill cranked into gear - was this a bad sign for Catherine? The advice from the prince's team was that there was no need to panic.</p>
        
            <p>The princess was doing well, they said, implying the absence was not related to his wife's health.</p>
        
            <p>But that was not enough to quell the speculation.</p>
        
            <p>My own WhatsApp messages probably reflected what lots of people were wondering.</p>
        
            <p>What is wrong with Kate? Why won't they tell us? Is that why William has not turned up?</p>
        
            <p>And if you then delved into social media and online searches, you found rumours about the princess's condition growing more outlandish by the hour.</p>
        
            <p>The lack of detailed information and Prince William's sudden withdrawal was fuelling the speculation.</p>
        
            <p>We still do not know why the prince pulled out of the service - but it is worth noting that he attended an event on Thursday as planned.</p>
        
            <p>Advisors to the Wales' are well aware of the online gossip - they read it, they chat about it, they know the conversation.</p>
        
            <p>But they stress that nothing has changed.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Catherine brushed off social media speculation.</p>
        
            <p>"Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the princess's recovery. We said we'd only be providing significant updates. That guidance stands."</p>
        
            <p>There is, of course, the issue of privacy.</p>
        
            <p>For Prince William, protecting his wife while she recovers is paramount.</p>
        
            <p>Kensington Palace quite simply does not want the details of her health made public and aides feel no need to say anymore about it.</p>
        
            <p>But when Catherine does return to public duty the scrutiny will be intense.</p>
        
            <p>All eyes will be on her.</p>
        
            <p>How does she look? How does she seem? Does she appear any different?</p>
        
            <p>Her team are well aware of the interest there will be in that moment so protecting her now has added importance.</p>
        
            <p>They will choose when and how we first see her in public again very carefully.</p>
        
            <p>Things are different over at Buckingham Palace as they manage King Charles III's cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>
        
            <p>There, courtiers feel there is a need to see the monarch in action carrying out some of his duties.</p>
        
            <p>It is why we have seen pictures of the King with the prime minister, going to church, and reading "get well" cards.</p>
        
            <p>This is a King who is compromised at the moment but can still do some of his regular work and the Palace wants to show us that.</p>
        
            <p>There is not that same pressure on Catherine to go public.</p>
        
            <p>She is not the monarch, she does not have to reassure in the same way.</p>
        
            <p>Yes, there is a clamour for information but "so be it" seems to be the mood.</p>
        
            <p>This is a princess who wants to keep things private.</p>
