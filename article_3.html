            <p>Auckland Council's head of urban design has told developers medium-density housing must be liveable.</p>
        
            <p>According to an Auckland Council study, some newly built terraces and duplexes in the city are getting too hot.</p>
        
            <p>Council urban design manager Lisa Dunshea said a combination of poor window placement, minimal shade, and a lack of natural ventilation is resulting in homes overheating in summer.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the issues we heard are around windows not having wide openings.</p>
        
            <p>"And the way windows are oriented - if they're large windows, they can attract a lot of heat."</p>
        
            <p>The council surveyed 1337 medium-density housing (MDH) residents about their living conditions, focusing on homes built between 2016 and 2023 with code of compliance.</p>
        
            <p>Dunshea said most MDH residents were happy with the temperature of their homes, particularly people in apartments.</p>
        
            <p>But those living in upper levels of terraced houses and duplexes were dissatisfied with sweltering temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>Dunshea said participants reported making changes to cool their homes often at a high financial cost, by installing fans and air conditioning units.</p>
        
            <p>She said some kept their curtains closed and windows open at all times to beat the heat.</p>
        
            <p>But Dunshea said there are other ways of cooling a MDH that those building them should consider.</p>
        
            <p>"The natural environment is a big one."</p>
        
            <p>"Trees have an important cooling effect.</p>
        
            <p>"Council can make sure where there is space, particularly on the street, that landscape is provided."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was also best to have architectural features on the outside of a home to stop the sun coming in.</p>
        
            <p>"Lourves and eaves on the external part of a building provide shade.</p>
        
            <p>"Having window placements set back a little bit enables shade to be cast across the glass when the sun's the most intense."</p>
        
            <p>She said there had been a big increase in MDH since 2016 and it was important to create affordable housing in the expensive Auckland property market.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a part of Auckland's growth, we're definitely going to see more of it."</p>
        
            <p>MDH made up two thirds of consented homes last year.</p>
        
            <p>Dunshea said insights about how well MDH is working is valuable for developers and architects who build the homes to get it right.</p>
        
            <p>"Having homes that are well functioning and getting them to work right we advocate for.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about us working with others to get the best quality and functionality."</p>
