            <p>Auckland FC have tasted defeat for the first time in their history after suffering a 4-0 shock loss to Western United at Go Media Stadium in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix v Western Sydney Wanderers</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7pm Sunday 22 December</p>
        
            <p>Commbank Stadium, Sydney</p>
        
            <p>Live blog updates on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland-based side had a dream start to their inaugural season and it was only last weekend that their winning run came to an end in round eight with a 2-2 draw with Melbourne City.</p>
        
            <p>But Western United ignored the playbook and scored three goals in the first half. It started with Riku Danzaki scoring off a penalty in the 17th minute.</p>
        
            <p>A few minutes later Noah Botic doubled the visitors lead, and in the 34th minute Hiroshi Ibusuki was able to get on the end of a pass from Tomoki Imai and fired it home low past keeper Alex Paulsen.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC were far more robust in the second half but just couldn't find a way to score.</p>
        
            <p>Matthew Grimaldi then put the icing on top for Western United by finding the net in the 87th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC are still at the top of the A-league standings with 19 points but Adelaide United are just one point adrift and now remain the only unbeaten side in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Liam Gillion told Sky Sport nothing clicked for Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>"We've showed in games previously everyone's sort of got that fight or die mentality ... something wasn't clicking today. We'll come our more firing next week, take it on the chin and then prepare for next week," Gillion said.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Phoenix women celebrated a home win over Sydney FC for the first time in their history thanks to a 2-0 triumph.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington extended their unbeaten streak to four matches at Porirua Park, where the start of the second half was delayed for almost an hour due to a storm.</p>
