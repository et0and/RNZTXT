        <h2>Live: Luxon says 'incompetence' behind Health NZ issues</h2>
        <p>
A poll shows both Luxon and his coalition are losing support. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon is playing down the Tax Payers Union's latest Curia political poll that shows both he and his coalition are losing support.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Luxon said he was focused on Kiwis - not the polls, as Labour's Chris Hipkins overtook him as preferred Prime Minister.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister played down the latest results, saying polls were "bouncing around a lot".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said it was a "tough time for Kiwis" and the government's job was to focus on what New Zealanders want, and "that is all about us fixing the economy".</p>
