            <p>An emergency beacon may have saved a motocross rider's life after he crashed in a forest with no radio or cell phone coverage.</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman for Auckland Rescue said the rider, who was aged in his 60s, suffered multiple injuries during a ride in Woodhill Forest, northwest of the city, on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A rescue helicopter crew was dispatched to the forest by the national Rescue Coordination Centre, which was alerted when the injured man activated his personal locator beacon.</p>
        
            <p>The crash happened in a remote area with no road access, so the crew had to winch him out of the forest on a stretcher, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The rider was flown to Middlemore Hospital in a serious condition.</p>

            <p>"This is a positive outcome and highlights the value of taking a PLB, or personal locator beacon, with you when you're going to inaccessible areas with no mobile coverage," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>PLBs, also called distress beacons, work by transmitting a signal which includes the device's GPS location.</p>
        
            <p>The signal is picked up by satellites and relayed to New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre.</p>
        
            <p>PLBs are similar to the EPIRBs, or emergency position indicating radio beacons, which are used at sea.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, a crew was tasked with rescuing a man in his 70s who had fallen about 20 metres down a cliff while abseiling at Oneroa, on Waiheke Island.</p>
        
            <p>He was also winched on board the helicopter, then flown to Auckland City Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
