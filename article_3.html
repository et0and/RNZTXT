            <p>Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.</p>
        
            <p>The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles (600km) from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.</p>
        
            <p>The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.</p>
        
            <p>He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC has approached Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.</p>
        
            <p>Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.</p>
        
            <p>He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.</p>
        
            <p>The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.</p>
        
            <p>The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 193km from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.</p>
