            <p>Organisational failure saw Environment Canterbury fail to reprimand the chairperson after he clocked almost 700 speeding incidents.</p>
        
            <p>That's what the council are saying after chairperson Peter Scott, who has now stepped down, exceeded the speed limit in a council-provided car 678 times since January, with a top speed of 157kph.</p>
        
            <p>In the fallout, ECan has been left to explain how Scott racked up so many speed limit breaches over nine months without any action taken.</p>
        
            <p>An ECan spokesperson said historically the monitoring reports were screened monthly and shared with managers "should their staff have any speeding recorded".</p>
        
            <p>The issue was that the chairperson "doesn't have a line manager to share the information with".</p>
        
            <p>"It was only when a new senior staff member asked for a report to be run [on September 17] and they reviewed all the data that the chair's data came to light.</p>
        
            <p>"It was immediately acted upon."</p>
        
            <p>ECan chief executive Stefanie Rixecker was notified of the breaches on September 18, with Scott then approached by the media when his speeding revelations emerged on September 19.</p>
        
            <p>An under-pressure Scott then relinquished the council car before also standing down as chairperson, while also resigning as chairperson of the Canterbury regional transport committee.</p>
        
            <p>Scott's speeding issues would have been an embarrassment for he and ECan, which has a fleet of around 170 vehicles that are all tracked.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything over the speed limit will register on the speeding report," the ECan spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>Speeding is categorised as minor, moderate, or excessive depending on the amount over the speed limit and other criteria set out in the motor vehicle and drive policy, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Conversations are had between managers and their staff as and when needed throughout the year."</p>
        
            <p>At the Ashburton District Council, chief executive Hamish Riach said there was a stringent monitoring process of the council fleet, except for the mayor's vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"The mayor opted to have a council vehicle at the start of the term to reduce the cost to the council and eliminate all the administration associated with reimbursements,'' Riach said.</p>
        
            <p>"He agreed to a salary reduction to allow for occasions when this vehicle is also used privately. For this reason, it is not tracked.</p>
        
            <p>"When on council business, elected members can either use their own vehicles and get reimbursed for the distance travelled or use our shared fleet."</p>
        
            <p>The council has a fleet of 50 vehicles, including nine hybrids, but not all are GPS tracked.</p>
        
            <p>The shared fleet vehicles use an electronic management system, called EROAD, which monitors work location and speed, Riach said.</p>
        
            <p>"We monitor reports on driver behaviour across the business on a fortnightly basis and where there is any concern, we speak to the driver.</p>
        
            <p>"If concerning driver behaviour is repetitive, then we use a more formal process and provide relevant training.</p>
