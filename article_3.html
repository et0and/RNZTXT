            <p>Seventy-nine New Zealand Customs jobs are proposed to go at airports and ports around the country.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Public Service Association (PSA), these workers from teams such as boarder operations, intelligence and compliance service delivery.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA said a further 41 roles were proposed to be axed from the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA).</p>
        
            <p>These included workers from teams dealing with child exploitation, money laundering and counter terrorism.</p>
        
            <p>PSA assistant secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said the cuts were irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>"It has taken years for successive governments and our Customs Officers to set up our internationally renowned border management. These cuts will harm New Zealand for years to come."</p>
        
            <p>Fitzsimons said the false promise of 'no cuts to the frontline' had again been exposed with these proposed cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"These are the very people whose job it is to be exposed to some of the most vile and traumatising material imaginable and those who control our long borders as a last line of defence on behalf of us all.</p>
        
            <p>"What could be more frontline?"</p>
        
            <p>A total of 33 Customs staff have accepted voluntary redundancy or early retirement. The service was considering further options to meet the required savings, including reviewing existing vacancies, it said.</p>
        
            <p>DIA has announced a first round of job cuts - with 28 jobs set to go at the National Library and its MƒÅori Strategy and Performance team as part of cost cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, it has confirmed the vast majority of the more than 400 staff working on the previous government's national water reform will be gone by end of the month.</p>
