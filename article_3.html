            <p>The number of homes on the market in January was the highest in a decade, according to a new property report.</p>
        
            <p>In total, 32,412 properties were for sale in January.</p>
        
            <p>That was 5000 more than the 27,261 for sale in January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Realestate.co.nz chief executive Sarah Wood said the numbers had not been this high in January since 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland had the highest January stock with more than 11,465 properties available, which had not been seen since 2012, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In Auckland, we've had a lot of properties come to sale over the last 12 months and it's sitting at a 13-year high in terms of number of properties for sale on our site.</p>
        
            <p>"The days on the market or time to sell has been much slower."</p>
        
            <p>The number of 'secondary homes' up for sale had also increased in popular holiday spots like Coromandel and Pauanui, Wood said.</p>
        
            <p>"Pauanui has 65 homes for sale at the moment. At the peak of the market a few years ago, the number of listings was 10-15."</p>
        
            <p>Asking prices remained stable, with the national average at $868,969, down just 1.3 percent year-on-year, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The market could become more appealing to buyers as interest rates declined.</p>
        
            <p>"There's certainly people looking to buy who are waiting for interest rates to come back down and see how the market changes."</p>
