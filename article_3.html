            <p>Simone Biles has just won her fifth Olympic gold medal as the United States clinched top spot in Paris in the team gymnastics competition, traditionally one of the most watched Olympic sessions.</p>
        
            <p>Biles and her US team led for almost all of the competition, with Italy in second and Brazil just pipping Britain for bronze.</p>
        
            <p>There was no doubt who was the centre of attention. Every move by Biles was cheered by the crowd, her every movement tracked by the cameras.</p>
        
            <p>Biles, certainly the greatest gymnast of the modern era and probably one of the top gymnasts ever, is now tied for Olympic gold medals with Nadia Comaneci, who lit up the 1976 Games as the first gymnast to be awarded a perfect 10 score.</p>
        
            <p>They both have five golds but Biles has the possibility of more with further events to come in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>However, Biles is unlikely to catch the Olympic gymnastic medal records set in the 1950s and 1960s when gymnastics was as much an ideological battle between the Soviet bloc and the West, as it was a sports competition.</p>
        
            <p>But Biles is the most decorated gymnast in World Championship history with 30 medals so far, 23 of them gold. She also has at least five signature moves named after her.</p>
        
            <p>Biles, who now has more Olympic medals than any American gymnast, will next appear in the early hours of Friday morning (NZT) in a formidable all-around final. It will be the first to feature two former champions - Biles and USA team-mate and defending Olympic champion Sunisa Lee.</p>
