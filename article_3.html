            <p>More than 23,000 tags have been removed across Auckland city, thanks to an 'A-class' service provided by a social enterprise.</p>
        
            <p>Specifically, 3070 of these were removed from the Māngere- Ōtāhuhu local board area.</p>
        
            <p>The Beautification Trust has become a key player in South Auckland's efforts to maintain clean and vibrant communities.</p>
        
            <p>The Trust transitioned from an Auckland Council-controlled organisation to a South Auckland-based social enterprise in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday night, Community Programmes Manager Sterling Ruwhiu and Community Coordinator Erin Bowers presented to the Māngere-Ōtāhuhu Local Board, showcasing the Trust's ongoing contributions.</p>
        
            <p>"Our mission is to connect the power of communities to learn, love, and look after the environment. That's our kaupapa."</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight, we're also showing how our work impacts the community in three key areas: communities that take pride and feel safe, a healthier and cleaner environment, and empowered, connected communities," Bowers said.</p>

            <p>The income generated from the Trust's services is reinvested into its community programmes.</p>
        
            <p>Their work over the past financial year includes:</p>
        
            <p>Other significant initiatives include the official opening of the Manurewa Bike Hub, promoting low-carbon travel, and the success of the Manurewa Community Recycling Centre, which has diverted nearly 190,000 kg of waste from landfills in just two years.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had big success with our repair cafes and launched our Food Together pop-up.</p>
        
            <p>"Every Thursday, people can buy a $15 bag of fresh produce, which is 40-50 percent cheaper than supermarket prices. We also have volunteers at our recycling centre, as well as a small group from Spectrum Care contributing back to society," Ruwhiu said.</p>
        
            <p>The Trust hosted four repair cafes last year, successfully repairing 129 items and diverting 496 kg of waste from landfills, offsetting about 3400 kilograms of carbon emissions.</p>
        
            <p>The Trust mobilised 902 volunteer hours and engaged over 6000 children and youth in environmental education programmes like Eye On Nature and Wearable Arts.</p>

            <p>Eighteen Early Childhood Education (ECE) and primary schools participated in Eye On Nature, with 35 artworks submitted and over 200 children engaged. Additionally, 402 students from 19 schools entered 85 garments for Wearable Arts.</p>
        
            <p>Ruwhiu shared a story about two sisters involved in wearable art projects: "One little girl, Siruian, bio-engineered her plastic for her outfit, and her sister grew crystals to include in hers. That's the kind of innovation coming from our young people."</p>
        
            <p>Local board chair Tauanu'u Nick Bakulich commended the Trust's value to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Every dollar is a dollar well spent in terms of the ratepayers' dollar. The responses we're getting, especially around graffiti removal, are A-class done within a very, very short time."</p>
        
            <p>Bakulich also suggested discussing how to increase applications from Māngere- Ōtāhuhu schools for wearable arts if funding is a limiting factor.</p>
        
            <p>Local Board Member Christine O'Brien praised the Trust's impact. "The impact on [graffiti removal] is just amazing," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She shared an example from Saleyards Road in Ōtāhuhu: "There was a guy who was going around between Vector and Auckland Transport, and the place was getting increasingly [messy].</p>
        
            <p>"Within a day of me saying, 'Have you tried the Beautification [Trust]?' it's all gone, and [he was] really the happiest ... on earth. So thank you for that."</p>
        
            <p>Through its innovative programmes and strong partnerships, the Beautification Trust continues to promote sustainability and strengthen communities in South Auckland.</p>
