            <p>Paris is promising a Games to remember as the opening ceremony for the 17th summer Paralymics gets underway.</p>
        
            <p>Around 4400 athletes from more than 160 countries are taking part, including 25 Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>Swimmer Cameron Leslie and athlete Anna Grimaldi have been chosen to be the flagbearers.</p>
        
            <p>International Paralympic Committee president, Andrew Parsons, when asked about the choice of having the opening ceremony outside the stadium said: "To us, it is like Paris is giving a gigantic hug to the Paralympic athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"When you hug someone, you're getting closer to the person and this is accepting the person like he or she is. This is our interpretation of this ceremony. We are being welcomed to Paris, at the very heart of the city."</p>
