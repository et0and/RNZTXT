            <p>The Black Caps have slumped to a 172-run defeat in the first test against Australia at the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Australian spinner Nathan Lyon ripped through the Kiwis' batting lineup, taking 6/65 as New Zealand were dismissed for 196 on day four.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon claimed 10 for the match, making the key breakthrough of Rachin Ravindra for 59 first up this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps skipper Tim Southee told TVNZ it was a disappointing result.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll reflect and look at ways that we can be better in the next one."</p>
        
            <p>He said despite not selecting a specialist spinner, they were happy with the options of Glenn Phillips and Rachin Ravindra.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously we didn't think it was going to turn as much as it did but</p>
        
            <p>having those two guys in the top seven give you that option when it does turn."</p>
        
            <p>He said they will need to quickly park the defeat ahead of the next test on Friday at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>"We move to a different ground, a different surface and a ground we have had a lot of success at."</p>
        
            <p>Pat Cummins said the Kiwis put up a good fight.</p>
        
            <p>"We had out moments, it was a really good game, I never felt we were too far in front on that wicket."</p>
        
            <p>He said they will no be underestimating them ahead of the next test.</p>
        
            <p>"No matter what format it is, they have a heap of match winners and a lot of experience, so we cant take them too lightly."</p>
        
            <p>With the Black Caps chasing an unlikely 369 to win the game, Lyon's three quick strikes for just two runs quashed any serious hope for the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell was next to go for a duck, with Glenn Phillips falling two overs later, as Lyon claimed his third.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Kuggeleijn and Daryl Mitchell offered some resistance with 26 and 38 respectively, before Cameron Green had Kuggeleijn caught behind.</p>
        
            <p>The wickets of Matt Henry, Tim Southee and Mitchell followed soon after. Mitchell was the last man to go, caught and bowled by Josh Hazlewood.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon finished with match figures of 10/108 while Cameron Green was awarded man of the match for his 174 in the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>Green said the pitch was never easy to bat on.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a tough wicket day one and stayed like that for the whole game."</p>
        
            <p>The second test in Christchurch gets underway on Friday.</p>
