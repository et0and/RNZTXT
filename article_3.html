            <p>It was a busy day for lifeguards at beaches all around the country yesterday, with nine swimmers at Auckland's Bethells Beach needing to be treated for blue bottle stings.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving New Zealand Chief Operations Officer Chris Emmett said staff made 22 rescues at the weekend - 18 of them on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It helped with a further 44 assists - all but two of them were on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Pāpāmoa lifeguards in the Bay of Plenty had to assist 20 people back to shore throughout the day as strong currents troubled many swimmers.</p>
        
            <p>In Waihi, two people were plucked from a rip using an inflatable rescue boat.</p>
        
            <p>Warm, sunny weather yesterday saw huge numbers of swimmers flock to the beaches - and causing some headaches for lifeguards.</p>
        
            <p>Omaha Beach saw 1400 people on the beach in the afternoon - the highest in the northern region. Mt Maunganui had the busiest day in Surf Lifesaving's eastern region with 1300 beach users at one point.</p>
        
            <p>Taylors Mistake in Christchurch was the busiest beach in the south.</p>
        
            <p>Beachgoers had been well-behaved, Emmett said.</p>
        
            <p>But lifeguards had been pressed dealing with a large number of swimmers making the most of the sun before heading back to work.</p>
