            <p>Three Indian nationals have been arrested and charged over the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada, which sparked a major diplomatic row between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead last June by masked gunmen in a busy car park in a Vancouver suburb.</p>
        
            <p>The diplomatic row escalated after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged India's government may have been involved.</p>
        
            <p>Delhi strongly denied the allegation.</p>
        
            <p>In announcing the arrests on Friday, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker said the three suspects were Karan Brar, 22, Kamal Preet Singh, 22, and 28-year-old Karan Preet Singh.</p>
        
            <p>He said all three had been living in Edmonton, Alberta where they were arrested. They have been charged with first-degree murder, court records show, as well as conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
        
            <p>All had been in Canada for three to five years, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police added that investigations were continuing, including into "connections to the government of India".</p>
        
            <p>"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters. Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today," Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.</p>
        
            <p>Investigators have been working with counterparts in India but the collaboration has been "rather difficult and rather challenging" for several years, they said</p>
        
            <p>Police said there may be others involved in the killing, and there may be further arrests or charges.</p>
        
            <p>Nijjar was a Sikh separatist leader who publicly campaigned for Khalistan - the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region of India.</p>
        
            <p>In the 1970s, Sikhs launched a separatist insurgency in India which saw thousands killed before it was quelled the following decade. Since then, the movement has been mostly limited to countries with large Sikh populations.</p>
        
            <p>India has in the past described Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters say are unfounded. They say he had received threats in the past because of his activism.</p>
        
            <p>He was shot dead at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, a city about 30km east of Vancouver on 18 June last year.</p>
        
            <p>Those close to him have said he was warned by Canadian intelligence services before his death that he was on a "hit list" and there had been threats on his life.</p>

            <p>Three months after Nijjar was killed, Trudeau, standing in the House of Commons, said Canada was looking at "credible allegations potentially linking" the Indian state to the killing.</p>
        
            <p>The allegation was strongly denied by Indian officials, who accused Canada of providing shelter to "Khalistani terrorists and extremists".</p>
        
            <p>The row between the two countries led Delhi to ask Ottawa to reduce the number of envoys it had in India.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau also faced pressure to provide evidence for his allegation of Delhi's involvement.</p>
