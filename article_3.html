            <p>Community members and public housing advocates say it is unfair for an Auckland business group to single out Kāinga Ora tenants in complaints over crime.</p>
        
            <p>Over the previous two months, the Parnell Business Association said it had traced 40 incidents back to a nearby Kāinga Ora apartment block.</p>
        
            <p>"Antisocial behaviour is regular, shoplifting is regular, but we've also had some quite serious break-ins," general manager Cheryl Adamson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thefts of some valuable items, we've tracked stolen scooters and bikes to that area. It's really a mixed bag."</p>
        
            <p>A worker at a dairy across from the Kāinga Ora block said petty theft was becoming more common.</p>
        
            <p>"Compared to years before I'd say there's definitely been an increase, there's been an increase in break-in attempts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say 99 percent of the people who come here are pretty well-behaved, but there's always that one percent that cause a bit of trouble."</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora said it was not responsible for what tenants did outside of their homes and criminal activity was a matter for the police.</p>
        
            <p>But Adamson said the agency needed to accept some responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen the pushback, and I understand that they're saying it's not their problem what happens offsite," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I think as good citizens, whether you're a school or a corporate you all want to be good citizens to your neighbours and I do believe Kāinga Ora has a responsibility for these facilities."</p>
        
            <p>Residents living in Parnell were not too concerned about the reported uptick in crime.</p>
        
            <p>Shaquille Hape, who lives near the Kāinga Ora facility, said he felt perfectly safe despite some dodgy behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"It's safe as, I feel good as in this area," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a few bad people down there, but I don't actually see them doing crime. I see them smoking drugs and stuff, heaps of people smoking bongs."</p>
        
            <p>Local celebrity and shoeshiner Larry Woods, better known as Mr Sunshine, said Parnell was a good neighbourhood with a few bad eggs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like all neighbourhoods, you've always got a few knuckleheads," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you see a lot of crime, it's because of the people... when you put them in a position where they feel desperate."</p>
        
            <p>He said people in public housing did not deserve to be treated like criminals.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an issue all around the world, they should be more open to people that are lower than them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Public Housing Futures spokesperson Vanessa Cole said it was unfair for the Parnell Business Association to single out residents in public housing.</p>
        
            <p>"There's thousands of people who live in public housing, people are being painted with [the same] brush," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's this idea that public housing itself somehow causes antisocial behaviour, but actually it allows people to live stable, safe and secure lives."</p>
        
            <p>An independent review of Kāinga Ora is set to be led by former prime minister Bill English.</p>
        
            <p>Cheryl Adamson said it should consider full-time on-site management and security.</p>
        
            <p>"I would just like the review to incorporate a view to the on-site management, we're just asking them to broaden the scope," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything they've included so far is critically important, we're just asking for this facet to be included."</p>
        
            <p>Adamson clarified that she did not want the public housing block to be removed, but she hoped it could be managed better in the future.</p>
