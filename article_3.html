            <p>Sky TV has terminated discussions about a potential takeover, after rejecting a bid that fell short of expectations.</p>
        
            <p>Last month the company revealed it received a non-binding expression of interest to be bought by an unnamed third party.</p>
        
            <p>It said the interest was highly preliminary, confidential and incomplete.</p>
        
            <p>But in a share market announcement on Wednesday morning, Sky said it received an updated non-binding offer from the third party yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"[The third party was] proposing a transaction at a value range which falls short of the board's view of the fair intrinsic value of Sky and, based on recent unsolicited feedback, the view of a number of Sky's institutional shareholders," Sky said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The company rejected the offer and ended discussions.</p>
        
            <p>It said that with talks ended, the board would recommence its $15 million share buyback programme on the same terms announced at the end of March.</p>
