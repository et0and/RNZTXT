            <p>A five-year-old child has been critically injured after being struck by a car whose driver may have been distracted by their phone, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The child suffered the injuries while crossing the road in the Auckland suburb of Manurewa on Thursday afternoon, Counties Manukau road policing manager Inspector Tony Wakelin said.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred on Sharland Avenue at around 3.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigations are ongoing into the exact causes of the crash, however, police believe the use of a mobile phone may have been a factor in what occurred," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Charges are currently being considered in this case.</p>
        
            <p>"Talking or texting whilst driving is dangerous."</p>
        
            <p>He reminded people that texts or calls were not as important as a person's life.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, police allege alcohol and speed were significant factors in a crash involving a vehicle clocking speeds well above the speed limit in Tuakau in Waikato on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 4.20pm, police units sighted a vehicle travelling at a significant speed of more than twice the posted speed limit," Inspector Wakelin said.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite police signalling for the vehicle to stop, the vehicle continued to drive in a reckless manner and fled the area."</p>
        
            <p>No pursuit was begun, however, police continued to track the vehicle as it travelled onto Bollard Road.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Wakelin said officers found the vehicle crashed into a residential building.</p>
        
            <p>When the driver was breath-tested he was found to be over the legal limit.</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully there were no injuries reported to anyone, the driver or those in the property, and remarkably the damage to the house appears to be minor.</p>
        
            <p>"In saying that, this once again demonstrates the frightful social harm caused by mixing speed with alcohol."</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old driver was arrested and will be charged with dangerous driving and driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Wakelin said police had zero tolerance for drivers risking their own and others' lives.</p>
        
            <p>"Drinking and driving, speeding, and using cell phones all contribute to someone's loved ones possibly being killed on our roads.</p>
        
            <p>"The message is: Don't think it won't happen to me, as the decisions we are seeing being made by drivers suggest - it might."</p>
