            <p>A South Auckland food bank has been saved from closure after generous donations from the community.</p>
        
            <p>David Letele's Buttabean food bank has struggled this year, with demand massively outstripping funding.</p>
        
            <p>He announced its closure in October, citing impossible conditions. Then to make things worse, in November the foodbank was hit by vandals, who smashed up equipment and turned off freezers - ruining eight tonnes of meat.</p>
        
            <p>But this week Buttabean will deliver hundreds of Christmas hampers and toys to families after donors stepped in to help.</p>
        
            <p>Letele, a community leader and former boxer, told Checkpoint on Monday the donations would allow him to stay open - though it was unclear for how long.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just amazing, you know? The public really rallied around us after you know what happened in November.</p>
        
            <p>"And then, you know, we had [telecommunications entrepreneur] Annette Presley, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and another rich-lister who's anonymous.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just unbelievable, you know? And it's, it's enabled us - today we're delivering 150 parcels to the Waikato Women's Refuge and toys down in Hamilton. So it's over, well over 1000 families are gonna be helped in Auckland, Hamilton, Tokoroa and also Te Kūiti."</p>
        
            <p>The anonymous donor Letele said was reached via social media - but he almost missed out.</p>
        
            <p>"A follower on LinkedIn reached out to me and I actually didn't reply, I was so busy. And then replied about two days later with my number and he rang me up, missed his call and then he texted, 'Look, I've got some great news for you. Can you please get in touch?'"</p>
        
            <p>They donated $100,000, Presley the same amount, and the church $130,000 - which Letele called "next level".</p>
        
            <p>"This is still only a band-aid, we can stay open. But I don't know how long for, but we're going to stay open. So, you know, we're going to talk to them about long-term-plans as well."</p>
        
            <p>Letele said he hoped for more support for the side of the charity that provides education, job opportunities and wraparound support - and also that other charities got the support his had.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy today, then I see your RNZ article about the… City Mission. They're struggling, they're having to cut, I think 30,000 parcels - each parcel represents an individual or family. So where are those people gonna go?</p>
        
            <p>"You know, I've got an organisation texting me today on Instagram and all social networks, 'So how have you done this? We're having to shut, we can't raise $100,000.'"</p>
        
            <p>Letele would not be drawn on the identity of the mystery donor, except to say "everyone would know" their identity.</p>
