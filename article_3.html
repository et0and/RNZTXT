        <h2>Unimpressed penguin found wandering on Wellington Airport runway</h2>
        <p>
Wellington Airport wildlife officer Jack Howarth said the kororā, which had to be rescued, was in a less-than-impressed mood.

            <p>A flightless bird has been caught crossing the runway at Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the airport said the little blue penguin was spotted by an Air Chathams pilot waiting to take off on Friday, 12 January.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport wildlife officer Jack Howarth said the kororā, which had to be rescued, was in a less-than-impressed mood.</p>
        
            <p>"Our runway sensors were reading 50C," making it no wonder the penguin was "not particularly happy".</p>
        
            <p>Howarth said the penguin was rescued by Wellington Airport airside staff Alex McGregor and Kaleb Woodcock.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was the first time a penguin had visited the airport.</p>
        
            <p>"We think he may have wriggled under the fence, so we've done some penguin-proofing to keep our flippered friends out of trouble in future."</p>
        
            <p>He said the space, under the airport's crashgates, was less than 100 millimetres in size.</p>
        
            <p>"He must have been very determined though, because judging by the size of his little puku it must have been quite the squeeze to get under there."</p>
        
            <p>Howarth said they were unsure how long the kororā had been exposed to sun without shelter, and decided to take him to The Nest at Wellington Zoo.</p>

            <p>"They've helped us with recovery of other wildlife in the past. They happily took him in to cool down and monitor for any further issues."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport said Wellington Zoo had since advised them that the penguin was now doing fine, eating normally and hanging out in one of the dens at the animal hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Zoo said the little blue penguin was around six weeks old when found, and only recently fledged.</p>
        
            <p>"Though thin, hungry and a little underweight, the fledgling was otherwise in good health," the zoo said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The zoo said kororā were known to live in natural nests at nearby Lyall Bay, and there was a high chance the fledgling simply got lost on their way home.</p>
        
            <p>"During their stay at Te Kōhanga the Kororā underwent X-rays and blood work by our vet team to make sure they were indeed in good health. They also went on a weight gain diet that included lots of fish."</p>
        
            <p>The zoo said the fledgling's adult feathers came in while at Te Kohanga, and the penguin was well on the road to recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"The veterinary team at Te Kōhanga is waiting for the kororā's feathers to be waterproofed before releasing them back into the wild. The waterproofing of seabirds' feathers is a crucial step in their growth, as waterproof feathers ensure seabirds stay warm and dry when they're swimming for food."</p>
        
            <p>The zoo said the penguin should be strong and old enough to be released into the wild in a couple of weeks.</p>
