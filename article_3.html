            <p>A New Zealand woman has died on Australia's Gold Coast following a suspected overdose during celebrations for her 40th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Danielle Whittaker, who is originally from Wellington, died on Good Friday while partying with friends in an apartment, Queensland police said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to The Esplanade unit about 11pm after she was found dead, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Whittaker had lived in Australia for several years, her friend Kaz Jackson said, and she was loved and missed by many.</p>
        
            <p>Her family did not want to make any comment at this stage, Jackson said, as they "needed space to grieve".</p>
        
            <p>Friends took to social media and said Whittaker had been an "inspiration" who helped empower "so many people" in her life.</p>
        
            <p>Her death was not being treated as suspicious, a spokesperson for Queensland police said, and they would prepare a report for the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>According to Nine News, two other woman were found "not breathing" at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A woman, 43, was taken to Gold Coast University Hospital in a critical condition where she was now stable, while another 43-year-old woman had been released from hospital.</p>
