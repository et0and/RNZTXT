            <p>Southern councils have revealed their annual leave allowances, with the results showing some staff are getting more than what is standard.</p>
        
            <p>Under current legislation, the minimum entitlement for annual leave in New Zealand is four weeks per year.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, it was noted during an Invercargill City Council meeting that the chief executive had approved an increase in annual leave allowances for staff.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions, chief executive Michael Day confirmed an increase had been approved for the standard four weeks to increase to five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>But there was a caveat - staff needed to have been continuously employed for four years.</p>
        
            <p>Day said the cost to council was an increased "annual leave liability" which would be a maximum of $75,000 for the 2023/24 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>He also noted the five-week increase had previously been available to staff once they reached their six-year anniversary.</p>
        
            <p>The change was made last year as part of a wellbeing initiative.</p>
        
            <p>At Southland District Council, annual leave entitlements were negotiated as part of individual employment agreements.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson said a number of staff had negotiated leave which exceeded the minimum allowance.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Southland was still utilising a 30-year-old system which saw staff accrue an extra day of leave for the first five years they were employed.</p>
        
            <p>Once they reached a maximum allowance of five weeks total leave, the additional days stopped accumulating.</p>
        
            <p>Gore District Council had not reviewed its entitlements recently, but staff could access their leave before the 12-month entitlement period was up, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>At that council, staff generally received four weeks of leave except in cases where they had negotiated a different arrangement.</p>
