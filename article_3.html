            <p>Parliament has passed the legislation repealing Fair Pay Agreements through its third reading, under urgency.</p>
        
            <p>The previous Labour government passed the law to enable the agreements - which aimed to allow unions and employer associations to bargain for bottom-line terms and conditions, covering entire sectors - in March last year.</p>
        
            <p>It took effect in December last year but no agreements have yet taken effect.</p>
        
            <p>A bill repealing that has now passed its third reading in Parliament - with support from National, ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Labour, the Greens and Te Pāti Māori opposed the repeal.</p>
        
            <p>The incoming government campaigned on abolishing the law, committing to do so before Christmas in the coalition agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses had long opposed the legislation, saying it would impose extra conditions on them, increasing costs.</p>
        
            <p>The move was fiercely criticised by the left bloc, which argued it takes workers deemed 'essential' in the pandemic backwards.</p>
        
            <p>Workplace Relations Minister Brooke van Velden said today's repeal had been a long time coming.</p>
        
            <p>"Fair pay agreements were never about fairness, they forced a minority of union worker's views on all affected workers and businesses and this government opposes the views that were put forward by the previous government and that law."</p>
        
            <p>.</p>
        
            <p>The House is still in urgency as the government moves on to repealing the clean car discount.</p>
