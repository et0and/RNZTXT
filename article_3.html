            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Ash Matthews said police were in the early stages of working out what happened, but it seemed those involved knew each other</p>

            <p>"I've heard some real serious concerns from the community about safety in the area, I've heard our community saying that they have some real issues with provision of community facilities in the area, and that some want to see strong enforcement."</p>
        
            <p>Some wanted to see a see a long-term community response to crime, Bartley said.</p>

            <p>"Especially to give our community a sense of safety, having that police presence there."</p>
        
            <p>Bartley raised concerns around the number of recent gun crimes in Auckland.</p>
