            <p>An advertising boycott of social media platform X is gathering pace amid an anti-Semitism storm on the site formerly known as Twitter.</p>
        
            <p>Apple, Disney, Comcast and Warner Brothers Discovery have all halted advertising on X, US media report, following hot on the heels of IBM.</p>
        
            <p>The European Commission, TV network Paramount and movie studio Lionsgate have also pulled ad dollars from X.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after X owner Elon Musk amplified an anti-Semitic trope.</p>
        
            <p>The corporate boycott has also been picking up steam in the wake of an investigation by a US group which flagged ads appearing next to pro-Nazi posts on X.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for X told the BBC that the company does not intentionally place brands "next to this kind of content" and the platform is dedicated to combating anti-Semitism.</p>
        
            <p>Musk came under fire on Wednesday local time after he replied to a post sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, calling it "actual truth".</p>
        
            <p>The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur denied he is anti-Semitic and later said his comments referred not to all Jewish people but to groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other unspecified "Jewish communities".</p>
        
            <p>The White House denounced Musk's endorsement of the post.</p>
        
            <p>"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of anti-Semitic and racist hate in the strongest terms," said spokesperson Andrew Bates.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday evening local time, the ADL - one of the most vocal critics of how X moderates incendiary content - offered rare praise for Musk's steps to fight hate on the platform.</p>
        
            <p>Musk had posted on X that anyone using terms such as "from the river to the sea" - which the ADL has described as a coded call for Israel's destruction - could be suspended from the platform.</p>
        
            <p>ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt replied that this was "an important and welcome move".</p>
        
            <p>X chief executive Linda Yaccarino posted on Friday evening local time that the platform had been "extremely clear about our efforts to combat anti-Semitism and discrimination. There's absolutely no place for it anywhere in the world".</p>
        
            <p>X has been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There's absolutely no place for it anywhere in the world. https://t.co/a3gGZrLm2p</p>
        
            <p>The ad boycott follows an investigation by left-leaning pressure group Media Matters for America, which said it found ads bought by the companies next to posts including Hitler quotes, praise of Nazis and Holocaust denial.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, IBM became the first company to pull its advertising from the site, saying the juxtaposition of its ads with Nazi content was "completely unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>X argues it has stronger brand safety controls than other social networks and that hate speech and extremism have fallen on the platform despite large cuts to the company's safety team.</p>
        
            <p>Several outside groups disagree with that assessment and say that such content has increased under Musk's leadership.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear how much of X's revenue currently comes from ads, because it's now a private company and no longer publishes quarterly reports.</p>
        
            <p>But before Musk took over the firm, advertising made up about 90 percent of Twitter revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Musk has attempted to change its reliance on ad dollars by trying to create a paid-membership tier.</p>
        
            <p>If you pay a monthly fee, you can have a blue tick by your name and your content will be boosted. Yet that still makes up a tiny fraction of revenue.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with the BBC in April, Musk said "almost all of them [advertisers] have either come back or they're going to come back".</p>
        
            <p>Three months later he acknowledged in a post on X that ad revenue had fallen by 50 percent.</p>
        
            <p>His appointment of Yaccarino, a former ad executive, was widely seen as an attempt to smooth relations with advertisers.</p>
        
            <p>But building those kinds of relationships is difficult when the company's owner himself is the one making the controversial posts.</p>
        
            <p>It is also hard to square advertisers' fears that the platform does not moderate content enough, with Musk's commitment to free speech.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC interviewed Twitter investor Ross Gerber last month and he said advertisers were worried about Nazi content not being removed.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not want my ads anywhere near Nazis and I would say that 99 percent of brands would agree with that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To lose advertisers over Nazi voices is the dumbest policy you could imagine."</p>
        
            <p>Although Musk is the world's richest man, he borrowed billions to buy Twitter and has to pay interest on those loans.</p>
        
            <p>Unless he is able to staunch the flow of ad dollars from the platform, it could become an increasing financial burden.</p>
