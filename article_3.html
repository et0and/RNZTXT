            <p>A woman who lives next to a large vegetation blaze in Horowhenua says she was worried her home, or properties nearby, would go up in flames.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze is under control and firefighters are in the final stages of extinguishing it.</p>
        
            <p>Caroline Beaufort-Puna lives next to the property where the blaze broke out, and said the windy day worsened its impact.</p>
        
            <p>"I was pretty terrified, actually. Mainly because we have ... huge poplar trees, and they're quite flammable.</p>
        
            <p>"And I thought, 'Gosh, you only need to get the wind come westward towards us and a few sparks in our trees, and that would go up and our house would probably go up'."</p>
        
            <p>Although the blaze was under control, Beaufort-Puna said she would still struggle to sleep tonight with several smaller fires still alight.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency was alerted to the fire on Waikawa Beach Road about 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>At its peak, the fire was burning over an area of 800 by 500 metres and nine crews from ÅŒtaki, Levin, Te Horo and Wellington were in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Two helicopters with monsoon buckets have been stood down for the night.</p>
        
            <p>The nine crews were expected to continue work overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Local business owner Kelly Henry said the property where the fire started contained forestry slash, dead gorse and cars.</p>
        
            <p>Horowhenua currently has no restrictions on open fires.</p>
