            <p>Marty Sheargold and Triple M have "mutually agreed to part ways", after the radio host made offensive comments about the Matildas on air.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday Sheargold said he "would rather hammer a nail through the head of [his] penis" than watch the Matildas play in next year's Asian Cup, while discussing the national women's football team.</p>
        
            <p>Among other things, Sheargold said the team reminded him of Year 10 girls.</p>
        
            <p>"All the infighting and all the friendship issues, 'The coach hates me and I hate bloody training and Michelle's being a bitch.'</p>
        
            <p>"Now, I'm sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that's what I think of it so you can stick it up your arse."</p>
        
            <p>
Marty Sheargold's comments about the Matildas sparked widespread outrage.

            <p>Sheargold and Triple M were forced to apologise on Tuesday, with the host saying "any comedy including mine can miss the mark sometimes, and I can see why people may have taken offence at my comments".</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon, Sheargold's show did not go to air, with the station instead playing music and advertisements.</p>
        
            <p>Triple M has since released a joint statement saying its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience, and it was a moment for reflection and review.</p>
        
            <p>He said the network would take all necessary steps to support staff, and that a new Drive show would be announced in due course.</p>
        
            <p>"Triple M acknowledges Marty's contribution over the past four years, and we wish him well for the future."</p>
        
            <p>In the statement, Sheargold said: "I fully understand the gravity of my comments.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation."</p>
        
            <p>He also thanked his immediate team for their hard work and apologised for the situation they now found themselves in.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Matildas interim coach Tom Sermanni described Sheargold's on-air comments as "out of order and very unnecessary".</p>
        
            <p>Athletes including former Hockeyroo Rosie Malone and Olympian Libby Trickett also expressed their outrage.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, federal Sports Minister Anika Wells called the comments "boorish, boring, wrong" while Beau Busch, head of Professional Footballers Australia, said it was "important such ignorance does not go unchecked".</p>
