            <p>A hero who chased the Christchurch terrorist away from one of the mosques has appeared in court on a charge of assault.</p>
        
            <p>Abdul Aziz Wahazadah, 50, who chased the gunman from the Linwood Islamic Centre during the 2019 Christchurch terror attacks, denies the assault charge and has elected a judge alone trial.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, Aziz's bravery was recognised at a special ceremony where he was hailed a hero.</p>
        
            <p>Aziz picked up a discarded rifle and shouted provocations at the gunman to divert his attention, with the intention of preventing further loss of life at the Linwood Islamic Centre.</p>
        
            <p>He chased the terrorist to his car and threw the rifle at the back window, smashing it, before the gunman drove off with Aziz chasing after him down Linwood Ave.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Aziz's brave actions deterred the gunman from re-entering this mosque to kill and maim others and ultimately forced the gunman to flee the mosque," the citation said.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday Aziz appeared at the Christchurch District Court where he represented himself on one charge of assault with intent to injure on 8 March. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded on bail and will next appear in court in July.</p>
