            <p>Warriors v Storm</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7.30pm, Saturday 15 June</p>
        
            <p>Go Media Stadium Mt Smart, Auckland</p>

            <p>It's been 3264 days since the Warriors last tasted victory over the Melbourne Storm. The Cowboys and Sharks hadn't won their maiden premierships yet and Nathan Cleary was captain of the Penrith U18s team.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors come into this game on an absolute high after stringing three wins in a row over some quality opponents, whilst the Storm are under strength missing multiple key players in Cameron Munster, Ryan Papenhuyzen and Reimis Smith.</p>
        
            <p>On top of that, the Warriors are welcoming back a rested and recovered Shaun Johnson, but they'll do well to remember the three things that are guaranteed: Death, taxes and a late Storm comeback.</p>

            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Warriors: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Rocco Berry 4. Adam Pompey 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Te Maire Martin 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Jackson Ford 11. Marata Niukore 12. Mitchell Barnett 13. Tohu Harris (C)</p>
        
            <p>Interchange: 14. Chanel Harris-Tavita 15. Dylan Walker 16. Jazz Tevaga 17. Kurt Capewell</p>
        
            <p>Storm: 1. Sualauvi Faalogo 2. Grant Anderson 3. Dean Ieremia 4. Nick Meaney 5. Xavier Coates 6. Tyran Wishart 7. Jahrome Hughes 8. Tui Kamikamica 9. Harry Grant 10. Josh King 11. Shawn Blore 12. Eilesa Katoa 13. Trent Loiero</p>

            <p>The question on everyone's lips is how Shaun Johnson was going to slot back into the team after doing so well without him, and how could it be done without disrupting the chemistry they have.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Webster insists the team will only get better with Johnson in the line-up, so Te Maire Martin moving to stand off and Chanel Harris-Tavita back to the bench are the only changes.</p>

            <p>With centre Reimis Smith out due to concussion protocol he's replaced by Dean Ieremia in what is a relatively inexperienced Melbourne back line.</p>
        
            <p>Eliesa Katoa returns to Auckland for the first time in two years, this time lining up against his former club.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 26 - 30 Storm (round two)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 28 - 14 Storm (2015)</p>
        
            <p>These two clubs have had their share of historic games - whether it's the 2011 preliminary final where we saw a young Shaun Johnson putting Lewis Brown over in the corner to make the club's second ever grand final, or a Nathan Friend backflip offload the last time the Warriors tasted victory over the Storm in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>We also have to include the record-breaking 70 - 10 Anzac Day hiding the Storm inflicted on the Warriors in 2022 as well as the 79th-minute Xavier Coates buzzer beater back in round two.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors know better than anyone that whenever you face the Melbourne Storm, everything goes out the window, but they are on a comeback path not many saw coming a month ago.</p>
        
            <p>On paper, they field a team that's actually more than capable of beating a weakened Storm side, Then again, Craig Bellamy is capable of pulling any random person off the street and forming a premiership-winning NRL side at this point.</p>
        
            <p>This game will be a mental battle as much as it is physical in what is tipped to be a close, low-scoring affair.</p>
