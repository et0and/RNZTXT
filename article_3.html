            <p>Santa's Wellington grotto looks a little different this year; it is on the Mars space station.</p>
        
            <p>That is the case for Wellington’s Jackson Street Programme at least, which is in its eighth year of providing creative alternatives to Santa’s usual dwelling.</p>
        
            <p>This year the charitable trust is helping to raise money for Women's Refuge.</p>
        
            <p>Santa’s little helper, Karen Arraj-Fisher, welcomed Morning Report producer Ellie Franco on to the extraterrestrial wonderland in a rocket trip to Mars.</p>
        
            <p>On landing, Santa was greeting 8-year-old Loretta with a northern English twang.</p>
        
            <p>He asked what she thought Christmas was all about.</p>
        
            <p>“It brings lots of joy and love and it brings families together,” Loretta told him.</p>
        
            <p>Santa said some children are just too excited to sleep on Christmas Eve.</p>
        
            <p>He let Loretta in on a little secret - how he makes it in and out of the house without being spotted.</p>
        
            <p>“When I go into their house I just sprinkle some stardust … and then everyone falls asleep,” he said.</p>
        
            <p>Back on Earth, Viviana Diaz is the head recruiter at Scene to Believe - a business which trains and recruits professional Santas across Australia and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She said having a real beard will earn Santa a premium.</p>
        
            <p>“We do have a higher rate for the real bearded Santa for the reason that having a beard really costs money and effort, so to maintain that beard for a whole year is admirable.”</p>
        
            <p>Diaz said Santa school involves a four-hour crash course under the guidance of a professional Santa.</p>
        
            <p>“It goes from how to stand up, how to perform the ‘ho-ho-ho’s’, wearing the suit ... how to maintain their wellbeing.”</p>
        
            <p>She said the organisation’s training goes into great detail around interacting with children.</p>
        
            <p>“How to respond to tricky questions kids can ask but also working with different personalities and needs.”</p>
        
            <p>Wayne Newby retired from working in nurseries to be a professional Santa and is currently based in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>He took part in Scene to Believe's training this year, where he learnt the value of sign language.</p>
        
            <p>“We do have children that are deaf or partly deaf, and they come and they greet you with sign language,” Newby said.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s nice to be able to reply to them with a little bit of sign language like ‘hello’, ‘welcome’, ‘Merry Christmas’ and ‘I’m Santa’.”</p>
        
            <p>Newby noted a particularly pleasant interaction with a boy who had intellectual disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>“He saw me as Santa and then I gave him the pleasure of hand gestures and looking into his eyes and being that man that he was expecting,” Newby said.</p>
        
            <p>But as with all jobs, some days were easier than others.</p>
        
            <p>To stay jolly, this Santa said he tries to keep a smile on his face and make the experience one to remember.</p>
        
            <p>“I had six or seven teenage boys in the other day and thought well I’ll stand up instead of just sitting down.</p>
        
            <p>“They came in and they were talking about what they were going to do to Santa and I put two of them in a headlock.</p>
        
            <p>“From that point on they had a bit of respect for me, a lot of fun and laughter, and they went away just buzzing.”</p>
