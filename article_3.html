            <p>The battle of the Bombays is always a bruising blockbuster.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ looks back on 10 memorable moments between the two sides contesting the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific final.</p>
        
            <p>Who else? Richard Loe was not exactly subtle about unleashing his right hook flush on the chin of Richard Fromont. However, it seems everyone but the man just three feet away saw who threw it, referee Paddy O'Brien not even awarding a penalty for the coldcock.</p>
        
            <p>With the scores locked up at 20-all, the late Tongan powerhouse produced this stunner at the horn to break Blues' hearts.</p>
        
            <p>In a high-scoring thriller at Albany, Asaeli Tikoirotuma's four meat pies ultimately proved the difference, his third being one of the tries of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Out of the 27 clashes between the two sides, only once could they not be separated on the scoreboard.</p>
        
            <p>Not so much a brain fart but more a bout of brain diarrhoea from the Blues lock.</p>
        
            <p>This time Paddy O'Brien did see it, and Flavell was sent off and suspended for three months.</p>
        
            <p>While the kit they were sporting was criminally ugly, this try was a thing of absolute beauty from Dougie Howlett.</p>
        
            <p>The late Sean Wainui with a nonchalant flick of the foot produces this amazing try.</p>
        
            <p>How did the Chiefs not score here?</p>
        
            <p>Desperate defence from the Blues and the match defining play coming from Josh Goodhue at the death as his side survives the onslaught.</p>
        
            <p>Rene Ranger in full flight, thrilling for spectators, terrifying for defenders.</p>
        
            <p>Steven Luatua's clothesline on Tim Nanai-Williams effectively ended the contest at half-time as the Blues' loosie was sent to the sideline for the nasty hit.</p>
