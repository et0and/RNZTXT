        <h2>Darleen Tana says Greens broke own constitution</h2>
        <p>
Lawyers for the former Green Party MP are making their case that she was ejected from the party unlawfully.
</p>
        
            <p>Former Green Party MP Darleen Tana's lawyer says the party's co-leaders acted unlawfully when they "ejected" her from the party.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing for a judicial review of Chl√∂e Swarbrick, Marama Davidson and the Greens is underway at the Auckland High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Tana resigned from the Green Party in March after an inquiry into migrant exploitation, but wants to remain in Parliament as an independent MP.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation found that Tana "likely" knew about allegations of worker exploitation at her husband's business and did not disclose them to the party.</p>
        
            <p>Tana's lawyer Sharyn Green argued the Green Party, as an incorporated society, had not followed its own constitution and charter when it asked Tana to resign.</p>

            <p>Green raised two points of contention: first, whether Tana had resigned of her own volition, and what she was being asked to resign from - the Green Party or from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Tana's lawyer said her client was "ejected" in that she was pushed to resign. She argued it was not in the Green Party's constitution for members to be tested by their spouses or children's actions, and to use that as a measure of conduct would be an extension of the existing constitution.</p>
        
            <p>Green argued "[Tana's] decision to resign was pushed on her; there was no other option for her", and claimed Tana's resignation letter was itself part of an unlawful process.</p>
        
            <p>She also told the court the Green Party's charter and constitution had provisions for tikanga to be observed, but Tana felt tikanga had been breached in that she had not been respected in the process.</p>

            <p>"She got the distinct impression that the first respondents were more keen to look good in front of the media, and to support migrant workers, even if it meant the migrant workers were falsely alleging something."</p>
        
            <p>Green said Tana's photo was removed from the Greens' caucus website when she was temporarily stood down, and she was not invited to James Shaw's valedictory speech - which she felt was "hugely insulting".</p>
        
            <p>Tana felt the process had been outside her control and she was "silenced" and refused natural justice.</p>
        
            <p>Green said Tana felt that between Marama Davidson's call to her on 14 March - which she interpreted as asking her to resign from the Green Party - and subsequent meetings, the co-leaders were doubting her word and were not coming to the allegations with an open mind, and did not provide her with a written complaint by any Green Party members on what conduct of hers was bringing the party into disrepute.</p>
        
            <p>The lawyer argued between 14 March and 5 July, the party and its co-leaders did not tell Tana explicitly she was being held responsible for the conduct of her husband - despite the fact this was being explicitly stated in these court proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>"She's (Tana) been at sea for a lot of the time as to know what it is that's alleged against her, and she also doesn't want to see this process engaged in against anyone else," Green said, referring to Tana's affidavit.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing continues.</p>
