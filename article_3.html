            <p>A New Zealand chef has been awarded a Michelin star for his restaurant in France.</p>
        
            <p>Nick Honeyman told Morning Report he was shell-shocked over the award, which had been a dream since he was a young chef.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a manifestation of 20 years coming to fruition, which is pretty crazy."</p>
        
            <p>He said ending up at Le Petit Léon in southern France was a "complete accident", having initially been sent there from Paris for a cultural experience 15 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Five years ago, Honeyman and wife Sina bought the restaurant "as an excuse to get to Europe in summer".</p>
        
            <p>He didn't fully understand the magnitude of receiving a Michelin star until this week, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just completely inundated with messages and emails and bookings."</p>
        
            <p>Honeyman said the process for awarding the stars is a mystery and they were invited to the award ceremony without knowing if they would receive one.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a nervours wreck until they read your name out and [then] I was trying to fight tears."</p>
        
            <p>Nick and Sina also co-own fine dining restaurant Paris Butter on Jervois Road in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been so overwhelmed with support over the last few days, we could not have done any of this without you all," he said in his Instagram post.</p>
        
            <p>"As we built this business this [star] was never our main objective but it was definitely on our goals list."</p>
        
            <p>He credited Sina with overseeing the front of house and allowing the kitchen team to "flourish".</p>
        
            <p>"This star belongs to our team, past and present and we could never have done this without Sina."</p>
        
            <p>He also thanked the suppliers, customers and the Paris Butter team in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"They allowed me to have full focus when we were in France and countless supportive phone calls and inspiration."</p>
        
            <p>Le Petit Léon is a seasonal restaurant in Le Bourg, Saint-Léon-sur-Vézère and is open from May through to September.</p>
