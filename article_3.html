            <p>France's president says he's dissolving parliament and is calling for new elections, following the performance of the far-right National Rally in the European elections.</p>
        
            <p>Exit polls show a historic win for Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, which is on course to trounce Emmanuel Macron's party.</p>
        
            <p>Macron has called for parliamentary elections to to be held on 30 June and 7 July.</p>
        
            <p>Far-right parties have also made substantial gains in Austria and Germany, exit polls say.</p>
        
            <p>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen welcomed President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap election.</p>
        
            <p>"This historic vote shows that when people vote, people win," she told a cheering crowd of supporters at a rally in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ready to take over power if the French give us their trust in the upcoming national elections," she added.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ready to exercise power, to end mass migration, to prioritise purchasing power, ready to make France live again," she said.</p>

            <p>Analysis - Calling a snap election is a huge surprise for the country, and a huge risk for President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
        
            <p>He could have reacted differently. He could have just kept going, explaining the hard-right's massive victory as a European aberration which would be corrected at more important elections.</p>
        
            <p>He could have trusted to the impending Euro football championship and above all the Paris Olympics to keep people's minds off politics for a couple of months.</p>
        
            <p>That was certainly how the Paris commentariat thought he would take his party's rout.</p>
        
            <p>But one can only assume the president had seen this coming, and planned his response in advance. Certainly, the result was an almost exact replica of the polls, so he would have had plenty of time to consider his options.</p>
        
            <p>The fact is that he is stuck. He has no majority in the National Assembly, so getting any bill through is already a struggle. With most of the country now so clearly against him, any new legislation - for example the upcoming budget - could have proved explosive.</p>
        
            <p>So he has plumped for "clarity". If the hard-right has the votes, then - he says - they should be given the chance to govern.</p>
        
            <p>Obviously the president will hope his own Renaissance party can mount a fight back at the elections on 30 June and 7 July. Or that other parties will do well better too. But he must appreciate that the odds favour another victory for the Rassemblement National - maybe not one so sweeping as today's, but enough for it to become the biggest party in parliament.</p>
        
            <p>At which point we might well have a Prime Minister Le Pen. Or Bardella.</p>
