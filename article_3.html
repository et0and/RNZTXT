        <h2>Move over Santa: Have you heard about the Christmas crow?</h2>
        <p>
"We don't have Santa here, he hasn't visited for about 50 years": Why the Wangkarnal crow brings presents every Christmas in one remote part of Australia.

            <p>It's a hot night before Christmas and an eerie figure is perched on a hilltop, gazing over Gija country, in Western Australia's Kimberley.</p>
        
            <p>He is tall, feathered and mysterious - and makes a loud screeching noise as the sun begins to set.</p>
        
            <p>Soon, he'll be bringing presents to local children, but he ain't no Santa Claus.</p>
        
            <p>He is Wangkarnal - the strangest and spookiest Christmas tradition you've never heard of - and he's about to make his annual appearance in the small bush community of Warmun.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have Santa here, he hasn't visited for about 50 years," explains teaching assistant Spencer Morgan.</p>
        
            <p>"Wangkarnal is the Gija word for crow, and every year he visits with presents for the kids.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's excited that he'll be rocking up tonight - excited and a little bit scared!"</p>
        
            <p>Wangkarnal is a uniquely Australian Christmas tradition that plays out each year in this part of northern Western Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Warmun community chairperson Vanessa Thomas says the crow character comes from the creation stories of Gija people.</p>

            <p>"It's a special thing to celebrate the story from our Ngarrangkarni, or Dreamtime," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"The old people taught us about the crow and the eagle, who lived up on the hill, but the crow was really lazy and never went hunting.</p>
        
            <p>"So they had a fight and the eagle struck the crow with hot coals, and that's how Wangkarnal got the white marks around his eyes.</p>
        
            <p>"Nowadays, we have a football team called the Eagles, and we have the crow come at Christmas time to give presents to the kids."</p>

            <p>It's thought Wangkarnal became entwined with Christian Christmas traditions in the 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>It was a formative time for the Gija families, who - after about 100 years of colonial dispossession - decided to establish their own community where language and customs could be maintained.</p>
        
            <p>They asked the Catholic Church to help them start a school where children could be taught both cultural values and the mainstream curriculum.</p>
        
            <p>Elder Eileen Bray says the result is a special blend of Gija and Christian culture in both classrooms and daily life.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're doing a good job of keeping our language and culture strong, but trying to make sure young people can find a job as well," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not easy, but my Jangalu [uncle] told me, 'you have to keep the language going, teach the kids, keep it strong', so we do our best."</p>

            <p>When the ABC arrives to witness the arrival of Wangkarnal, there's electricity in the air. A tropical storm crackles overhead as excited children gather for the school Christmas concert.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel gooloo gooloo [happy] that he's coming to visit," Tennielle Patrick says.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes the kids run away because Wangkarnal can be a bit scary."</p>

            <p>After class awards, the ominous beat of clapping sticks begins, and the handful of remaining elders sing to summon the big black bird.</p>
        
            <p>A white troopie - the troop carrier four-wheel-drive favoured in these parts - tears across the oval and the kids begin to scream.</p>
        
            <p>Spencer Morgan throws open the passenger doors, and two large screeching crows burst out and lunge towards the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The crows dart and weave among the families, emitting strange bird noises, and scooping up presents to be delivered to each child.</p>
        
            <p>After the excitement, as dinner is packed away and prams are being pushed home, Spencer reflects on the spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>He grew up watching Wangkarnal as a child and, after several years away at boarding school, has returned to Warmun to be a teaching assistant.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a local boy, so it makes me very happy to be helping out with the younger ones now," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it's pretty unusual what we have here, the way we mix [cultural influences] together in our stories and our art and the school."</p>

            <p>For now, Wangkarnal has folded away his wings and disappeared into the night.</p>
        
            <p>But locals know he will be back next Christmas; a ritual held tight, even as everything else in the world is changing.</p>
