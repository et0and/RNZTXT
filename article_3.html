            <p>A visiting Brit who scammed Kiwis out of hundreds of thousands of dollars will not be leaving the country anytime soon.</p>
        
            <p>Jack Dylan Hennessy faces three years and three months behind bars over his involvement in a fake police scam which emerged earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>The scam involved people being cold called by people posing as police officers under the guise of asking them to assist a "covert police operation".</p>
        
            <p>Victims were conned into withdrawing thousands in cash to be collected in-person by a fake officer.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-six-year-old Hennessy took $337,700 in cash from Aucklanders.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Bolton, from Auckland City's Financial Crime Unit, said investigators worked quickly to track down the man who had been appearing at victims' front doors.</p>
        
            <p>"A short visit to rip off New Zealanders has turned into a three-year prison sentence," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Right from the start our investigators were determined to make people aware and put a stop to this offending."</p>
        
            <p>Police acknowledge the sentence handed down in Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>"It sends a message to the offshore organised criminal groups running these operations that we are not a soft target," Detective Senior Sergeant Bolton said.</p>
        
            <p>In August Hennessy pleaded guilty to 27 charges, including 25 counts of obtains by deception.</p>
        
            <p>"A prison sentence is a clear warning to those who may be recruited to be cash couriers by these criminal groups - we'll catch up with you."</p>

            <p>Two other men were also facing court proceedings for their alleged roles in the re-emergence of the scam in other parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Another UK national remained before the Wellington District Court after his arrest in August.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a 24-year-old Auckland man was still before the Waitākere District Court on a fraud charge. In August, real police officers from Waitematā District lay in wait for the man after he allegedly came to collect cash from another victim of the scam.</p>
        
            <p>"Confidence scams such as this one impact their victims, who are often vulnerable members of our community," Bolton said. "This has had a devastating financial loss for these victims."</p>
