            <p>The tangi of Head Hunters gang leader William "Bird" Hines started around 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Police are keeping the crowd contained. Both patched gang members and members of the public are evident at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter in Foxton said the main highway was briefly blocked as Hines' coffin was transported along the road.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, smoke from a bike burnout could be seen billowing through the crowds and many appeared to be filming the procession as it went past.</p>
