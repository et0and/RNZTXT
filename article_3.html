        <h2>Hidden cost of disability: Call for hearing aid batteries to be made free</h2>
        <p>
A deaf person would have to pay $25,000 over their lifetime for hearing aid batteries, says a student calling for them to be made free.

            <p>A 16-year-old Auckland student is campaigning for hearing aid batteries to be made free for deaf New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>Felix Shaw has relied on hearing aids since birth.</p>
        
            <p>"I was born deaf with a rare condition called cat eye syndrome," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The condition can cause a range of complications from skeletal problems to, in Shaw's case, deafness.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Bay High School student delivered a speech to his teacher after discovering he would have to pay for his own batteries when he turned 18.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually going to have to start paying $7.50 a week for batteries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I go through a pack-and-a-half of batteries a week."</p>
        
            <p>That adds up to $390 a year, or almost $25,000 between the ages of 18 and the average life expectancy of 82 years.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Disabled People said young people up to the age of 21 were entitled to free batteries but only if they were in full-time education.</p>
        
            <p>"My teacher came up to me about a week after my speech and said 'is that seriously the amount of money you have to pay? That's just not fair whatsoever,' so that's how this whole campaign started."</p>
        
            <p>Shaw has been working on a petition since July 2023, which had so far gained 2000 signatures.</p>
        
            <p>"The best outcome would be that the government funds all hearing aid batteries for every person in New Zealand born deaf," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The dream would be to present [the petition] to Parliament, but I just want people in New Zealand to be aware of this issue and that people with disabilities actually have hidden costs ... and over time it adds up to quite a lot of money."</p>
        
            <p>Once the petition had enough signatures, Shaw planned to deliver it to an MP to be taken to Parliament on his behalf.</p>
