            <p>The prime minister may think a decision made by Wellington councils is "lame-o", but Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau says those comments are poor form and the councils are sticking to their timeline to get it right.</p>
        
            <p>Councils were asked to work alongside others in their respective regions to form and submit proposals for regional deals by 28 February.</p>
        
            <p>The government said at the time it would not be putting money on the table as part of the deals, which would instead increase access to funding and financing tools.</p>
        
            <p>A letter sent to Minister of Local Government Simon Watts from Wellington Regional Leadership Committee chairperson Darrin Apanui and deputy chairperson Daran Ponter - dated 21 February - said despite originally signalling it was keen to submit an application, "with further consideration [the committee has] concluded that we will not be ready to submit a proposal by this date".</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Ponter told RNZ the committee concluded they needed more time, as it did not want to rush through a proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon called the fact the Wellington region had not put forward a city or regional deal "lame".</p>
        
            <p>"Well, it's pretty lame-o is my view of it.</p>
        
            <p>"Here we have a government doing everything it can to make sure that we attract capital to this country which has been a problem for a long period of time, and you can't even get Wellington councils to submit a regional or a city deal."</p>
        
            <p>But Whanau said Luxon's comments were poor form.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said that Wellington City Council Crown observer Lindsay McKenzie provided an update to council officers on 24 February that noted that the Wellington region's current priority was water reform.</p>
        
            <p>She said that report found that from the Department of Internal Affairs' perspective, receiving a regional deal application from Wellington was not an expectation.</p>
        
            <p>"As such, our Wellington councils are rightly focused on water reform first and we will work towards a comprehensive and meaningful regional deal in due course. We're not going to waste our time chasing the mirage of a short-term regional deal.</p>
        
            <p>"With due respect, Prime Minister, we will deliver a deal, it will just be on our timeline. We are determined to get this right."</p>
