            <p>An 18-year-old man has been arrested and an officer treated for injuries after police intercepted a car in Waikato overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato District Commander Superintendent Bruce Bird said police stopped a vehicle wanted for fleeing police in Rotorua just after 9.30pm on Norton Road.</p>
        
            <p>While police were organising the vehicle to be towed, one of the occupants returned to the car.</p>
        
            <p>An officer attempted to stop the car, then realised he was at risk of being run over or pinned as the car moved. He made the split-second decision to get in the vehicle, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The car then hit a stationary patrol car before fleeing the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Bird said the officer used "tactical options", including a Taser, in an attempt to get the driver to stop. The driver allegedly struck the officer multiple times on the head.</p>
        
            <p>The car lost control and crashed on Lincoln Street a short distance away and the driver fled on foot.</p>
        
            <p>After another pursuit involving a dog unit and police helicopter, the suspect was found up a tree.</p>
        
            <p>The officer suffered moderate facial injuries, but has been discharged from Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gravely concerning to see a police officer injured while carrying out their duties and incidents like this demonstrate the unpredictable and dangerous situations police face, often with little or no warning," Bird said.</p>
