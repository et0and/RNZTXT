            <p>The state housing agency says tenants had been complaining for months about the behaviour of a person involved in a fatal attack at a Mt Albert unit in Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>One man was killed and another was taken to hospital in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police have launched a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Kﾄ（nga Ora said neighbours of the tenant had been complaining about him since December.</p>
        
            <p>It said it contacted the person, their family, police and health services to provide support.</p>
        
            <p>The tenant had only recently returned to the unit.</p>
        
            <p>Kﾄ（nga Ora said it issued a notice under the Residential Tenancies Act, making it clear that the person's behaviour was putting their tenancy at risk.</p>
        
            <p>The agency would not say if he was the man who died, or if he was the person who was seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>It said it had been a complex and challenging case for all the agencies, and it was a tragedy that it ended in this way.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday, Mount Albert MP Helen White said what happened was shocking and upsetting.</p>
        
            <p>White said she had been speaking with police, and had been told it was a family harm incident.</p>
