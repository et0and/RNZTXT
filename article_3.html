        <h2>Netball: Franchises on sponsorship, player recruitment, getting fans</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Franchises are feeling the pinch of the economic climate and have to be innovative to attract sponsorship and fans through the door, the CEOs of the six ANZ Premiership netball sides say.</p>
        
            <p>With two weeks to go before the start of the ANZ Premiership, RNZ surveyed the CEOs of the six franchises on a range of issues from grand final venues to recruitment.</p>
        
            <p>The eighth edition of the domestic league starts on 13 April when the Magic host the Mystics in Hamilton. The regular season will come to a close on the 22 July, when the focus shifts to an elimination final leading into the grand final.</p>
        
            <p>Northern Mystics chief executive Phil Vyver</p>
        
            <p>"Trying to operate a true high performance programme so that our athletes and support staff can be the best version of themselves, but in a very financially constrained environment, would be the biggest challenge."</p>
        
            <p>Stars chief executive Jane Bennett</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest challenge is realising our full commercial potential.</p>
        
            <p>"We have highly engaged audiences and fans, strong media value, access to the key household decision maker, strong community links - yet it is still a challenge to get our proposition in front of the key business decision makers.</p>
        
            <p>"Sport and especially women's sport has a unique angle of providing strong branding opportunities but also the ability to support brand and corporate community impact goals."</p>
        
            <p>Magic general manager Justine Dixon</p>
        
            <p>"It is the same challenge that most businesses are facing in this current economy, maintaining and growing revenue levels. This is why we continue to innovate in this space to retain and attract new fans and sponsors."</p>

            <p>"Money! Either through partnerships or viewership. We need cash in our game to support team performance, to have the right support staff, and to create innovation and relevance. And with this, success breeds success. So, having some money can support better performance, better resourcing opportunities and more innovation, which will lead to stronger partnerships and more viewers."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix general manager Kate Agnew</p>
        
            <p>"Ensuring there are enough resources to deliver a performance team environment and a 'sportainment' experience while servicing commercial partners and league demands."</p>
        
            <p>Steel chief executive Sonya Fleming</p>
        
            <p>"Revenue streams and rising costs continue to be the most challenging aspect for franchises to navigate."</p>

            <p>Northern Mystics chief executive Phil Vyver</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, without a doubt. I don't think anyone is immune from the economic challenges we face as a country at present."</p>
        
            <p>Stars chief executive Jane Bennett</p>
        
            <p>"I can only speak on my one year of experience in this space so haven't got context from a few years ago, but the election and change of government plus cost of living pressures do make it a challenging time for sponsorship.</p>
        
            <p>"I also think businesses are looking more from partnerships - it's no longer about a fancy logo on front of a sports uniform but the opportunity to create meaningful initiatives for the brand and our community.</p>
        
            <p>"This is something I believe netball is in a strong position to deliver."</p>
        
            <p>Magic general manager Justine Dixon</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely - and that's why it's so important to ensure we fully understand the needs of our sponsors to ensure we retain them and are in a position to also attract new sponsors."</p>
        
            <p>Central Zone interim chief executive Ann Hay</p>
        
            <p>"It has always been hard, but certainly, the current economic climate has not made it any easier. Everybody is tightening their belts and there are more players in the market competing for the sponsorship dollar."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix general manager Kate Agnew</p>
        
            <p>"I think that the current environment is challenging, albeit we are fortunate to have some fantastic partners. We know that the economic environment for them is also challenging and there are a lot of choices and competition for their resources."</p>
        
            <p>Steel chief executive Sonya Fleming </p>
        
            <p>"Yes, it is a really challenging space. We are so fortunate to have loyal existing partners, but new partnerships are definitely harder to secure in our current economic climate."</p>

            <p>Northern Mystics chief executive Phil Vyver </p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day we want to grow and develop great people. Having to tell a player they don't fit in our plans for the next season is always very difficult."</p>
        
            <p>Stars chief executive Jane Bennett</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is the lining up of contracts - we need a few pieces to fall into place before we can complete the process and if any of those pieces are not locked in or change it has a domino effect on the rest of the team make-up.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope to be as transparent as possible with players throughout this process but it can make conversations challenging when we are not in a position to offer certainty."</p>
        
            <p>Magic general manager Justine Dixon</p>
        
            <p>"No matter whether it is the players choice or ours, saying good-bye is definitely the hardest as they leave the Magic whānau."</p>
        
            <p>Central Zone interim chief executive Ann Hay </p>
        
            <p>"I came into the interim CEO role after the recruitment process had been completed, so am unable to comment on this facet."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix general manager Kate Agnew </p>
        
            <p>"Balancing the demands of a current verse future team composition and rewarding loyalty verse performance."</p>
        
            <p>Steel chief executive Sonya Fleming </p>
        
            <p>"There are multiple challenges when it comes to player recruitment - not least the strong competition for key players which eventuates each year amongst the franchises."</p>

            <p>"Top qualifier should ideally have the home advantage."</p>
        
            <p>Stars chief executive Jane Bennett</p>
        
            <p>"For the benefit of the league itself capacity does need to be a factor - we want to be able to build on our crowds and the finals series should be treated as a pinnacle event for all our netball fans.</p>
        
            <p>"The top team should be able to access the advantage of a home final. Unfortunately, venues are a big challenge for us and many other codes ... so we need to keep a level of pragmatism when making these decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe Netball NZ is working collaboratively with us [Team GMs/CEOs] to work on finding the best solution."</p>
        
            <p>Magic general manager Justine Dixon</p>
        
            <p>"Of course our preference would be home advantage, however given that venue availability across New Zealand is often booked out well in advance, practically, a neutral venue needs to be booked."</p>
        
            <p>Central Zone interim chief executive Ann Hay </p>
        
            <p>"The final should be played at the home of the team who is the top qualifier for the final. The team have earned the right to have the home court advantage, and their fans and sponsors deserve the chance to support their team live."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix general manager Kate Agnew </p>
        
            <p>"There are a number of factors, some of which are not within netball's control, which influence this. But while there are advantages with certainty of knowing where the final will be held at the start of the competition there are disadvantages too with pre-setting the venue.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it is also very difficult to wait and allocate it to the first ranked team. I am not sure there is an ideal option."</p>
        
            <p>Steel chief executive Sonya Fleming </p>
        
            <p>"I believe the winning team following the conclusion of the round robin phase should host the grand final.</p>
        
            <p>"The home crowd advantage is vital and being able to play at home with your partners, funders and fans is the ultimate goal for the team. The semi-final should feature the second-placed team hosting the third placed."</p>

            <p>Northern Mystics chief executive Phil Vyver </p>
        
            <p>"Sell the message of how awesome a live game of netball is. We have remarkable athletes playing our sport and they deserve to showcase their talents in front of big crowds."</p>
        
            <p>Stars chief executive Jane Bennett</p>
        
            <p>"We have a fantastic base of strong netball fans but how can we engage with new audiences. You don't need to be a netball participant to be able to enjoy a fantastic live sporting event.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be many of our new New Zealanders who have not heard of netball before ...how do we entice these families to our games, feel connected to their community and become fans?</p>
        
            <p>"There is of course the opportunity to drive innovation in the sport and there are many ways to do this, not just a two-point shot."</p>
        
            <p>Magic general manager Justine Dixon</p>
        
            <p>"It's all about fan experience - from their interactions on social media, to walking through the doors, to the match itself. Make it enjoyable for our fans. Surprise them, delight them and they will keep coming back."</p>
        
            <p>Central Zone interim chief executive Ann Hay </p>
        
            <p>"We are providing an entertainment option which goes beyond just the game. The whole experience needs to be exciting, easy to access, have quality food and beverage options, allow for engagement with the team after the game, create an amazing atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"The games themselves also need to be entertaining and have some unpredictability. So, rules that enhance this either through a bonus point system or powerplays should be considered."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix general manager Kate Agnew </p>
        
            <p>"Listen to what fans want to see, hear and experience when they come to a match, challenge themselves to try things which are really innovative. And have matches of great athletic competitiveness with uncertainty of outcome!"</p>
        
            <p>Steel chief executive Sonya Fleming </p>
        
            <p>"Invest the vital resources needed to take the game to the next level from an event perspective. Entertainment is the key, creating an awesome and exciting in-stadium game day experience for our fans.</p>
        
            <p>"Netball continues to face a very real threat from other sporting codes and we must continue to evolve to retain our audience courtside."</p>
