            <p>Oji Fibre Solutions Penrose mill is permanently closing, the E Tu union says.</p>
        
            <p>Workers attended a meeting on Wedneday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The union said the mill's last day of operation will be 18 December.</p>
        
            <p>Oji Fibre Solutions said it was considering closing its Penrose mill, partly due to high power prices. Up to 75 workers would be affected.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, 230 workers at Winston Pulp International were told the sawmill and pulp mills near Ruapehu were both closing for good.</p>
        
            <p>E Tu union spokesperson Joe Gallagher earlier told Morning Report the mood at the mill head of the meeting was "pretty sombre".</p>
        
            <p>"I think people are resigned to the fact that this morning they're going to be told there's a closure, that's yet to be confirmed."</p>
        
            <p>He said a combination of factors was behind the current situation, including power and gas prices.</p>
        
            <p>But also a lack of past capital investment.</p>
        
            <p>$50m in capital upgrades were needed if the mill were to remain open, Gallagher said.</p>
        
            <p>"They ruled that out as a solution.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the signal is quite clear that the announcement today will be a closure.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to support these workers and it's a pretty tough time, leading up to Christmas, to lose your job," Gallagher said.</p>
