            <p>A joint venture working to reduce on farm emissions is doubling down on efforts to create a methane vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>AgriZeroNZ - which is owned by the government and key players in the primary industries - is investing $9.9 million in US company ArkeaBio, which is working to create a methane vaccine for ruminant animals.</p>
        
            <p>It comes on top of [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/country/513979/efforts-to-create-methane-vaccine-bolstered investment into research being done in New Zealand to create a vaccine</p>
        
            <p>AgriZeroNZ chief executive Wayne McNee said it is backing the US research to increase the chance of delivering the highly sought-after, world-first solution.</p>
        
            <p>"A methane vaccine for ruminant animals is internationally recognised as the 'holy grail' to deliver methane reduction at low cost and mass scale.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be one of the best long-term options to really shift the dial on agricultural emissions in New Zealand without compromising farm profitability, as well as a powerful tool globally."</p>
        
            <p>ArkeaBio is led by kiwi expat Colin South and recently completed US$26.5m Series A venture financing to develop and trial the vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>South said they were pleased to have AgriZeroNZ join the funding round.</p>
        
            <p>"A vaccine is the lowest cost path to global scale enteric methane reduction and is applicable to cattle worldwide. This singular solution, distributed globally with large-scale adoption, can change the trajectory of global warming and demonstrate a path to meeting major climate mitigation goals."</p>
