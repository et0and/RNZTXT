            <p>Political parties have roundly criticised Te Pāti Māori for using words like 'extermination' and 'white supremacy' in the House.</p>
        
            <p>MP for Te Tai Tokerau Mariameno Kapa-Kingi accused the coalition government of having a "mission to exterminate Māori" during a general debate last week.</p>
        
            <p>She also used the words "white supremacy" and "Pākehā supremacy" when criticising the repeal of section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour and Green parties also oppose this policy, but do not agree with Kapa-Kingi's choice of words.</p>
        
            <p>"I myself would not use those words," Green MP Huhana Hickey said.</p>
        
            <p>"That kind of language isn't helpful and it's certainly not language that I agree with," Opposition leader Chris Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters posted on X after the debate, saying Kapa Kingi's accusations were ignorant and offensive.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour described the comments as "disgraceful".</p>
        
            <p>"This government, all three parties, have Māori members in Cabinet. It would be rather unusual if we were off to exterminate ourselves."</p>
        
            <p>But Te Pāti Māori is refusing to back down, with co-leader Rawiri Waititi describing Ms Kapa Kingi's speech as "bang on".</p>
        
            <p>"Many of the policy changes that this government is making absolutely makes us feel like there's huge extermination processes and policies of the very existence of tangata whenua in this country.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was absolutely the right wording. It was a brilliant speech and if you haven't already watched the whole speech I suggest you do that."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Kapa-Kingi's comments were out of line and inappropriate, and he has called for calm across the entire House.</p>
        
            <p>"Rhetoric needs to calm down big time across the whole of the political spectrum."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time Luxon has called on political leaders to tone down their language - he did so in March after Winston Peters compared co-governance with Nazi Germany's race-based theories.</p>
