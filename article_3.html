            <p>A person is in a critical condition after a crash involving a truck and a motorbike on Auckland's Harbour Bridge this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the bridge just after 2pm on Friday, and one person was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Two southbound lanes had to be closed and motorists have been advised to avoid the bridge - or expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>All lanes have since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>FINAL UPDATE - 3:05PMAll lanes are now OPEN on the Harbour Bridge. Allow extra time for delays in the area to ease. ^HJ https://t.co/NzsR61m34W</p>
        
            <p>Traffic was heavy on and around the bridge, Google Maps showed. Traffic was also moving slowly on State Highway 1 on the North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>
Auckland traffic as of 3pm.
