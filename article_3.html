            <p>The prime ministers of New Zealand, Australia and Canada have issued a joint statement calling for a pause in hostilities in Gaza and more international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon, Anthony Albanese and Justin Trudeau said the recent pause in hostilities had allowed for the release of more than 100 hostages and led to more humanitarian aid for civilians.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the persistent diplomatic efforts of the United States, Qatar, and Egypt to broker this pause, and we regret it could not be extended.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to see this pause resumed and support urgent international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire. This cannot be one-sided. Hamas must release all hostages, stop using Palestinian civilians as human shields, and lay down its arms."</p>
        
            <p>They said they mourned the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives and were alarmed at the "diminishing safe space" for civilians in Gaza, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>While recognising Israel's right to exist and to defend itself, the country must respect international humanitarian law, and protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, the leaders said.</p>
        
            <p>They unequivocally condemned Hamas' terror attacks on Israel on 7 October, including "the appalling loss of life, and the heinous acts of violence perpetrated in those attacks, including sexual violence".</p>
        
            <p>The prime ministers said they wanted the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>They said the price of defeating Hamas could not be the continuous suffering of all Palestinian civilians.</p>
        
            <p>"We remain deeply concerned by the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and ongoing risks to all Palestinian civilians. Safe and unimpeded humanitarian access must be increased and sustained."</p>
        
            <p>The prime ministers also said they recommitted themselves to working with partners toward an enduring peace in the form of a two-state solution "where Israelis and Palestinians can live securely within internationally recognised borders".</p>
        
            <p>The statement comes at the same time as Israel's major ally, the US, has warned that it is losing support from the international community with its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza that has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.</p>
        
            <p>US President Joe Biden told a campaign fundraising event in Washington: "They're starting to lose that support."</p>
        
            <p>Biden also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needed to change his hardline government, Reuters reported.</p>
