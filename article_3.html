        <h2>Business owner shocked after witnessing armed police swarm busy Auckland road</h2>
        <p>
"It feels like [something] in a movie scene but in the real right in front of you."
</p>
        
            <p>A cafe chef on Auckland's Karangahape road has described the moment armed police swarmed the road as something out of a movie.</p>
        
            <p>A number of armed police descended onto Karangahape Road on Tuesday afternoon, to the shock of nearby businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they arrested three people after it was reported a man was carrying a gun on nearby Hamilton Rd.</p>
        
            <p>La Noisette bakery's chef Oscar Zhou told RNZ she had never seen anything like the response from police.</p>
        
            <p>"I was making muffins, so I heard the cops car were all gathering," she said.</p>

            <p>"All the cars stopped in the middle [of the road], everybody jumped out of the car and pulled out their gun,"</p>
        
            <p>"It was f****** scary."</p>
        
            <p>Zhou said she had been in New Zealand for 22 years, and this was the first time she had seen so many guns.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels like [something] in a movie scene but in the real right in front of you."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said officers had tracked a man getting into a car and travelling along Jervois Rd, and an armed traffic stop was carried out on Karangahape Rd.</p>
        
            <p>"As the traffic stop was being carried out, a passenger ran from the vehicle and attempted to get into a vehicle passing by.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff prevented this from occurring and arrested the 35-year-old man, who had an outstanding warrant for his arrest."</p>
        
            <p>When police searched the car, they found a paintball gun, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries were reported and a man and a woman inside the car were also arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Charged were being considered, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>In a video supplied to RNZ, officers can be seen pointing a gun at a woman who was walking towards them with her hands on her head, before they appear to arrest her.</p>
