            <p>Five boys, aged between 11 and 13, have been arrested in Auckland after a person was assaulted in their Remuera home on Wednesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Relieving Auckland City East Area Prevention Manager Senior Sergeant David Mayes said police responded to reports of a burglary at a residential address on Ohinerau Street about 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The owner of the property returned home to find five people had allegedly broken into the address and were still inside. When confronted, the suspects have attempted to flee.</p>
        
            <p>"The property owner tried to stop the suspects and was assaulted by one of them."</p>
        
            <p>Mayes said those involved ran from the area, however responding frontline officers, with the assistance of the Eagle helicopter and the Police dog unit, found them and took all five into custody without further incident.</p>
        
            <p>Five youths have been referred to Youth Aid in relation to the burglary and the associated assault.</p>
        
            <p>Mayes said the victim was taken to hospital as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>"They have since received medical treatment for minor injuries and are now recovering at home."</p>
        
            <p>He said Police are providing support to the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the impact property crime can have however would caution people against taking matters into their own hands.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, the best thing to do is to avoid a confrontation, maintain observations, and call Police."</p>
