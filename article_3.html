            <p>The Anzac Day curse remains for the Warriors, after going down 27-24 to bottom of the table Gold Coast Titans at Go Media Mt Smart Stadium on Thursday. They haven't won a fixture on Anzac Day for over a decade, despite having hosting rights this year.</p>
        
            <p>Despite another strong opening 20 minutes from the Warriors, which saw two quick tries from Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad in his 100th NRL game and Addin Fonua-Blake, they let the game slip from their grasp.</p>
        
            <p>The Titans came flying back, racking up three consecutive tries and iced it off with a Tanah Boyd field goal to go into sheds with a 19-12 lead at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Things started looking grim for the home side at the start of the second half after the Titans capitalised through Alofiana Khan-Pereira scoring straight away. Fullback AJ Brimson then scored his second, making it five unanswered tries to the Titans.</p>
        
            <p>It seemed that momentum had swung back the way of the Warriors when Roger Tuivasa-Sheck desperately climbed up to clutch a Shaun Johnson bomb, but it was quickly overturned following a Wayde Egan error picked up in the play of the ball.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors began their fight back racking up quick consecutive tries through Fonua-Blake and Rocco Berry, but the Titans held on desperately defending their line having an answer for everything the Warriors through at them.</p>
        
            <p>In the end it wasn't enough as yet another display of poor discipline and errors at crucial times conspired to hand them a disappointing defeat.</p>
        
            <p>The game was played in front of another impressive 24,000 strong crowd, however the Warriors had better find a way to start winning if they want that figure to continue. They face the struggling Knights next Sunday in Newcastle.</p>
        
            <p>Titans 27 (AJ Brimson 2, Tanah Boyd, David Fifita, Alofiana Khan-Pereira tries; Boyd 3 goals, field goal)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 24 (Addin Fonua-Blake 2, Charnze Niccol-Klokstad, Rocco Berry tries; Shaun Johnson 4 goals)</p>
        
            <p>HT: 19-12 Titans</p>
