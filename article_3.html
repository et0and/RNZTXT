            <p>Donald Trump has tapped three vocal celebrity supporters in a bid to make Hollywood "stronger than ever before".</p>
        
            <p>The president-elect named Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone to fill the new "special ambassador" appointments on Truth Social on Thursday, local time, four days ahead of his inauguration.</p>
        
            <p>While their duties remain unclear, Trump said the trio will be his "eyes and ears", and he will "get done what they suggest".</p>
        
            <p>"They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK - BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!</p>
        
            <p>"It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!"</p>
        
            <p>The ambassadors may not have been notified of their new roles in advance.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement provided to Variety, Gibson said he learned of his position through Trump's social media post.</p>
        
            <p>"I got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any chance the position comes with an ambassador's residence?"</p>
        
            <p>The president-elect's post appears to reference Hollywood's post-pandemic revenue struggles.</p>
        
            <p>The US box office was down last year, with revenues of just US$8.7 billion (NZ$15.5b), down 3.3 percent from 2023 and 23.5 percent from 2019, the last pre-pandemic year.</p>
        
            <p>Gibson, Stallone and Voight have each given public support to Trump in recent years.</p>

            <p>At a Mar-a-Lago gala in November Stallone, 78, described Trump as the "second George Washington".</p>
        
            <p>"This man was going to go through a metamorphosis and change lives, just like President Trump," Stallone said of his character Rocky Balboa.</p>
        
            <p>"And I'll just say this, and I'll mean it: When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world. Because without him, you can't imagine what the world would look like.</p>
        
            <p>"Guess what? We've got the second George Washington."</p>
        
            <p>In October, paparazzi filmed Gibson, 69, offering his thoughts on Trump's election campaign opponent Kamala Harris while walking through an airport.</p>
        
            <p>"I know what it'll be like if we let her in," Gibson said in video published by TMZ.</p>
        
            <p>"And that ain't good. Miserable track record. No policies to speak of. She's got the IQ of a fence post."</p>
        
            <p>Gibson, who was ostracised in Hollywood for anti-Semitic comments made in 2006, returned to the industry in 2016 by directing Hacksaw Ridge.</p>
        
            <p>He is among several celebrities who recently lost their homes in the massive wildfires still raging around Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>Voight, 86, has frequently voiced his support for Trump in social media videos and television appearances.</p>
