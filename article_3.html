        <h2>'We have to give this idea a chance': Cautious approach to boot camps advised</h2>
        <p>
They must take a therapeutic approach, rather than a 'scare-them-straight' attitude, the Human Rights Commission says.

            <p>The Human Rights Commission says boot camps need a chance to work but only if they take a therapeutic approach.</p>
        
            <p>Advice to the government says research has concluded a "military regime" - or 'scare them straight'-type camp is ineffective, but ones with lots of support before and after can change young criminals.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Chief Human Rights Commissioner Saunoamaali'i Dr Karanina Sumeo said the government now knew not to take the too-tough track.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unfortunate that they use the term 'boot camp'," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It kinda signals the use of violence to counter violence."</p>
        
            <p>But Sumeo "really supported" a more "therapeutic, helpful approach to them".</p>
        
            <p>"We have to give this idea a chance to work."</p>
        
            <p>'Boot camps' are defined by researchers as emphasising military-style discipline, drills and ceremonies, and rigorous exercise.</p>
        
            <p>They are based on the idea that the routine, discipline, and interaction with staff teach offenders self-control and respect, and "also shock them into behaving in a respectful and obedient manner", the advice to Children's Minister Karen Chhour said.</p>

            <p>This clashes with what Oranga Tamariki told her next: "Traditional military-based approaches for those who have experienced trauma or have a disability will not lead to better long-term outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>"These young people have very high and complex needs and are likely to have experienced trauma, abuse, and family violence, have a disability, have issues with addiction and mental health, and/or poor outcomes in education."</p>
        
            <p>The National Party approach since 2022 has been that the year-long programme within youth justice residences would include schooling, vocational training, counselling, drug and alcohol treatment, mentoring, and cultural support.</p>
        
            <p>Community groups say an offender being ordered by a judge into a boot camp might perversely earn them attention from gang recruiters.</p>
        
            <p>The pitfalls upon release had not been addressed in past attempts, the advice said.</p>
        
            <p>Previous boot camps foundered inside - "lack of robust support (that addresses the causes of the young person's offending), meant improved outcomes were not realised" - and outside - "lack of transitional support and intervention with family and whānau were also identified as shortcomings", Chhour was told.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ that transition planning involving whānau, iwi and communities was her number one focus.</p>
        
            <p>Sumeo said the commission wanted input but had not had it so far.</p>
        
            <p>"Normally we are given an opportunity to input, so we want an opportunity to input, to give the best advice to them.</p>
        
            <p>"From a basic human rights perspective, we expect to be part of the group that's consulted."</p>
        
            <p>The minister should spread the tent to hear from multicultural groups and dairy and business owners, so everyone with a stake got a say, Sumeo said.</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said health and safety laws would apply in the military academies.</p>
        
            <p>"The minister expects the operational aspects of the programme to comply with all regulation," a spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki would have the status of a PCBU - a person conducting a business or undertaking - under law in the camps.</p>
        
            <p>"The details of the programme are still being developed, including the design, locations, staff training, health and safety requirements, and the potential cohorts of young people that will be included."</p>
