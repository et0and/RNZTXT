            <p>The All Blacks will host the World Champions South Africa at Eden Park next year.</p>
        
            <p>It will be the first time the All Blacks have played the Springboks at the Auckland venue since 2013.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby (NZR) has confirmed the All Blacks and Black Ferns home schedules for 2025, with the teams also taking part in a double header in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns build up to next year's women's Rugby World Cup includes three home tests starting in Christchurch against world No.2 Canada, while the All Blacks season kicks off in Dunedin against France in the first of six home fixtures including back-to-back tests against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The double header will be in Wellington on 12 July where the Black Ferns will put the O'Reilly Cup on the line against Australia at 4.30pm, before the All Blacks play the second of their three test July series against France at 7.05pm.</p>
        
            <p>With the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England next August the Black Ferns domestic schedule takes on extra significance with two Pacific Four Series tests in May against defending champions Canada and the United States.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns host Canada in Christchurch on 17 May before taking on the US at North Harbour Stadium in Auckland the following weekend. Both games kick off at 3:35pm.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns round out their home schedule against the Wallaroos in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns head coach Allan Bunting knows 2025 is a massive year for his side.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't get any bigger than a World Cup year, but the foundations of our year will be laid here in Aotearoa with the support of our fans, friends and whƒÅnau. Australia, Canada and USA will be crucial tests and the double-header in Wellington will be a fitting finale to our domestic schedule," Bunting said.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks Rugby Championship schedule features back-to-back Freedom Cup tests against South Africa at Eden Park in Auckland on 6 September and in Wellington on 13 September before finishing back at Eden Park on 27 September for an afternoon Bledisloe Cup clash against the Wallabies that kicks off at 5.05pm.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks extended their winning run at Eden Park to 50 tests this year with wins over England and Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>France visits New Zealand for the first time in seven years and will pick up where they left off in 2018 with a test in Dunedin before heading to Wellington for the second test of the series.</p>
        
            <p>The potential decider will be a historic occasion with France playing a test in Hamilton for the first time since first touring New Zealand in 1961.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby had tried to take one of the French tests to the US but France said no to that idea.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks Head Coach Scott Robertson said there are no easy games in their schedule.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing at home and representing your country in front of New Zealanders is always special and especially so against three of our most traditional rivals. France, South Africa and Australia will each bring unique challenges and that's exciting for us as we continue to build our game in 2025," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby boss Mark Robinson hopes the country shows its support for the Black Ferns in a World Cup season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge year for the Black Ferns with the Rugby World Cup and the 2025 schedule is a chance for fans across the country to get behind the team as they prepare to win their title in England. The support of New Zealanders means a huge amount to our teams in black and the double-header at Sky Stadium in Wellington will be a special occasion for both teams," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the All Blacks there is a rare opportunity to host three of our greatest rivals in the same year as we welcome France, South Africa and Australia. These traditional rivalries will always be special and we look forward to a continuation of the entertainment and drama we saw during 2024."</p>
