        <h2>The champ is here: Coco Gauff ready to defend her ASB Classic title</h2>
        <p>
It's a fair assumption right now that Gauff is leading the resurgence of American tennis, writes Jamie Wall.

            <p>Just a little over three months on from her maiden Grand Slam title, it's fair to say Coco Gauff is pretty happy with the way her tennis career is going.</p>
        
            <p>The win at the US Open capped off a season that started with a win at the 2023 ASB Classic, so the 19-year-old returns as the defending champion and main drawcard. It's a fair assumption right now that Gauff is the leading light in the resurgence of American tennis, but that's not a label she likes to wear.</p>
        
            <p>"Like public publicity wise and ranking wise, technically I'm at the front, but all my counterparts are older than me, so I don't really feel like that," she said the day before the start of the 2024 tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"So, I don't feel like I'm leading them in any way or leading it. Maybe for you guys (the media) it feels like that. But for us, or at least for me, I just feel like I'm just focus on me. I'm not trying to lead anybody. If anything, I'm really learning from them."</p>
        
            <p>Still, Gauff admits that her breakthrough win at Flushing Meadows has changed things in a big way.</p>
        
            <p>"I get more recognition, but I just feel like for me as a person, that helped me, prove that all the growth that I'm doing is leading to results.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not going to win all the time. But there is a moment where you're going to reach that goal. So, I think (the US Open win) was just a statement for all the work that I put in, and I think I definitely deserved it."</p>

            <p>She was quick to point out that her first-round exit at Wimbledon last season was something that she'd learned from in a big way.</p>
        
            <p>"Learning from it helped me push forward and I think sometimes you need those setbacks to push you forward. Obviously, at the time I didn't want to lose first round, but I think that's what I needed."</p>
        
            <p>That sort of confidence and maturity on the court and on camera is something that the US tennis establishment is lapping up, as well as the fact that they also have Ben Shelton rapidly rising up the ranks.</p>
        
            <p>She is joined in the top 10 by Jessica Pegula right now and says that the potential for an American dynasty in the years to come is exciting.</p>
        
            <p>"That feeling I felt on match point (at the US Open) was a high and I want to continue to chase that high," she said.</p>
        
            <p>So how does it feel to walk into a room as not only the defending champ, but a US Open winner?</p>

            <p>"It feels the same, last season was last season. I don't really take any thought to it. Obviously, you want to defend, but my whole career has been trying to forget the past and it's just the same as a tournament that I've lost in the first round at.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I feel like that's more pressure because you don't want to lose in the first round again. I try to treat every tournament like a fresh start and if I get to the end and win back-to-back, that's pretty cool, but I'm not really looking at that."</p>
        
            <p>Gauff takes on fellow American Claire Liu, ranked 98 in the world, in her first-round match. Looking at the draw she's a decent shout to repeat her title-winning effort from last year, but the relaxed and confident champion is taking it all in her stride.</p>
