        <h2>Bill repealing section 7AA of Oranga Tamariki Act passes first reading</h2>
        <p>
It does not mean Oranga Tamariki will stop working with iwi and Māori organisations, Children's Minister Karen Chhour says.

            <p>The bill repealing Oranga Tamariki's obligation to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi passed its first reading in Parliament this evening.</p>
        
            <p>The bill repeals section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>The section includes Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations including the creation of partnerships with iwi and Māori organisations.</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour told Parliament the section had driven bad decisions by Oranga Tamariki staff.</p>
        
            <p>"During my time in opposition and before coming to Parliament, I heard devastating stories about how some Oranga Tamariki staff prioritised cultural considerations and the desires of a child's family over the individual need of the child. This sometimes led to unsafe care decisions and disruption for both the children and the caregivers."</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said the change did not mean Oranga Tamariki would stop working with iwi and Māori organisations.</p>
        
            <p>During the debate, Te Pati Maori MP Mariameno Kapa-Kingi repeated her earlier claims that the repeal bill was a form of extermination.</p>
        
            <p>"The repeal of Section 7AA is a targeted extermination of our babies - hold tight, don't... have feelings yet - exterminating any ounce of culture, identity and any sense of their Māori selves."</p>
        
            <p>Māori children in care would lose contact with their culture if the bill was passed, she said.</p>
