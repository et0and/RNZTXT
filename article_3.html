            <p>Parliament's justice select committee unanimously agreed to re-open submissions to 1pm Tuesday 14 January after technical issues.</p>
        
            <p>Initial indications are that the committee received 300,000 online submissions, half of which were received on the last day.</p>
        
            <p>It easily surpasses the previous record of about 107,000 on the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Bill in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The final number of submissions is likely to change as committee staff work through processing the submissions.</p>

            <p>Submissions emailed to treatyprinciples@parliament.govt.nz or justice@parliament.govt.nz between Monday and 9am Thursday will be accepted as a regular submission, provided their email references the technical issues with the website, contains a name, a submission, and meets the submisson conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Those who emailed submissions that do not meet this criteria would need to re-do it on the website portal.</p>
        
            <p>The committee has "strongly encouraged" those wishing to make submissions to do so promptly and not leave doing so until the final hours of next Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Those experiencing technical difficulties - or wondering if their email meets the committee's criteria - have been asked to email committee staff at treatyprinciples@parliament.govt.nz.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone approaching the committee about technical difficulties need to attach a screenshot of the issue they're experiencing.</p>
        
            <p>The Justice Committee says people may experience a delay getting a response to their queries due to the high level of public engagement.</p>
        
            <p>"Committee staff are working hard to support everyone to participate in the committee's work, and the committee appreciates your patience," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Each individual submitter will be counted once, even if they make multiple submissions, and it's up to the committee as to how it handles identical submissions from different individuals.</p>
        
            <p>Problems with the website meant people were not able to make a submission by the original deadline of 11.59pm on Tuesday, 7 January.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was contacted by dozens of people who couldn't get their submission in and one case where the feedback was altered.</p>
        
            <p>The committee met on Thursday to decide whether an extension was merited.</p>
        
            <p>Tech consultant Louisa Taylor said the errors she observed on the website could be caused by low server capacity or an attack.</p>
        
            <p>"If a nefarious actor sent a lot of traffic to the site they could actually take it down," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It's not clear how many people were affected by technical problems but RNZ has seen evidence they could date back to late November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Back then, a submitter emailed their feedback to Parliament, flagging they had experienced problems with the official submissions portal.</p>
