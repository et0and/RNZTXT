            <p>Legendary Australian rocker Jimmy Barnes has revealed he was often "incapacitated" while writing songs for his latest album.</p>
        
            <p>Barnes, 68, has been hit with a series of health issues in recent years after more than five decades of performing and touring.</p>
        
            <p>The Cold Chisel frontman underwent open-heart surgery in late 2023 after being hospitalised with bacterial pneumonia, and then had emergency surgery in August 2024 when the infection returned to his hip. Fighting excruciating pain, Barnes was given a temporary joint but managed to return to the stage seven weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>This month, Barnes again underwent surgery after being given the all-clear to have his hip replaced with a permanent joint.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with ABC News Breakfast, Barnes describes himself as "fighting fit".</p>
        
            <p>"I've just been for a big check-up on my heart surgery and they all said it's all working great and I'm healthy as a mallee bull," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His new album, Defiant, is out this year and its first single, 'New Day', was released on Monday. Barnes said his health issues undoubtedly played a part in the making of his new music.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in considering all the odds, it's actually made the record a better record," he said on News Breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>"Because I was writing these songs and quite a lot of time, I was sort of incapacitated, but I was just going, I want to get on stage and play some rock and roll. This is what I do best."</p>
        
            <p>Barnes said he was often writing new lyrics from a hospital bed while recovering from surgery.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the fact that I could see not only my health getting better, but I could see this album taking shape actually kept me sane while I was going through all that."</p>
        
            <p>The name of Barnes's new album is no accident. He said his health challenges helped make him "a very defiant person".</p>
        
            <p>"Life throws things at you," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And, you know, quite often you get knocked down.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to pick yourself up. You've got to learn from what's happened to you. You've got to know what you've done wrong, and then move forward again, you know, carefully. I've always done that.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you've got to be sort of defiant. You've got to be persistent and strong in everything you do in life, whether it's relationships, whether it's raising children, whether it's making yourself a better human being."</p>
        
            <p>Barnes said he could not wait to get on the road for a newly announced national tour in June and play his new music to a live audience.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to do theatres," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to be able to see the whites of people's eyes. So it's good to keep it in a contained area where I can really control the sound and the production.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really looking forward to getting out and sharing these songs with my kids and with Jane and playing them live."</p>

            <p>Increasingly, Barnes's shows are becoming something of a family affair. His daughter, Mahaila, provides backing vocals on the new album while his son, Jackie, plays the drums.</p>
        
            <p>"And of course they're all going to be in the band when we play live," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been joking lately about how I used to have a band once. Now I'm in their band!</p>
        
            <p>"I don't try and run the band as 'this is how I want it done'. They all know what I want because they're my family.</p>
        
            <p>"As a unit, we work really well together."</p>
        
            <p>However, Barnes admitted having family on the road "has certain challenges".</p>
        
            <p>"They're all very stubborn," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all very defiant like me.</p>
        
            <p>"And you know what, I like it because everybody has a say in what we do and most of the time I keep a very open mind because they're really great ideas."</p>
        
            <p>Jimmy Barnes's new album Defiant will be out on 6 June, and a six-date national tour will see Barnes playing theatres in Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.</p>
