            <p>A fire in Southland has doubled in size since it broke out overnight, with 40 firefighters and five helicopters working to contain the blaze on the Awarua Peninsula in Southland.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it was alerted to the large scrub fire at Tiwai Point at around midnight and it has now spread to 250 hectares with an 8km perimeter.</p>

            <p>Fire crews have been working through the night, and helicopters began operations at first light to help contain the blaze.</p>

            <p>Invercargill City councillor Alex Crackett said smoke from the fire was visible across the city and from as far away as Riverton.</p>
        
            <p>She said the fire was burning through vegetation, but the smoke was blowing in the opposite direction from the Tiwai aluminium smelter, which was not currently under threat.</p>

            <p>"We've got some sites of significance out there near Bluff, some urupa and some gorgeous and significant wetlands out there so I am really hoping it can be contained and controlled quite soon."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Aluminium Smelter spokesman Simon King said there was no immediate impact or danger to the site or staff and the plant remained in operation.</p>
        
            <p>It would continue to monitor the situation and remains in contact with emergency services, he said.</p>
