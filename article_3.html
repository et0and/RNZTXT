            <p>A jewellery store owner is in hospital with serious injuries after being attacked in his Papatoetoe store by up to five armed men who allegedly struck him repeatedly in the head with a hammer and knife.</p>
        
            <p>The man was transported to Middlemore Hospital and is receiving medical treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The offenders fled the scene and police are hunting for those responsible.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened at Pooja Jewellers on Kolmar Rd, Papatoetoe about 5.45pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Dairy & Business Owners crime prevention group chairman Sunny Kaushal said he knew the victim closely.</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal understood about five armed offenders forced entry into the store as one customer was leaving about 5.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>"They assaulted the shop owner, a family member and a worker. So three people were injured," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The shop owner had serious injuries. Apparently, he was attacked with a hammer on his head three times and an attack with a knife on his forehead."</p>
        
            <p>"He was hospitalised and was stitched on the forehead. He is currently waiting for a scan, but is out of danger."</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal planned to visit the family on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"This family is a very community-orientated family," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have made such a contribution to the community and to the society."</p>
        
            <p>He said the family had been in the community for a long time and was well-known and well-respected."It is a stark reminder about how serious it is getting in New Zealand, that crime is out of control and needs to be stopped.</p>
        
            <p>"Doing business in New Zealand is getting very hard for shop owners."</p>
        
            <p>A St John ambulance spokesman told the Herald they responded to a call about an incident in Papatoetoe and attended with one road manager and two ambulances.</p>
        
            <p>"We transported one patient to Middlemore Hospital in serious condition."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said the Eagle helicopter responded to the area, however the offenders left in a vehicle prior to arrival and were not located.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Keki Wilson said police were working to piece together exactly what occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"We are speaking with a number of witnesses and will conduct a scene examination.</p>
        
            <p>"Violent incidents like these rightly cause concern and police is committed to holding offenders to account."</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said enquiries remained ongoing to locate the offenders and their vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>If you have any information that may assist in locating those involved please contact Police on 105 and reference event number: P059142364.</p>
