            <p>New Zealand canoe sprint paddler Aimee Fisher has one major ambition - an Olympic gold medal.</p>
        
            <p>If she achieves it she will have to defeat the woman she most admired while coming up through the junior ranks and the country's most successful Olympian.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington won the K1 500 at the Tokyo Olympics, however, Fisher has beaten her at the distance twice this year including at the last regatta before the Olympics, in Poland in late May.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old also reminded the world of her class when she won the K1 500 world title just months after she decided to sit out the Tokyo Olympics because she was concerned about athlete welfare concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher told the International Canoe Federation at the time she enjoyed the match-ups against Carrington, but knew the bar would be lifted to another level in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"We have raced so many times now that it comes down to centimetres so you have to just treat every stroke with respect because you know she is going to be right there," Fisher said.</p>
        
            <p>"When the Olympics come around it will be winner takes all. From now, I need to reset as I have a lot of work to do and I am going to be working hard every single day."</p>
        
            <p>All going well, at 11pm on 10 August the two women will square off with a possible gold-silver quinella for New Zealand on the line.</p>
