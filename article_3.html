        <h2>'Appalling lack of process': Treaty bill deadline moved up to tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
The committee has "rammed it through with outrageous haste", with a report now expected tomorrow, but excluding thousands of submissions, Duncan Webb says.

            <p>Labour says the Justice Select Committee is expected to report back on the Treaty Principles Bill on Friday - more than a month ahead of time.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament set down a deadline of the 14 May, and a Cabinet minute shows the committee was set to consider it until 16 May.</p>
        
            <p>But Labour's Justice spokesperson Duncan Webb - who had previously sought an extension to avoid thousands of public submissions being excluded - now says the timeline has been moved up.</p>
        
            <p>"The committee finished more than a month ahead of the 14 May deadline set by Parliament with the report expected to be presented and available tomorrow (Friday)," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Webb said the Committee had "rammed it through with outrageous haste" and the early report would exclude those thousands of submissions.</p>
        
            <p>"With government members rushing to report the bill back early, the process is exposed for what it really is - a sham," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This shows utter contempt for the many New Zealanders who took the time to submit and whose views are now missing from the record.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an appalling lack of process on a hugely consequential bill."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has previously said the record number of submissions overwhelmed the committee, and that Labour was playing politics.</p>
        
            <p>He this week doubled down on allowing the submissions to be excluded, despite warnings from legal scholars the move would set a precedent that could erode democratic participation.</p>
