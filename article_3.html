            <p>England head into the second test holding a 1-0 series lead after a very comfortable victory at Hagley Oval. Despite the Basin pitch having a bit of turn, the Black Caps have resisted the urge to change their lineup, so the pressure is on the bowling unit to come up with some spells of dominance - and everyone to hold onto some catches. Play starts at 11am.</p>
