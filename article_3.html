            <p>Auckland Council group chief financial officer Peter Gudsell has announced his resignation after three years in the job.</p>
        
            <p>Gudsell will leave the council at the end of February next year after he and his team has delivered the council's 10-year Budget consultation document, a statement from the council said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am grateful and proud to have had the opportunity to be part of what the council has achieved, particularly over the last three years when Covid, weather events, climate impacts, and a rollercoaster ride of interest, inflation and budget pressures have thrown so much at us," he said in the statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm departing at an important milestone in the long-term planning process, but what I hope is a good time for someone else to come in."</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Phil Wilson acknowledged Gudsell's contribution, the job of CFO of the largest council group in Australasia is "perhaps one of the most complex and challenging executive roles in local government."</p>
        
            <p>"Peter and his team have consistently achieved high credit ratings, met our external audit expectations and our obligations as a publicly listed organisation - no mean feat when dealing with budget gaps and our own high standards when it comes to financial prudence.</p>
        
            <p>He takes up a new role as chief financial officer at Southern Cross Healthcare in March next year.</p>
