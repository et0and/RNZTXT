            <p>Auckland Transport wants shopping centres to proactively manage traffic during Black Friday sales and the Christmas shopping period.</p>
        
            <p>The call follows some shoppers waiting more than three hours to leave the Westfield Mall in Newmarket on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport (AT) was for its handling of traffic management.</p>
        
            <p>With Black Friday sales this weekend and Christmas just over four weeks away, Auckland's roads are expected to be busy again.</p>
        
            <p>AT's executive general public transport services Stacey van der Putten told Morning Report they will have staff on from 9am Friday helping to optimise the flow of traffic, including through the use of traffic light timings.</p>
        
            <p>But she said shopping malls can also help by proactively managing onsite parking and having clear signage when car parks are full.</p>
        
            <p>They can also encourage shoppers to use public transport, van der Putten said.</p>
        
            <p>"Public transport is really really well serviced into those shopping centres. So shopping centres encouraging people to do that means that they can get more people into their facilities."</p>
        
            <p>Van der Putten said there was no one size fits all approach but it's stressful sitting in car going nowhere or hunting for a park.</p>
        
            <p>"Where practical we are encouraging people to look at alternative travel and public transport is a really good option for people to consider."</p>
        
            <p>It was important to plan ahead to avoid a repeat of last weekend, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's anyone's fault, I think it's a scenario we can learn from."</p>
