            <p>Ryan Fox has recorded a rare feat in golf, hitting a hole in one.</p>
        
            <p>Fox has aced the iconic 17th Island Green hole at the $40 million Players Championship in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old New Zealander etched his name into the history books as he became just the 14th player to record a hole-in-one at the 17th at the Players Championship.</p>
        
            <p>He also became the first player ever to record back-to-back eagles on 16 and 17.</p>

            <p>He finished with a three under par 69 which currently has him tied for 11th.</p>
        
            <p>It was a mixed round for the Aucklander, he he two eagles, two birdies and three bogeys.</p>
        
            <p>Before the tournament Fox told RNZ about his experience of the 17th after playing there last year.</p>
        
            <p>"The 17th doesn't seem like that hard of a shot on a Monday and Tuesday, but (during the tournament) you've got a few thousand people there pretty much waiting for a car accident.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite intimidating and you can never let your guard down and you can make two, or five, or even worse than that there very quickly."</p>
        
            <p>Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy are the club house leaders.</p>
        
            <p>....more to come.</p>
