            <p>Attendees at the US Republican National Convention have been wearing bandages over their ears in an apparent act of solidarity with former President Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>The four-day convention began less than 48 hours after a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing one supporter.</p>
        
            <p>The gunman was shot dead and his motive remains unclear.</p>
        
            <p>Trump walked into the Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee on the first night of the convention with a thick bandage over his ear as the crowd chanted "Fight! Fight! Fight" and pumped their fists, a reference to his reaction in the moments after he was wounded.</p>

            <p>Arizona delegate Joe Neglia, with a folded white envelope taped across his ear, told CBS News it was the newest fashion trend.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm getting this going - everybody in the world is going to be wearing one of these pretty soon. It's the latest thing," Neglia said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm setting new fashion ground here."</p>
        
            <p>Trump is due to formally accept the party's nomination in a prime-time speech on Thursday (local time), and will face Democratic President Joe Biden in the 5 November election.</p>
