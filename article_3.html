            <p>A Russian Ilyushin-76 military transport plane has crashed in the southern Belgorod region bordering Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Russia's ministry of defence said 65 captured Ukrainian military were on the plane heading to Belgorod region for a prisoner exchange.</p>
        
            <p>None of the details surrounding those on board can be independently verified.</p>
        
            <p>Ria Novosti news agency said another nine people were on the plane, including six crew.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine's general staff, quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda website, said the plane was transporting missiles for Russia's S-300 air defence systems. It made no mention of prisoners of war.</p>
        
            <p>Video shared on social media showed a plane going down followed by an explosion and a fireball near the village of Yablonovo, 70km to the north-east of the city of Belgorod, about 11am local time (08:00 GMT).</p>
        
            <p>Some Ukrainian media suggested initially that the Il-76 may have been downed by Ukrainian forces, but those reports were later deleted.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine's general staff told BBC Ukrainian that it did not have accurate information about the situation and that it was investigating the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said he was aware of an "incident" but gave no further details.</p>
        
            <p>Andrei Kartapolov, the chairman of Russia's parliamentary defence committee, claimed later that there had been a second plane in the air transporting 80 Ukrainian prisoners, although that plane had then changed course.</p>
        
            <p>"There can now be no talk of any other [prisoner] exchanges," Kartapolov told Russian TV.</p>
        
            <p>Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin was aware of the crash but refused to go in to details.</p>
        
            <p>A nationwide air raid alert was briefly in place across Ukraine shortly after news of the Il-76 crash emerged.</p>
        
            <p>Belgorod, which is located about 40km north of the border with Ukraine, has suffered dozens of casualties from air strikes and drones since the war in Ukraine began.</p>
        
            <p>In December, 25 people were killed and 100 were injured following an air strike - although Ukraine insisted that only military infrastructure had been targeted and blamed Russian air defences for fragments falling on the city.</p>
