            <p>TVNZ is planning to scrap its 1News website next year under a proposal to save the struggling state-owned broadcaster's finances.</p>
        
            <p>A whole staff meeting was called on Monday to go over the proposal, aiming to find $30 million in savings.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcaster earlier this year cut a number of news and current affairs shows, including Fair Go and its midday and late night bulletins.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal presented to staff at the meeting included:</p>
        
            <p>"TVNZ today shared proposed strategic changes focused on how we might achieve our $30m target, deliver on our Digital+ strategy and ensure the business remains sustainable and relevant for all New Zealanders," the company said in a statement following the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now seeking feedback on the proposals, and we will not be making any decisions until after we have considered all the feedback from our people."</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Jodi O'Donnell in August said TVNZ had sufficient cash to fund its digital strategy over the next three years, but would not pay a dividend.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcaster reported a loss of $85 million against a $1.7m profit the year before, driven by a $62m write down in asset values, which were not specified, and a $39m drop in revenue.</p>
