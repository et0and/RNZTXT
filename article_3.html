        <h2>Watch live: Coalition confirms $24m for Gumboot Friday</h2>
        <p>
The move comes a week ahead of Budget 2024 and meets a commitment set out in coalition agreements.
</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has confirmed this year's Budget will include a $24 million spend over four years for the I Am Hope initiative Gumboot Friday, providing counselling to young people.</p>
        
            <p>Mental health campaigner Mike King joined Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey to confirm the decision at Parliament on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the money would enable the charity to provide access to free mental health counselling services for more than 15,000 young New Zealanders per year.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said prevention and early intervention were a critical part of dealing with mental health, and Gumboot Friday played a vital role in enabling young people with mild to moderate mental health needs access to counselling services earlier.</p>
        
            <p>King said every cent would be reported and accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>"Every single cent, $24 million, is going directly to councellors. Mike King is not putting a single cent in his pocket, I Am Hope Foundation is not putting a signle cent in its pocket, this is about the kids," he said.</p>
