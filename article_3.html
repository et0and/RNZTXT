            <p>Open air fires and fireworks are banned in Otago's Strath Taieri from Saturday morning, due to the increasing fire risk.</p>
        
            <p>The Strath Taieri covers the Taieri River, Te Papanui Conservation Park, the Rock and Pillar Range, and the town of Middlemarch.</p>
        
            <p>The prohibited fire season also meant all fire permits were suspended.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Otago district manager Phil Marsh said dry conditions were expected to continue, while blustery westerly winds were forecast for the remainder of summer and into autumn.</p>
        
            <p>"This combination presents a very high fire risk, as dry grass and scrub can ignite easily, and fire will rapidly spread," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce the risk of wildfire, we are also putting a ban on fireworks.</p>
        
            <p>"It only takes one spark to start a wildfire. The risk is far too high in these dry and windy conditions."</p>
        
            <p>He asked residents and visitors to take extra care this weekend due to a higher fire danger in Strath Taieri and across Otago.</p>
        
            <p>He urged people to be vigilant about any activities that generated heat or sparks, including using machinery or gas cookers if camping in the area.</p>
