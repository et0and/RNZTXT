            <p>A witness to a crash at an Australian airshow says the entire crowd was stunned into silence after seeing a plane hit the ground in what appeared to be an uncontrolled nosedive.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC is reporting the pilot and sole occupant has been seriously injured in the crash at the Avalon International Airshow near Melbourne on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>It reports emergency services were called after a plane lost control while conducting a demonstration and crashed into the tarmac.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ broadcaster Phil O'Brien is among the crowd at the airshow and said the crash was "beyond horrible" and he can't believe anyone could survive the impact.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest, it was just nose first. Full speed into the ground."</p>
        
            <p>He said the biplanes were doing loops and tricks which included stalling and plummeting towards the ground before pulling up at the last second.</p>
        
            <p>"And I watched him come down and he started to pull back and then suddenly he got into what looked like an uncontrollable spin.</p>
        
            <p>"And it just went nose first ... right on the edge of the runway."</p>
        
            <p>O'Brien said there were no flames but he saw an explosion of dust and felt the shock of the impact through the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"But the weirdest thing was this huge crowd at the airport just went completely silent, just stopped. There wasn't a sound for about 10 seconds when everyone realised what had happened."</p>
        
            <p>The pilot and sole occupant of the aircraft has suffered critical injuries, an Ambulance Victoria spokesperson told the ABC.</p>
