            <p>The King will deliver his annual Christmas message from a former hospital chapel.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is the first country in the Commonwealth to broadcast King Charles' message, at 6.06pm on RNZ National, and again at 6.50pm on TVNZ's Channel 1.</p>
        
            <p>King Charles singled out and thanked the medical profession for its dedication and service.</p>
        
            <p>In a break from tradition, the King, who is being treated for cancer, spoke from a former hospital chapel, rather than from one of the royal residences.</p>
        
            <p>He praised those who care for others and gave his own personal thanks.</p>
        
            <p>King Charles also acknowledged the devastating effects of conflict, pointing to ongoing war in the Middle East, Ukraine and parts of Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The annual speech from the monarch is traditionally recorded earlier in December and broadcast on television and radio at 3pm on Christmas Day in Britain.</p>
        
            <p>The annual festive broadcast is normally recorded at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. But the British monarch opted to film this year's message at Fitzrovia Chapel in central London, which was previously a hospital chapel before it was demolished in 1924.</p>
        
            <p>The speech location is a break with tradition amid the King's continued cancer treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The first Christmas Royal broadcast was given by King George V in 1932. Every year since, the monarch has addressed the nation on Christmas Day.</p>
