            <p>Rental prices have hit an all time high, online marketplace Trade Me says.</p>
        
            <p>Properties in the website's rental index have risen by an average of $50 in the last year, bringing the national median rental price to $650.</p>
        
            <p>"While it's not the biggest annual increase we've ever seen, it is unusual to see it this high in March," Trade Me property sales director Gavin Lloyd said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd normally expect to see the market cool slightly as we exit summer and start heading into the colder months."</p>
        
            <p>He said the increase amounted to an extra $2600 per year for most New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>The steepest increase was in the ManawatÅ«-Whanganui region, which was up 10 percent to $550.</p>
        
            <p>In the same period, rentals in Wellington didn't shift at all and remained at $650.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland saw a 6.2 percent increase and remained the most expensive city with an average weekly rent of $690.</p>
        
            <p>Southland saw a 9.3 percent increase - the second largest nationwide - but remained the cheapest region at an average of $470.</p>
        
            <p>Demand was down and supply has risen for the second month, the index also showed.</p>
        
            <p>Compared with the same time in 2023, there were 22 percent fewer enquiries and 3 percent more properties available in March.</p>
        
            <p>While there was still some way to go before supply caught up with demand, rents might stablise or even fall, Lloyd said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, apartments, townhouses and units were in demand across the motu, together jumping to a record-breaking average of $580 per week in March, 8.4 percent more than the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>Rents were growing faster outside the main city centres.</p>
        
            <p>Lloyd said it showed Kiwis were willing to trade a bit of space for a desirable location.</p>
