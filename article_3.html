        <p>
On Auckland's North Shore, a public golf course is fighting council plans to use their course as a floodwater catchment.

            <p>Auckland Council wants to turn public land into a water catchment to protect against floods. The current leaseholders say there's a better way. </p>
        
            <p>A stoush is brewing on Auckland's North Shore over a controversial proposal to convert Takapuna Golf Course into a floodwater catchment area, aiming to mitigate the city's increasing flood risks.</p>
        
            <p>The plan involves transforming the popular, public 18-hole course into a multi-purpose green space designed to absorb excess stormwater during heavy rains.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about golfing, it's about flooding, and protecting lives and properties," says Tom Mansell, the council's head of sustainable partnerships.</p>
        
            <p>"This catchment was absolutely devastated by the floods in 2023... we had loss of life, many properties were written off, hundreds of businesses were destroyed, so we had to look at ways to mitigate the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>"We had to look at all sorts of options. But this area at the golf course can be used for storage of water, to take the flooding away from the streets and houses and store it here."</p>
        
            <p>North Shore councillor Richard Hills, who played golf on the course as a youngster, backs the new proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently the golf course can hold about 60 million litres of water, but if this project goes ahead, and is built the way it has been planned, it will hold over half a billion litres of water, so significantly different," he says.</p>
        
            <p>But the golf club is not impressed.</p>
        
            <p>"Disbelief, we were just in shock," club spokesperson Stephen Dowd tells The Detail. "It was like being hit with a blunt instrument really."</p>
        
            <p>He says they only found out about the proposal during recent lease negotiations with the Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>"Why didn't they involve us, why didn't they come and talk to us, why does it seem like they want to destroy the golf course?"</p>
        
            <p>In response to the plan, a public petition has been launched to save the course on AF Thomas Park, which attracts about 500 visitors a day, and about 200,000 each year.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a golf course, not a club, so we are cheap - very cheap," says Dowd. "Golfers begin their golf game here ... working class, women, men, young, old... a lot of people enjoying playing here.</p>
        
            <p>"Lydia Ko has played here, I think Ryan Fox practiced at the driving range ... we have had a pro-am with the best New Zealand golfers here. A lot of great young golfers have started their careers here."</p>
        
            <p>But under the proposal, the course would either be halved to a nine-hole course, or closed entirely.</p>
        
            <p>If greenlit, the project would be a major undertaking onsite, take several years to finish, and cost tens of millions of dollars, funded by the government and ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>Engineers would create wetlands, retention ponds, and natural drainage areas to prevent nearby streets and homes from flooding. In drier months, the area would offer walking trails and recreational facilities.</p>
        
            <p>The move is in response to growing concerns over Auckland's vulnerability to extreme weather events.</p>
        
            <p>"It would help reduce velocity," says Hills. "It would help reduce the amount of water heading down the catchment at once and it would help hold some of the water until the rain has stopped, and it will be released over time.</p>
        
            <p>"This will help reduce flooding and it will reduce the speed and harmfulness, so people aren't swept away.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's also important that the whole community has a say on this."</p>
        
            <p>But Dowd says there are options that could save lives, and the course. He's met with civil engineers to discuss viable options.</p>
        
            <p>"Courses around the world have been designed to help manage water during flooding events and there is considerable scope to increase the Takapuna course's existing capacity, without destroying a community asset.</p>
        
            <p>"We are confident we can come up with something that is workable for both parties."</p>
