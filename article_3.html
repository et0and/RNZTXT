            <p>A criminal conviction for Golriz Gharaman could jeopardise her ability to practise law in New Zealand, a retired law professor says.</p>
        
            <p>The former Green MP admitted four shoplifting charges, relating to the theft of thousands of dollars' worth clothing, when she appeared in the Auckland District Court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Former law professor Bill Hodge told Morning Report Gharaman was not currently practising law.</p>
        
            <p>But if she were looking to renew her practising certificate, the Law Society would likely be concerned if she was convicted, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't wish to speak for them [Law Society], but her ability to appear in court in New Zealand after such a conviction, will, I think be prejudiced."</p>
        
            <p>Hodge said Gharaman's defence lawyers would be seeking a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the obvious goal for counsel ... She's already signalled this, that the sentence she'll be seeking will be a discharge without conviction and that is deemed to be an acquittal.</p>
        
            <p>"So she'll walk away with a clean sheet. That would be the best possible outcome for Golriz and her counsel."</p>
        
            <p>Hodge said it would be a difficult task for the judge.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, counsel is going to emphasise the big, big matter of mitigation. She's pleaded guilty. That's a great step forward. Is she suffering remorse? Obviously. Did she deny it and blame it on someone else? No. She's owned up to it. So that's all to her benefit."</p>
        
            <p>He said the defence counsel would likely say she had "already been punished and that a conviction would be disproportionate to the level of offending".</p>
        
            <p>The judge would look into more details that "the rest of us, looking from outside, might not see the entire picture," Hodge said.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old former politician was charged with stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx Store on 22 October and a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue in Newmarket on 22 December.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with two counts of shoplifting from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby - $5773 of items on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods on 23 December.</p>
