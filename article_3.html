            <p>CareVets Kilbirnie owner Nick Cooper said firefighters had entered the cattery to get the animals out.</p>
        
            <p>There had been about ten cats at the clinic the night of the fire, but staff don't know the exact number has they had not been able to get into the building where the computers and paperwork are, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the cats that were pulled out of the burning building were given treatment at the scene, before being taken to they city's after-hours veterinary clinic.</p>
        
            <p>"Our nurses put a couple of cats on oxygen straight away - the ambulance helped us, and they've recovered, and they've gone to our other clinic now," Cooper said.</p>
        
            <p>There are two apartments above the vet clinic, and at least six people were in the building the night of the fire, he said, but everyone got out safely.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper said he and his staff had been on site since 3am on Sunday, and he praised everyone who had helped respond: "Wellington After Hours Vet, Wellington Free [Ambulance], the fire service, all fantastic, absolutely - and my team of course,"</p>
        
            <p>He expected that once he is able to get into the building, he would know more how many of the cats are accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ central shift manager Murray Dunbar said eight appliances and four specialist support vehicles attended the fire, which was put out around 2.30am.</p>
        
            <p>The fire at CareVets Kilbirnie would be investigated, he said.</p>
