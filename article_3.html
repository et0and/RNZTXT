            <p>A beachside community in south Auckland will finally have its first pump track after the project was approved by the local board.</p>
        
            <p>Motivated by his three kids, Byron Scott has tried for years to build a pump track in the Maraetai and Beachlands area.</p>
        
            <p>He had the expertise through his company Trail Pro and the funds, but lacked the space to bring his dreams of a 360 square metre asphalt pump track to life.</p>
        
            <p>Until now.</p>
        
            <p>At Tuesday's meeting, the Franklin Local Board approved Constellation Park as the location for the pump track, and Trail Pro's contribution to cover 80 percent of the costs.</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson Angela Fulljames said the pump track was "much needed" as the community has not had a lot of great facilities delivered to it.</p>
        
            <p>"At the time the Super City formed, basically some were forgotten really, in terms of planning, that's for certain," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And so because there wasn't planning, there wasn't the understanding of the needs of facilities for the community."</p>
        
            <p>The board also agreed to cover additional funding to the project, to cover the build, tree planting and project management.</p>

            <p>The board also approved that the ownership of the pump track would be transferred to Auckland Council, for maintenance and responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>"I appreciate it is always difficult when you live somewhere and you see what you got, and that changes. Change is something you can actually rely on, nothing stays the same.</p>
        
            <p>"And Beachlands hasn't stayed the same."</p>
        
            <p>Scott's company has built asphalt pump tracks and bike tracks in schools and for councils, all over the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>"We just didn't have one in our community .. we have to travel to Papakura for a decent one," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And, our local skate park is very dilapidated and very basic; and needs an upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>"As a father of three young boys, I find it sad that my boys have no where to go to skate or bike."</p>
        
            <p>Trail Pro was putting up more than $100,000 for the project.</p>
        
            <p>Public consultation results from February showed 77 percent out of the 326 submitters strongly supported the project.</p>
        
            <p>Concerns from the 22 percent against the build were towards privacy, noise and anti-social behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>David Barker from council parks said they could mitigate privacy concerns by planting trees.</p>
        
            <p>"Anti-social behaviour, I would say that generally we find where we are getting activity in parks that's genuine, that tends to displace those who are in parks for anti-social acts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said pump tracks were fairly new in Auckland, with about six in the region, and a few temporary tracks.</p>
        
            <p>"They've always been well received by the communities we've put them into.</p>
        
            <p>"The noise, planting won't make a big impact on noise but we do find that with pump tracks its a similar noise to noise generated by a playground.</p>
        
            <p>It's an asphalt surface, so it won't be like a skate park where you get a big impact when a wheel hits concrete, he said.</p>
