            <p>Wairarapa Hospital did not have security guards on hand when a man attacked a visitor in the emergency department with a machete just before midnight on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>A 62-year-old man was taken into custody at the scene and is now facing a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>Police said in a statement the victim and the offender were known to each other, and the victim received moderate injuries.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, they said a weapon, which they confirmed was a machete, had been recovered.</p>
        
            <p>Association of Salaried Medical Specialists executive director Sarah Dalton told Midday Report she was "reasonably certain there was no security staff present in the ED at that time".</p>
        
            <p>The man was disarmed by a doctor, attendants, and the patient herself.</p>
        
            <p>She said there were a number of people in the ED, and it must have been "really frightening" and "really stressful" for everyone involved.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was not standard in small hospitals to have round-the-clock security in place in the ED.</p>
        
            <p>"They may have one or more security staff on-site, but they may be far away from the emergency department," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said staff at the hospital had told her this sort of thing "never used to happen", and it was "really shocking to longer-serving staff".</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the newer ones kind of expect the workplace to be violent, which is a really terrible thing to have to say about our hospitals."</p>
        
            <p>It was not just a matter of just beefing up security either, said Dalton.</p>
        
            <p>A number of the security staff the government [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/508195/some-security-staff-provided-to-hospital-eds-over-summer-not-properly-trained temporarily put in over summer were not specifically trained for hospital settings or in de-escalation, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"While they were able to be there as a visible presence, they weren't actually able to be of a lot of practical help."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Wairarapa group director operations Kieran McCann said in a statement, following the incident, that extra security was placed in the emergency department and staff were being supported.</p>
        
            <p>"We condemn all actions of violence against patients and staff. An investigation will take place into this incident to determine if there was anything which could have prevented it occurring."</p>
        
            <p>Security had been temporarily beefed up security over the Christmas period, with more security on-site. That had since been removed.</p>
        
            <p>But Dalton said even that was not enough.</p>
        
            <p>"We need better than that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Those temporary staff were not trained in a hospital setting or de-escalation or restraint, she said, so they would not have been "a practical help" if an incident occurred.</p>
        
            <p>She said a proper review was needed, and specific funding for ED security.</p>
