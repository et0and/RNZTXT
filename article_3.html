            <p>A wild day of weather has led to flooding in Tararua District and road closures on the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury Police are urging motorists to consider delaying unnecessary travel this afternoon, with conditions poor around the region.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 73 is closed from Springfield to Castle Hill, with numerous vehicles reported stuck at Castle Hill and the Lake Lyndon area, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The Tararua District town of Pahiatua has experienced flooding, with the mayor saying it cut off some houses and closed roads.</p>
        
            <p>Other alpine areas are also experiencing heavy snowfall.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere across the country there have been reports of surface flooding and snow.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers are urged to use NZTA's Journey Planner before hitting the road in some regions.</p>

            <p>Reduced speed limits are also in place on the Auckland Harbour Bridge because of strong gusts of wind.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency said vehicles travelling over the bridge need to take care, especially high-sided ones and motorbikes.</p>
        
            <p>It said there may also be lane reductions and motorists should consider using the Western Ring Road - Highways 16 and 18 - as an alternative route.</p>
