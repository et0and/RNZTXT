            <p>A lockdown of several schools in Taupō has ended though police say they are still searching for a "person of interest".</p>
        
            <p>Police say while schools are out of lockdown, they will continue to have an increased presence in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons are in place at both ends of Arthur Crescent and Invergarry Road.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō's Tauhara College was among those in lockdown and its principal Ben Hancock said all students, staff and other people on site were accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>"Most students did extremely well and responded to instructions. A notice will be going out to parents/caregivers tonight to provide some more information about our emergency lockdown procedures.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to personally thank you for your support and trust during this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier the school said whānau interviews had been postponed and it had been in contact with the bus company to ensure there would be buses for students who needed them after the lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the public were to avoid the Hilltop area and cordons were in place.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons are in place on multiple streets in the area, and schools have been placed into lockdown as a precaution. More information will be released when we are in a position to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Intermediate School, Tauhara Primary School and Lake Taupō Christian College said they were also out of lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Hospital said it was not in lockdown and patients and staff were safe.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the hospital is within the cordons as police are dealing with an incident in the area. If anyone is needing to go to the hospital, Police are allowing people through."</p>
        
            <p>Police were asking all residents to stay inside and contact them on 111 and reference event number P057866209 if they see anything of concern.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
