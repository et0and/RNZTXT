            <p>A Porirua high school has raised more than $72,000 towards a trip to Europe - the first time the school has ever planned a trip to the continent.</p>
        
            <p>Mana College, which in a low socio-economic area, has been fundraising since September. Twenty students have been working to raise the $165,000 needed to go to Germany, the Netherlands, France and Denmark for 16 days in April 2025.</p>
        
            <p>German teacher Elin Lorenzen said even when the students were coming home from cleaning a stadium after an event at 2am, they asked what else they could do to raise the money.</p>
        
            <p>"These students and their whānau are such a great example of the beautiful Porirua community, caring for one another, showing up and working hard," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The students have been doing everything they can to fundraise - raffles, bake sales, sausage sizzles, hangi, hosting quiz nights, comedy nights and discos.</p>
        
            <p>Mana College added German as a subject as a trial four years ago. Lorenzen said the students embraced the language and culture with so much manaakitanga and interest that it now had a year 10, 11 and 12 class.</p>
        
            <p>"After all the love, manaakitanga, curiosity and care the students have shown towards German culture and language - how could I not take them to the country they have been learning so passionately about?"</p>
        
            <p>She said she wanted to thank Mana College.</p>
        
            <p>"The school could've easily said no," Lorenzen said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that speaks to how supportive Mana College really is, and wanting to see their students to flourish and succeed."</p>
        
            <p>Mana College year 13 dean Lana McLaughlin-Khan said they wanted to fundraise so it was not too big of a financial stress for any of the students and their whānau.</p>
        
            <p>She said even students that were not going on the trip had been doing hours of work to support the students that were.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant principal Jeff Chapman said the students had all embodied Mana College's values of manaakitanga, ako (learn, teach), ngakau (determination, perseverance) and aspire.</p>
        
            <p>He said one student, Blade, had really impressed him in terms of his entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"He's gone out there, he's been on GoFundMe, he's knocked on people's doors asking to do odd jobs," Chapman said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's raised so much money that now he's giving it away to the rest of the students."</p>
        
            <p>"We're working so hard so we can get this amazing experience," student León said.</p>
        
            <p>It has not just been about going to Europe next year for one student - Darcy said he was just having fun working with the other students and making new friends.</p>
        
            <p>With one year left to go, Mana College is only $93,000 away from their goal.</p>
        
            <p>They opened a GiveALittle page on Saturday, and raised more than $500 in two days.</p>
