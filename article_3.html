            <p>The Auditor-General has decided to inquire into how ministerial conflicts of interest were identified and managed in relation to fast-track projects.</p>
        
            <p>The Cabinet Manual outlines the expectations for managing these conflicts, and it is important that there are systems to ensure that ministers promptly identify all potential conflicts (including perceived conflicts) and take sufficient steps to appropriately manage them, the office of the Auditor-General said.</p>
        
            <p>The office will not make any public comment while work is under way, and will publish a report once it has completed the inquiry, and the report has been tabled in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>... More to come</p>
