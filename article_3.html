            <p>Wellington City Councillor Ray Chung has written to Local Government Minister Simeon Brown asking for an early election.</p>
        
            <p>Chung, who has confirmed his intention to run for mayor at the next scheduled election in 2025, said a commissioner would be too expensive and could remain in place for years. He said ideally an election would be held in the next three months.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors have been meeting urgently to discuss the city's long-term plan, amid talk of the government replacing them with commissioners.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Iona Pannett said Wellington councillors had "high level" discussions on Wednesday, she had confidence in the mayor and the government's suggestion of intervening was unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown is to meet with Mayor Tory Whanau over the concerns. He was still waiting on advice from the Department of Internal Affairs, which he said he had requested with urgency.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Local Government Minister Simeon Brown told media he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him and thresholds to intervene in the city council, after the council voted last Thursday to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Former Local Government New Zealand president Stuart Crosby told RNZ the systemic problems of trust between Wellington City Council's executive and its elected members mean it is "incredibly close" to needing intervention.</p>
