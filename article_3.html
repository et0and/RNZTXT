            <p>It has been quite the year for screen actor and filmmaker Chelsie Preston Crayford.</p>
        
            <p>A week ago she finished filming her first feature film Caterpillar, a work she has directed and been writing for six years.</p>
        
            <p>Preston Crayford told Culture 101 that it was exciting to be going into the post-production phase of the film, and that there had been a huge change in pace between the writing and filming processes.</p>
        
            <p>"This one took me five years to write, you know, maybe six. And then suddenly you need to make it in five weeks," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very strange. But that's why it's such a magical and wonderful medium, because you can't do it by yourself.</p>
        
            <p>"I almost lost my mind in those five years because I kept thinking 'no one wants to make a movie to sit in a room by themselves for five years,'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>Then there was her role in almost every peopled frame of the now streaming TVNZ crime drama A Remarkable Place to Die.</p>
        
            <p>Preston Crayford played the show’s lead Detective Anais Mallory, and only played support to Queenstown’s remarkable scenery.</p>
        
            <p>It was a "delight" to work on the show, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had never worked for Screentime before. And I had heard that it really feels like a family, and it did. They're such good people and they attract such great people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a make or break if the people you're working with are really great," Preston Crayford said.</p>
        
            <p>Her role in the show had been a lot of work, she added.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a big learning curve, learning that much dialogue."</p>
        
            <p>She was also on screen this year in a rather different role: an unhinged journalist in Dark City: The Cleaner on Neon, making Cohen Holloway’s serial killer life difficult. </p>
        
            <p>Somehow through all that was the parenting of a nine-year-old daughter Olive in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland with a partner whose own career had also been on a big upward trajectory, Guy Montgomery.</p>
        
            <p>No wonder that when Culture 101 got in touch with Chelsie she was relieved to hear we wanted to principally talk not about her but her own cultural favourites:</p>
        
            <p>Chelsie Preston Crayford's Fast Favourites</p>
        
            <p>Juan Bullion hats </p>
        
            <p>"Designed by my amazing e hoa Briar Vivian. Briar is also a talented costume designer, she designed my film Caterpillar and also recently won a NZ TV award for Far North while she was at it. These hats are like nothing else, you have almost definitely seen one out in the wild and thought 'shit that's a cool hat'."</p>
        
            <p>Coco Solid's Patreon and newsletter</p>
        
            <p>"Coco Solid aka Jessica Hansell is one of the most vital and refreshing voices in Aotearoa. Many of you will know her so I will be preaching to the converted but she is multi-disciplinarian, an author, screenwriter, animator, filmmaker, musician, scholar, activist - actually too many slashes to list. Anytime I encounter her work I am grateful I did."</p>
        
            <p>Indigenous small businesses</p>
        
            <p>"In light of the Treaty Principles Bill, I think it's crucial to support Māori voices in every way we can. If you are wondering where to do your Christmas shopping these are my favourite shops in all of Aotearoa, who stock and support work from Māori artists from all over the Mōtu: Moana Fresh and Kaukau. Both incredible stores with very important kaupapa. Buy from them not Temu. And most importantly, make a submission on the Treaty Principles Bill."</p>
        
            <p>Preserved Identity</p>
        
            <p>"An amazing online store that sells Palestinian wares, from Medjool dates to gorgeous and informative kids books to exquisitely made shoes. Plus every order placed they donate a meal to children in need."</p>
        
            <p>Viva Mexico</p>
        
            <p>"We all know cooking is an art, and when I was shooting in Pōneke I was lucky enough to eat at Viva Mexico, which was the most delicious and authentic Mexican food I've ever had. The chef David Da'Orta is a culinary master, and for a limited time I believe he is offering cooking classes which would make an excellent Christmas gift. My mouth is watering just thinking about this kai."</p>
        
            <p> Ana Chaya Scotney</p>
        
            <p>"A tāonga with a soulful and miraculous voice. Like Coco, her artistry can't be contained by one discipline but if you see she has made something you should run not walk." </p>
        
            <p>Jonathan Crayford</p>
        
            <p>"I am lucky that I get to collaborate with my extremely talented dad on the soundtrack of Caterpillar; we are about to begin this work, so in honour of that, the song I have to share with you is one from his 2010 album Dark Light, enjoy!"</p>
