            <p>New Zealand have had a shocking opening day on the Sydney leg of Sail GP, failing to make tomorrow's final.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Foils finished eighth and seventh in the first two races on Sydney Harbour and then finished last in the final two races after striking mechanical problems.</p>
        
            <p>They came off their foils after a skirmish when a chance of finishing just behind the top three in the third race and then suffered a penalty before race four.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, they had to start behind the other boats, ending up off their foils, limping in the middle of the course.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Burling's crew, who struggled at the start of all four races, ended the day with just seven points in ninth place.</p>
        
            <p>Australia, who won the final two races, lead the Sydney leg with 37 points, from Great Britain, on 32 and Switzerland on 31. The Swiss won the opening race before the British edged out the Australians in the second.</p>
        
            <p>Australian skipper Tom Slingsby was pleased with his boat's starts on Saturday, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what's going on with our starts, but it's all sort of gelling," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You need a bit of luck and we've had a bit of luck. Little gaps have opened up at the right time. Sometimes it just clicks. And we're in a little purple patch at the moment. We hope we can continue it on."</p>
        
            <p>France, who were unable to race in the first two stops of the season because of issues with their boat, made a strong return to the fleet and ended the day fourth in the standings.</p>
        
            <p>"It was wonderful, honestly," said helmsman Quentin Delapierre.</p>
        
            <p>There are two races on Sunday before the top three teams contest the final.</p>
