            <p>While the game is over, the feud is far from dead.</p>
        
            <p>But the All Blacks have bragging rights for now, picking up a hard-fought 23-13 win over Ireland in Dublin this morning.</p>
        
            <p>And it didn't take long for the shade to be thrown, as New Zealand revel in knocking over their new great rivals.</p>
        
            <p>The clash had been eagerly anticipated due to the animosity between players on both camps, with Rieko Ioane the centre of the drama in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>Ioane was seen exchanging heated words with Kiwi-born Bundee Aki after the final whistle, seemingly suggesting Aki look at the scoreboard.</p>
        
            <p>Ioane then posted on Instagram images of the win, accompanied with the caption, 'put that in your book'.</p>
        
            <p>The jab is aimed squarely at Ireland first-five Johnny Sexton, who did not play in this morning's loss.</p>
        
            <p>Sexton went after Ioane in his autobiography, citing Ioane's fulltime reaction in Ireland's World Cup quarterfinal loss.</p>
        
            <p>"So much for the All Blacks' famous "no d…heads" policy. So much for their humility. I walk after Ioane and call him a fake-humble f…er. It doesn't look great, me having a go at one of them just after we've lost. But I can't be expected to ignore that," Sexton wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Ioane clapped back with an Instagram story of himself and Sexton during the All Blacks' 28-24 win, with the song "Zombie" playing.</p>
        
            <p>The anthem was recently adopted by Irish fans, however, Ioane was implying to Sexton the World Cup result was still "in your head".</p>
        
            <p>Ioane also led a visceral rendition of "Kapa o Pango" before kick off.</p>
        
            <p>"When it comes to game days, I don't let the emotion dictate my week. I love the spectacle of rugby and what I can influence to create. Feelings were hurt, stuff was said. I'm just here to play footy and win games," he told Sky Sport.</p>
