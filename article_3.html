            <p>RNZ has made contact with Hone Kay-Selwyn's whānau, who refused to comment, saying: "Don told us, in time of raru (conflict), when the media call, say 'no comment'. So 'no comment'."</p>
        
            <p>Robert Horne was shot by the 31-year-old Killer Beez gang member on Sunday night while leaving a car on Ponsonby Road.</p>
        
            <p>Kay-Selwyn was found dead at a rural property in Taupō on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Horne's family have said on social media the 33-year-old's body is now home at Parawera Marae, with whānau welcome to attend a service there this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Police say at this stage they believe the two men did not know each other.</p>
