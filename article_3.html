            <p>The fishing spot where two men went missing this week is notorious among locals as a danger zone.</p>
        
            <p>The men were fishing near rocks at The Gap, near Taiharuru in Northland on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>They were reported missing just before midnight after they failed to return home.</p>
        
            <p>On its website, WhangƒÅrei District Council described The Gap as a "narrow cleft in the rocks", which could be a "spectacular sight when the sea is rough".</p>
        
            <p>It is known as a good fishing spot, especially for snapper, but can be dangerous when there are large swells - as there were on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A photo taken in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam in 2015 showed waves pounding through The Gap and hammering the beach.</p>
        
            <p>One local fisherman, who did not want to be named out of respect for the missing men, said the fishing spot could be treacherous in high seas.</p>
        
            <p>"Locals know you have to respect The Gap."</p>
        
            <p>In 2013, a fisherman died at The Gap after he and two friends were swept off the rocks and into the sea.</p>
        
            <p>Police said on Thursday evening that despite ongoing search efforts, the men remained missing.</p>
        
            <p>Police Search and Rescue, along with LandSAR volunteers, had searched the coastline throughout the day, while the Eagle helicopter had conducted an aerial search.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard's Circa Rescue vessel and Northland Coastguard Air Patrol had also been assisting, and Coastguard volunteers had been searching the shoreline from the water.</p>
        
            <p>Police said search efforts would continue.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to assess the situation moving forward and call on assistance from additional resources and agencies as appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are also keeping in contact with the men's families to provide them with updates and our thoughts remain with them at this time."</p>
