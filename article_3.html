            <p>The world's oldest person, Japanese woman Tomiko Itooka, has died aged 116, the city where she lived, Ashiya, announced on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Itooka, who had four children and five grandchildren, died on 29 December at a nursing home where she resided since 2019, the southern city's mayor said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>She was born on May 23, 1908 in the commercial hub of Osaka, near Ashiya- four months before the Ford Model T was launched in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Itooka was recognised as the oldest person in the world after the August 2024 death of Spain's Maria Branyas Morera at age 117.</p>
        
            <p>"Ms Itooka gave us courage and hope through her long life," Ashiya's 27-year-old mayor Ryosuke Takashima said in the statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank her for it."</p>
        
            <p>Itooka, who was one of three siblings, lived through world wars and pandemics as well as technological breakthroughs.</p>
        
            <p>As a student, she played volleyball.</p>
        
            <p>In her older age, Itooka enjoyed bananas and Calpis, a milky soft drink popular in Japan, according to the mayor's statement.</p>
        
            <p>Women typically enjoy longevity in Japan, but the country is facing a worsening demographic crisis as its expanding elderly population leads to soaring medical and welfare costs, with a shrinking labour force to pay for it.</p>
        
            <p>As of September, Japan counted more than 95,000 people who were 100 or older - 88 percent of whom were women.</p>
        
            <p>Of the country's 124 million people, nearly a third are 65 or older.</p>
