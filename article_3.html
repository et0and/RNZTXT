            <p>A manager of one of the Lower Hutt stores damaged in Tuesday's severe weather event has described how the wind "sucked the guts" out of his store.</p>
        
            <p>A big clean-up is under way in the area after a thunderstorm roared through yesterday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Lighting Direct manager Damian Townsend said he was standing at the back of the premises when there was a lot of noise and the wall started to collapse between him and the premises, Holy Bagels, next door.</p>
        
            <p>"There was this massive rumble and a whole lot of noise and all of a sudden it sounded like the roof was coming off," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The wall was the first thing to go and injured a customer at the bagel shop, who received a head injury, he said.</p>

            <p>Townsend described the event as 15 minutes of chaos and said his brain was trying to process what was going on.</p>
        
            <p>He said he could not make out what was happening so he went to the middle of the store and watched as all the glass blew out of the front of the store.</p>
        
            <p>"That was the front doors, glass smashing, glass coming inside and outside so it was this real, like, vortex of swirling motion and kind of sucking, like it was just sucking the guts out of the store."</p>
        
            <p>Townsend watched as the front of the building got taken away and said he could see the debris flying around, up into the air.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest thing that would stay with him was the roar and sound of the weather, there was thunder and lightning but the intense wind sound was hard to describe, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Lighting Direct shop had had around the clock security and the premises was boarded up, but "amazingly" all the lighting was all intact, Townsend said.</p>

            <p>A couple of streets away, Commonsense Organics never shut yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>That was despite the window being blown out, glass smashed and a fence being blown over.</p>
        
            <p>The window was boarded up last night and the shop was busy this morning with tradies fixing problems.</p>
        
            <p>Commonsense Organics manager Tori Buttle said the customers had been "really sweet" about the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been really concerned and we've had people come over just to see if we're okay and we had a lot of that yesterday too so that was really nice," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Buttle said it was hectic yesterday and that she and her staff were "all pretty freaked out" by it, but the team at her shop were feeling much better today.</p>
