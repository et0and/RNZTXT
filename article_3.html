            <p>Leaders in the performing arts industry are shocked and worried following news the capital's only creative polytech campus could close its doors.</p>
        
            <p>The cash-strapped national polytechnic organisation Te Pūkenga is looking at closing Te Kāhui Auaha which opened just seven years ago and also serves as a performance venue.</p>
        
            <p>Whitireia and WelTec - which is part of Te Pūkenga and runs Te Kāhui Auaha - said the review of the central city campus was partly due to the roll dropping from 600 in 2018 to fewer than 200 now.</p>
        
            <p>Ruby Carter studied a Bachelor of Creativity at the institute between 2019 and 2021, and said news the campus could close came out of the blue.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I was shocked," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Beyond its purpose as a school, and I think it's a very necessary school - despite its issues it's a really good programme - we need more venues in Wellington for the arts, and Te Auaha is one of the best and well-equipped venues in Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>Carter said during her studies there was a feeling the programme was "going downhill", and staffing was a problem.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like our tutors weren't necessarily that supported by the higher ups. Definitely it felt like the higher ups prioritised outside users of the space over students."</p>
        
            <p>She hoped the events space, called Te Auaha, would still be available for the creative community even if the campus closed.</p>
        
            <p>So did Lauren Whitney, the chief executive of the Comedy Trust which runs the New Zealand International Comedy Festival.</p>
        
            <p>Te Auaha was the festival's heart, and 10,000 people were expected through its doors for this year's performances, Whitney said.</p>
        
            <p>What happens beyond is now unknown. But Whitney was not only worried for the future of the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm also concerned for the wider performing arts industry, I mean this affects not just comedy, it's affecting theatre, dance, live music," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge loss of having students in that space, but also ... what Te Auaha offers to Wellington's economy through those students."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's creative scene was an "ecosystem" and removing a key part would have a big impact on the city as the creative capital, she said.</p>

            <p>The 2025 season of the Fringe Festival is just 10 days away, and has 35 shows booked at the venue.</p>
        
            <p>Festival director Vanessa Stacey said the campus fostered great talent.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had the pleasure of hosting a lot of recent grads from Te Auaha's amazing arts programmes, and helping those artists ... take their first steps into their arts practice.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really hoping it will continue to support those artists and have a great space for artists to train and also present their work."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Councillor Teri O'Neill heads up the social, cultural and economic committee, and said there was no way the creative capital should shut the doors on the people who make it so special.</p>
        
            <p>As leaders, the council needed to take a stronger approach with government and advocating for artists, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"To cut an institution like this will further put the employees and the students in hardship, and I would really like to see this coalition government investing, not cutting, in services like these."</p>
        
            <p>Whitireia and WelTec executive director Mark Oldershaw declined an interview with RNZ. In a statement he said closing the campus was just one consideration, and no decisions had been made.</p>
        
            <p>This year's courses will run as normal, beginning 24 February.</p>
