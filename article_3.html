            <p>US space agency Nasa confirmed that an object that crashed into a home in Florida earlier this month was part of the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
        
            <p>The metal object was jettisoned from the orbiting outpost in March 2021, Nasa said after analysing the sample at the Kennedy Space Centre.</p>
        
            <p>The 0.7kg metal object tore through two layers of ceiling after re-entering Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>Homeowner Alejandro Otero said his son was nearly injured by the impact.</p>
        
            <p>Nasa said the object was part of some 2.6 tonnes of hardware that was dumped by the station after it had new lithium-ion batteries installed.</p>
        
            <p>"The hardware was expected to fully burn up during entry through Earth's atmosphere on March 8, 2024. However, a piece of hardware survived and impacted a home in Naples, Florida," the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>The debris was determined to be part of a stanchion used to mount batteries on a cargo pallet.</p>
        
            <p>The object, made from metal alloy Inconel, has dimensions of 10.1cm by 4cm.</p>
        
            <p>Hello. Looks like one of those pieces missed Ft Myers and landed in my house in Naples. Tore through the roof and went  thru 2 floors. Almost his my son. Can you please assist with getting NASA to connect with me? Iâ€™ve left messages and emails without a response. pic.twitter.com/Yi29f3EwyV</p>
        
            <p>Otero told CBS affiliate Wink-TV that the device created a "tremendous sound" as it blasted into his home.</p>
        
            <p>"It almost hit my son. He was two rooms over and heard it all," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage," Otero continued.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super grateful that nobody got hurt."</p>
        
            <p>According to Nasa, the ISS will "perform a detailed investigation" on how the debris survived burn-up.</p>
        
            <p>Space junk has been a growing problem. Earlier this month, sky watchers in California watched mysterious golden streaks moving through the night sky.</p>
        
            <p>US officials later determined that the light show was caused by burning debris from a Chinese rocket re-entering earth's orbit.</p>
        
            <p>In February, a Chinese satellite known as "Object K" burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere over Hawaii.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, a barnacle-covered giant metal dome found on a Western Australian beach was identified as a component of an Indian rocket. There are plans to display it alongside chunks of Nasa's Skylab, which crashed in Australia in 1979.</p>
