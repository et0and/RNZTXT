            <p>One of Aotearoa's most accomplished musicians hopes to recruit 10,000 people to reclaim the haka world record.</p>
        
            <p>France holds the current Guiness World Record for the largest haka, which it claimed in 2014 with a group of 4028 people.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Hinewehi Mohi will host a new record attempt at Auckland's Eden Park on 29 September.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't realise the French still held the Guiness World Record for the largest haka, so we felt it would be a wonderful opportunity to bring people together in the spirit of kotahitanga," she told RNZ at the campaign's launch event in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"We will form on the pitch here at Eden Park to do the haka, Ka Mate, and perform our hearts out."</p>
        
            <p>The record attempt would also raise money for Mohi's Raukatauri Music Therapy Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"It has gotten huger and huger... We've just been overwhelmed by the donations and support," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Mohi wasn't impressed by France's take on the haka.</p>
        
            <p>"If you go onto the Guiness World Record website and see the haka performed in 2014... You see the importance of bringing back the cultural integrity of the haka," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be controversial... But it is going to be a wonderful thing to bring it home."</p>
        
            <p>She said the haka, and particularly Ka Mate, was a cultural icon for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's really important to bring the mana of the world record back to Aotearoa, because it is undeniably us," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need 4,029 to break the current record... [But] we're aiming to have 10,000 people. We want to pack out the pitch of Eden Park."</p>
        
            <p>The event is sponsored by Auckland Council through its economic and cultural development agency Tātaki Auckland Unlimited.</p>
        
            <p>Tātaki's Director for Māori Outcomes, Helen Te Hira, said anyone could take part in the record attempt - for a small fee.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a fee to participate but that fee is being kept very low and it goes towards [the music therapy centre]," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kapa haka experience was not a prerequisite and beginners were welcome.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole intent is based on accessibility. There'll be resources on the website, [or] you just need to watch an All Blacks game," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't have to be on the pitch, you'll be able to participate online. Everyone is welcome, you don't have to have the perfect haka stance."</p>
