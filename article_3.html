            <p>The government is declining to commit to its pre-election promise to put more beds and services into Dunedin's new hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party said last year it would restore 23 beds, two operating theatres and a high-tech scanner, that $90 million of emergency cost-saving cuts to the project had excised.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti, asked by RNZ if he would follow through on what National had estimated was a $30 million pledge, in a statement said only: "This is one of a number of large and complex health infrastructure projects on which I continue to receive advice. I look forward to travelling to Dunedin in the coming weeks to view the project for myself."</p>
        
            <p>The whole project is currently budgeted at $1.59 billion, though this does not appear to include almost $100m for information technology systems for stage one, the outpatients block.</p>
        
            <p>Piling at stage one is well advanced, suggesting any redesign at this stage is unlikely.</p>
        
            <p>Reti in December said he was awaiting advice about the full portfolio of health infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Te Whatu Ora now said it sent him a draft nationwide investment plan and asset management strategy in December, within deadline.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the minister's feedback, the documents will then be finalised, and a Cabinet paper prepared to seek Cabinet's approval," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Then the documents would be released publicly.</p>
        
            <p>It comes four years after the first draft of a national asset management plan was released to fanfare by the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>Finalising the plan and strategy has faced delay upon delay, amid the sweeping health reforms.</p>
        
            <p>How they are now implemented will fall to new national and regional infrastructure teams.</p>
        
            <p>The government was told last July the new set-up had already paid dividends of better governance and delivery structures at the three huge hospital redevelopments in Dunedin, WhangƒÅrei and Nelson.</p>
