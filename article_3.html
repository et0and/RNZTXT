        <h2>South Korea votes to impeach president - for second time in a fortnight</h2>

            <p>A majority of South Korea's parliament voted on Friday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Han has been acting president since President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on 14 December over his short-lived imposition of martial law on 3 December, and his presidential powers were suspended.</p>
        
            <p>After Han's impeachment, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is next in line to assume the acting presidency, according to South Korean law.</p>
        
            <p>Some 192 lawmakers voted to impeach Han out of the 300-member parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The main opposition Democratic Party (DP), which controls parliament, decided to impeach Han after he did not immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies at the Constitutional Court.</p>
        
            <p>The DP-controlled parliament backed three nominees on Thursday, but Han said he would not formally appoint them unless there was bipartisan agreement on the appointments.</p>
        
            <p>There has been disagreement between the ruling and opposition parties and some constitutional scholars over whether a simple majority or a two-thirds vote is needed to impeach the acting president.</p>
        
            <p>However, parliament speaker Woo Won-shik, who is from the DP, said only a simple majority was needed to impeach Han.</p>
        
            <p>If Han is suspended, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will assume the acting presidency by law.</p>
        
            <p>Lee's pledge to remove Han came minutes after Choi warned that impeaching the acting president would seriously damage the country's economic credibility and asked political parties to withdraw the plan.</p>
        
            <p>"The economy and the people's livelihoods are walking on thin ice under a national state of emergency and it cannot cope any greater political uncertainty that will result from another acting president assuming the acting presidency," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Choi spoke for the country's cabinet, flanked by ministers.</p>
        
            <p>The South Korean won weakened to a fresh low of 1,486.7 per dollar on Friday, the weakest since March 2009, as analysts said there was little to reverse the negative sentiment stemming from the political uncertainty.</p>
        
            <p>The vote to determine Han's fate comes on the same day the Constitutional Court held its first hearing in a case reviewing whether to overturn the impeachment and reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking for the court in a preparatory hearing, Justice Cheong Hyung-sik said the court will move swiftly on the case considering its gravity, denying a request by Yoon's lawyers for a postponement in proceedings to better prepare the case.</p>
        
            <p>In the hearing that wrapped up under an hour, the court set the next hearing for 3 January.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon Kap-keun, one of the lawyers representing the impeached president, later told reporters the legal team is still adding members and that Yoon himself plans to appear in person in the future.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing follows weeks of defiance by Yoon ignoring requests by the court to submit documents as well as summons by investigators in a separate criminal case over his martial law declaration.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon was not required to attend Friday's hearing. If he ousted, a new presidential election would be held within 60 days.</p>
        
            <p>The events following the 3 December martial law declaration have plunged the country into its gravest political crisis since 1987, when widespread protests forced the ruling party of former military generals into accepting a constitutional amendment bringing in direct, popular vote to elect the president.</p>
        
            <p>The turmoil has also spilled over into financial markets.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon shocked the country and the world with a late-night announcement that he was imposing martial law to overcome political deadlock and root out "anti-state forces".</p>
        
            <p>The military deployed special forces to the national assembly, the election commission, and the office of a liberal YouTube commentator.</p>
        
            <p>It also issued orders banning activity by parliament and political parties, as well as calling for government control of the media.</p>
        
            <p>But within hours 190 lawmakers had defied the cordons of troops and police and voted against Yoon's order. About six hours after his initial decree, Yoon rescinded the order.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon and senior members of his administration also face criminal investigations for insurrection.</p>
