            <p>The Black Foils have won their fifth SailGP event of the season at the New York Sail Grand Prix - guaranteeing their place in next month's three-boat $2 million grand final in San Francisco.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand extended their overall Season 4 Championship lead and sit on 93 points, Australia moved into second place with 78, and Spain are third with 76 points.</p>
        
            <p>It was another masterclass from skipper Peter Burling, who expertly guided the Black Foils in a three-boat shoot-out, crossing the line ahead of the Canadians, and Emirates GBR, who came third.</p>
        
            <p>A blistering start saw all three teams jostle in a frantic drag race to Mark 1, but it was New Zealand which pushed Emirates GBR and Canada high and wide to secure the all-important inside line.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis went on to push their ride height to the limit, sailing faster and higher than both other teams.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has five wins out of 12 events and will head to San Francisco in three weeks for the winner takes all grand final showdown.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking after racing, Burling said it felt good to secure one of the three spots in San Francisco.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew we had a long road ahead of us to be top of the leaderboard going to the grand final, missing an event, not only the points side of things but just the lack of training time.</p>
        
            <p>"This group's done less training time than anyone else in the whole league this season. So it's been a tough season but to charge through that and get these wins on the board is something we're super proud of."</p>
        
            <p>SailGP returns to San Francisco for the Season 4-defining Grand Final on 13-14 July.</p>
