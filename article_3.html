            <p>The family of a Kiwi woman allegedly murdered by her partner before he killed himself in Melbourne are remembering her as a "vibrant, loving soul" and a "devoted mother".</p>
        
            <p>Rachel McKenna, 35, was found dead at an address in the north-west suburb of Ascot vale at around 4pm last Friday, The Daily Mail reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe she was murdered by her partner, who then fled the scene.</p>
        
            <p>He was found critically injured on the side of the Princes Freeway, where he died around two hours after McKenna's body was discovered, according to The Daily Mail.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts are shattered by the loss of beautiful Rachel McKenna, our lovely niece," Terry McKenna wrote in a tribute on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"Rachel was a vibrant, loving soul, a devoted mother to Leo, and a light in so many lives.</p>
        
            <p>"Something must be done to stop violence against women."</p>
        
            <p>McKenna's younger sister Meg Trotter described her death as an "unnecessary tragedy, one we never dreamed would impact our family".</p>
        
            <p>"She was generous, vibrant, loyal, and looked forward to many adventures with her precious son."</p>
        
            <p>Trotter reiterated Terry McKenna's sentiments, saying "something must be done to stop violence against women in this country".</p>
        
            <p>"We love you forever, our beautiful Rach."</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched in relation to McKenna's death.</p>
        
            <p>Her brother-in-law has set up a Gofundme page to raise money to help support her seven-year-old son's future, as well as cover the costs of her memorial.</p>

            <p>He was charged with one count each of attempted murder adn common assault, and appeared in court on 20 January.</p>
