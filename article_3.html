            <p>On 1 November 1944, 733 Polish refugee children arrived at their new home - a former POW camp. This weekend, about 20 are back.</p>
        
            <p>Just as they did 80 years ago, Pahīatua residents lined the lower North Island town's streets on Friday to bid an emotional tribute to people forever known as the "Polish children".</p>
        
            <p>Back then it was a welcome for those who had escaped the horrors of World War II and the Soviet invasion of Poland to start a new life in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The surviving Polish children are now in their 80s and 90s and Friday's tribute brought out huge emotion.</p>
        
            <p>On 1 November 1944, 733 Polish refugee children and about 100 caregivers got off the train from Wellington and were driven to their new home, a former POW camp repurposed as a base for them.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend about 20 are returning and, along with their families, they were driven through the town on the same route.</p>
        
            <p>Locals waved Polish flags and carried signs saying "welcome home", before Dave Dobbyn serenaded them with the song of the same name at an afternoon concert.</p>
        
            <p>Witold Powierza, 87, was among the returning children, making the trip from Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>He said the drive through town was overwhelming.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very emotional, let's put it that way ... We've come back every five years to say thanks. It's a wonderful, wonderful thing," he said.</p>

            <p>"I went to school here, towards the end before the camp broke up. I carry a lot of good memories, excellent memories.</p>
        
            <p>"I can see the town's not as bustling as it used to be. That's what happens, but there're far more children around."</p>
        
            <p>Among those children were pupils from Pahīatua School, who waved mini Polish flags on the side of the road.</p>
        
            <p>They said they had learned about the Polish camp and wanted to pay tribute to the surviving former refugees by welcoming them back.</p>
        
            <p>Ninety-five-year-old Stefan Wisniewski now lives in Wellington and returned to Pahīatua with his family.</p>

            <p>"It was out of this world. How wonderful. I almost felt like crying," he said of the drive through town.</p>
        
            <p>Wisniewski spent about a year at the camp before moving to high school in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course we couldn't speak English. None of us could understand what was going on. We said yes to everything instead of maybe saying no."</p>
        
            <p>Aroha Payne was among those lining the route from the railway station into town.</p>

            <p>"The Polish people are part of Pahīatua's history. We serve that history and we serve those people.</p>
        
            <p>"They're getting older. It should be more special as it goes on. We just want to acknowledge them."</p>
        
            <p>That acknowledgement means the world to the Polish children, such as 91-year-old Mietek Glowacki, who also flew in from Australia to join the convoy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unbelievable. It really touched my heart. We didn't expect that. It was beautiful.</p>

            <p>"My son was sitting next to me and he said: 'Dad, I'm glad I came with you', and my daughter was in the back and she said: 'I'm the same'.</p>
        
            <p>"I did not expect a welcome like that."</p>
        
            <p>Glowacki has good memories of the town, such as getting the chance to earn two shillings by bowling out the camp sergeant major's son at cricket practice.</p>
        
            <p>The children's camp, which was called Little Poland, is long gone, although the surviving Polish children and their families on Friday evening visited the site, which is now an aerodrome, to unveil a new memorial plaque.</p>
        
            <p>Eightieth anniversary celebrations wrap up on Sunday.</p>
