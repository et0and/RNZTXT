            <p>The curse of the capital continues.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina have scored another famous win over the All Blacks, just the third in their history.</p>
        
            <p>It was a tit-for-tat affair in Wellington, but it was veteran Agust√≠n Creevy's strike late in the game which sealed the victory 38-30.</p>
        
            <p>Creevy, who was in tears at fulltime, told Sky Sport it is a special day for Argentine rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"It was amazing, we dominated the whole game, this was for the nation. Now we want to win next week."</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Pablo Matera said the win was hard earned.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a great week, we had a plan, and we stuck to the plan even when the score was not in our favour."</p>
        
            <p>Anton Lienert-Brown was sensational at centre, Damian McKenzie produced some magic moments, and Sam Darry had a dazzling debut but it was not enough.</p>
        
            <p>Ardie Savea conceded it was hugely disappointing.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't our night tonight. They put us under pressure and we couldn't hold with them. They suffocated us and we couldn't find the answers. That's not All Black standard."</p>
        
            <p>The result marks the first loss of Scott Robertson's tenure, and will continue to erode the aura of the All Blacks in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>With Argentina conceding an early 6-1 penalty count, the All Blacks cashed in through the boot of McKenzie to put first points on the board.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after it was Sam Darry on debut, the lock looming up to catch an ugly bounce and bang it over the chalk for the opener.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie freed up Beauden Barrett on the back of a chip and chase before the fullback hoofed it infield for the pack of All Black chasers.</p>
        
            <p>The ball evaded several All Blacks before finding the hands of Darry.</p>
        
            <p>But the Pumas pounced back shortly after, Santiago Chocobares hitting a beautiful line to carve through the All Black defence before linking with Lucio Cinti who powered through the final two tacklers.</p>

            <p>After trading penalty goals, the All Blacks struck with their second as Anton Lienert-Brown swivelled through his opposite after a deft ball from McKenzie.</p>
        
            <p>Just as it looked like the All Blacks would take a comfortable halftime lead, Argentina stole one back with Sevu Reece knocking the kick off back only for it to find the electric Mateo Carreras who rocketed around the cover to streak 30 metres and bring his side back within five at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Staggeringly, there was not a single scrum in the first 40 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors kicked things off after oranges with some trickery, a clever lineout move throwing to the man in front of the jumper, Franco Molina rumbling his way to the line as Argentina took the lead 22-20.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie regained the advantage with his third penalty goal and then after a long conference between the officials, Ethan Blackadder was pinged for shoulder to head contact, giving Argentina the lead once more.</p>
        
            <p>Will Jordan then made his long awaited return to test rugby, coming on to the wing.</p>
        
            <p>After a quiet 50 minutes, Mark Telea came in looking for work and was rewarded with a try as he broke through from the base of a ruck.</p>
        
            <p>Carreras kept the South Americans in touch with another penalty to reduce the gap to two.</p>
        
            <p>It took an hour, but the first scrum was finally packed down after replacement halfback Cortez Ratima knocked on.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie looked to have bagged another for the All Blacks when he waltzed through a gaping hole, but the try was scrubbed due to a forward pass.</p>
        
            <p>A comedy of errors left the door wide open for Argentina as two wayward passes in a row forced the All Blacks to dot down on their own line.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina did not need a second invitation, Creevy powering over the line to put the Pumas in front with ten to play.</p>
        
            <p>The Pumas played their part in trying to run the clock down, but conceded a penalty under their own sticks to give the All Blacks a sniff.</p>
        
            <p>However, their lineout woes continued, and after losing possession the Pumas forced another penalty right in front to stretch the lead to eight.</p>
        
            <p>It was a bridge too far for New Zealand, and in stark contrast to Auckland where the return match takes place next week. Wellington continues to be the All Blacks' worst venue in the world.</p>
