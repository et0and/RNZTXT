            <p>An Auckland man is fighting for his life after developing a life-threatening condition within days of what started out as a sore throat and mild fever.</p>
        
            <p>Otherwise fit and healthy, Neeraj Ramachandran, 36, travelled to India in July to take care of his sick father.</p>
        
            <p>In August, he came back and developed flu-like symptoms.</p>
        
            <p>His doctor gave him medication for a throat infection but it didn't help.</p>
        
            <p>Within two weeks, he was admitted to Auckland's North Shore hospital and remains in intensive care fighting complications from a rare, life-threatening condition.</p>
        
            <p>His brother Nirmal Ramachandran said "bubbly" and "happy go lucky" Neeraj travelled all the way to India weeks before he was admitted to the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Raj [Neeraj] went to India for a medical emergency. Our father was taken to the ICU and nearly lost his left leg."</p>
        
            <p>The father contracted a flesh-eating bacteria posing a risk to his left leg, Nirmal said.</p>
        
            <p>"Raj nursed him [the father] back to health until he could stand again."</p>

            <p>Nirmal said his younger brother had no major symptoms when he returned to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The day he flew back [to New Zealand], he complained about being in a bit feverish. We thought it must be a normal flu or a tummy bug.</p>
        
            <p>"He went to the doctors who gave him medicine for some throat infection.</p>
        
            <p>"Things just went downhill from there. He started getting shivers and cold."</p>
        
            <p>Neeraj was taken to the hospital on August 16, his brother said.</p>
        
            <p>"His [body] temperature was really bad. His heart rate just went over the roof. His blood pressure just went out of control.</p>
        
            <p>"He couldn't breathe properly so they [the doctors at the hospital] rushed him to HDU [high dependency unit]."</p>
        
            <p>Neeraj was in an induced coma and received treatment for typhoid fever.</p>
        
            <p>"He is on IV fluids, tube-fed, and connected to a ventilator."</p>
        
            <p>"The doctors told us he has something called as HLH [Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis]"</p>
        
            <p>Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis or HLH is a rare and often life-threatening condition caused by excessive immune system activation.</p>
        
            <p>The condition can trigger immune system to produce too many cells. These cells can attack the body and make a person seriously ill, which can be life-threatening.</p>

            <p>Nirmal said he was heartbroken when doctors told him to call the parents to say "goodbye" to his younger brother about three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I am not prepared to lose a loved one in my family.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not know when he will recover and the doctors have not provided a time frame.</p>
        
            <p>"He is my young lad. It is the first time I have seen him sick.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't think of it even in your weirdest dreams that mild fever can turn into this. It has been a nightmare."</p>
        
            <p>Nirmal thanked his brother's employers for the support.</p>
        
            <p>"They [the employer] said they will keep the role open for him when he comes back from hospital even though it's going to take a while for him to get back on his feet.</p>
        
            <p>"They even paid us one month salary. That was a huge, huge relief for us."</p>
        
            <p>Nirmal started a Givealittle page to raise funds as his brother battles on in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Neeraj moved from India to New Zealand in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Qualified as a petroleum engineer, he worked as a courier driver in the past and recently got a job with a power company as a line mechanic.</p>
