        <h2>Paul beats Tyson in flat fight</h2>
        <p>
While it was never going to live up to the hype, few predicted that Tyson would be so subdued, landing just 18 punches.

            <p>Jake Paul has beaten boxing legend Mike Tyson by unanimous decision to win an intergenerational heavyweight battle in Texas that failed to live up to its enormous hype.</p>
        
            <p>With one scoring it 80-72, and two judges giving it 79-72 to Paul, it was a relatively easy win for the much maligned former child star.</p>
        
            <p>The bout between the 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prizefighter and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion was streamed live on Netflix and played out in front of a sold-out crowd at AT&T Stadium in Arlington.</p>
        
            <p>While it was never going to live up to the hype, few predicted that Tyson would be so subdued, landing just 18 punches.</p>
        
            <p>Paul dominated the former heavyweight champ, using his fitness to bounce in and out of range at will, while peppering Tyson with stiff shots.</p>
        
            <p>After appearing strong in the opening round, Tyson faded fast and was soon being toyed with by the man almost three decades his junior.</p>
        
            <p>With an audience of a quarter billion expected to watch, fans were left frustrated with glitches and buffering.</p>
        
            <p>Netflix was down for thousands of users in the United States, outage tracking website Downdetector.com said, just as viewers tuned in.</p>
        
            <p>After hs loss, Tyson said it was time for the public to start respecting Paul.</p>
        
            <p>He would not rule out a return to the ring, suggesting a fight with Jake's brother Logan Paul.</p>
        
            <p>The pair buried any animosity and Paul said Tyson would forever be a legend of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"This man is an icon and it was an honour to fight him."</p>
