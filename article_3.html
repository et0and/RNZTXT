            <p>With the Wild Card Round having set the stage for a postseason filled with drama, major upsets and high intensity football, the NFL Divisional Round now offers even more compelling matches.</p>
        
            <p>As the eight franchises left prepare to go to war, they are all just three more victories away from lifting The Vince Lombardi Trophy. If this season has taught us anything, it is that you are only as good as your last game. The Dallas Cowboys proved that last weekend after having a fairytale season, just to be cut short at the hands of the rampant and resurgent Green Bay Packers - who looked down and out just a few months ago and are now one of the big smokeys of the eight teams left.</p>
        
            <p>It is time to dissect the unfolding drama, examining how these elite teams navigate the challenging path towards potential glory. Here is the NFL Divisional Playoff Round, where every play, every decision, and every moment carries the weight of championship aspirations (away team first):</p>

            <p>Houston will face Baltimore for the second time this season, in a rematch from the opening weekend, when the Ravens triumphed 25-9. A lot has transpired since then. We have seen the Texans go from no-hopers to now being recognised as a powerhouse, and a team that would make you nervous with their seemingly nothing to lose attitude. Under rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud, the Texans have not lost since his injury comeback in round 17. But even with all this praise for the resilient franchise from the Lone Star State, let us not get it twisted.</p>
        
            <p>Their opponents in the Baltimore Ravens are one of the most exciting and precise teams we have encountered in years and are tipped by most to at least go on to the Super Bowl if not win the whole thing. We are seeing quarterback Sensation Lamar Jackson in the video game cover type form - the best of his career and that is not to mention the Raven's sensational defence. This is the perfect match up to kick off the NFL Divisional Playoff weekend and is a must watch for even part time American Football fans.</p>
        
            <p>We only have to look back over the past few years between these two juggernauts to piece together the fierce rivalry. The Green Bay Packers tasted faced defeat against the San Francisco 49ers twice in three playoff instances, possibly indicating a tactical edge for 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan over his former protege Matt LaFleur.</p>
        
            <p>This time Green Bay has a new not so secret weapon, with quarterback Jordan Love playing out of his skin, the Packers have a chance to equal the mighty offensive output of San Francisco, who are now ranked third in terms of scoring efficiency. Love has been in outstanding form over the last four games, tossing ten touchdown passes without giving up a single interception. As great as all that sounds Green Bay with have to dig deep and find something even more to match up against Super Bowl favourites San Francisco - for two reasons: the 49ers should prove to be an even greater challenge than the Cowboys. With star running back Christian McCaffrey, they are significantly more devoted to their rushing game, and the 49ers are thought of as the most disciplined squad in the league. They will be far less prone to make the same mistakes the Cowboys did in an attempt to mitigate the Packers' running game on defence. An unmissable match up will see another chapter in the rivalry of these two fierce teams written this Sunday afternoon with a strong likelihood the winner of this game could go on to win the Super Bowl.</p>

            <p>The Bucs delivered a resounding defeat to an underperforming Eagles team that limped into the playoffs. However, credit must be given to Baker Mayfield, who is currently experiencing a rejuvenation in his career. In his inaugural season in Tampa, Mayfield has achieved career-best statistics in various passing categories. So it's likely Tampa Bay could capitalise on the Detroit Lions' poorly ranked pass defence in what is anticipated to be a closely contested battle.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the Lions securing a 20-6 victory in Tampa during week six, the upcoming rematch in Detroit suggests vulnerabilities in the Lions' defensive line up. Anticipate a dynamic and closely contested matchup, resembling the intensity of Detroit's wild-card game against the Rams, which was exceptionally tight. While this may not be the most high-profile clash of the week, it holds the potential to be the most thrilling, promising a display of high-scoring football with two red hot quarterbacks duking it out for a place in the NFC title match up.</p>

            <p>Okay, I know I just said the previous match up has the potential to be the most exciting game of the weekend - but this Chiefs vs Bills rematch from last year's playoffs has the prospect to be one of the most exciting playoff games of all time.</p>
        
            <p>For the last four years, Bills quarterback Josh Allen has been regarded as one of the best in the NFL, the proven best quarterback of the entire league Patrick Mahomes will provide a postseason barrier that will be difficult for Buffalo to overcome. The Chiefs beat the Bills in the most unforgettable game of playoff's football in modern day history back in 2021, but the Bills are finally getting a crack at them at home and in red hot form after six straight wins. Considering their recent stellar performances, the Bills present a compelling case for success; however, the pervasive injuries across various positions raise legitimate concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Mahomes, fuelled by the playoffs, can never be written off even with 20 seconds left on the clock, especially with the Chiefs facing increased scepticism due to errors from their skill players. In the high-stakes duel between two prominent quarterbacks, the often overloooked Chiefs' defence demands attention. Kansas City has impressively limited opponents to 20 or fewer points in six consecutive games, surrendering more than 21 points only twice throughout the season in what could be the proving point on Monday's match up. Do not miss this game!</p>
