            <p>Dame Fiona Kidman is borrowing the words of other writers to 'raise the roof' and raise funds for Randell Cottage. The legendary writer is organising the event, based on a UK concept that has been running for more than a decade. The event brings together actors, writers, professors, celebrities and those with a love of literature to celebrate the power and magic of letters. </p>
        
            <p>Raise the roof for Randell Cottage: Live Letters will have 12 people reading letters aloud, some of whom have held former residencies. The letters have been chosen, if not written, by the readers themselves. The line-up includes recent Ockham New Zealand Book Awards winner Emily Perkins, historian Vincent O’Malley, academic Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, foreign correspondent Anna Fifield, Supreme Court Judge Justice Sir Stephen Kos and 'the voice of Country Calendar’, Dan Henry. </p>
        
            <p>Randell Cottage in Wellington has been a writers’ residency since 2001. </p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Culture 101’s Perlina Lau, Fiona explains how Randell Cottage came to be. She, along with a group of writers, including the late Vincent O’Sullivan, had tried to buy the house of poet and writer Lauris Edmond. But it wasn’t possible due to insufficient funds. </p>
        
            <p>Then, a gift.</p>
        
            <p>Out of the blue, she received a phone call from children’s author Beverley Price, better known as Beverley Randell.  </p>
        
            <p>On the phone, Price said, “I can’t buy you Lauris’ house, but I can give you a house.”</p>
        
            <p>Price and her family had purchased a cottage that belonged to her great-grandfather in the 1860s and had restored it. But after finishing the renovations, they didn’t quite know what to do with it. </p>
        
            <p>“If you’d like to form a Trust, I’ll go see my lawyer and drop the keys in your letterbox,” said Price. </p>
        
            <p>And that's exactly what happened. </p>

            <p>Now, two writers each year are offered a six-month residency at Randell Cottage - one for a New Zealand writer and the other to French nationals. But the historic 160-year-old building now needs a new roof and Dame Fiona Kidman and friends are leading the charge. </p>
        
            <p>A writer for more than 60 years, Kidman has published more than 30 books including novels, poetry, essays and three memoirs. Her latest memoir, So Far, For Now was published in 2022 and she has recently returned to poetry, with a collection to be released next year. </p>
        
            <p>She’s also the subject of a new documentary, The House Within, which will screen as part of the New Zealand Film Festival - an experience she describes as “a lot of fun”.</p>
        
            <p>Having lived in Wellington for more than 50 years, the documentary is also a “love letter to Wellington”.</p>
        
            <p>“It ranges all over places in Wellington which are important to me. I like being filmed in those places.”</p>
        
            <p>Despite being one of New Zealand’s most celebrated writers, Kidman takes a rather matter-of-fact approach to her success. </p>
        
            <p>“People say I’ve done extraordinary things, but I don’t see it that way. They’re just the things I do.”</p>
        
            <p>Kidman suspects growing up as an only child in the rural Far North of Aotearoa set her on an independent path.</p>
        
            <p>“I didn’t have a lot of people to consult about the things that I did. So I’ve probably taken a fairly independent line in my life.”</p>
        
            <p>Kidman has always been a disciplined writer. She made the decision, early on, to become a writer and applied herself. And she still does. While it’s not necessarily a career she would recommend to others, she writes every day with set hours and a routine. </p>
        
            <p>When reflecting on her career, her advice to new writers is to “let the world in”.</p>
        
            <p>“I don’t believe writers live in ivory towers. I have always made time for other things if they’re important. You need to let the world in. Don’t shy away. Don’t lock yourself away.”</p>
        
            <p>Kidman started out in radio, writing radio dramas. When asked about the best advice she’s ever received about writing, she recalls her mentor, Arthur Jones, who had been at the BBC. </p>
        
            <p>“You know Fiona, radio has certain elements - music, sound, sound effects, dialogue, conversation - it has silence. Don’t forget the silences. Learn to listen to the silences, because that’s where the action is.” </p>
        
            <p>“That has never left me.”</p>
