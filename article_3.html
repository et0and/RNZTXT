            <p>The jury in a High Court in Christchurch has been shown explicit images and videos found on the phone of a man facing multiple sexual assault charges.</p>
        
            <p>John Hope Muchirahondo is facing more than 30 charges, including rape and sexual violation in the High Court in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Brett Goucher told the court that thousands of images and a smaller number of videos were found on Muchirahondo's phone, and about 30 were deemed relevant to the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Police had focused on the images that could be of sexual assault, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the images were of sexual acts, or naked women, with close-ups of genitals, and some of women being touched intimately.</p>
        
            <p>The images were presented in a closed court room.</p>
        
            <p>Goucher said they used some non-explicit images to confirm locations and the people in the images.</p>
        
            <p>This morning, the High Court also heard from the owner of Chic bar in central Christchurch, Peivand Yazdanpanah, who said Muchirahondo had been a regular visitor to his bar over four or five years.</p>
        
            <p>On one occasion he had said to Muchirahondo that he was very popular on the dance floor, and Muchirahondo had responded that he could have any woman.</p>
        
            <p>Yazdanpanah asked Muchirahondo what he meant by that, and Muchirahondo pulled out his phone.</p>
        
            <p>"It took a few seconds to scroll down to find the app," said Yazdanpanah. "Which to me was a bit odd, because you couldn't see any gallery [that] usually you see on the phone. And he said no this is my secret area. Then he put a pin code in, and opened the app and scrolled, and showed me the videos of having intercourse with other women."</p>
        
            <p>Yazdanpanah said he was shown two clips of around 10 seconds, but could see files for about 20 to 25 videos.</p>
        
            <p>He asked Muchirahondo if it was him in the videos and he said it was.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
