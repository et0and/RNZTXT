            <p>Rangatahi Māori are being encouraged to join the national hui at Turangawaewae Marae on Saturday 20 January to make their voices heard.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuuheitia issued a Royal Proclamation last December calling for a hui to unify the nation and hold the government to account.</p>
        
            <p>One of the forums at the hui will focus specifically on issues affecting young Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Rangatahi forum facilitator Piripi Winiata said one of the mātāpono (principles) governing the hui was having a future-focused plan, which was where rangatahi come in.</p>
        
            <p>"In my experience [Kiingi Tuuheitia is] really passionate about rangatahi, it's something he cares deeply about. Hearing their voice is a huge part of having a future-focused plan that comes out of this hui," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Winiata said the message to rangatahi was: "Nau mai haere mai".</p>
        
            <p>He said Māori leaders wanted to ensure rangatahi Māori knew that there was a space for them to be heard, "That they are welcome and are encouraged to participate, whether they feel they have a wealth of knowledge or are early on in understanding the part that they have to play".</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to really encourage our rangatahi to feel like there's a space for them, like there's going to be an opportunity for them to participate in a way that they feel comfortable participating in."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week Kiingi Tuuheitia's daughter Te Puhi Ariki, Ngawai hono i te po encouraged rangatahi to join the hui.</p>
        
            <p>"A rangatira was once a rangatahi, so come, come and be heard," she said on the Kiingitanga Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>Winiata said Te Puhi Ariki's role was like a korowai that wrapped around the rangatahi forum.</p>
        
            <p>"She's a source of mana, of strength, of wisdom, of respect and she is there to hear our rangatahi and make sure that they feel that they've been heard," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 3000 people are expected to attend the hui. While not all rangatahi may have the chance to speak, there would be avenues for them to be heard, Winiata said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that we've designed the rangatahi forum is to use a bit more technology to make sure that our rangatahi who are really strong in that technology space have an ability to contribute.</p>
        
            <p>"If we have thousands of people, which we're likely to have at the hui, that will be hard for everyone to have a chance to stand up and speak for five minutes but there's going to be other avenues for people to contribute.</p>
        
            <p>"So I would say please feel like you have a part to play, please feel like you're welcome and that you will have a space to be heard if that's what you want or to come along and listen if that's what you want to do."</p>
