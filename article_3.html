            <p>Super Rugby Pacific rolls on, the Warriors will be looking to climb the NRL ladder and netball begins in earnest - April is another big month for sport.</p>
        
            <p>Here's what's on the calendar for the month ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Hong Kong Sevens</p>
        
            <p>5-7 April</p>

            <p>The All Blacks and Black Ferns Sevens sides head back up to the sport's most iconic venue this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>While the shortened form of the game has lost a fair bit of lustre recently, this is an Olympic year and both sides need a tune-up before going for gold in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The women have Stacey Waaka back from injury to bolster their squad, while Dylan Collier makes a comeback after missing the past two events for the men.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix v Central Coast Mariners</p>

            <p>What's in the water in Wellington? Both the rugby and football teams are top of the table, with the Phoenix closing in on their best season finish ever.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend sees them head away to second-placed Central Coast, before returning home the following week for another big clash with Melbourne Victory.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Nix are currently six points clear with four regular season matches to go.</p>
        
            <p>Japanese Grand Prix</p>
        
            <p>5pm Sunday 7 April</p>

            <p>Liam Lawson is in the news, but not for the reasons that Red Bull team want to be reading.</p>
        
            <p>Currently a reserve, Lawson has made his frustrations clear at not getting a drive in either RB team, so while it is unlikely he will be suiting up for anyone else this weekend at Suzuka, that may well change in the near future.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, season leader Max Verstappen will be looking to make up for a DNF at the Melbourne Grand Prix after his car almost blew up.</p>
        
            <p>11-14 April</p>

            <p>New Zealand's own Ryan Fox heads to Augusta National to compete in his second US Masters tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Last year he finished tied for 26th, and is coming off an excellent 2023 season in which he won the BMW PGA Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Fox will be up against the current power names in golf like Scotty Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and John Rahm.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ Premiership</p>
        
            <p>From 13 April</p>

            <p>Netball finds itself in an interesting spot right now, with the domestic game admitting it is under financial pressure and needing to stay relevant due to the broadening of women's sporting options.</p>
        
            <p>The ANZ Premiership opens on Saturday 13 April when Magic host the defending champion Mystics in Hamilton, while the Stars go up against the Pulse the following day.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes v Chiefs</p>

            <p>This month sees New Zealand derby matches take a bit of a back seat but there is one big one when the Chiefs head to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The Canes have been exceptional so far this year, fully deserving of their top of the table status, but have suffered an injury blow with Cam Roigard looking like he will be missing the rest of the campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Chiefs have had a few weaknesses exposed so far this year, so this shapes up as being a massive challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Nottingham Forest v Everton</p>
        
            <p>12.30am 22 April</p>

            <p>Every game is crucial for Chris Wood's Forest, as they look to lift themselves out of the relegation zone before the season's conclusion in May.</p>
        
            <p>They have Fulham, Spurs and Wolves before a big one against fellow strugglers Everton.</p>
        
            <p>Wood may well play a big part in what might be another great escape - he's made a bit of a habit of playing for sides in this position in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors v Titans</p>
        
            <p>4pm 25 April</p>

            <p>The NRL's Anzac Round game returns to New Zealand for the first time in almost a decade, which will be played in front what will surely be another Mt Smart sell-out.</p>
        
            <p>However, the day's events may shine a bit of light on rugby league's rather contradictory modern attitude to World War I - quite the opposite of what it was at the time when it allied itself tightly to trade unions and socialist movements to discourage enlistment, meaning its competition continued throughout the conflict.</p>
