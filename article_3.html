            <p>A security breach at Auckland Airport caused disruption for travellers as all passengers had to be rescreened.</p>
        
            <p>Flights were also delayed or cancelled as a result.</p>
        
            <p>There have been reports of large queues at the domestic departures.</p>
        
            <p>Aviation Security said about 6.40am a passenger in the security screening area refused to comply and left before their screening process was complete.</p>
        
            <p>"The person was located by Aviation Security officers and removed from the restricted area."</p>
        
            <p>But the terminal had to be emptied and passengers rescreened as a result, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no safety or security risk."</p>
        
            <p>They said there would be further investigation into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland Airport spokesperson said the security breach this morning had been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"Aviation Security Services is requiring all passengers to be rescreened and that process is underway now," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank travellers for their patience and they should please check with their airline about any impact to their flight."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said it had to cancel four flights as a result of the security breach.</p>
        
            <p>Several other flights were delayed.</p>
        
            <p>"The team are working to reaccommodate any impacted customers and we thank them for their patience while we work to get them to their destination as quickly as possible," the airline said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar said two of its flights were delayed up to 30 minutes but they had no other disruption.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month there were lengthy queues at Auckland Airport's domestic terminal caused by upgrades to a security machine.</p>
