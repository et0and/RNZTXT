            <p>Police say they have not found who made a mayday call in Dunedin on Saturday afternoon, and are asking the public for help.</p>
        
            <p>Officers received the call at about 3.35pm, but it did not specify a particular location.</p>
        
            <p>Police then made further inquiries and checked out a range of boat ramps in the area, including Carey's Bay, Back Beach, Portobello, Hoopers Inlet, and the peninsular, but did not find anything of note.</p>
        
            <p>They were asking anyone who may have made the mayday call, who was now safe, to get in touch using the event number P057889968.</p>
        
            <p>Alternatively, police asked the public if they knew anyone who had not yet returned after boating on Saturday, to also get in touch.</p>
