            <p>Rescue efforts are underway to refloat a stranded juvenile pilot whale at Kaitorete Spit in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation (DOC) Mahaanui operations manager Andy Thompson said the whale's condition was being assessed before next steps were determined. It was not yet known what had led the whale to strand.</p>
        
            <p>DOC staff were also assessing whether there are other whales in the area, and working with representatives from Te Taumutu Rūnanga and Wairewa Rūnanga to ensure appropriate tikanga was being observed.</p>
        
            <p>The whale is at a remote site a few kilometres south of Birdlings Flat, with limited vehicle access. Public assistance was not needed, with people being asked to stay away from the area.</p>
        
            <p>A Project Jonah medic and Christchurch City Council staff were also on site.</p>
        
            <p>"Teams are assessing the welfare of the whale, large waves and conditions to see if refloat is to be attempted," Project Jonah said in a social media post.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said pilot whale strandings on Kaitorete were not common, but the Banks Peninsula area was a hotspot for a wide range of marine life, and it was not unusual for pilot whales to be in the area.</p>
