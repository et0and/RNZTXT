            <p>The father of a three-year-old boy who became trapped in a claw machine at a south-east Queensland shopping centre says his son "was having the time of his life".</p>
        
            <p>Three-year-old Ethan climbed into the machine through its prize dispenser at a shopping centre at Capalaba on Saturday night, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Vision shows the toddler calmly climbing on the toys, as adults encouraged him to come out.</p>
        
            <p>Ethan's father, Timothy Hopper, said his son was playing with the machine before he quickly disappeared out of sight.</p>
        
            <p>"I had zero chance to react to it, it was unbelievable how fast he climbed up there," Hopper said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was watching him and then I was talking to my children.</p>
        
            <p>"He always opens up the flap to be an opportunist, and then within a split second he crawled into the machine and the door closed behind him."</p>
        
            <p>Hopper said his son regularly played the machines and was quite amused he was inside.</p>
        
            <p>"He stood up and realised what had happened, he climbed over the perplex glass and was king of the mountain," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't help but laugh thinking 'how has this happened?' because he wasn't hurt, he wasn't sad, so it was easy to have a laugh when he was having the time of his life.</p>
        
            <p>"But then reality sunk in - how am I going to get him out."</p>
        
            <p>Hopper said he and his partner prioritised remaining calm, while calling the claw machine company.</p>
        
            <p>"They were asking me how much money I had put in the machine [and if the money was] stuck in the machine," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My response was 'the only thing stuck in the machine is my child, I'd love to have him back'.</p>
        
            <p>"I messaged my old man and he asked me how many $2 coins I had, we can try and win him back."</p>
        
            <p>Senior constable Stuart Power said the rescue was a first in his 11-year policing career, but made easy because Ethan was in good spirits.</p>
        
            <p>"For him to get distraught in there, it would've made things a lot harder to extract him on the night," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We directed him to the back corner and to cover his eyes which he was exceedingly happy to do, he bounced into the corner. Kids are going to be kids."</p>
        
            <p>Power and his colleagues broke the glass, before helping Ethan to safety.</p>
        
            <p>"He was more excited he was going to get a cuddle from a police officer," Hopper said.</p>
        
            <p>A Capalaba Park Shopping Centre spokesperson said the incident was a first for company Retail First, which operates 21 centres in the south-east.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in discussions with the claw machine vendor to review what measures can be put in place to avoid this happening again," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>As for three-year-old Ethan, who was presented with his own toy koala dressed as a police officer to mark the occasion, he has assured his dad more entrapments aren't in his future.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't worry dad, I won't do it again," Ethan said.</p>
