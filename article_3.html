            <p>This weekend marks the dawn of a new All Blacks coaching reign, with Scott Robertson the 26th man to call the shots for history's greatest rugby team. Ahead of his debut, RNZ looks back at the first tests at the previous nine who took on the most scrutinised job in the country.</p>
        
            <p>First test: 1985 Defeated England 18-13 at Lancaster Park, Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>An ugly start to the late great's tenure, six penalties from Kieran Crowley getting them home on a sodden Christchurch pitch.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: C.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 1987 Defeated Australia 30-16 at Concord Oval, Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh of a World Cup win, a double for Sean Fitzpatrick ensured a dominant win, and the Bledisloe return home for Lochore's swansong.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: A-.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 18 tests, 14 wins, 3 losses, 1 draw. 80 percent win rate.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>First test: 1988 Defeated Wales 52-3 at Lancaster Park, Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>A woeful Welsh team toured in '88 and were soundly hammered in Grizz's first test at the helm, John Kirwan crossing for a quartet.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: A.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 1991 Defeated Scotland 13-6 at Cardiff Arms Park, Cardiff.</p>
        
            <p>The game no one wants play in, but at least they won with a late Walter Little score to end Wylie's reign with World Cup bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: B-.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 23 tests, 20 wins, 2 losses, 1 draw. 89 percent win rate.</p>

            <p>First test: 1992 Lost to the World XV 28-14 at Lancaster Park, Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>A new age started in unfamiliar fashion for the All Blacks, beaten by a classy World XV in the opener of the centenary series.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: D.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 1995 Defeated France 37-12 at Parc des Princes, Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Bouncing back from a loss in the first test, the All Blacks squared the series to see Mains out with a win.</p>
        
            <p>Rating; B+.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 34 tests, 23 wins, 10 losses, 1 draw. 69 percent win rate.</p>
        
            <p>
Mains had a knack for not mincing words, once telling Sean Fitzpatrick he was "too fat and too arrogant."

            <p>First test: 1996 Defeated Samoa 51-10 at McLean Park, Napier.</p>
        
            <p>A night of firsts, the debut of Christian Cullen, the inaugural test under lights and a solid victory to start the Hart era.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: B.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 1999 Lost to South Africa 22-18 at Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.</p>
        
            <p>Rubbing salt into the wound inflicted by the French, Hart bowed out with a demoralising loss in the play off for third at the '99 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: F.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 42 tests, 32 wins, 9 losses, 1 draw. 77 percent win rate.</p>

            <p>First test: 2000 Defeated Tonga 102-0 North Harbour Stadium at Albany.</p>
        
            <p>A Troy Flavell hat-trick on debut marked a blistering opening to Smith's chapter in charge, albeit against a pretty poor Tongan team.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: A.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 2001 Lost to Australia 29-26 at Stadium Australia, Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Totai Kefu and the Wallabies breaking All Black hearts in the final minute was a suitable send off for Smith.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: C-.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 17 tests, 12 wins, 5 losses. 71 percent win rate.</p>

            <p>First test: 2001 Defeated Ireland 40-29 at Lansdowne Road, Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>The international introduction of Richie McCaw, and start of a successful Northern tour under Mitchell.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: B+.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 2003 Defeated France 40-13 at Telstra Stadium, Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>A convincing win to finish third at the tournament, but the writing was on the wall for Mitchell's job after crashing out in the World Cup semi.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: B-.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 28 tests, 23 wins, 4 losses 1 draw. 84 percent win rate.</p>

            <p>First test: 2003 Defeated England 36-3 at Carisbrook, Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Henry opened his All Blacks coaching account with a resounding win over the English, kicking off a dominant pre World Cup period.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: A.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 2011 Defeated France 8-7 at Eden Park, Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>After 24 long years, Henry's All Blacks finally recaptured the Rugby World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: A.</p>
        
            <p>Overall Record: 103 tests, 88 wins, 15 losses. 85 percent win rate.</p>

            <p>First test: 2012 Defeated Ireland 42-10 at Eden Park, Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Hansen's first test coincided with the debuts of Aaron Smith, Brodie Retallick and Julian Savea, the bus bagging a treble in the Irish rout.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: A-.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 2019 defeated Wales 40-17 at Ajinomoto Stadium, Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>The fourth All Blacks coach to exit in a play off for bronze, his departure capped a dominant period marred by the loss to England in the semi final.</p>
        
            <p>Rating; B+.</p>
        
            <p>Overall record: 107 tests, 93 wins, 10 losses 4 draws. 89 percent win rate.</p>
        
            <p>
It took a lot to make Hansen smile, but the success of his All Blacks sometimes did the trick.

            <p>First test: 2020 Drew 16-all with Australia at Sky Stadium, Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>A perfect result to encapsulate Foster's tumultuous tenure.</p>
        
            <p>Rating: C.</p>
        
            <p>Last test: 2023 Lost to South Africa 12-11 at Stade de France, Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Had Jordie Barrett's penalty been on target, all may have been forgiven for Foster. However, just a second World Cup final loss was just another unwanted record.</p>
        
            <p>Rating; D.</p>
        
            <p>Overall record: 46 tests, 32 wins, 12 losses 2 draws. 70 percent win rate.</p>

            <p>First test: 2024 vs England, Dunedin, 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps the most excited the New Zealand Rugby public has ever been about a new All Blacks coaching appointment. Can Razor re-establish the All Black dynasty?</p>
