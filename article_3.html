            <p>New Zealanders listed more than $115 billion worth of residential property for sale in 2024, and some of them are still waiting to find buyers.</p>
        
            <p>Data from realestate.co.nz shows that the value of the property listed for sale lifted 19.4 percent year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>There were more than 110,000 new residential listings year-on-year, up 19,000 from the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>Real Estate Institute data indicates there were just under 70,000 sales in the year.</p>
        
            <p>The average asking price was consistent, down just 0.3 percent year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington had the biggest increase in new listings, with 8132 coming onto the market, up 37.3 percent compared to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Personal circumstances would have been a factor for many choosing to sell in 2024. But greater price stability across the motu likely boosted vendor confidence in some regions," said realestate.co.nz spokesperson Vanessa Williams.</p>
        
            <p>Central Otago Lakes had the biggest increase in average asking price in the year, up 7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The year prior, [2023], was our worst listing year in our 17-year history," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>She said, interest rate cuts and improving business confidence had helped to turn that around, even while the labour market remained weak.</p>
        
            <p>"$115b of property is a lot of property, especially given sometimes the increase in price is what drives it as a big number but the average asking price was give or take the same.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it kind of sets us up in good stead for when activity does pick up.</p>
        
            <p>"When you come back into the market, specifically as a buyer, you want choice, you don't want to have to be competing with heaps of people in an open home.</p>
        
            <p>"The property market will move again, if you've been trying to sell a house for two years it might not feel like things are going to change but it will change."</p>
        
            <p>She said some who listed in the year could have been stuck on the market for months.</p>
        
            <p>Real estate salespeople reported that was usually because they had outdated price expectations, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't seen sales pick up at the same rate as listings. January to October sales were light but November sales were the highest since 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think, that drop in interest rates, the stability of prices for two years ... people are like 'I might get in now before the market does start to move'".</p>
        
            <p>The market was likely to be busier this year, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"Providing all the key metrics we look at stay relatively consistent, there's a good amount of stock, buyers are getting more serious ... in the first 20 days of 2025, a healthy number of new listings have come on to the market already.</p>
        
            <p>"Prices being stable is a good sign, there's quite a bit of competition if you're selling a house, but I don't think that's a bad thing.</p>
        
            <p>"As buyers come back more strongly into the market as we see interest rates change, that's where we'll start to see the rubber hit the road."</p>
