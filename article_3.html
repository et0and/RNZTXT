            <p>A man has brandished a firearm in an alleged road rage incident in west Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called after a witness saw a man pull out a gun and threaten construction workers on West Coast Road, between Glen Eden and Kelston mall.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said the man was yelling obscenities, pulled the middle finger, before gesturing with what appeared to be a gun as he drove away.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted police for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a heavy armed police presence has been reported nearby on Great North Road in New Lynn.</p>
        
            <p>Police were seen outside a block of flats near the intersection with Fruitvale Rd just before 2pm, the New Zealand Herald reported.</p>
        
            <p>The police helicopter was in the area for some time but had since departed.</p>
        
            <p>A local resident told the Herald police had blocked off Great North Road at Fruitvale Rd with "lots of police in operation".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has reached out to police to confirm whether the two incidents are connected.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
