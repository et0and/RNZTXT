            <p>At least 14 people have been killed after a series of tornadoes hit in Arkansas and Missouri in the night, raking a path of destruction that is still being assessed, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-six tornadoes were reported - but not confirmed to have touched down - late on Friday night and early on Saturday as a low-pressure system drove powerful thunderstorms across parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi and Missouri, said David Roth, a meteorologist at the US National Weather Service's (NWS) Prediction Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"Today there is a high risk for more tornadoes across Alabama and Mississippi. The chance is 30 percent," he said. "That's pretty significant."</p>

            <p>Two of the tornado deaths occurred in southern Missouri in the Bakersfield area of Ozark County, about 434 kilometres (270 miles) southeast of Kansas City, and a third death was reported in Butler County, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and other officials said.</p>
        
            <p>Eight others were killed in the storms, the Missouri Highway Patrol said on X, without giving details.</p>
        
            <p>Three other deaths from the overnight storms occurred in Arkansas, the state's Department of Emergency Management reported on its website, adding that there were 29 injuries.</p>
        
            <p>As the storms regain strength, the highest possible risk of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms is on Saturday night, forecasters said. By Saturday afternoon, parts of Mississippi and Alabama were issued a level 5 tornado alert, the highest level the NWS has.</p>
        
            <p>Robbie Myers, the director of Butler County Emergency Management in Missouri, told reporters that more than 500 homes, along with a church and grocery store in the county were destroyed. A mobile home park had been "totally destroyed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The storms will move east throughout Saturday and could hit as far east as the Florida Panhandle and Atlanta by midnight, according to the NWS.</p>
