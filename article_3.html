            <p>Cher, Mary J. Blige and Ozzy Osbourne were among this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, formally introduced on Saturday at a concert gala.</p>
        
            <p>Kool & the Gang, Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, and Peter Frampton were also among the 2024 class of honourees, artists honoured at the ceremony held in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
        
            <p>Big Mama Thornton, Alexis Korner and John Mayall received special honours for "musical influence," Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and Norman Whitfield received awards for "musical excellence."</p>
        
            <p>Suzanne de Passe, a trailblazer for women executives in the music business, who was big in Motown, won the night's award for non-performing industry professionals.</p>
        
            <p>Dua Lipa kicked off the evening with a performance of 'Believe', with Cher joining the pop star onstage to finish her 1998 smash hit, which was credited as the first song to use auto-tune technology as an instrument.</p>
        
            <p>"I changed the sound of music forever," she said in her acceptance speech, less than a year after railing against the hall for not having yet added her to the ballot.</p>
        
            <p>"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was getting in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame," she said.</p>
