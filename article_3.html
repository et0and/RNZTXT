        <h2>ASB Classic: Top seed through, disappointment over withdrawals</h2>
        <p>
It's looking likely that the women's singles will be a heavily American affair.

            <p>It's looking likely that the ASB Classic women's singles will be a heavily American affair, after thewithdrawal of Emma Raducanu and Elise Mertens this morning. While that was a blow for the tournament, at least there was some good news in the afternoon when top seed Madison Keys safely advanced with a 6-4 6-4 win over Lucia Bronzetti.</p>
        
            <p>Although her Italian opponent put up a decent fight, Keys' experience shone through in windy conditions at Stanley Street.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a little tough, but to be expected. Really happy to say I had a pretty clean match despite the conditions," said Keys after walking off the court.</p>
        
            <p>"It always feels really good to get the first win of the season. We're all a little bit more nervous and a bit more out of sorts so to get that win really helps the confidence and momentum."</p>
        
            <p>That momentum is likely to continue in the second round, where Keys faces unseeded Romanian Jacqueline Cristian.</p>
        
            <p>Keys, from Florida, joined compatriot Sofia Kenin in the winner's circle today, meaning eight American players will take the court in the second round. Kenin had to work hard in the first set of her match against Wang Xiyu, before running away with the second to win 7(7)-6 6-1. Like Keys, she said that adjusting to the wind quicker than her opponent was deciding factor.</p>
        
            <p>"I kept my serve, which is not easy. These conditions, you just have to hit the ball through the middle and try to be aggressive and not passive," said the world number 23, who now doesn't have to deal with Raducanu on her side of the draw.</p>
        
            <p>While Kenin would have gone in confident, as she has won the last two matches between the two, it was a different feeling for tournament director Nicolas Lamperin regarding the loss of the two big names through injury.</p>
        
            <p>"She obviously hasn't been able to train properly ahead of the new season," said Lamperin regarding Raducanu's ongoing lower back injury. Mertens' injury was unknown.</p>
        
            <p>"When athletes want a chance to play, they will give themselves up till the last minute before making a decision. You have strong objectives…it is a setback for sure. You want to start strong and get as many matches before the Australian Open."</p>
        
            <p>It's yet another injury for Raducanu, who suffered an ankle complaint on her first visit to Auckland two years ago, along with several serious complaints that have constantly derailed her career since her 2021 US Open win.</p>
        
            <p>"Emma's a massive name in tennis, she's a marquee player, we love to have her here," said Lamperin.</p>
        
            <p>"We're disappointed, but we also understand the circumstances and wish her well. It's not uncommon, tennis is plagued with injuries…that's just the reality of the sport."</p>
