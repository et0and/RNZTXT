            <p>A protester with the 'Restore Passenger Rail' group that's notorious for disrupting traffic could get a compensation payout after being arrested for putting up posters.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Wham was pasting up a climate crisis flyer in central Wellington last month when he was taken into custody for breaching his bail conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Wham had earlier thrown red paint over the front of a luxury car dealership in a climate stunt that saw him handcuffed and charged with wilful damage.</p>
        
            <p>A month later, the activist was pasting up climate crisis posters near The Embassy in central Wellington when the police caught up with him again.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I saw the back of a police car going past. They must have recognised me from the car dealership protest and seen that I was postering," Wham said.</p>
        
            <p>"A few minutes later a couple of other cop cars turn up and there's three or four police officers. I'd just finished putting up a poster and one of them calls out my name and says: "Peter!"</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Wham said the officers approached him, one showing him his bail conditions that included not to encourage, support, entice or organise any illegal protest activity.</p>
        
            <p>"I just said to him the emphasis in that bail condition is the word 'illegal', isn't it? I said to him, I don't think what I'm doing is illegal, but his interest was more in the 'not encourage, support, entice or organise'. That's what caught his eye on the bail condition."</p>
        
            <p>Wham was arrested anyway and spent a night in a police cell. The next day the case was thrown out.</p>
        
            <p>The police prosecutor said even on law enforcement's own broad interpretation, putting up posters was not a breach of the bail conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Andrew Nicholls - who is overseeing a bunch of Restore Passenger Rail court cases - said the police got it wrong and apologised to Wham.</p>
        
            <p>This may not be the end of it, however, with Wham now seeking compensation, also known as 'Baigent damages', claiming a breach of the Bill of Rights.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands a taxpayer payout could reach thousands of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>University of Waikato law professor Alexander Gillespie said it was clear police had overstepped.</p>
        
            <p>"From the facts that we've got, if his bail said not participating or supporting illegal activity that's one thing, but supporting and promoting legal protest is another.</p>
        
            <p>"No one should be incarcerated for supporting legal protest."</p>

Restore Passenger Rail protests in Wellington have included blocking State Highway 1 and inner city roads, and led to arrests and anger from motorists caught in the resulting traffic jams.

            <p>Gillespie said getting to the bottom of exactly what happened - and why - was crucial as New Zealand was a liberal democracy and frustration from both sides of the picket lines was only increasing.</p>
        
            <p>"As climate protests increase, we've got to balance the right to protest, to freedom of assembly, against the rights of other people," Gillespie said.</p>
        
            <p>"The temptation of protesters is to try to push them to one side or take away their power, and that's where if I see people being arrested unduly or put into detention unduly, we have to start ringing alarm bells."</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie has written about global climate protest trends - pointing out some parts of the world - such as Britain - are already setting up new laws to deal with them.</p>
        
            <p>"This trend is escalating and it's going to get more difficult in time to come," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in New Zealand particularly it could rise quite quickly as our climate policies start to go backwards from where they were with the last administration."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand needs more detailed laws to keep up with growing climate protest action.</p>
        
            <p>"You can say to someone: 'you could get 14 years in jail for blocking a road and ten years if you're a ram raider and you steal someone's jewellery from a shop'. It's completely out of whack."</p>
