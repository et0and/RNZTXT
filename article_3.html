            <p>A Queenstown councillor who revealed a confidential council plan to discharge treated sewage into the Shotover River has been stripped of her responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Niki Gladding revealed the council was planning to invoke emergency powers to pump at least 12,000 cubic metres of treated sewage into the Shotover River per day.</p>
        
            <p>An extraordinary meeting was called for this afternoon regarding concerns she had breached the council's Code of Conduct</p>
        
            <p>During the meeting, Gladding said it was unfair for the council not to follow due process.</p>
        
            <p>The vote was not unanimous, but the council voted to strip Gladding of her committee roles.</p>
