            <p>The Associate Agriculture minister says it's beyond disappointing Kāinga Ora isn't putting wool carpet into new state houses.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora has released a request for proposal for companies to provide carpet and underlay for its state homes but it specifically says no wool.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of last year the government directed government agencies to prefer the use of woollen fibres where practical and appropriate, rather than artificial fibres in government buildings.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Agriculture Minister responsible for wool Mark Patterson said tweaks to procurement rules were being made and he expected to make an announcement soon.</p>

            <p>"It's beyond disappointing. It defies clear intent of the coalition agreement which does prioritise woollen fibres and while those procurement rules haven't been updated yet the intention is clear from the government."</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora owns and maintains more than 75,000 homes throughout the country. Over the next two years it will add 2650 new homes and renew carpet in a further 3000 homes.</p>
        
            <p>It had used dyed nylon carpet for more than a decade due to durability and price and a recent cost analysis showed nylon was 34 percent cheaper than wool alternatives, the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>Patterson said it shouldn't all be about cost.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an investment in safer healthier homes for our more vulnerable families. Wool is less flammable, it's anti allergenic, it's good for the environment, no micro plastics and its biodegradable so there's a lot of features of wool that we need to look at. We need to have a more holistic approach."</p>
        
            <p>Carpet manufacturer Wools of New Zealand said it was disappointing wool carpet was excluded from the new tender.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive John McWhirter said the company would simply like to have the opportunity to tender for the contracts.</p>
        
            <p>He understood nylon carpets were probably cheaper but said wool carpets have attributes that should be looked at.</p>
        
            <p>Bremworth chief executive Greg Smith said the deliberate exclusion of wool carpet from state homes in favour of synthetic materials by Kāinga Ora set a damaging precedent.</p>
        
            <p>"Kāinga Ora is New Zealand's largest landlord, owning or managing over 75,000 homes and a contract to supply this many homes would equate to over a million lineal metres of carpet and would be 'transformative' to the wool sector.</p>
        
            <p>"In July 2023 Kāinga Ora stated that it was pursuing a more sustainable path for its housing. That meant looking at the fibre being used in their homes after over 600,000 meters of synthetic carpet had been laid over the previous six years. This volume of synthetic carpet requires importing around 1.7 million kilos of plastic for its production."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said ironically many of the Kāinga Ora homes would date from a time when wool was the only option for carpet in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"To suggest that for some reason decades later wool is no longer a viable option for the same purpose makes no sense.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no question that we would have gone to extraordinary lengths to secure this contract. It would have represented a key turning point for the wool sector in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>If there was some inherent bias against wool that persisted within government departments, it was important for the industry to have the opportunity to correct any lingering misconceptions, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the wool sector to be completely left out of the conversation will be soul destroying for many farmers."</p>
