        <p>
The coroner says signs need to be more high-profile, but the council disagrees.

            <p>The coroner says signs warning of the dangers of crossing the Taieri Mouth need to be more high-profile, following the death of a two-year-old girl who was trapped under her family's boat when it capsized.</p>
        
            <p>On 3 April, 2021 the Dunedin family of five launched their boat at Taieri Mouth. The girl's father had owned the boat since early 2021, and had used it at Taieri Mouth on three previous occasions.</p>
        
            <p>The names of the family were suppressed by coroner Ruth Thomas. In her findings, the coroner said the father did not have much experience boating around the Dunedin area, but had previously held a skipper's licence.</p>
        
            <p>On the day of the accident, he slowed the boat as he struggled to spot the channel through the sandbar.</p>
        
            <p>He turned the boat to face the waves directly, but a larger wave struck the boat and it capsized. The mother and son were thrown away, but the man and his two daughters were trapped under the upturned boat.</p>

            <p>All of the family were wearing life jackets, but at this point the man took his off to enable him to submerge and get out from under the boat. He said he tried to get his daughter's life jacket off, but lost consciousness.</p>
        
            <p>His wife spotted her husband's legs poking out from underneath the boat, and dragged him out.</p>
        
            <p>Four surfers had arrived at the Taieri Mouth at the same time as the family, and realised the boat had capsized and went to their rescue.</p>
        
            <p>The four surfers were made up of three qualified doctors and one trainee doctor, and two of them were previously qualified lifeguards.</p>
        
            <p>The surfers helped the two adults and two children to get to shore, performing mouth-to-mouth on one of the children.</p>
        
            <p>One of the surfers realised another person was missing, and returned to the upturned boat.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner's report said the surfer dived under numerous times, and finally reached into the bow and felt a small foot.</p>
        
            <p>He was able to free the two-year-old girl and brought her to the surface. He placed the girl on a surfboard, and started mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions.</p>
        
            <p>The girl was taken to Dunedin Hospital by rescue helicopter, and the surfer - who was also an intensive care registrar - remained with the girl, ventilating her on the flight.</p>
        
            <p>The girl received CPR for just over two hours, but was declared dead at 3.50pm with her parents at her bedside.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas said the girl died from cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to drowning.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner's report said sadly on this day, the skipper found himself in sea conditions that exceeded his experience in a challenging environment.</p>
        
            <p>The report said crossing rivers or harbour bars in New Zealand can be dangerous, and the Taieri Mouth bar had a history of vessel capsizes.</p>
        
            <p>There were signs warning of the dangerous conditions at the mouth, but the father had not seen or read them.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas recommended the Otago Regional Council improve the prominence and visual impact of the warning signs. However, the council has said all skippers are responsible for educating themselves on boating safety at each location, and any warning signage is a last opportunity to provide information.</p>
        
            <p>It said the signs highlighted the key safety messages, and the placement was satisfactory.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas noted the four surfers were to be commended for their bravery and rescue skills, and that their actions saved lives.</p>
