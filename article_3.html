        <h2>Manawanui sinking: Minister commits to transparency</h2>
        <p>
Chris Penk says talk about final costs is premature and has defended the court of inquiry process, saying other investigations could occur.

            <p>Acting Defence Minister Chris Penk has made a statement in Parliament about the HMNZS Manawanui's sinking, and answered questions from other politicians - but rejected some as being "premature".</p>
        
            <p>He has rejected suggestions Defence Minister Judith Collins' response had been "dismissive" or that relations with Samoa had been damaged, committed to making the court of inquiry process public "to the greatest extent possible", and shut down questions about the overall cost.</p>
        
            <p>Penk stood to make the statement on Tuesday, the first sitting day in Parliament since the ship listed on Saturday 5 October and went beneath the waves the following day, opening the matter for questions and statements from other parties.</p>
        
            <p>He assured the Samoan and New Zealand people the government and navy would do everything they could through the all-of-government response, dubbed 'Operation Resolution'.</p>
        
            <p>It would involve working with Samoan authorities to understand the implications and evaluate salvage options, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Defence Force is investigating options to mitigate the capability loss as a result of the HMNZS Manawanui sinking," Penk said. "The navy still has diving and survey capabilities that operate independently of Manawanui and are therefore still available and deployable."</p>
        
            <p>He said the government was grateful for the Samoan government's patience and support in its exclusive economic zone, and particularly to those who rescued the ship's crew and passengers, but stopped short of making an apology - something Labour's Peeni Henare did not shy away from.</p>

            <p>"On behalf of Labour... we apologise to Samoa - in particular the community of Upolu and the large Samoan community here in Aotearoa, New Zealand," Henare said.</p>
        
            <p>He also pushed back against questions about reports a Samoan man who lived near where the ship sunk had previously told media Defence Minister Judith Collins' response had been "dismissive", and other suggestions the relationship between the two countries could be strained.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "nothing dismissive about" the reaction of the minister or the government, which - from the prime minister to the minister of defence on down - had "acknowledged and been in touch with relevant counterparts".</p>
        
            <p>The court of inquiry process already underway would collect and record evidence, he said, and report on the sequence of events leading up to the loss of the ship; the cause of the grounding and subsequent sinking; adherence to the standard notifications procedures; and any injuries and environmental damage.</p>
        
            <p>Under questioning from Henare, who asked whether that process was "akin to the navy investigating itself", Penk said there was nothing to prevent other investigations from also taking place. However, asked if the government would consider another parallel inquiry "that is far more public, transparent and accountable", Penk said it would not be helpful to speculate "until such time as we have a clearer idea of what has happened... what continues to be possible in relation to possible environmental impact".</p>
        
            <p>However, he did say the findings would be made public "to the greatest extent possible" and other options would be considered afterwards "for the purpose of accountability and otherwise assuring the New Zealand public and that of Samoa".</p>

            <p>He also rebuffed questions about the costs of the overall operation, saying they were premature.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be premature for me to speculate on what cost may accrue as a result of the incident in question, and therefore be premature to answer the question that is purely a hypothetical at this stage, in terms of a quantum of such compensation."</p>
        
            <p>A hotline has been set up for Samoan locals to phone if they find items from the ship washed ashore or at sea: +685 714 2198.</p>
        
            <p>"I rise to make a ministerial statement regarding the all of government response to HMNZS Manawanui sinking off the coast of Samoa on Saturday, 5 October. I'd also like to acknowledge the brave ship's company and passengers who evacuated overnight in extreme conditions, and Commander Yvonne Gray who made the right decision to evacuate the ship. We should be incredibly proud of all of our New Zealand Defence Force personnel who are all highly skilled and serve New Zealand without hesitation. </p>
        
            <p>"With the passengers and crew safe, the government's focus shifted to mitigating any environmental impacts. Sir, I assure this House, the people of New Zealand, and those of Samoa, we will do everything that we can. The New Zealand Defence Force is leading the all-of-government response to this incident named Operation Resolution, which includes support from Maritime New Zealand, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence and wildlife experts from Massey University. Operation Resolution involves working with Samoan authorities to understand the implications of this incident and to evaluate salvage options. Personnel have been clearing flotsam from the beach area, and navy divers are regularly assessing the ship's position and status of oil tanks on board. </p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to express our deepest thanks to the Samoan government for their support and patience as we assess the impact of this incident on their exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, and to the Samoan personnel who rescued the ship's crew and passengers on that fateful Saturday night. </p>
        
            <p>"Sir, we are also grateful for the support provided by His Majesty's Ship Tamar of the Royal Navy and other partners. The Defence Force is investigating options to mitigate the capability loss as a result of the HMNZS Manawanui sinking. The navy still has diving and survey capabilities that operate independently of Manawanui and are therefore still available and deployable further considerations, including as part of the upcoming defence capability plan, will provide options for broader and longer-term solutions. </p>
        
            <p>"On Thursday, 10 October, Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding, announced the details of the New Zealand Defines Force Court of Inquiry into the matter. This inquiry will collect and record evidence and report on the sequence of events leading up to the loss of the ship, the cause of the grounding, the subsequent sinking, and details on notification procedures, along with injuries sustained and of course, any environmental damage. We do know that there will be many questions, but the appropriate process does need to play out through the Court of Inquiry, which is being conducted strictly in accordance with the Armed Force Discipline Act,</p>
        
            <p>"The government recognizes the high level of public interest in the matter and will continue to keep the New Zealand public informed as new information comes to light, subject to privacy, national security and commercial sensitivity concerns. </p>
        
            <p>"It is important, sir, that we do not rush to speculate on what happened, and also to allow the court of inquiry process to play out. While we do not yet know what caused this terrible incident, I do wish to echo the sentiments of Minister of Defence Judith Collins that we do know that the ship's captain's gender had no role to play in the incident. </p>
        
            <p>"Sir, our personnel are highly skilled, and it is a testament to their courage, comradeship and commitment that the evacuation of HMNZS Manawanui was carried out safely, that is, with no loss of life. The government will continue to do everything that we can to continue to mitigate the impact of this incident on Samoa and the wider Pacific."</p>
