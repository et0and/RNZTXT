            <p>An urban planning academic says there are not enough unisex toilets in the country despite Winston Peter's suggestion that anyone who wants to use one can.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First unveiled its 'Fair Access to Bathrooms Bill' earlier this month which the party said was primarily about the safety of women and girls.</p>
        
            <p>The bill aims to ensure that all new non-domestic publicly accessible buildings provide separate, clearly demarcated, unisex and single sex bathrooms.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand First campaigned to defend the right to privacy, personal safety, and freedom from harm for all New Zealanders, and this bill demonstrates a much-needed commonsense solution to an issue that has often been overshadowed by ideology," Peters said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Under the bill, anyone who used a single-sex toilet who was not the sex for which that toilet was designated would be fined.</p>
        
            <p>Peters took to the social media platform X to promote the new bill, saying "It's not difficult".</p>
        
            <p>In the post, the deputy prime minister also defined woman as, "Adult. Human. Female."</p>
        
            <p>"So obviously he's getting into the transgender people in toilets debate there," Bill McKay, a senior lecturer in architecture and planning at the University of Auckland, told Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said that while many toilet designs complied with the Building Code, the rules were a minimum standard.</p>
        
            <p>"Ask yourself when you last saw a queue outside male toilets [or] female toilets with a queue outside. They probably complied with the building code, but as I always say the built environment's racist, ageist, ableist and guess what, sexist as well."</p>
        
            <p>According to the Building Code, there were two approaches to the design of toilet buildings, said McKay.</p>
        
            <p>The first approach was to have male and female toilets with separate cubicles. However, the walls were not floor to ceiling and the wash hand basins are outside.</p>
        
            <p>For male toilets, the urinals were out in the open and "really good school bullying territory as I seem to recall from my highschool," McKay said.</p>
        
            <p>The second option, which he said was "much more prevalent these days", was cubicles with floor to ceiling walls, proper doors and wash hand basins that were inside the cubicle.</p>
        
            <p>While these were "much more pleasant", according to McKay, they could have a slower turnover.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said unisex toilets were becoming more prevalent, particularly in bars and restaurants because they saved space, but they tended to be a bit more expensive.</p>
        
            <p>Personally, he did not think unisex toilets worked in bars.</p>
        
            <p>"Young women don't want some old drunk guy following them in to the unisex toilets [and] female toilets can be a safe space for discussion."</p>
        
            <p>However unisex toilets in malls, cinemas and libraries were a good idea, McKay said.</p>
        
            <p>He pointed to the example of a father with his young daughter or an elderly couple to assist each other.</p>
        
            <p>"For good design ... think of the users and go beyond the Building Code minimum.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand way of course is to do the adequate, cheap option ... that's why transgender people will often not find a unisex option anywhere."</p>
