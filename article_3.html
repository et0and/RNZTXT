            <p>A police scene examination and post-mortem have been completed in the investigation into the death of an eight-month-old baby at a Wellington housing complex.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Newtown Park Apartments on Mansfield Street, which are owned by Wellington City Council, just before midday on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police inquiries into what happened in the lead-up to the baby's death were ongoing, and the family were fully cooperating with officers.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they acknowledged it was a very distressing time for the baby's mother and the wider family, and they continued to support and work with them.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week residents reported seeing a "distressed mother" with a baby in her arms.</p>
        
            <p>Officers have also been speaking to residents and had been doing a scene investigation.</p>
