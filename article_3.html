            <p>A hostage situation in Blenheim that lasted nearly a day has been peacefully resolved.</p>
        
            <p>A 44-year-old man was arrested about 4.35pm and a baby that was inside the house has been recovered safey and is uninjured, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the house just after 5pm on Friday, Marlborough Area Commander Inspector Simon Feltham, said after a man arrived with a gun.</p>
        
            <p>"The Police Negotiation Team has been at the address since last night, engaging with the man while he remained inside the house with the baby," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police's focus has been the welfare of resolving the incident safely for all concerned and we are very pleased that has now been achieved.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have also deployed tactical staff and other staff to achieve this outcome, and we've been supported by the New Zealand Defence Force."</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours were asked to stay in temporary accommodation on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>There was no risk to the wider community, police said.</p>
