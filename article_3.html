        <h2>'A massive occasion for Auckland' – Blues old boys fired up for Crusaders clash</h2>
        <p>
The hair might be a little greyer, but the fire to compete still burns strong for some of the Blues' champions of the past, Jamie Wall writes.

            <p>The hair might be a little greyer, but the fire to compete still burns strong for some of the Blues' champions of the past.</p>
        
            <p>The team hosted an alumni breakfast at their Epsom training base on Tuesday morning, with John Afoa, Charles Riechelmann, Brad Mika and Doug Howlett all looking forward to Saturday night's match against the struggling Crusaders at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>The old boys joined the 2024 players and their coaching squad to impart some wisdom, as the fourth-placed Blues look to improve their record this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a massive occasion for Auckland and for the boys," said Afoa, whose remarkable 22-season pro career ironically ended last year with a brief stint in the red and black jersey.</p>
        
            <p>"I know it's early in the season, but it feels like a real crossroads for both teams.</p>
        
            <p>"When you lose five key members, that's going to be an issue. But they're a side that's always prided themselves on depth. They're a good team and they have that history, so they'll be just looking to get that first win… just hopefully it's not this week."</p>
        
            <p>Afoa is one of a surprisingly high number of test players who have played for both rival teams, alongside Mika, Caleb Ralph, Rico Gear, Ron Cribb and Ali Williams.</p>
        
            <p>"Even Vern (Cotter) coached the Crusaders before being here at the Blues… better that than the Chiefs, you know what I mean?"</p>

            <p>Mika, who won titles with both sides in consecutive seasons in 2002-03, was clear about where his allegiances lie two decades on.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully the Blues boys will do the job. Auckland's my home and my heart's still with the Blues. We were giving John a hard time when he got called up, he's like our age so it was hard case to see him running around."</p>
        
            <p>Former lock Riechelmann, who was part of the Blues' 1996 and '97 Super 12 wins, is adamant that the Blues should not be taking the 0-4 Crusaders lightly.</p>
        
            <p>"Never count them out. This weekend will be tight, it's good for the boys to be home," he said. It is the first game of the season at Eden Park, due to the venue's use for cricket and P!nk's two concerts last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Howlett, who still holds the record as the All Blacks' highest test try scorer with 49, joked about making a comeback so he could add to his 98 games for the Blues.</p>
        
            <p>"I see Vern's in the corner there, I just need a couple of 10 minutes," the 45-year-old said.</p>
        
            <p>"These are great weeks to be a part of, you can feel it in the environment. This is a game that the boys are getting ready for, we've been there and felt that so it's nice to feel that again…I think any time you watch a game at Eden Park you think about what was, how you used to approach games. Being in this environment with the players, understanding their mentality, it takes you back to 20 years ago."</p>
        
            <p>Howlett's nostalgia was shared by his former teammates, although Riechelmann was happy to be in the stands these days.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes you remember the old days, but your body says there's no way… you look at the games and how tough it is, and you think, 'Oh mate, I'm just glad I'm not playing'."</p>
        
            <p>The Blues are anticipating a big crowd at Eden Park, with their Aupiki side playing Matatu as the first part of a double-header. That game kicks off at 4:35pm on a big Super Rugby Saturday, with the Highlanders hosting the Chiefs in another big New Zealand derby match at the same time.</p>
