            <p>New Zealand was originally not expected to participate in the call, but on Friday, Luxon confirmed he had been invited and accepted.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a chance, really, for an update as to the different lines of diplomatic efforts that are going in across securing peace in Ukraine," Luxon said at the time.</p>
