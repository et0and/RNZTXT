            <p>The popular Bluff Oyster and Food Festival risks losing its ability to sell alcohol after digging its toes in over glass beverages.</p>
        
            <p>Running almost every year since 2008, the southern food festival has attracted more than 4000 people to the small town for a day of oysters and entertainment.</p>
        
            <p>But next week it faces a hearing after hitting a speed bump with its alcohol application due to security concerns and a wish to sell glass beverages.</p>
        
            <p>An Invercargill City Council licensing inspector's report said police previously advised they would oppose the festival's next application if glass was included.</p>
        
            <p>Police delivered on that promise, saying the material posed a risk due to breakage and its potential for use as a weapon.</p>
        
            <p>"The applicant is not providing the safest environment possible by selling alcohol in glass containers and has shown little emphasis on their host responsibility by wanting to do so," Southland alcohol harm prevention officer Hayden McNaught said.</p>
        
            <p>Police also took exception to the event being staffed with eight security personnel, saying that number was too few.</p>
        
            <p>A lack of supervision at entry and exit points last year was highlighted as an area of concern.</p>
        
            <p>The festival has agreed to increase the number of security from eight to 10, but remains resolute in its desire to sell alcohol out of glass.</p>
        
            <p>That was despite agreeing to a police request that cans and plastic cups be used at last year's festival.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a more recent request and due to our short time frame to host the 2024 event, we did not oppose it," the festival committee said.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel the recent change without any evidence of issues of violence at our event is unnecessary."</p>
        
            <p>The application has not been opposed by either Health New Zealand or the Bluff Community Board.</p>
        
            <p>The licensing inspector also did not oppose, but noted the application did not comply with the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act or Combined Local Alcohol Policy.</p>
        
            <p>It made a suite of recommendations including that alcohol only be sold in cans and cups, continuous monitoring of the entranceway, no alcohol to leave the venue, and sound levels to remain within council limits.</p>
        
            <p>Minutes from a debrief following the 2024 festival show organisers were disappointed someone had been able to bring a bottle of wine into the event through an unmanned entrance.</p>
        
            <p>The festival returned last year after a two-year hiatus due to Covid and issues with a nearby hotel which has since been demolished.</p>
        
            <p>This year's festival will take place on 24 May, with the hearing set for Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the applicant's reasoning for wanting to use glass was that customers were dissatisfied with drinking out of cans.</p>
