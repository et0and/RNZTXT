            <p>The government has agreed to give Ruapehu Alpine Lifts (RAL) a $7 million bailout.</p>
        
            <p>It has told the operator it will be its last taxpayer bailout, with Regional Development Minister Shane Jones saying "this is the last chance saloon".</p>
        
            <p>This is RAL's fifth multimillion-dollar bailout in the last 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>In October 2023, the government gave the company - which is in voluntary administration - an extra $7m.</p>
        
            <p>That was on top of a $5m loan announced in June 2023 and $2m and $6m in November and December 2022 respectively.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Conservation Minister Tama Potaka said the latest bailout was to ensure the 2024 ski season could go ahead on the Whakapapa ski field.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet had also agreed to provide $3.05m in equity and loan funding to support the sale of T큰roa ski field assets to Pure T큰roa Ltd, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said this was RAL's final opportunity to find a commercially viable solution for Whakapapa.</p>
        
            <p>It also provided more certainty for T큰roa.</p>
        
            <p>"The government cannot indefinitely sustain the ski fields. That is why Cabinet is signalling a clear end point," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"If no acceptable commercially led solution can be found within the next year, there will be no additional government funding for RAL's Whakapapa ski operations."</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the government's preferred bidder, Tom Elworthy, walked away from negotiations on purchasing the Whakapapa skifield.</p>
        
            <p>Elworthy said the deal was not worth it and no-one would be willing to take on a business with more than $15m of debt repayments and other risks.</p>
        
            <p>The uncertainty over the skifield's future was "frustrating for local businesses", Ruapehu District mayor Wes Kirton said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"It turns over something like $100m collectively between the two mountains through our industry and that's certainly a big hit for the community."</p>
        
            <p>Ruapehu Skifield Stakeholders Association earlier put forward a proposal to run Whakapapa and T큰roa together as a not-for-profit, using crowdfunding and having iwi on board.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment did not engage with the idea.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said snow tourism was a large employer in the region, supporting about 800 full-time equivalent jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Checkpoint, Jones said it was "last chance saloon" for RAL and the skifields had "run out of motorway".</p>
        
            <p>They had been struggling for years, he said, due to Covid-19 "and a host of other challenges".</p>
        
            <p>Jones said RAL's receivers and his own staff hoped someone would buy both businesses, but due diligence had to be done.</p>
        
            <p>In total, $32 million had been "poked into this enterprise" since 2020, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously the local community are highly agitated, but I have to repeat what my mandate is: this is the last chance saloon, I have no authority to give another cracker."</p>
        
            <p>Asked why the government was spending millions on a skifield rather than on a better police pay offer or free school lunches, Jones said the money had been "set aside in a fund" to work with businesses.</p>
