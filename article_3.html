            <p>This year's Budget has been revealed and like any year, there are the haves and have-nots.</p>
        
            <p>While some of it is up for debate depending on what side of the political spectrum you lean towards, here are a few of the outcomes of the government's funding divvy-up this year.</p>
        
            <p>'Back Pocket Boost' is back</p>
        
            <p>The Budget documents stated 1.9 million households would benefit from the overall relief package by an average of $30 a week. Households with children would benefit by $39 a week on average.</p>
        
            <p>A minimum wage worker can expect about $12.50 a week, while superannuitants will take home just $4.50 a week.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Earner Tax Credit is also being expanded, with the upper limit for eligibility rising from an income of $48,000 to $70,000, with amounts reducing from $66,000+ instead of $44,000+.</p>
        
            <p>The in-work tax credit will also go up by up to $25 a week from 31 July. National had campaigned on that kicking in from 1 April.</p>
        
            <p>The relief package also includes a childcare payment for low-and-middle-income households as already announced by Willis in March.</p>
        
            <p>Roads</p>
        
            <p>The government is pumping $2.68 billion in to transport over four years, and more than two thirds of that's being spent on roads.</p>
        
            <p>There is $1b over four years to accelerate Roads of National Significance and $939.3 million over four years to repair roads damaged during North Island weather events.</p>
        
            <p>Health</p>
        
            <p>Healthcare's getting a whopping $16.7b in new funding - though that's spread over three Budgets.</p>
        
            <p>Among the standout amounts there are:</p>
        
            <p>Landlords</p>
        
            <p>There's $729m being spent on restoring interest deductibility for residential rental property.</p>
        
            <p>Police</p>
        
            <p>Police are getting $226.1m over four years for an extra 500 police and there's also $424.9m over four years to support frontline policing.</p>
        
            <p>Education</p>
        
            <p>Schools and kura kaupapa property are getting a $1.48b boost over four years and there's also $200m in grants for operating schools, too.</p>
        
            <p>There are also boosts for school IT infrastructure and subsidies for ECEs and tertiary tuition and training.</p>
        
            <p>Māori </p>
        
            <p>There's $12 million over four years for Kōhanga Reo property maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>Te Matatini received another boost in this years budget, from 2025 they will get $48.7m over three years. That goes with the $34m over two years the National kapa haka festival received in Budget 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Natural disaster response</p>
        
            <p>There's a fair bit in the Budget for this sector and it's perhaps no surprise, coming in the wake of the mop-up for events like Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>This $939.3m is clearly that - spread over four years, it's to repair roads damaged during Cyclone Gabrielle, the Auckland floods and other North Island weather events.</p>
        
            <p>There's $200m for flood infrastructure upgrades in the $1.2b Regional Infrastructure Fund.</p>
        
            <p>In the same sphere, there's $5m for the creation of the National Infrastructure Agency and the somewhat adjacent $106.9m over four years operational funding for GeoNet and the National Seismic Hazard Model.</p>
        
            <p>There's also $23.1m over four years for critical frontline rescue services to respond to severe weather events and emergencies.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, the Climate Emergency Response Fund is getting $597m, paid for through the ETS.</p>
        
            <p>Local councils</p>
        
            <p>The Waste Disposal Levy is being expanded to cover a wider range of projects with an expected result of $1.195b over four years.</p>
        
            <p>The country's debt level</p>
        
            <p>The government borrowing programme over the next four years was increased by $12b from December's forecast.</p>
        
            <p>Net debt is forecast to peak at 43.5 percent of GDP in 2025 and is forecast to remain above the government's 40 percent ceiling for the following three years.</p>
        
            <p>Tax evaders</p>
        
            <p>It's not a good day if you're a tax evader - the government is pumping $147m into cracking down on tax evasion.</p>
        
            <p>The next lot of first-year uni students</p>
        
            <p>The government is switching fees-free from first year to final year of university - with an expected saving of $220m.</p>
        
            <p>Overseas student loan borrowers</p>
        
            <p>Interest rates for overseas borrowers are set to increase from 3.9 percent to 4.9 percent from 1 April 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Online gambling operators</p>
        
            <p>It's expected there will be $47m extra from taxing online casino operators.</p>
        
            <p>Māori</p>
        
            <p>The disestablishment of Te Aka Whai Ora, the Māori Health Authority is set to save the government $35.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>Ongoing funding of $40 million for new supply and capability of Māori housing has been cut. This returns uncontracted funding.</p>
        
            <p>And $20 million of funding for Rangatahi transitional housing has been returned to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, this funding was also uncontracted.</p>
        
            <p> NZ Film Commission, NZ Symphony Orchestra, and Nga Taonga Sound and Vision</p>
        
            <p>The government's saving $5.55m over four years by spending less on these institutions.</p>
        
            <p>The Consumer Advocacy Council</p>
        
            <p>It's being scrapped - that's a saving of $5.72m over four years.</p>
        
            <p>Energy programmes</p>
        
            <p>The government's saving $38.27m over four years by scaling down initiatives like the Community Renewable Energy Fund.</p>
        
            <p>There's also $178m over four years in savings from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, including discontinuing new Warmer Kiwi Homes subsidies for hot water heaters, energy-efficiency measures, an LED lighting scheme, and community-focused outreach for hard-to-reach households.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Science City project </p>
        
            <p>It's gone - and being scrapped to the tune of $462.8m of savings over four years.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac</p>
        
            <p>During the campaign, National pledged to give Pharmac an extra $70m a year over four years in ring-fenced funding to target 13 specific cancers.</p>
        
            <p>However, that hadn't been possible this budget, Willis said - but noted the coalition remained committed to following through on its commitment in future Budgets.</p>
