            <p>Adventurous young penguins are biting off more than they can chew, leaving themselves stuck in strange places on their quest to reach the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend, the Oamaru Blue Penguin Colony rescued four young penguins found outside Milligans Food Group, Z petrol station, the Criterion and Oamaru Doctors.</p>
        
            <p>Another bird was found at Waitaki Girls' High School on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Penguin Colony science and environmental manager Dr Philippa Agnew said it had reached the point in the breeding cycle where young birds were heading out to sea, but some had either lost their way or left prematurely.</p>
        
            <p>The colony rescued the birds and fed them for a week or two until they were ready to complete their journey.</p>
        
            <p>It was not a bad experience for them, as there were often a few chicks in the same situation they could socialise with, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Those heading out to sea were not the only ones getting lost.</p>
        
            <p>Some larger chicks would come out at night to wait for their parents, but then wander a little too far and find themselves stuck throughout the day.</p>
        
            <p>Adult penguins would also be land-bound for a while soon with the upcoming moulting season.</p>
        
            <p>Penguins were "really vulnerable" in these positions and it was a reminder that people needed to abide by the dog bylaws and keep their pets leashed in areas they were allowed, she said.</p>
        
            <p>A common location for penguins to hide was in the harbour precinct, under barrels or in vents.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who found a penguin should contact the colony with the exact location and time of the sighting, she said.</p>
        
            <p>If a penguin was in imminent danger outside of the colony's opening hours, a solution was to put it carefully into a box and contact the colony to collect it later.</p>
