            <p>The parents of Jake and Callum Robinson have made an emotional statement about the loss of their sons, saying: "The world has become a darker place for us".</p>
        
            <p>"It is with heavy hearts that we share the news that Callum and Jake have been murdered," mother Debra Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts are broken and the world has become a darker place for us.</p>
        
            <p>"We also mourn the loss of [Jack] Carter Rhoad, a close friend. They were young men enjoying their passion of surfing together."</p>
        
            <p>Debra and Martin Robinson were speaking from the beach in San Diego that was their son Callum's local surf break and adopted home in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>After making the journey to California from their home in Perth, the couple travelled across the border into Mexico to identify their sons over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"Now it's time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia," Debra said.</p>
        
            <p>"Please live bigger, shine brighter and love harder in their memory."</p>
        
            <p>The couple painted a picture of their two sons - close brothers and much-loved friends to many.</p>
        
            <p>"We have always been very proud of their academic and sporting achievements, and admired their life choices," Debra said.</p>
        
            <p>"Callum was a loveable, larger-than-life character and considered the United States his second home.</p>
        
            <p>"Known as the big koala, he played professional lacrosse in the PLL [Premier Lacrosse League] and represented Australia in the world championships and always found time to coach junior teams."</p>
        
            <p>Debra said Jake was "a happy, gentle and compassionate soul who was pursuing a career in medicine".</p>
        
            <p>"Jake's passion was surfing and it was no coincidence that many of the hospitals that he worked in were close to surfing beaches," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Debra said she knew how much her sons were loved.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of emotions and support that we have received for Callum and Jake," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that they were truly loved and impacted many people's lives."</p>
        
            <p>Martin Robinson thanked friends and family who had been "a massive support" to the couple as they left Australia to find their sons and over recent days.</p>
        
            <p>He also thanked consulate staff, Australian agencies and Foreign Minister Penny Wong.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to thank Foreign Minister Wong, who took time out of her busy schedule yesterday to call us with support," he said.</p>

            <p>The bodies of Callum and Jake Robinson were believed to still be in Mexico as the family worked through the logistics of getting their boys home.</p>
        
            <p>The two Australian brothers, along with their American friend, had been travelling the Baja California coastline on a surf trip when the Robinsons raised the alarm that their sons had not been in contact or checked into their accommodation as planned.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday morning local time, the bodies of the three missing men were found near a cliff on the Pacific coast, a local government official in Mexico's north-west told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>The attorney-general for Baja California said their primary hypothesis was the men were killed in a robbery gone awry, with the murderers attempting to steal the tyres off a ute before being confronted.</p>
        
            <p>But given the level of cartel activity in the area, authorities said they could not rule out organised crime links. Particularly given the men's bodies were found in a well with a seemingly unconnected victim.</p>
        
            <p>The three accused remain in custody, with more charges expected to be upgraded on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Mexican national Jes√∫s Gerardo Garcia Cota, who was also known by the alias "El Kekas", had been charged with forced disappearance before the bodies were formally identified.</p>
        
            <p>He was expected to be charged with the three murders and will appear in court tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>His brother, Christian Alejandro, and romantic partner 23-year-old Ari Gisell Silva Raya were also arrested in relation to the disappearances but have not been charged.</p>
        
            <p>The attorney-general has previously indicated more than one person will be charged over the murders.</p>
        
            <p>The murders forced a crowd of about 500 people onto the streets of Ensenada, with protesters chanting in Spanish, "we want security".</p>
        
            <p>Some held surfboards with messages including "Australia, we are with you" and "They only wanted to surf, and they executed them".</p>
        
            <p>Local surfers also participated in a memorial paddle out nearby at Playa San Miguel.</p>
        
            <p>In San Diego, another paddle-out planned for this Saturday will again honour the three men.</p>
