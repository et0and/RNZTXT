        <h2>What a state-of-the-art research ship actually looks like</h2>
        <p>

            <p>A state-of-the-art German research ship is giving local scientists new insight into the ocean floor, scouting underwater volcanos and coral reefs around the motū.</p>
        
            <p>During a layover in Wellington this week - to swap out scientists and equipment - guests were welcomed on-board to hear about the voyage and more coming up.</p>
        
            <p>RV Sonne, meaning "sun", has just got back from a month at sea surveying coral reefs from the little-explored Colville Ridge, to the Graveyard sea-mounts on Chatham Rise and the Fiords of Southland.</p>
        
            <p>Marine biologist at Niwa Dr Kareen Schnabel said the technology on board allowed them to see things in detail like never before.</p>

            <p>On deck, she pointed out a large cube, more than a metre high and made up of metal pipes and plastic, called the Ocean Floor Observation System - or OFOS.</p>
        
            <p>It was capable of working at depths of 4000 metres, towed along by the ship. On their most recent mission, it reached depths of 1200m.</p>
        
            <p>With the footage it captured, scientists could analyse the abundance and distribution of animals and plants on the sea floor.</p>
        
            <p>Schnabel said similar surveys had been carried out for the past 20 years, and comparing the results was useful for scientists.</p>
        
            <p>Another piece of equipment at their disposal was the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), supplied by MARUM - Centre for Marine Environmental Sciences, which powered itself along the sea floor and captured even more detailed photographs and video.</p>

            <p>"What really did blow my mind was the resolution," Schnabel said.</p>
        
            <p>"The level of accuracy and the high definition footage and the zoom capability are something we do not have. We have a general understanding of these communities... but we do not have the capability to look at them in such a fine scale."</p>
        
            <p>Chief scientist for the voyage just gone Dr André Freiwald wanted to better understand the geology and biology of coral reefs - especially the effect of human disturbances.</p>
        
            <p>"We know from Niwa that some sea-mounts were totally fished and destroyed by bottom trawling gear, and we saw it and it was desperate. But next to it, we saw unfished sea-mounts, with real pristine coral reefs with all the primary associated community. That was mind blowing."</p>
        
            <p>But there had not been many signs of recolonisation, he said, with indications it was taking decades for corals to begin growing back in damaged areas.</p>

            <p>On the bridge of the ship, second mate Reese Osta explained they were the testing ground for some exciting new technology.</p>
        
            <p>The new dynamic positioning system allowed the ship to park itself, and then keep itself in position with the help of sensors and thrusters.</p>
        
            <p>But not all of it was popular with the crew, he said, pointing out a touchscreen on a bench - the ship's new digital logbook.</p>
        
            <p>Behind him sat the ship's traditional method, a paper book and a pen.</p>
        
            <p>"Not everybody's a fan of it," he said of the digital addition. A paper book was tradition, and he found information like the weather and the ship's position stuck in his brain better when he manually recorded it.</p>
        
            <p>Up another flight of stairs, in the crow's nest, meteorologist Patrick Suter had the best view on the ship.</p>

            <p>Not every ship had its own meteorologist, usually relying on local weather forecasts, but Suter said there was nothing like being there.</p>
        
            <p>Did he prefer calm to storm?</p>
        
            <p>"I think every meteorologist prefers stormy weather," he said, laughing.</p>
        
            <p>But chief scientist on the next expedition Sebastian Krastel, of Kiel University, cut in: "And every scientist prefers the other thing!"</p>
        
            <p>The next departure will see a fresh batch of scientists heading to the Palliser and Pegasus canyons, on another month-long voyage.</p>
