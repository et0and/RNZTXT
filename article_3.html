            <p>A man in Invercargill has been arrested after choosing to rob perhaps the worst possible victims - a group of elite cyclists.</p>
        
            <p>The cyclists were enjoying a post-race meal on Saturday, police said, when an opportunistic thief grabbed one of their bikes and took off.</p>
        
            <p>"Two of the cyclists mounted their trusty bikes and went into pursuit of the man," Sergeant Geoff Sutherland said.</p>
        
            <p>The suspect "did not stand a chance", he said, only making it three blocks before the athletes sandwiched him in.</p>
        
            <p>"For him, the race was over."</p>
        
            <p>The "out-of-breath" offender was arrested without incident a minute later, Sutherland said.</p>
        
            <p>The $15,000 racing bike suffered only minor damage, and its owner was back racing it the next day.</p>
        
            <p>A 31-year-old man charged with theft will appear in Invercargill District Court on Monday.</p>
