            <p>It's been a tough year for businesses around the country.</p>
        
            <p>In November, company liquidations were up 27 percent year-on-year, according to Centrix.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses large and small suffered - and even some big names did not make it.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some of the prominent businesses that did not survive 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklanders were shocked in July when Ponsonby favourite SPQR closed its doors.</p>
        
            <p>The restaurant opened in 1992.</p>
        
            <p>"The hospitality industry is struggling and has been since the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it's hard out there for people and when the dollar is tight, this sector suffers," liquidator Stephen Lawrence told RNZ at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The fallout from SolarZero's liquidation continues.</p>
        
            <p>Owned by international asset manager BlackRock, SolarZero provided leased solar energy systems to about 15,000 houses around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But it was placed into liquidation because the business was not sustainable, BlackRock said.</p>
        
            <p>The problem for the government is that the NZ Green investment Fund had set up a taxpayer-funded lending facility of $145m for SolarZero, of which it said about $115m had been drawn down.</p>

            <p>There was some good news in this story for pie lovers. Maketū Pies went into liquidation in November after years of losses, but was saved by new owners.</p>
        
            <p>Privately owned catering business Montana Group took over the 42-year-old brand and its about 20 employees in early December.</p>
        
            <p>Organic and wholefoods grocer Huckleberry went into liquidation in the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>In their report, liquidators said the failure was driven by a downturn in customer numbers and spending, as well as a reduction in turnover.</p>
        
            <p>"The result of this was he revenue was no longer able to sustain the company's outgoings or expenses."</p>
        
            <p>Ezibuy hit trouble again this year.</p>
        
            <p>Its parent company, Mosaic Brands, appointed administrators. Its other brands, such as Katies and Millers, were also affected.</p>
        
            <p>Mosaic told the ASX that a "small number of stakeholders" did not support its proposals for restructure, or negotiating a commercial outcome, and Mosaic could not reach an acceptable resolution with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over proceedings relating to the late or non-delivery of goods during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, voluntary administrators were appointed to Ezibuy, which owed more than $100 million to creditors.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Mosaic said its significant decline in sales through 2022 was at odds with the rest of the business.</p>
        
            <p>But Mosaic bought it back earlier this year, planning a simplified online-only operation.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington co-working space Digital Nomad did not make it until the end of the year, either.</p>
        
            <p>Liquidators said the main reason was that it was too difficult to maintain a sustainable level of tenants and revenue to make the operation profitable.</p>
        
            <p>"The working landscape has been changing in Wellington for the last few years since Covid-19 and the shift to working from home has made it particularly challenging to secure tenants."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland-based plumbing supplies business Franklins went into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>It had been owned by the Smith family for 69 years.</p>
        
            <p>But it said the "changing landscape of the building industry and the current state of the economy" had led the director to make the decision to shut the business.</p>
        
            <p>Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said he hoped the year ahead would be an easier one.</p>
        
            <p>"But business failures is a lagging indicator. Many businesses that limp through the recession are not in good shape for the recovery, so there will be a tail of businesses which will continue to fail for the next year or so.</p>
        
            <p>"But many other businesses will benefit from a cyclical recovery. The key risks are when the economic recovery takes hold: two headwinds from sharply slowing net migration and prospect of more intense fiscal austerity.</p>
        
            <p>"Both could delay the positive effects of lower interest rates and returning hope among consumers and businesses. "</p>
