        <h2>No anaesthetic: Woman's 'horrific pain' during treatment</h2>
        <p>
A senior doctor said she was shaken by the pain they had caused with a live electrical loop.

It felt like the electrically surging wire was cutting through her cervix, the woman said.

            <p>A woman screamed in pain when a live electrical loop was placed on her cervix without anaesthetic during a medical procedure, a critical report has found.</p>
        
            <p>The Health and Disablity Commission has released its findings on a complaint into the 2019 incident which happened at Auckland's Greenlane Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The woman, in her 20s at the time, screamed out as the wire loop touched her cervix during the treatment to have abnormal cells removed.</p>
        
            <p>Local anaesthetic should have been administered but had not.</p>
        
            <p>"Now you're going to hear a buzz from the machine but you won't feel a thing," she was told, but she was then "filled with the most incredibly horrific pain", she told the commission.</p>
        
            <p>It felt like the electrically surging wire was cutting through her cervix, she said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the doctors told her to stop her legs shaking because she was interfering with the procedure.</p>
        
            <p>They stopped and asked if she would like to reschedule the procedure or have it under general anaesthetic.</p>
        
            <p>The women decided to go ahead because she was afraid if she did not the abnormal cells would develop into cancer, she told the commission.</p>
        
            <p>Anaesthetic was then applied and the treatment continued.</p>
        
            <p>Two doctors were involved: one a senior gynaecological oncologist, the other a junior doctor.</p>
        
            <p>The commission found the junior doctor should have applied the local anaesthetic before the procedure started, but the senior doctor was ultimately responsible for making sure she had.</p>
        
            <p>Neither had provided the patient with an appropriate standard of care and skill, the report found.</p>
        
            <p>The senior doctor said she was shaken by the pain they had caused. She tried to contact the woman later and sent an apology letter.</p>
        
            <p>The patient was eventually given a formal apology by Te Whatu Ora Health NZ.</p>
        
            <p>The woman had also complained she received burns to her vagina and upper thigh from iodine used in another part of the treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Morag McDowell recommended Te Whatu Ora update its policy to make sure patients who had suffered an adverse event or who have been particularly distressed during an appointment get a phone call to follow up.</p>
        
            <p>And the agency should consider using saline wash at after any gynaecological procedures that use iodine.</p>
