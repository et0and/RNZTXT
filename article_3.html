            <p>Campaigning Australian journalist and filmmaker John Pilger has died aged 84, his family has announced.</p>
        
            <p>A statement by his relatives on X said he died in London on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>They described Pilger as "simply the most amazing and loved dad, grandad and partner".</p>
        
            <p>He was a vocal and sometimes controversial critic of Western foreign policy. He was also outspoken over the treatment of Indigenous Australians.</p>
        
            <p>Pilger was born in Bondi, New South Wales in 1939, but was based in the United Kingdom since the 1960s. He worked for outlets including Reuters and the Daily Mirror.</p>
        
            <p>He was best known for his work as a foreign correspondent, including reporting on the Vietnam War, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and from the United States during the turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>He was in the same room when Robert Kennedy was assassinated while running to be the Democratic nominee for the 1968 presidential election, according to his website.</p>
        
            <p>He made numerous documentaries, including the 1979 film Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia, about the country under Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, as well as many about Australia and its treatment of Indigenous Australians.</p>
        
            <p>In a 1990 interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he had always been "interested in the victims of war, the people running the other way".</p>
        
            <p>"Journalism is nothing if it's not about humanity - it has to be about people's lives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He won numerous awards throughout his career, including Britain's Journalist of the Year Award in 1967 and 1979, and Bafta's Richard Dimbleby Award for factual reporting in 1991.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, he was a high-profile supporter of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange - who is currently in Belmarsh Prison, fighting extradition to the US on charges related to the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011.</p>
        
            <p>He has described Assange as a "truth teller who has committed no crime but revealed government crimes and lies on a vast scale".</p>
        
            <p>The official Wikileaks X account described Pilger as a "ferocious speaker of truth to power".</p>
        
            <p>Former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan described Pilger as "a brilliant firebrand journalist and ferocious holder of the powerful to proper account".</p>
        
            <p>John Simpson, the BBC's world affairs editor, said that although he disagreed with Pilger over the years, "I admired the force of his writing, even when I often didn't support what he wrote, and he was always warm when we met".</p>
        
            <p>Former Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow called Pilger "a great and steadfast journalist".</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Lygo, from ITV - on which many of Pilger's documentaries were broadcast - called him a "giant of campaign journalism".</p>
        
            <p>Pilger also courted controversy with his comments on Russia. In a 2014 article for The Guardian, he wrote that President Vladimir Putin was "the only leader to condemn the rise of fascism in 21st-century Europe".</p>
        
            <p>He also told Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, that the Russian nerve agent attack in Salisbury in 2018 was "a carefully constructed drama in which the media plays a role".</p>
