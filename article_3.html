            <p>Whānau Ora chairperson Merepeka Raukawa-Tait says she is concerned the government tabled a bill to repeal section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act during a recess week.</p>
        
            <p>Raukawa-Tait told Mata with Mihingarangi Forbes anything good would have been done while Parliament was in session so full exposure could be given to it.</p>
        
            <p>She believed the timing was chosen to prevent people having their say about it.</p>
        
            <p>Repealing section 7AA was devastating, Raukawa-Tait said.</p>
        
            <p>It had only been implemented in recent years in an attempt by Oranga Tamariki to ensure tamariki do not become disenfranchised and lose their connection with whānau, hapū and iwi.</p>
        
            <p>Staying connected was “very important to their long-term health and wellbeing”, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Raukawa-Tait said Prime Minister Christopher Luxon did not understand what section 7AA was all about – and he needed to learn the history of Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>She said tamariki Māori had “never” been safe in state care and there was a lot the government agency needed to correct.</p>
        
            <p>“I know that it has been trying in recent years, but after so many reports over the last two decades, and that would be 15 to 16 to 18 reports, telling them what they’re doing wrong, what they could do right, telling them about the safety issues, cultural and also the physical and the emotional, and the other areas of concern that need to be addressed.</p>
        
            <p>“So, this was a department that was attempting to do something so just to have it disappear, and not only that, he obviously doesn’t understand that the culture is absolutely important to tamariki and shouldn’t be denied them.</p>
        
            <p>“That is not only their human right, their cultural right, that is their whakapapa right as well.”</p>
