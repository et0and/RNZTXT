            <p>The defending champion Crusaders swept aside the Chiefs 37-26 in a bruising try-fest in Super Rugby Pacific to post their first win of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Leading by eight points in a tense final 10 minute showdown, the Crusaders converted a late penalty to extend their lead for the drought-breaking 11 point win.</p>
        
            <p>The Cantabrians scored five tries to the Chiefs four after opening their account in positive fashion with two tries inside the opening 15 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Johnny McNicholl scored a double for the Crusaders with the side running in five tries for the night in a confidence boosting performance.</p>
        
            <p>McNicholl returned to the Canterbury side recently after playing in Wales for the Scarlets. He grabbed a stunning intercept for his second try, which took the Canterbury side ahead 34 -19 with just under 20 minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders halfback Noah Hotham registered two try assists in a promising start for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs, playing without their All Blacks star Damian McKenzie, produced four tries, and were in the game despite trailing from start to finish.</p>
        
            <p>Second half tries to Anton Lienert-Brown and Cortez Ratima gave the visitors a chance.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders Captain Tom Christie told SkySport the team lifted their performance in both attack and defence.</p>
        
            <p>"The boys fronted tonight and really lifted from what we've had in the past," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It just shows, a little bit of adversity.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it was just a sense of freedom, the shackles were off. We just wanted to come out and play Crusaders rugby and I think we came out and did that."</p>
        
            <p>Christie said motivation was high within the camp to turn around their form after posting five straight losses in a shocking start to the season.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone would give it all for this jersey, it's a special thing."</p>

            <p>Chiefs captain Luke Jacobson said the Crusaders put everything on the line.</p>
        
            <p>"They played with some great tempo, credit to them there," Jacobson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't take them lightly that's for sure but it felt like it was a good game of footy. We came out just a little bit soft in defence.</p>
        
            <p>"We started to play our footy in the second half - we had real confidence but just a few penalties hurt us there."</p>
        
            <p>Another notable performance came from Crusaders hooker George Bell who dotted down after halftime after a brilliant 30 metre run.</p>
        
            <p>Next week the Crusaders have the bye, while the Chiefs host Moana Pasifika in Hamilton.</p>
