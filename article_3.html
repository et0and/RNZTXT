            <p>Olympic breaker Rachel 'Raygun' Gunn has told followers on social media why she made the decision to shut down a comedy musical inspired by her moves.</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted to her Instagram account, Gunn said she learnt about the show through the media and felt "blindsided".</p>
        
            <p>Sydney comedian Steph Broadbridge had to cancel her Raygun-inspired musical after receiving letters from the Olympic breakdancer's lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>"People had assumed we had developed it and we had approved it and it damaged many relationships, both personal and professional," Gunn said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is why my management had to work to quickly to shut it down.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really unfortunate that the show had to be cancelled so close to the launch.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that the artist would have put a lot of work into it and that really sucks but had we known about it sooner, there could have been a different outcome."</p>

            <p>Raygun: The Musical was set to debut in Sydney on Saturday evening at a venue on Oxford Street, in the city's inner east.</p>
        
            <p>Broadbridge had billed the show as "the inspiring story of a groundbreaking breakdancer and new global sensation".</p>
        
            <p>But she announced on Instagram on Saturday that the premiere wouldn't go ahead, after Raygun's lawyers claimed her name and iconic kangaroo dance move were protected intellectual property.</p>
        
            <p>"Raygun's lawyers got in touch with the venue and threatened legal action," Broadbridge said in the Instagram video, offering refunds for the tickets.</p>
        
            <p>In the new video, Gunn said that she had trademarked her name and "famous kangaroo silhouette pose" to block others from using her name and likeness for commercial purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason we did that is because we were notified that there were applications from other parties trying to trademark my name and image for commercial purposes," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The academic and breakdancer said while she trademarked the name and pose, she had not laid claim to the kangaroo dance.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of the kangaroo dance, I did not trademark it or any kangaroo dance and it in no way mimics Aboriginal dance," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was instead inspired by the Australian Olympic Mascot, BK, the boxing kangaroo and I wanted to represent and celebrate that spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"Now I know that this misinformation about the kangaroo dance has upset many members of the Indigenous community and I'm sorry for that and I'm really sorry that this hasn't been corrected sooner.</p>
        
            <p>"I have the utmost respect for Indigenous Australians."</p>
        
            <p>Gunn told viewers that the decision was not about "being able to take a joke".</p>
        
            <p>"I really do strive to support creativity and have loved the ways my performance has sparked so many different artistic interpretations and there was so many fantastic memes that were clever, and funny and creative," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a whole folder of them on my phone so not being able to take a joke is not what the issue here."</p>
        
            <p>Gunn ended her video talking about her difficulties adjusting to her new found fame following her appearance at the Paris Olympics in August.</p>
        
            <p>"Please remember that just because you hear or read something about someone on social media that doesn't mean it's the full story or even that it's true," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Remember also that there is a person behind all this with a family, with friends and who until a few months ago nobody had even heard of.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'm really trying to do my best to navigate this new chapter of my life."</p>
