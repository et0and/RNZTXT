            <p>The number of job ads fell in October in all regions except Taranaki, with real estate and property one of the few industry sectors to record growing demand for workers.</p>
        
            <p>Seek NZ's October employment report indicated job ads fell 6 percent in October over September, 29 percent down on the year earlier, or a drop of 1 percent on the October 2019 pre-Covid-19 period.</p>
        
            <p>The largest cities drove the overall decline, with demand in Auckland down 4 percent, and Wellington and Canterbury each down 6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Manufacturing, transport and logistics saw the number of ads fall by 7 percent, while real estate and property rose 23 percent, and education and training 11 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"A rebound in applications per job ad levels, after a drop the month prior, discounts the idea that candidate interest is plateauing, " Seek country manager Rob Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"Application levels are again close to a record high, which demonstrates the desire for many workers to make a move ahead of Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"For hirers, particularly in industries where worker demand remains high, such as community services and development and hospitality and tourism, this should mean greater choice and a better chance at filling critical roles before the end of the year."</p>
