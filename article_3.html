            <p>The government has told international investors it wants their help deciding on the options for a second WaitematƒÅ Harbour crossing.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to the Infrastructure Investment Summit, Transport Minister Chris Bishop said the government was commencing "early market soundings" on the project, and whether it will be a second bridge or a tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of you will be from countries that have done mega-projects like this. It has been a long, long time since we have," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need your thoughts, and the lessons you have learnt being involved in similar projects."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the study would also ask about financing options, and expected tolling or road pricing would play a part.</p>
        
            <p>He said the first market sounding would take place in April, with a second one taking place later in the year.</p>
        
            <p>He expected to announce a preferred option in mid-2026.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland, and New Zealand, needs this project. And after decades of discussion, we are finally ready to put a stake in the ground," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The market soundings would involve one-on-one engagement with civil contractors, maintenance providers, investors, and debt financiers.</p>
        
            <p>They would be asked for their feedback on design elements and approach to delivery, as well as the market appetite and capacity.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency would also test interest on funding, financing, and procurement options, Bishop said.</p>
