            <p>A Tongan grandfather who was fatally shot in his courier van in an East Auckland on Monday morning is being remembered by his community as a kind and lovely man.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched after Saia Kokohu Vi was found wounded in the van, near his home on Pixie Place in Pakuranga, shortly before he died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Parish priest of St Marks Pakuranga Faher Sherwn Lapaan said the community, both the parish and school, were "deeply grieving" alongside Vi's family.</p>
        
            <p>Lapaan said it was an "incredibly difficult time".</p>
        
            <p>"We have extended our heartfelt support, condolences, and prayers through our school to express our solidarity with the family."</p>

            <p>Vi worked as a postal courier contractor for Post Haste, the company confirmed. Neighbours on the street decribed him as "a kind grandfather".</p>
        
            <p>Police are yet to announce any arrests and neighbour Amanda Craig said the killing had unsettled locals.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it shocked a lot of people, it is very frightening to have something like that happen in such a nice neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't caught the shooter and we don't know who did this. Was it a targeted attack? Was it a random attack? Is the shooter still in the area? Until these questions are answered, we will be scared."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Detective Inspector Shaun Vickers said the investigation was continuing, and formal identification would be carried out in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>"Police inquiries remain ongoing and we continue to speak to witnesses and those providing information as we piece together what has occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"The community can also expect to see an increased police presence in the Pakuranga Heights area throughout the next few days."</p>
        
            <p>Police were still working to locate whoever was involved and because of that, dashcam and CCTV footage was wanted.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who was travelling in Pakuranga Heights between 5.30am and 7.30am on Monday, and who has footage, should speak to police.</p>
        
            <p>Police specifically wanted to hear from people in the Cascades Road, Archmillen Avenue, Hope Farm Avenue or Marvon Downs Avenue area.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to thank those people who have spoken to us already, and encourage anyone who has any information, no matter how small, to get in touch with our team," Vickers said.</p>
