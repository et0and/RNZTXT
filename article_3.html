        <h2>Intense rain, thunderstorms expected for Northland, Auckland</h2>
        <p>
MetService meteorologist John Law says small tornadoes are not out of the question with the North Island's west coast most at risk of damage from strong winds. Audio

            <p>Much of Aotearoa should prepare for unsettled weather this evening and over the next few days, MetService meteorologist John Law says.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of us will find it will be really gusty, really squally winds ... and they really will be quite blustery - bringing with them some heavy rainfall perhaps as we go through this afternoon and this evening .... and some risk of hail as well.</p>
        
            <p>"But for most of us, we will find some hefty showers and some really strong winds over both today and also ... towards tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Law said small tornadoes were not out of the question with the North Island's west coast being most at risk of damage from strong winds.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Emergency Management acting general manager Anna Wallace said although there were no severe weather watches or warnings for the region at this stage, the agency was prepared to respond if necessary.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Emergency Management will be closely montioring the MetService forecast throughout the day today, and should that weather forecast change, we will be provide further updates to the Auckland public."</p>
        
            <p>The agency encouraged people in the region to take care while driving, tie down any outdoor furniture and check their drains and gutters for blockages.</p>
        
            <p>The cold front was bringing snow to parts of central North Island, too.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a heavy snow watch for Taihape from 10am-6pm on Tuesday, with heavy snow above 700 metres.</p>
        
            <p>In the deep south, another heavy snow watch had been issued for Fiordland, Southland, southern Otago and Stewart Island from 5pm Monday until 11am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said people in those areas could expect periods of heavy snow above 300 metres, where amounts may approach warning criteria, and some snow could also affect areas down to sea level on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Road snowfall warnings were in place for the following routes:</p>
        
            <p>Windy weather, thunderstorms and snowfall. There's a lot to fit in the forecast today. https://t.co/KqFoMNvrRr</p>
        
            <p>Polar conditions rolled through parts of the South Island overnight and much of the country could expect colder than average temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>Law told Morning Report it was "definitely a cold and wintery night".</p>
        
            <p>And it wouldn't be the last, with some places 8C colder than usual, particularly in the south, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some areas in the south would see night time temperatures back down below zero.</p>
        
            <p>A south-westerly wind would make it feel colder too, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's worth saying that we're all going to find a bit of cool air coming up towards us as we head through this week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even as we head in towards [Tuesday] night, towards Wednesday, I think we'll find those temperatures back down below average for many spots, even on the North Island as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Spring is a classic season for that real changeability in the weather, we can see our temperatures flip-flopping and yo-yoing as we go through the season.</p>
        
            <p>"It really is one of those changeable seasons but this definitely is on the colder side."</p>
        
            <p>There was a possibility of snowfall on the higher roads around the Central Plateau and RaukÅ«mara Range.</p>
        
            <p>"So really worth taking extra care, extra caution on any of those higher roads ... over the next couple of days."</p>
