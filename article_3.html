            <p>The state-owned enterprises minister Paul Goldsmith says the government has been clear it would not sell state-owned enterprises without campaigning on that.</p>
        
            <p>However, he did not rule out campaigning on such a move in future.</p>
        
            <p>"We've always been clear that if we were going to sell them, we would take that to an election as a commitment, and so we'll do that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said Cabinet had not yet made decisions on what might replace the Interislander ferries.</p>
        
            <p>An independent report on the options for doing so was delivered last month, but has not yet been released.</p>
        
            <p>"These are big decisions to make, we're just going through the options at the moment, and when we've got something to announce, we'll announce it."</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, KiwiRail released a summary of a report on the breakdown-plagued ferries by international maritime assessors Den Norske Veritas (DNV).</p>
        
            <p>Multiple systems on the three ferries were close to obsolescent, including one ship's bridge radar, but they were "operationally safe", just difficult to maintain, KiwiRail said.</p>
        
            <p>Continuing to maintain the ships into the future was estimated to require about an extra $7m a year.</p>
        
            <p>The DNV assessors concluded it was possible to keep the three ships running until at least 2029.</p>
