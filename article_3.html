            <p>Peter Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy two decades ago followed by three Hobbit movies, will serve as a producer of the new films.</p>
        
            <p>The movies are based on books written by JRR Tolkien and set in the fictional land of Middle-earth inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves, and hobbits.</p>
        
            <p>The prior movies in the franchise have earned nearly $6 billion combined at global box offices. The 2003 movie, Return of the King, won 11 Oscars, including best picture.</p>
        
            <p>A previously announced animated Lord of the Rings film, called The War of the Rohirrim, is set for release in theatres this December.</p>
