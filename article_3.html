            <p>Centre Ali Leiataua has scored two tries to power NZ Warriors home 14-6 over Sydney Roosters, breaking an eight-year drought against their rivals at Go Media Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>As they did seven days early, when they came from behind against Manly Sea Eagles on the same ground, the Auckland side trailled for much of the contest, after Kiwis international prop Naufahu Whyte put the visitors ahead in the 22nd minute.</p>
        
            <p>Leiatuau answered, but the Roosters lead 6-4 at halftime and into the final quarter, before Warriors five-eighth Chanel Harris-Tavita rose high to take a kick on the Roosters goal-line and plunge over.</p>
        
            <p>The result still hung in the balance with 10 minutes remaining, but Leiataua loomed large on the right to shrug off a couple of tackles to score his second.</p>
        
            <p>Halfback Luke Metcalf converted to put the margin beyond a converted try, with time running out on their rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Victory may have come at a cost, with star winger Roger Tuivasa-Sheck limping off with a hamstring injury, suffered in a despairing trysaving tackle in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>The win sees the Warriors improve to 2-1 for the NRL season, with a trip across the Tasman to face resurgent Wests Tigers looming next Sunday.</p>
