            <p>Lee Sun-kyun, a South Korean actor of the Oscar-winning film Parasite, has been found dead, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday, citing police.</p>
        
            <p>Lee had been under investigation over illegal drug use allegations amid an ongoing South Korea government crackdown on illegal drugs.</p>
        
            <p>Lee was found unconscious next to charcoal briquettes inside a car at a park in Seoul on Wednesday morning, after his wife reported to police that Lee had left home and she had found what appeared to be a suicide note, Yonhap said.</p>
        
            <p>Seoul's Jongno police station did not immediately respond to phone calls.</p>
        
            <p>South Korea has tough drug laws, and drug crimes are typically punishable by at least six months in prison or up to 14 years for repeat offenders and dealers.</p>
        
            <p>Lee had been questioned three times by police, including for 19 hours over the weekend. The actor had said he was tricked into taking drugs by a bar hostess who then tried to blackmail him, Yonhap reported.</p>
        
            <p>Born in 1975, Lee starred as a rich family's father in Parasite, and also played leading roles in South Korean movies including the 2012 thriller Helpless and 2014's All About My Wife, among others.</p>
        
            <p>Lee had the lead role in Apple TV+'s first Korean-language original series, which rolled out in 2021. Dr Brain, a six-episode sci-fi thriller, was about a cold-hearted neurologist, Koh Se-won, who tries to find clues to a mysterious family accident through brain experiments.</p>
