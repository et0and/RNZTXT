            <p>A 57-year-old man has been arrested after a publicity stunt on a motorway overbridge in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the East Tāmaki overbridge on the Southern Motorway after reports of a man who appeared to be injured about 7.46am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrived to find the man "who was pretending to be injured as part of what we can only describe as reckless behaviour in an attempt to gain publicity", Inspector Danny Meade said.</p>
        
            <p>"Emergency services from across Tāmaki Makaurau have been put in a situation where considerable time and resources were tied up as we dealt with this incident, not to mention the inconvenience to the public due to the lane closures involved.</p>
        
            <p>"The was a significant and unnecessary incident, that in no doubt will have impacted many people over the disturbing sight.</p>
        
            <p>"It is also incredibly lucky this man's reckless actions did not cause injury to himself, or any other road users."</p>
