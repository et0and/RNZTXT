            <p>Auckland police investigating the 1980 homicide of Simon Buis are appealing for information after new details were revealed in an episode of Cold Case last night.</p>
        
            <p>In the early hours of the morning on 4 April 1980, the 54-year-old was found dead in Auckland's Gribblehirst Park outside the rugby club. Police said he had face and head injuries after being violently assaulted.</p>
        
            <p>Later that morning, two 15 year olds who were arrested for being in a stolen car indicated they were involved in a fight at a park.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were charged with Buis' murder but police said they were released six days later after the evidence was reviewed.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Scott Beard has been in charge of the case dubbed Operation Intrigue since 2006.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, he said the key to the case relied on knowing Simon Buis' movements in the last hour of his life.</p>
        
            <p>"We know Simon started his evening at the Leopard Tavern in Freeman's Bay, where he then made his way to La Cava Lounge on Customs Street East. Here, he interacted with at least three different groups of people.</p>
        
            <p>"Simon then called a taxi from La Cava and was dropped off on Symonds Street around 2.25am on the Friday morning."</p>
        
            <p>About 30 minutes later, a couple heard screaming followed by the sound of a noisy car coming from Gribblehirst Park and called 111.</p>
        
            <p>Police had spoken to the couple, along with a number of people who were in Gribblehirst Park earlier that evening, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The key pieces of information we are missing is why Simon went to Gribblehirst Park, how he got there, and who he was with. We believe it is unlikely that Simon walked the distance in the timeframe between the taxi dropping him off on Symonds Street and Police arriving to find his body in the park," Beard said.</p>

            <p>Beard said two cars seen leaving the park on the night were central to the investigation - a light-coloured Mark 1 Ford Zephyr, or possibly a large American 1950s car, with a noisy exhaust and a yellow FJ Holden.</p>

            <p>Anyone with information about the death or who may have seen what happened is asked to contact the police.</p>
        
            <p>"These details and fresh information will help us get the answers we need to provide some closure for Simon's family," Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>Information can be provided to the Operation Intrigue Investigation team on 0800 COLD CASE or 0800 2653 2273.</p>
