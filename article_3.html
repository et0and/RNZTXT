            <p>Two planes have collided at Heathrow Airport, causing damage to both aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>The incident involved a British Airways plane with 121 passengers on board and a Virgin Atlantic plane. Heathrow said there were no injuries and no delays.</p>
        
            <p>Virgin Atlantic said its empty Boeing 787-9 was being towed from the stand at Terminal 3 when the collision happened.</p>
        
            <p>The airline added that the plane had just landed and was being transported to a different part of the airfield.</p>
        
            <p>One of the wings of the plane being towed clipped the other aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>The passengers on the British Airways flight were scheduled to depart to Accra, Ghana, at 12:40 BST.</p>
        
            <p>British Airways said it provided an alternative aircraft for them, which was rescheduled to take off at 18:00.</p>
        
            <p>Virgin Atlantic said it was investigating and that maintenance checks were being made on its aircraft, which has been taken out of service.</p>
        
            <p>The tow movement was provided by a ground-handling company under contract by Virgin Atlantic, it said.</p>
        
            <p>A Heathrow spokesperson said: "We are working alongside emergency services and our airline partners in response to an incident involving two aircraft on the ground earlier today."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson added: "At present, no passenger injuries have been reported and we do not anticipate there to be any ongoing impact to airport operations."</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services attended the scene as a precautionary measure.</p>
        
            <p>The Met Police said it was supporting the airport authorities and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch with an investigation into the circumstances.</p>
