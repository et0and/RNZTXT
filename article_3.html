            <p>A 14 year old campaigning to get international flights back to Dunedin has got a meeting with the Prime Minister today.</p>
        
            <p>Virgin Australia flew directly between Brisbane and Dunedin weekly before the Covid-19 pandemic hit - but the route has not been reopened since then.</p>
        
            <p>Benjamin Paterson started a campaign to bring those flights back in October.</p>

            <p>He also contacted the Prime Minister's office in October, leading to the meeting with Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Paterson said the idea was sparked after it took a long time to get to Wellington then Australia for a holiday.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped Luxon would back the idea.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully he looks into it and like supports it, and push[es] it a lot more."</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ the meeting was exciting, but that he was also nervous.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what it is going to be like, hopefully it will be good."</p>
        
            <p>He said he has had support of the plan in Dunedin, across New Zealand and in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>He gathered 25,000 signatures on a petition calling for the flights before it ended in December.</p>
