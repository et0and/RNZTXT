            <p>Fire and Emergency has evacuated four properties as a large fire burns near Lake Pukaki in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says they were called to the scene after a farmer's burn-off got out of control shortly before 3pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the homes were vacant, while the other two were evacuated as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze has been burning in the area where State Highway 80 and State Highway 8 intersect.</p>
        
            <p>The flames spread through about 50 hectares of grass and scrub during the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze is around 1km from any properties.</p>

            <p>A Twizel resident said she could see the flames from about 10 kilometres away.</p>
        
            <p>Twizel Community Board chairperson Tracey Gunn said she was concerned about the fire spreading.</p>
        
            <p>''It is very close to significant numbers of pine trees, which is always a concern, with a lot of fuel for the fire, but yeah, it is [a worry], the flames are visible from a good distance, you know, 10km away."</p>
        
            <p>Gunn said it was the fourth incident in the area in the past five days, following twin bus crashes last week, and another multi-vehicle crash at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been absolutely horrendous for the local volunteer emergency services. All of our services here are volunteer, St John Ambulance, the fire brigade, so this is their fourth incident in five days that they've had to be called out to, so they will be absolutely buggered." she said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews will remain at the scene on Monday night, with a helicopter heading to the fire at first light.</p>
