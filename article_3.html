            <p>Dávila, 33, the captain of Sydney club Macarthur was arrested by New South Wales in South Coogee on Friday morning following an investigation by the Organised Crime Squad Gaming Unit into the alleged manipulation of yellow cards during football games for gambling purposes.</p>

            <p>The alleged offending occurred during games between 24 November and 9 December last year.</p>
        
            <p>Dávila received a yellow card during Macarthur FC's game against Melbourne Victory on 24 November and another yellow card during his side's match against Sydney FC on 9 December.</p>
        
            <p>Failed attempts to allegedly control the number of cards issued during games happened between 20 April and 4 May this year.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to be charged with two counts of engage in conduct that corrupts a betting outcome of an event, and two counts of facilitate in conduct that corrupts a betting out of an event.</p>

            <p>He played for the Phoenix between 2019-2021 before signing with Macarthur.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Phoenix general manager David Dome said the club had put considerable resource and effort into re-signing Davila.</p>

            <p>Dávila recently renewed his contract with Macarthur for a further two years.</p>
