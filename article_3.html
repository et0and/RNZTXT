            <p>Tasman have their hands on the Ranfurly Shield for the first time after beating Hawke's Bay 25-24 in Napier at McLean Park.</p>
        
            <p>A late penalty to replacement first-five Campbell Parata sealed the one-point win as he slotted the penalty from 47 metres out.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman Makos captain Quinten Strange told SkySport while his side dominated the first half, they did well to repel the Hawke's Bay onslaught in the second.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, we just managed to hang on," a relieved and ecstatic Quinten Strange said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just really proud that this group can create history.</p>

            <p>"I know that Marlborough has won it once in 1973, but for Tasman as a union it's pretty special.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just for this group, it's everyone who has donned the jersey before."</p>
        
            <p>The Makos led 19-5 at halftime in a dominant first half with two tries and first-five William Havili adding nine points with two penalties and a drop goal.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay stromed back in front of a home crowd with three tries and a stunning conversion from the sideline to take the lead, 24-22, with just two minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>But Tasman slotted their final penalty kick to snatch the memorable win.</p>
        
            <p>The Magpies will pick up two bonus points after having scored four tries and losing by just one point.</p>
