            <p>Project Jonah is pleading with Canterbury residents not to disturb a large whale that is stranded near the entrance to the shallow estuary at Moncks Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) is working with Project Jonah and has sent a boat and jetski out to try and make the whale change direction and head back out towards the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteer Jessica Halsey said so far the situation was calm but people should be careful not to spook the whale.</p>
        
            <p>"It was moving around, we could see it splashing but nothing too stressful. It didn't look in massive distress - obviously being trapped out on the sandbar will be quite distressing for the whale, but I guess the key thing we're just asking, if anyone is coming down that they're not shinning any bright lights, they're not making loads of noise and they're especially not going in the water," Halsey said.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was possible Project Jonah, DOC and Coastguard could remain at the beach monitoring the whale for a while.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be that some of us will be down here all night, it could be that just Coastguard and DOC [are here] overnight and some of us come back early in the morning when the light's up ... It would be unsafe to be in the water while it's dark," Halsey said.</p>
        
            <p>She said earlier, while it was still quite light, there were lot of people around asking questions about what was going on but they had cleared away as it got darker.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage they had not been able to identify the type of whale it was or the possible reason it had got stranded, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The tide was continuing to go out in the shallow estuary until about 1.45am, making it unlikely the whale would be able to refloated before then.</p>
        
            <p>High tide is about 7.54am.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Sumner volunteer Howard Nicholls said a team would stay overnight and a meeting would be held at first light, before high tide to try to decide what to do.</p>
        
            <p>This whale beaching comes a week after a pod of 45 false killer whales and one bottlenose dolphin were euthanised after becoming stranded near MƒÅhia.</p>
