            <p>Turning the creative taps back on was like "the sweetest liquid you've ever tasted", singer Fiona McDonald says.</p>
        
            <p>The 58-year-old has been singing her whole life, but is best known for being in Strawpeople and Headless Chickens.</p>
        
            <p>McDonald, along with Paul Casserly, have released their first Strawpeople album in 19 years -  Knucklebones - to great acclaim.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time ever, Strawpeople are going to be playing their music live, planning their sets for Splore and Womad.</p>
        
            <p>McDonald joined Music 101's Charlotte Ryan for The Mixtape.</p>

            <p>She said she felt "amazingly good" about the new album and that it was a "long time coming".</p>
        
            <p>"It took us a long time to do, we lovingly laboured over the songs, and we love them. It was great to write again after so many years.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm 58, so it's an unusual place to be to find myself able to be back in the createasphere, you know? And I was really grateful for it. I'm friggin' lucky to be able to do this and people give a shit."</p>
        
            <p>When the idea of a new album for Strawpeople came about, McDonald said it took about six months for her and Casserly to really get in the groove.</p>
        
            <p>They were trying to work out why they were doing it, what was it for and what was their sound.</p>
        
            <p>When they started writing, they started realising what they liked and the direction they would go in.</p>
        
            <p>But it took eight years for the album to come into fruition.</p>
        
            <p>McDonald said Covid-19 was a big part of that - but life was happening in a different way that it did when they were in their 20s and 30s.</p>
        
            <p>"Life is just different, isn't it? Life is different."</p>
        
            <p>Over the years, McDonald said she had been constantly asked if she misses performing.</p>
        
            <p>She would reply honestly, saying she did not - but it was not until she was back on the stage, in that environment, that she would realise she really did.</p>
        
            <p>Turning the creative taps back on after them being off for some time was like "a gush".</p>
        
            <p>"It's the sweetest liquid you've ever tasted".</p>
        
            <p>McDonald said it was tricky to pick the songs for her mixtape, but decided on ones that had meant a lot to her over time.</p>
