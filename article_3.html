            <p>Sampha Sisay, A.K.A SAMPHA is a British singer, producer, musician and songwriter known for his smooth and rich voice.

            <p>Family is front and centre in his follow-up album Lahai. The musical background of the record steeped in West African folk music got SAMPHA thinking about his own,  “Lahai is my middle name, whilst I was making the record. Lineage and ancestry were on my mind”. </p>
        
            <p>Spirit 2.0- was him trying to re-interpret some of that music in an electronic style. He purchased a new OB-6 synth and modular synthesizers and began exploring new music production techniques. </p>
        
            <p>Jungle was a kind of nostalgic haze for SAMPHA who grew up with four older brothers immersed in the UK rave scene in the mid 90’s. A sound he reinterpreted using a robotic drummer to create the breakbeats in songs like Spirit 2.0 in his new album. </p>
        
            <p>“My brothers were the pioneers I had a very nutritious musical upbringing, in terms of the music I was introduced to and the music I was surrounded by”. The song, Evidence is an ode to his daughter who was born during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>“My existential worries shifted thinking about my own life”. He describes parenting during that time as both grounding and challenging amidst the global pandemic. </p>

            <p>SAMPHA is thankful that the song No One Knows Me (Like the Piano) from his first album Process acts as a kind of document to return to the grief of losing his mother Binty Sisay. The powerful tribute became popular in 2017.  He believes, “One of the joys of music is that you can express something that doesn't make people feel so alone. It’s beautiful that a lot of people are speaking about their situations and what that song means to them”.  </p>
        
            <p>SAMPHA will be playing in Aotearoa, at the Power Station on Friday, February 23, and Saturday at Splore festival on Feb 24 with his full live band. </p>
