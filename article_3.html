            <p>The daughter of a former All Black has pleaded guilty in relation to a hit and run that left a 65-year-old man dead on the side of an Auckland road.</p>
        
            <p>Helena Jade Cribb, the daughter of Ron Cribb, was charged earlier this year after an investigation into the death of Jason Collins, who was found by a member of the public on O'Brien Rd, Lucas Heights in the early hours of 7 December.</p>
        
            <p>She appeared at the North Shore District Court on Thursday where she pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle carelessly and thereby causing Collins' death, her lawyer Adam Holland confirmed to Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>Cribb was convicted and will be sentenced in December.</p>
        
            <p>According to the summary of facts previously read out in court, Cribb had been at a Christmas party and was observed by work colleagues and the licences premises managers to be "drunk", "very highly intoxicated", "slurring her words" and "aggressive" over the course of the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Her exact level of intoxication is unknown as she was unable to be tested.</p>
        
            <p>A work colleague arranged an Uber to take her to her car in the CBD on the condition she was going to sleep in her car, charge her phone and not drive.</p>
        
            <p>But at 11.28pm after the Uber had dropped her off at the car, she got into the driving seat and began driving towards her home address 24kms away.</p>
        
            <p>As she was driving on O'Brien Rd, Cribb's vehicle struck Collins who was lying on the road. The road was unlit and a sealed rural road with a speed limit of 60kph.</p>
        
            <p>Collins' exact position on the road is unknown but a scene examination suggested he was either laying down on the road or laying partially on the road. His body was dragged about 31m by Cribb's vehicle and rolled a further 7m before coming to a rest.</p>
        
            <p>Collins sustained serious internal injuries to his head and body, which were likely to be fatal even if Cribb had stopped and contacted emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>"We will never know how he came to be lying on the road," Judge Murray previously said in court.</p>
        
            <p>After becoming aware of Collins' death from media reports, Cribb went to the police and said she did not know she had hit anyone but wondered if she had hit something while turning up the radio as she recalled a big bump, similar to a pothole.</p>
        
            <p>The collision with Collins caused extensive damage to the underside of Cribb's car and it broe down the following morning, broken pieces of the underside of the plastic coverings were found at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>There were no witnesses to the incident. Police said it was likely the crash was caused by Cribb being distracted by the radio.</p>
        
            <p>Collins' family previous told Stuff he was a devoted father, husband and trusted friend to many in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"The tragic loss of Jason has left an unfillable void in our hearts.</p>
        
            <p>"Taken from us too soon, his departure is a profound and senseless blow that we struggle to comprehend.</p>
        
            <p>"Each day is a battle against the overwhelming emptiness left in his wake."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Detective Sergeant Ben Bergin said the vehicle and driver allegedly involved had been identified shortly after Collins' death.</p>
        
            <p>"A thorough investigation has been underway into the tragic circumstances by the WaitematƒÅ CIB and we have reached a point where charges have been filed."</p>
