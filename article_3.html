            <p>Environment Canterbury chairperson Peter Scott has received a formal warning following an independent investigation into his own claims he was "operating illegally" on a South Canterbury farm.</p>
        
            <p>ECan chief executive Stefanie Rixecker ordered the investigation in May after Scott revealed in a NewstalkZB interview that he was not operating with formal resource consents because of processing delays.</p>
        
            <p>Scott told the presenter he had been waiting six years for information from another government agency - Land Information NZ - so a land use consent could be issued for the 67-hectare farm in Kerrytown Road in Timaru.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the six-year wait, Scott replied: "In fact what I'm doing is carrying on and I'm ignoring the fact that I haven't got one and so I'm actually operating illegally and I'm the chairman of Environment Canterbury".</p>
        
            <p>Rixecker said the $66,000 investigation into the farm's irrigation and land use consents was done by a Resource Management Act compliance officer from a North Island regional council, although the council has not named the person.</p>
        
            <p>Gary Rooney, who bought the farm in 2023, and John Chapman, who leased the farm between 2019 and 2023, were also formally warned.</p>
        
            <p>Rixecker said their findings and recommendations went to the council's Enforcement Decision Panel last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the time that had elapsed since the council first had information of the activities (through the application for a land use consent in October 2022), along with the low level of environmental impact, the panel determined it did not meet the threshold for prosecution," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The panel considered the seriousness of the non-compliance activity to be at the lower end of the spectrum, meaning a warning was appropriate."</p>
        
            <p>Scott voluntarily stood aside from his role while the investigation was carried out and was now free to resume the role, Rixecker said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Scott said he was pleased the investigation was over and confirmed his return as chair at the regional council.</p>
        
            <p>"The farm was in my family for nearly 70 years. We always took great care to ensure we operated within the law, so this delay was immensely frustrating. It was a good example of how consent delays are not always clear cut which is why I mentioned it on radio," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The subsequent investigation has been time consuming and costly, but I have respected the process and co-operated fully."</p>
        
            <p>Scott said the necessary land use consent for the property was being processed.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd been waiting for LINZ to issue a licence to occupy a three-hectare parcel of land which formed part of the farm but was under their ownership. That's now being actioned. It's unfortunate that roadblock wasn't removed years ago."</p>
