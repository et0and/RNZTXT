            <p>A runaway try from forward Leka Halasima and a late penalty from halfback Luke Metcalf have carried NZ Warriors to their third straight win of the 2025 NRL season - 26-24 over Wests Tigers at Campbelltown.</p>
        
            <p>The Tigers - competition wooden-spooners for the past three seasons - showed they were a very different proposition under Kiwi legend Benji Marshall and seemed on track for their third victory in four games, when they scored back-to-back tries in quick succession for a 24-18 lead midway through the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams had tries disallowed over the final half hour, but the Warriors were struggling to stay in the contest on a ground where they had enjoyed little previous success.</p>
        
            <p>With 10 minutes remaining, Halasima received the ball on the right sideline and sprinted from deep inside his own half, evading a despairing tackle and bumping off the last defender in his path to score.</p>
        
            <p>In his excitement, he could have run closer to the posts, but luckily Metcalf had his kicking boots on and converted the try to level the scores.</p>
        
            <p>From the restart, the Warriors made good metres and earned a penalty, when fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad was hit in a high shoulder charge 40 metres out from the posts.</p>
        
            <p>Again, Metcalf made no mistake into a stiff wind and the visitors were able to withstand pressure over the final moments to secure the win.</p>
        
            <p>"We did everything we could to make it uncomfortable," reflected co-captain Mitch Barnett. "We came over the top again, we're just showing grit at the moment and I'm very proud of the effort."</p>
        
            <p>The result elevates the Warriors into sixth on the competition table with a 3-1 record, as they head into a bye week. Their next outing will see them visit Melbourne Storm on Sunday 13 April.</p>
