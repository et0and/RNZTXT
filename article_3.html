            <p>A Dunedin shooting victim, social justice campaigner and former Green Party candidate has been arrested in Ireland after allegedly looting a shoe store during mass riots in Dublin last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, he claims he has an alibi.</p>
        
            <p>Former 2020 Green Party candidate Jack Brazil was arrested in Ireland on Tuesday (local time) for the alleged looting of a Footlocker store in Dublin last year, Irish media reported.</p>
        
            <p>He allegedly committed the burglary on 23 November 2023, during the Dublin riots - an incident that involved widespread looting and disorder in the city in response to a knife attack on young children, the Irish Mirror reported.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in Dublin District Court on Thursday charged with burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Brazil, 30, claimed he ''has an alibi".</p>
        
            <p>Garda Brian Kenny told the court that when charged, Brazil replied: "I reserve the right to provide further exculpatory evidence,'' the Irish Mirror reported.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded on bail on a €200 ($NZ370) bond, his passport was seized, he was forbidden from applying for travel documents, and was given a midnight to 6am curfew.</p>
        
            <p>Brazil was granted legal aid after the court heard he had no job and had no assets, The Journal reported.</p>
        
            <p>On 16 April 2023, Brazil was seriously injured after being shot in Littlebourne Rd, Roslyn.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called and at 3.10am they found Brazil had suffered a gunshot wound to the liver.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the shooting, Brazil had been in a vehicle with another man. He then drove himself alone to Yours, a café and venue operated by the Ōtepoti Possibilities Co-operative, where Brazil was a shareholder.</p>
        
            <p>He initially called an ambulance but then flagged down a passing car to take him to the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A witness at the time told the Otago Daily Times the armed offenders squad raided the premises about an hour later.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the shooting was an ''isolated incident'' and later asked for public help in finding another man reportedly in a car with Brazil at the time of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Brazil contested the Dunedin electorate in the 2020 election for the Green Party and was number 20 on the party list.</p>
        
            <p>During his time in Dunedin, he was a prominent voice in the local anti-oil and gas movement, which grew out of the opposition to International oil giant OMV drilling in the Great South Basin.</p>
