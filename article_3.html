            <p>Christopher Luxon has been warmly welcomed by China's President in Lima on the sidelines of the APEC Summit.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time Xi Jinping and Luxon have met, with the meeting scheduled for 30 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>In his opening remarks, President Xi acknowledged the sound and steady growth between China and New Zealand and commended Luxon for his efforts building the relationship since he took office a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>He also said China was ready to work together with New Zealand to create more firsts.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon arrived in Peru for APEC overnight.</p>

            <p>On arrival, Luxon headed straight to a private catch-up with his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese.</p>
        
            <p>The leaders of APEC's 21 economies from the Asia-Pacific region are meeting just a week after Donald Trump was declared the US president-elect.</p>
        
            <p>While it is Joe Biden in town representing the US, Trump's promised tariffs will feature heavily in leader to leader conversations this weekend, including between Luxon and China's Xi Jinping.</p>
        
            <p>Xi is under very tight security in Lima, prompting him to send his officials to a grand port opening two hours north while he held a virtual ribbon cutting.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is expected to speak to media at 12.20pm (NZT).</p>
