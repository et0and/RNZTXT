            <p>The conflicting views of two IT experts have been revisited in the trial of Philip Polkinghorne.</p>
        
            <p>Police digital forensic analyst, Jun Lee, said he analysed activity on Pauline Hanna's iPhone 8 in the hours before her death.</p>
        
            <p>Lee returned to the High Court in Auckland after earlier giving evidence as part of the prosecution's case.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the court heard from the defence's own IT expert from Australia, Atakan Shahho.</p>
        
            <p>Shahho claimed Hanna drafted iMessages to two people at around 4.00am on the morning she was found dead in her Remuera home.</p>
        
            <p>He said one draft message was to her husband, Polkinghorne, and another was to the teenage daughter of a friend.</p>
        
            <p>But Lee affirmed to Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock that Hanna's phone could not have been used to draft any text messages the morning she died.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no trace of user interaction on the phone at all," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believed her phone was last used at 10.47pm on 4 April, 2021, the night before she died.</p>
        
            <p>He said his analysis of the phone's background data showed it did an identity look-up service check at around 4.00am.</p>
        
            <p>He said the automated process checked the phone for scammers by verifying if contacts in a phone were legitimate.</p>
        
            <p>He said the security feature on Apple phones was automated and could happen when the phone was not in use.</p>
        
            <p>During cross-examination, defence lawyer Ron Mansfield KC questioned Lee's ability to analyse Apple devices, as he used to be employed by Samsung which uses an Android rather than an iOS operating system.</p>
        
            <p>Lee argued this was not relevant.</p>
        
            <p>After a lengthy back and forth, Justice Graham Lang decided Lee would return on Thursday for Mansfield KC to finish his cross-examination.</p>
        
            <p>A mental health expert, brought in by defence, defended his assessment that Pauline Hanna had several suicide</p>
        
            <p>risk factors.</p>
        
            <p>During cross-examination, Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock questioned psychiatrist Dr Olav Neilssen on why he thought Hanna's habit of sending work emails at night was concerning.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock said Hanna's colleagues were not concerned and Hanna had told them work was her happy place.</p>
        
            <p>But Dr Neilssen argued insomnia was a "cardinal symptom of depression".</p>
        
            <p>"It's all good and well to say that. But objectively, it doesn't look quite right.</p>
        
            <p>"It's healthier for us all to get a good night's sleep, myself included."</p>
        
            <p>He said Hanna's history of depression and recent passing of her mother also made suicide more likely.</p>
        
            <p>He believed Hanna had behaved unusually in the days before her death, doing things she would not normally do,</p>
        
            <p>such as visiting the tip and cooking for her husband.</p>
        
            <p>"Are you suggesting a trip to the tip is indicative of some kind of mental health deterioration?" McClintock said.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Neilssen said people who had made a decision to end their life sometimes gave away their possessions.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock clarified Hanna was getting rid of old curtains.</p>
        
            <p>He conceded to McClintock that his assessment was largely reliant on Polkinghorne's account in his police statement.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of the day, Justice Lang discharged a jury member due to a personal commitment.</p>
        
            <p>The defence indicated it had a few witnesses left before closing its case.</p>
        
            <p>The trial is expected to stretch into its eighth week next week, where the prosecution and defence will deliver their closing arguments.</p>
