            <p>Frustrated drivers are leading to deadly mistakes on roads, driving advocates say after the worst Easter weekend road toll since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The official road death toll for the Easter period remains unconfirmed, but police have counted seven deaths on the roads from 4pm Thursday until 6am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Transport's toll remains at six - with questions over whether a crash between a motorbike and a tractor was being counted.</p>
        
            <p>The Automobile Association says impatient and frustrated drivers are leading to more people making bad decisions on our roads.</p>
        
            <p>AA road safety spokesperson Dylan Thomsen told Morning Report drivers were losing their lives as a result of risky behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The Easter weekend road toll is the worst it has been since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>While it was too soon to comment on the specifics of the recent crashes, "there's a lot of indicators showing that we seem to be seeing more frustration, more anger, more bad behaviour out on the roads", Thomsen said.</p>
        
            <p>"That is a terrible thing, and it can lead to people making some really bad decisions and taking risks that can end up costing people their lives in the worst case."</p>
        
            <p>He said AA was concerned about an increase in "really extremely reckless behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>The overall road toll was down from the late 1990s - from about 530 a year to 340.</p>
        
            <p>Research in 2017 looked at a number of fatal crashes and found half of them involved reckless, extreme behaviour, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We did some analysis earlier this year looking at the recent Christmas / New Year periods and in those periods we're up to more than 3/4 of the fatal crashes involving either a drunk driver, a drugged driver or somebody not wearing a seat belt."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the legislation would change this year to allow the use of drug testing devices like in Australia and Europe.</p>
        
            <p>Thomsen said a larger police presence on the roads could lower the death toll.</p>
        
            <p>Road policing director superintendent Steve Greally told Morning Report the Pukaki crash was "absolutely horrific".</p>
        
            <p>Police were still investigating it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said police had put out a lot of safe driving messages before the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Just short of confirming the seventh death, Greally said one of the crashes "potentially happened on private property, which wouldn't count in terms of the official statistics".</p>
        
            <p>Police data showed the behaviours contributing to incidents on roads include people not wearing seatbelts, alcohol and drugs, fatigue, distraction, and speed.</p>
        
            <p>"Speed affects around 60 percent of all crashes involving death and serious injury."</p>
        
            <p>He said police had been enforcing rules at "levels that are unprecedented".</p>
        
            <p>Breath tests were up, as was speed enforcement on rural roads.</p>
        
            <p>"We had 31 less deaths last year."</p>
        
            <p>There were 1070 dedicated police officers primarily based on the open road deterring people from making "bad decisions", Greally said.</p>
        
            <p>Early on Sunday morning, one person died in a crash on State Highway 5, Whakarewarewa, south of Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Another person died in a three-vehicle crash at Okaramio, northwest of Blenheim on Sunday afternoon. The person died at the scene, and two others were injured.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday morning, a motorcyclist died in hospital after crashing into a tractor in the Matamata-Piako district.</p>
        
            <p>There were three tractor crashes on the same day.</p>
        
            <p>And four people died in a crash between two vehicles and a motorcycle near Lake Pukaki. Three of them died at the scene on Saturday afternoon, and another who was seriously injured died in hospital two days later.</p>
        
            <p>Two foreign students from the University of Canterbury were among those who died. One of the deceased was riding a motorcycle.</p>
