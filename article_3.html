            <p>A woman in her 80s has been seriously injured in an assault overnight in what police say was an aggravated burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the house in Henderson about 2.20am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>WaitematƒÅ CIB acting detective inspector Simon Harrison said police understood a man entered the Dellwood Avenue property, was disturbed by the sole occupant of the house, and assaulted them.</p>
        
            <p>"The female victim, who is in her 80s, has received medical treatment for serious, but non-life threatening injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"She remains in hospital in a stable condition."</p>
        
            <p>Police, including the Air Support Unit and Police Dog Unit, immediately responded but have not found the man, Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene guard is in place and police want to hear from anyone who may have been in the area last night who saw something of note.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ensuring support is in place the victim as we work to understand the full circumstances of what has occurred.</p>
