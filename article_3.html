            <p>One person is missing after getting into jetski trouble on Lake Taupō off Acacia Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Police Senior Sergeant Andy Livingstone said they received a report around 12.40pm on Sunday of a person or people on a jetski in trouble.</p>
        
            <p>"While one person and the jetski made it to shore with assistance from Police and Taupō Coastguard, a second person sadly did not, and was last seen struggling in the water," Livingstone said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Police National Dive Squad has been notified and is expected to deploy tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>He said Tūwharetoa Maori Trust Board had been advised and local hapū were assisting to support those involved.</p>
