        <h2>Oscars 2025: All the must see looks from the red carpet</h2>
        <p>
The red carpet at this year's Academy awards served structure, silver and lots of brooches.

            <p>The Oscars have lived up to its reputation as the most glamorous night in Hollywood.</p>
        
            <p>The red carpet at the 97th Academy Awards seemed partially about escapism. It's been a little more than a month since LA wildfires killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes. Celebrities - and their stylists - have given the city and the rest of the world something else to think about for a few minutes with some truly stunning looks.</p>
        
            <p>As we saw at the Golden Globes in January, black gloves were everywhere. Gloves were mostly long and black as seen on supporting actress nominee Zoe Saldaña and British actress Yasmin Finney. Singer and former child Disney star Miley Cyrus, ever the trailblazer, went for short lace gloves.</p>
        
            <p>The man brooch was huge. Best actor nominee Adrian Brody matched his brooch to the single earring of his girlfriend Georgina Chapman (wonderful teamwork). Actor Joe Alwyn was in the brooch club as were actor and singer Omar Apollo, and the Apprentice star Sebastian Stan plus many more.</p>
        
            <p>Nude was a breakout colour at this year's couture fashion shows in Paris and we saw that translate to the red carpet. Ariana Grande wore an architectural creation from Schiaparelli, the fashion house that went viral during couture week for its show that put nude front and centre. Lupita Nyong'o gown had the slightest hint of nude. Selena Gomez went with a sparkling rose gold dress. (Gomez also stuck with an Old Hollywood glamour bob which has been a common sight at the Golden Globes and now-Oscars).</p>
        
            <p>Creative necklines as well as strapless gowns were all the rage. Best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo might have played a witch in Wicked but she channelled Dracula with a pointed high collar. Whoopi Goldberg shined in a shimmery dress with a boat neck. Director Ava DuVernay's gown had satin shoulder sleeves. Saldaña and Meg Ryan were some of the many actresses in strapless gowns thanks to the resurgence of tube tops of the 2000s.</p>
        
            <p>Some other notable mentions:</p>
        
            <p>- Best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet colour blocked entirely- and effectively - in lemon.</p>
        
            <p>- Actor Jeremy Strong, who started conversations with his mint green bucket hat and sunglasses at the Golden Globes, was rather stunning in a olive green suit with abstract neck tie.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some of the best looks from this year's Academy Awards:</p>
