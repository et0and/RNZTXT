            <p>It was an overflowing courtroom in the High Court at Tauranga on Tuesday as locals were told the sale of the Tauranga marine precinct should not have come as a surprise to residents who "were widely consulted".</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Tauranga City Council sold the precinct to Christchurch developer Sam Rofe.</p>
        
            <p>However, the sale was paused at the eleventh hour after an interim injunction was granted by the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Andrew was hearing arguments on an application for a judicial review of the sale.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyers for the purchaser argued that numerous meetings were held with marine users and over the years the option to sell was openly discussed.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Shane Campbell said what the applicant, marine precinct user Pacific 7, really wanted to achieve was to pressure the council into cancelling the contract with their client.</p>
        
            <p>"This proceeding has been brought on an admitted basis for trying to bring overt pressure to bear on elected officials to exercise what they say are cancellation rights," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Andrews pushed back on this and asked whether the applicant was simply asking to hold Tauranga City Council to account.</p>
        
            <p>"That's entirely legitimate isn't it, in a democracy?" the justice asked.</p>
        
            <p>Outside the court, locals disagreed that there had been wide consultation and said they wanted justice for ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't been included, there has been no consultation," said one.</p>
        
            <p>Another said that it felt like a very small group of people were playing monopoly with the city.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Andrew is expected to reserve his decision.</p>
