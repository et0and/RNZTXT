        <h2>No one knows how many people live in Papua New Guinea</h2>
        <p>
The Pacific nation has not held a successful census in 24 years, and is now trying to work out what its population is, but there are fears even a census won't be able to determine it.

            <p>It's a hot afternoon in the dusty streets of Port Moresby and Maholopa Laveil is driving around looking for someone in a white shirt and bright yellow vest brandished with the slogan "be counted".</p>
        
            <p>He has a piece of paper in his hand that he's determined to give them a form that contains important information about him and his family.</p>
        
            <p>"It's my civic right," he tells the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>Laveil is looking for census officers that were supposed to show up to his house a few days earlier, but never did.</p>
        
            <p>When they eventually came by to take down his information three days late he was at work.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, his dad emailed him a copy of the data collection form, which he printed out himself and filled in.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, Laveil spots a team of census officers who are about to knock off for the day.</p>
        
            <p>He flags them down and hands over the form - relieved to know that he'll be counted in Papua New Guinea's national census.</p>
        
            <p>But he fears many others simply won't be.</p>

            <p>Laveil is the kind of guy who loves numbers.</p>
        
            <p>It's why he became a lecturer in economics at the University of Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>And he hates it when the numbers are wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"My sense is the census is on a path to failure," he says.</p>
        
            <p>It's a disappointing prediction for the academic, who was hoping the exercise would answer a critical question: how big is the population of PNG, actually?</p>

            <p>The Pacific nation hasn't held a successful census in 24 years, and the fact that no-one really knows the population is a factor in many of PNG's problems, according to Laveil.</p>
        
            <p>"We need a good census to provide that socio-demographic data that government needs for policy planning," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Police-to-person ratios, doctor-to-person ratios. All these other very important indicators â€¦ depend on accurate census data."</p>

            <p>The question of PNG's population has been at the centre of controversy in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Data from an unreliable 2011 census suggests the number is around 11 million.</p>
        
            <p>A UN study, funded by Australia, used satellite imagery to estimate a much higher population of 17 million in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Demographic information is also crucial for PNG's development partners, including Australia, which delivers around $616 million in aid to the country each year, and New Zealand.</p>

            <p>At a press conference last week, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the census would enable Australia to better respond to PNG's needs.</p>
        
            <p>One example, according to Laveil, can be found in the massive landslide that struck PNG's highlands recently - wiping out an entire village.</p>
        
            <p>In the wake of the disaster, the PNG government, NGOs and the UN struggled to determine exactly how many people had been affected.</p>
        
            <p>Official estimates of the death toll varied wildly from a couple of hundred to more than 2000.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a census figure could really inform disaster response in future," Laveil said.</p>

            <p>The population count could also influence PNG's global economic ranking, and provide insights into the levels of poverty across the country.</p>

            <p>PNG's Administrative Service Minister Richard Masere agrees it is an important exercise.</p>
        
            <p>"The census must be done, and it must be concluded so we are able to say, 'well, this is the population,'" he told ABC.</p>
        
            <p>At a press conference earlier this month, he appeared positive about the preparations, despite the census budget being slashed from 300 million kina ($AU117.3 million) to 150 million kina ($AU58.6 million).</p>
        
            <p>"We've done enough work so far to be, I would say, 99.9 percent confident that we will get the right data going forward," Masere said.</p>
        
            <p>He said 20,000 people had been recruited, including teachers whose school terms had been cut short by two weeks so they could assist.</p>
        
            <p>But since the count began on 17 June, it has been plagued by long delays, administrative issues and financial shortfalls.</p>
        
            <p>By the end of the first week of counting, most provinces told the ABC they had not begun collecting data.</p>

            <p>Dennis Mipa, a census supervisor in Port Moresby, has experienced the frustrations firsthand.</p>
        
            <p>He told the ABC his team wasn't issued with the electronic tablets they were supposed to use to collect information.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just doing the household interviews manually using pen and paper," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the data was then sent to census coordinators via WhatsApp.</p>
        
            <p>"It's slowing our work progress," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mipa said he also spent about $200 of his own money last week to buy lunch for his team because they hadn't received their allowances from the National Statistics Office.</p>
        
            <p>Two hours outside the capital, in the coastal village of Makerupu in PNG's central province, tablets are being used.</p>
        
            <p>But the area's census coordinator Morea Arua said the program had been set back by a week while they were waiting for materials to arrive.</p>

            <p>He said some villages in his district could only be reached by boat or helicopter - adding to the challenge of ensuring every household is counted.</p>
        
            <p>The PNG government has allocated an extra 60 days for data collection and cleansing, before the official results are announced in September.</p>
        
            <p>The National Statistics Office and the Department of Administrative Services has not responded to the ABC's request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Morea said he's still hopeful the census will be a success.</p>

            <p>But Laveil remains sceptical.</p>
        
            <p>"Poor preparations, low funding, capacity issues within the National Statistics Office, and then it's just fit into the failure that we're seeing now," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The budget for this census was reduced from 300 million kina to 150 million kina - almost half of what was spent on the failed 2011 census, after adjusting for inflation.</p>
        
            <p>Laveil said if the government planned to continue the census for another 60 days, it would have to allocate more funding.</p>
