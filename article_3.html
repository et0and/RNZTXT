            <p>MetService says South Cantabrians could be in for heavy snow until mid-morning.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy snow warning is in place in inland Canterbury until 9am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mark Todd said while snow settled in parts of northern Southland and Central Otago on Saturday, it was Canterbury's turn overnight and Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Through to mid-morning we could see 15 to 20 centimetres of snow settling at altitudes above 500 metres in the southern parts of Canterbury south of the Rangitata River, including the Mackenzie Basin."</p>
        
            <p>Todd said a decent amount of snow may also have settled on Lindis Pass.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Alwyn Bakker told RNZ while it was not unusual to see snow falling in the mountains in May, it was less usual to see it falling at lower altitudes.</p>
        
            <p>Further west, the ranges of Westland District about and north of Mt Ward are subject to a heavy rain watch until midday.</p>
        
            <p>The lowest temperature recorded this morning was in the Southland town of Lumsden, which was sitting at -3.2C.</p>
