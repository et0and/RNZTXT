            <p>Firefighters are continuing the battle to contain a large vegetation fire burning on Tiwai Peninsula, near Bluff.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, which began on Thursday, was burning over 1200 hectares of scrub and valuable conservation wetland.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40 firefighters were at the scene on Thursday, as the fire grew in size due to higher temperatures and winds.</p>
        
            <p>Two crews remained on site overnight to monitor the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Several fire crews will be back on the scene at about 7am on Friday, Fire and Emergency New Zealand confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The fire poses no immediate threat to people, homes, the Tiwai Point smelter, or the Tiwai Bridge, a spokesperson for Fire and Emergency said.</p>
