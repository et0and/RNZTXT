            <p>A person has died after being found at the bottom of a Coromandel cliff.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Hahei Beach about 8.15pm on Saturday and a person was located at the bottom of the cliff face in a critical condition, however, they later died at the scene, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Another person was trapped on the cliff but uninjured and later rescued by a Fire and Emergency Lines Rescue Team.</p>
        
            <p>St John said it sent one first response unit, one ambulance and one helicopter to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Hahei Beach is south east of Whitianga, and a popular Coromandel Peninsula summer holiday destination.</p>
        
            <p>The death will be referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Bright, skipper for Coromandel tour boat Hahei Explorer, said the landscape was very rocky.</p>
        
            <p>"[There is] kind of dense bush at the top of the cliff, so if you were going through it you'd only be able to see maybe a metre, two metres in front of you at a time," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"The rocks themselves are fairly crumbly, so yeah you don't want to go too close to the cliff edges."</p>
        
            <p>Bright said there was signage around the cliffs of Cathedral Cove to warn trampers to keep to the path.</p>
        
            <p>"The track to Cathedral Cove, that's totally safe and if you stay on the track you're fine.</p>
        
            <p>"There are track signs saying, you know, stick to the track. There is a track from the Cathedral Cove lookout back down to the beach, but that has been closed by DOC (the Department of Conservation) with multiple fences, signs, everything like that."</p>
