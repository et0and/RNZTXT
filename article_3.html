            <p>As Rātana celebrations conclude for another year, the contentious Treaty Principles Bill was the talk of the day, with politicians on either sides of the spectrum having their say.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters labelled it as "dead in the water" in his speech, while Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated his earlier stance against the bill's future prospects.</p>
        
            <p>Followers of the Rātana Church, called mōrehu, gather at the small settlement south of Whanganui each year in January to celebrate the birthday of the movement's founder, Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, on 25 January.</p>
        
            <p>The event traditionally marks the start of the political year, as politicians pay tribute to the movement and engage with Māori leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, a Māori leader said the Rātana celebrations would be a chance for Luxon to front up to Māori.</p>
