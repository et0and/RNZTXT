            <p>Sprinter Danielle Aitchison has claimed a silver medal in the women's 200m T36 final at the Paris Paralympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third Paralympic medal of the 23-year-old's career and New Zealand's second silver at these Games.</p>
        
            <p>Cyclist Anna Taylor clinched the first medal for New Zealand earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison, who is based in Hamilton, earlier broke the 200m Paralympic record in the qualifiers, with a time of 28.21 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>However, Chinese sprinter Yiting Shi went one better in the final, clocking 27.50 seconds to take the gold.</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison was just 0.14 seconds behind.</p>
        
            <p>"It was definitely a hard race, I felt pretty strong coming out of the blocks and on the home straight I was neck-and-neck with Shi, it was a serious race," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a bit disappointed with the last five metres and got really fatigued.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling tired - I had a late night (after the evening heats) and didn't get to bed until this morning. I am happy with the time, which was great."</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison, who has cerebral palsy, has been coached by Alan McDonald in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>She won a silver medal in the women's 200m T36 and bronze in the women's 100m T36 at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison and Shi, the current world champion, are long-time rivals, with both frequently placing on the podium and besting each other's record times at international meets.</p>
