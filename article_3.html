            <p>The decision to allow a conservative American commentator into the country has been as divisive as the initial ban.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Associate Immigration Minister Chris Penk overturned Immigration New Zealand's ban on Candace Owens entering.</p>
        
            <p>Known for her controversial views - such as downplaying the Holocaust and claiming Muslims started slavery - Owens was barred from visiting Australia in October after announcing a speaking tour there.</p>
        
            <p>That ban meant she was then denied a visa to come to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Penk declined an interview with RNZ, but in a statement said that Owens had requested ministerial intervention.</p>
        
            <p>"Immigration New Zealand originally declined her visa application on the basis of section 15(1)(f) of the Immigration Act following Ms Owens being denied entry to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Subsequently, Ms Owens requested intervention from the Associate Minister of Immigration to exercise his discretion and grant her a visa.</p>
        
            <p>"The Minister made his decision after considering representations made to him, including the importance of free speech."</p>
        
            <p>The u-turn on her entering New Zealand has drawn criticism and praise, with the Free Speech Union congratulating the government on the reversal and the Holocaust Centre condemning it.</p>
        
            <p>Holocaust Centre board chair Deborah Hart said Owens would fuel anti-semitism in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a huge increase in anti-semitic incidents in this country and we really don't need someone who espouses anti-semitic rhetoric right now to be visiting and stoke more hatred."</p>
        
            <p>Her message to New Zealanders was that they had a choice.</p>
        
            <p>"You should choose to turn your back on a person who repeats blood libels about Jewish people, just turn your back on her."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Free Speech Union chief executive Jonathan Ayling said the minister's decision was a win for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was up to individuals, not the state, to decided who they wanted to listen to and denying Owens entry denied an informed discussion.</p>
        
            <p>"[She] runs controversial perspectives, that's part of her brand.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of attempts of blocking her from entry, a lot more people have engaged with her content, which is exactly what she's wanting."</p>
        
            <p>Ayling said censorship only played into Owens' hands, and instead encouraged those who didn't agree with her to peacefully protest.</p>
