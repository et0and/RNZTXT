        <h2>'Mindless vandalism': Window smashing spree hits series of schools</h2>
        <p>
"It's also such a hard way to end the term, really disheartening for our kids to come into school," one principal says.

            <p>Several Auckland schools have had their windows smashed and vehicles damaged in recent days.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook, Massey High School said they, and at least four other West Auckland secondary schools, had suffered similar "mindless vandalism" over the past two nights.</p>
        
            <p>"All schools have suffered similar damage, large numbers of broken windows at the front of the school (caused by blunt objects) and damage to school vehicles," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>Green Bay High School principal Fiona Barker said there was a "significant amount" of damage, and staff and students were disheartened.</p>
        
            <p>CCTV footage showed five people entered the property about 4.30am and smashing 30 windows across multiple classroom blocks, as well as the windows out of three school vans.</p>
        
            <p>"The damage is significant both cost-wise, but actually the disruption is huge," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Intermediate school students were due for a "transition visit" at the school on Friday and that had to be postponed.</p>
        
            <p>Students had to be moved into different classrooms to avoid the damage, and a big clean-up had begun.</p>

            <p>"It's also such a hard way to end the term, really disheartening for our kids to come into school, and our teachers, and to find all of this happening."</p>
        
            <p>Barker did not have any idea why anyone would have vandalised the schools.</p>
        
            <p>"It just looks mindless, nothing was stolen, it was just causing damage ... just so much damage."</p>
        
            <p>Barker estimated the clean-up cost would be "in the many tens of thousands" - money better spent on "doing great things for kids to enjoy", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Massey High School principal Alastair Fairley said a large number of windows at the front of his school were smashed using blunt objects, and school vehicles also had windows smashed.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously incredibly frustrating, the disruption it causes is unwelcome and the mindless nature of it can seem a bit unbelievable," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our student's response is heartening as they are immensely proud of their school. At least no one was hurt."</p>
        
            <p>Fairley said the schools were working together with police, and the Ministry of Education has been quickly facilitating claims.</p>
        
            <p>"The collegiality amongst West Auckland principals really comes to the fore with incidents like this," he said.</p>
