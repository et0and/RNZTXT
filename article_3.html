            <p>Two kōiwi - or human remains - have been found at the Paekākāriki Surf Club building during construction.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed there have been two separate discoveries of human remains since earthworks began in early May.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, the Greater Wellington Regional Council identified a serious risk to the coastal edge of Queen Elizabeth Park.</p>
        
            <p>The old building had been demolished because of coastal erosion caused by climate change.</p>
        
            <p>The development plan started six weeks ago but had stopped because of the discoveries.</p>
        
            <p>Ecosystems and community manager David Boone said the kōiwi are of significance to Ngāti Toa.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a long-standing area that has been used by Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Haumia ancestors," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really no surprise that there was evidence of activity in the site from the pre-settlement era."</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Toa declined to comment to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Police said both discoveries have been referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>The rebuild has since resumed.</p>
