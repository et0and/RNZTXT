            <p>The mayor of Auckland has reluctantly moved to re-commit $15 million in funding to restore the St James Theatre.</p>
        
            <p>The historic theatre in the middle of Auckland's CBD has been in a state of disrepair since a fire in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>The 1920s theatre has hosted some of the world's biggest acts including James Brown, Miles Davis and Joni Mitchell.</p>
        
            <p>The funding was promised by Auckland Council in 2016 and has been confirmed again after a vote this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Wayne Brown said he had mixed feelings about the project.</p>
        
            <p>"Well I wouldn't have supported to original decision to commit public funding to St James, I am clear that the best chance we have to make a real difference to our mid-town right now is to get on with it.</p>
        
            <p>"We can no longer accept the eyesore it has become and must make the best use of a difficult situation."</p>
