            <p>A security officer hired to transport prisoners has been disciplined after physically assaulting a prisoner at court.</p>
        
            <p>A complaint about the incident was one of four Corrections received about the contractors hired to provide escort duties in the 2022/2023 year - up from zero complaints in the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>In its latest annual report, Corrections said an investigation was launched and most of the allegations against the security officer were found to be true. An apology was issued and a disciplinary process completed.</p>
        
            <p>Another security officer went through a disciplinary process after a complaint about inappropriate conduct and comments they made while supervising a prisoner at court.</p>
        
            <p>Two further complaints were made by members of the public who claimed security officers had driven dangerously and above the speed limit in two separate incidents - the officers were required to undertake further training.</p>
        
            <p>The contractor providing transport services took disciplinary action against 11 of its security officers in the latest reporting year, mostly because of poor attendance and failing to turn up for rostered shifts.</p>
        
            <p>However, two people were disciplined after three prisoners escaped from their escort vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>In February, three remand prisoners leapt from a van onto Auckland's Southern Motorway, near the Ellerslie-Panmure Highway off-ramp. It was travelling north towards Mt Eden Prison.</p>
        
            <p>The prisoners fled on foot towards the South-Eastern Highway, before stealing a vehicle from a passer-by. They were arrested by police a week later and were charged with escaping custody and offences relating to the stolen vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>A further security officer was disciplined for not wearing a seatbelt while driving.</p>
        
            <p>The last reporting year also showed three instances of prisoner violence against security officers, while they were escorting inmates or undertaking courtroom custodial duties.</p>
        
            <p>One prisoner kicked a security officer in the leg after refusing to be taken back to prison, and another punched a security officer in the jaw. A third prisoner tried to spit at one security officer and successfully spat in another's face.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections national commissioner Leigh Marsh said a high standard of conduct was expected from all staff - including contractors.</p>
        
            <p>"The nature of our work means we must act beyond reproach at all times. Our Code of Conduct describes the principles we operate by, and the standard of behaviour expected of all staff, contractors, consultants, and volunteers. This, combined with our human resources processes, ensures accountability for any behaviour that falls short of expectations," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When we receive any information suggesting staff or contractors are not meeting our standards, we investigate and take the necessary action."</p>
        
            <p>The overwhelming majority of staff acted with integrity, honesty and professionalism, Marsh said.</p>
