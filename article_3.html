        <h2>Petone to Pito-one name change gets council backing</h2>
        <p>
Pito-one became Petone following colonial settlement in the 19th century, a misspelling of the area's traditional name. Now, it may change back.

            <p>Hutt City Council has backed a move to change the name of Petone to Pito-one.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Tenths Trust and Palmerston North MƒÅori Reserves Trust have worked on an application for the name change throughout this year.</p>
        
            <p>The two trusts contacted Hutt City Council to back the move, which was discussed at the council's Policy, Finance and Strategy Committee on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>In the meeting agenda it stated the evolution of the name Pito-one into its current form, Petone, followed colonial settlement in the region during the latter half of the 19th century. The document said it represented a misspelling of the area's traditional name.</p>
        
            <p>For any official name change, an application would have to be made to and considered by the New Zealand Geographic Board.</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt Mayor Campbell Barry will now send a letter to the New Zealand Geographic Board, reflecting the council's backing.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ spoke to locals in the suburb's Jackson Street about their views on changing the name.</p>
        
            <p>Vishnu had lived in the suburb for the past 11 months and reckoned it would be a good move.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything should be in their original form, they should not be influenced by other culture and perspective."</p>
        
            <p>Ian, who had worked in Petone for 15 years, told RNZ it would not achieve anything.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it is important really, I think what's important is here and now and here now everyone knows this district as Petone - I don't see the point in changing it."</p>
        
            <p>He said while he did not back it, he would not stop people who thought it was important.</p>
        
            <p>"If they think that's fine and they get on there and they make it happen that's good, but I've got other work to get on with, to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>Leanne believed it would make sense to change it, given it was the original name and would also respect tikanga.</p>
        
            <p>"The name's just got a whole lot of history with it as well, so it is very important."</p>
        
            <p>Damien said he did not want it to change since he had always known it as Petone, and noted the cost of making a name change.</p>
        
            <p>"[If] the council wants to spend money on that, spend some money on the roads, eh?"</p>
        
            <p>James wanted it to change, and likened it to when the 'H' was added to Whanganui in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't change anything, and it was a bit more respectful like, of what the name should be rather than people just being lazy on not pronouncing the H."</p>
