            <p>The Breakers have crashed to an eighth straight loss in the NBL, beaten 97-82 by the Tasmania Jackjumpers in their Christmas Day game in Hobart.</p>
        
            <p>Another poor finish cost the New Zealand side, who opened up an early seven-point lead and were still within sight heading into the final quarter at just five points down.</p>
        
            <p>Guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright scored 23 points but appeared fortunate to stay on the court when he became involved in a fiery altercation over the closing minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright was among the Breakers players off their best in long-range shooting, managing just four of their 23 three-point attempts.</p>
        
            <p>Other standout performers on the stats sheet were big men Tacko Fall (11 points, nine rebounds, three blocks) and Sam Mennenga (11 points, seven rebounds).</p>
        
            <p>Tasmania were led by Jordon Crawford, who included six three-pointers among his 26 points.</p>
        
            <p>Breakers coach Petteri Koponen said his side were guilty of letting a good position slip away.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the same story as against Sydney (previous game) with us giving effort for 30-35 minutes but then we start to rush some things and don't make the pass to the open guy, and try to go individually," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We kind of lost our poise there again and it's something we've talked a lot about during the season because it has been our problem.</p>
        
            <p>"During this losing stretch we've been shooting the ball really badly - four of 23 from three tonight is not good enough.</p>
        
            <p>"There are no magic tricks, but we keep fighting as a team. No one wants to quit and it's just those crucial moments we need to play better. The guys are much better than we're showing right now."</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers have a chance to end their losing run when they play the last-placed Taipans in Cairns on Tuesday night.</p>
