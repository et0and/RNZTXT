            <p>The Hurricanes have had their seventh straight win of the Super Rugby Pacific season after beating the Chiefs 36-23 in Wellington in a blockbuster contest between two heavyweights.</p>
        
            <p>The home side made use of their many strike weapons in round eight with Asofo Aumua, Jordie Barrett, Kini Naholo, Tyrel Lomax and Ruben Love all playing their part.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes great TJ Perenara equalled Julian Savea's record for the most Super Rugby tries, with the 62nd of his career.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara stepped up after he came in to replace the injured Cam Roigard and proved his worth with a try double.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes led 17-13 at halftime but were pushed early in the second half by the Chiefs, before the home side stormed back with late tries.</p>
        
            <p>Hooker Aumua took on the Chiefs' defence all night.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw said his team struggled to get the momentum back but earned it through the physicality of their pack.</p>
        
            <p>"We do have some powerful athletes but it was unbelievable tonight," Laidlaw told SkySport.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to come back from a bye and not miss a beat I suppose.</p>
        
            <p>"The Chiefs have probably got the best defence in the competition, so I think we'll take the win against a quality side."</p>

            <p>Chiefs captain Luke Jacobson told SkySport it was disappointing to drop their third match of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a few errors in our own half which the Hurricanes ended up getting possession from and scoring points from as well," Jacobson said.</p>
        
            <p>"That really hurt us.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight we probably didn't get as much ball as we like in the right areas of the field, so we can look at what we have to do to get more of those kind of opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"In the first half we didn't get to play much footy."</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes were the dominant side in the first 40 minutes, which was only partially reflected on the scoreboard. They kept the visitors inside their own half and on defence.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie displayed some great offloads and chip kicks to showcase his skills.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes retain top spot on the standings with the bonus point win.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes next take on the Fijian Drua in Suva, while the Chiefs have the bye.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 36 (TJ Perenara 2, Brayden Iose, Kini Naholo, Asafo Aumua tries; Cameron penalty & 4 conversions)</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs 23 (Cortez Ratima, Emoni Narawa tries; McKenzie 2 conversions & 3 penalties)</p>
