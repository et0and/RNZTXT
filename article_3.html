            <p>Laser treatment worth thousands of dollars is up for grabs at a 'tattoo fail' competition in New Plymouth this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The event is part of the New Zealand Tattoo and Art Festival being held at the TSB Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Festival organiser Brent Taylor said the competition which was running for just the second time was hugely popular, but also had a serious side.</p>
        
            <p>"Generally, it's not a tattoo done in a shop or professionally what's going to win - it is a home job or a very poorly executed tattoo. That could be life-changing for someone to get that removed when they can't afford it as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Sacred Laser is also very generous with the prize, which gets the people queuing up because $2000 would probably remove - mostly remove or fully remove - a terrible tattoo."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said last year's winner was overwhelmed.</p>
        
            <p>"The winner was almost in tears when she won that, and she knew she was going to get this horrible monstrosity taken off - I think it was her stomach or something. So, she was like, stoked, which is pretty cool too. It's kind of a win-win for everyone."</p>

            <p>Taylor said he expected more entrants this year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just whether they are brave enough to get up there, but the MC makes it really fun as well. There's no judgement, it's all just a bit of a laugh and done in good spirit."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said he had seen a few bad tattoos in his time.</p>
        
            <p>"There's just some of the silly home jobs. The ones you see where people I don't know whether they've been drinking and there's a tattoo machine around or they think it's a good idea to let their mate tattoo them. Some of them can be pretty average."</p>
        
            <p>He had seen a few grammatical fails, a la the misspellings in Energy Online's infamous 'No Regerts' advertisement.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh yeah, you see a bit of that sometimes where there's some terrible spelling or things that are done poorly and don't look like they are supposed to look like."</p>
        
            <p>And then there were the proverbs or similar in foreign languages and scripts which were not what they seemed.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, you get a bit of that too, but they're not as popular as they used to be. Yeah, you get a bit of that - a stitch-up where you think it means 'strength' or something and it actually means 'dog' or 'cat' or whatever.</p>
        
            <p>"A bit of that has happened in the past, but not so much now because people aren't getting those tattoos. But definitely in the past, that was a thing."</p>
        
            <p>As for Taylor, he did not have any tattoos he regretted, or had 'regerts' over for that matter.</p>
        
            <p>"Nah, I haven't regretted any, I've made fairly good decisions. The odd one's been covered over if it didn't work with what was planned."</p>
        
            <p>For anyone wanting to get a legitimate tattoo from a top-quality artist, more than 250 tattooists from around the world will be plying their trade in New Plymouth until Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They are supported by a cast of musicians, BMX riders and street entertainers at Australasia's largest tattoo festival, which is now in its 11th year.</p>
