            <p>Welcome back to RNZ's new weekly round up of Good News, where we'll be sharing some of the most uplifting recent stories featured on our website by RNZ reporters and partners.</p>
        
            <p>Here's what caught our eye this week:</p>

            <p>The total world population of tara iti, or fairy terns, is less than 40, but five fledglings have already struck out on their own this season, and as many as eight more chicks are to follow. Spirits lifted, the Department of Conservation (DOC) said this season was tracking to be the best since 2013-14.</p>

            <p>An endangered Australasian crested grebe (or pūteketeke) has been released back to the wild after swallowing a fishhook. The adult female bird, which was found near Twizel in December, underwent a major surgical procedure to remove the hook. There are thought to be fewer than 1000 pūteketeke - recently named New Zealand's Bird of the Century - in the country.</p>

            <p>Just one to two percent of the population are redheads - and those with ginger locks often find themselves alone in a crowd. But this week, a gathering of more than 100 people turned a Hastings bar into a sea of red. Organiser Reverend Jill McDonald said she had dreamed of walking to a cafe filled solely with redheads for more than 30 years.</p>

            <p>Wintec in Hamilton achieved a 100 percent pass rate for students sitting enrolled nursing exams. Programme co-ordinator Annene Bosman said the diploma helped attract students into nursing who might not otherwise give it a go, such as mature students.</p>

            <p>Dark Sky International has granted international dark sky park status accreditation to the 11,350-hectare Oxford Forest Conservation Area. It becomes the sixth New Zealand community to gain this accreditation, with more than 200 parks around the world encouraging more people to look up at the sky in wonder.</p>
