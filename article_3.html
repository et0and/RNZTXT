            <p>A north Queensland town has been ordered to urgently seek higher ground as floodwaters continue to rise for a third day.</p>
        
            <p>The alert for the Cardwell area, issued shortly after midnight, warned the situation "poses a threat to life and property".</p>
        
            <p>The heavy falls have continued, with pockets receiving more than 500 millimetres for multiple days.</p>
        
            <p>More than 10,000 properties remain without power.</p>
        
            <p>The flood disaster was yesterday marked by the tragic death of a woman who was killed when an SES boat capsized at Ingham</p>
        
            <p>Paluma Dam, north of Townsville has been drenched with 604mm of rain since 9am Sunday morning - it has now had 1316mm in 48 hours.</p>
        
            <p>A small bridge on the Bruce Highway has also collapsed, unable to endure the intense rain.</p>

            <p>The slow-moving low-pressure system continues to drive severe weather warnings, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning that more intense rainfall will lead to "dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding".</p>
        
            <p>The warning area stretches from north of Tully to south of Townsville and west to parts of the Northern Goldfields.</p>
        
            <p>Major flood warnings remain for the Haughton, Herbert, Ross, Bohle, Upper Burdekin and Murray rivers and their catchments.</p>
        
            <p>The Heatley evacuation centre reached capacity on Sunday evening, with evacuees directed to another centre that opened at 8pm at Ignatius Park College.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Bass from the Bureau of Meteorology said the monsoon trough that has brought so much rain and devastation is moving away from Cardwell and back towards Townsville.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Townsville city area would likely face the heaviest falls on Monday.</p>

            <p>"I would expect that in the next few hours, we are going to see the rainfall start to pick up again for Townsville city," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mr Bass said the Herbert River at Ingham was still below its 1967 record of 15.2 metres, but that could change as rain keeps falling.</p>
        
            <p>"We're currently around that 14.8 or 14.9, so about 30cm below that currently.</p>
        
            <p>"But it does depend on the rainfall just for the next few hours. The potential is there."</p>
        
            <p>Floodwaters in Townsville are expected to continue rising, with a peak not likely until Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Local Disaster Management Group chair Andrew Robinson said the prediction is based on mathematical modelling, but is not set in stone.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the old adage of plan for the worst and hope for the best," he said.</p>

            <p>"It's affected by a number of different things like storm surge, highest astronomical tide, rainfall and releases from the dam."</p>
        
            <p>The last flood of this catastrophic nature was in 2019, after a slow-moving monsoon dumped a deluge of rain over north Queensland for days.</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland Fire Department said 40 swift water rescues had been conducted in north Queensland in the 24 hours from Saturday to Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The Bruce Highway has been badly damaged and closed in some sections, with reports that parts of the road have broken away entirely.</p>
        
            <p>The Ollera Creek bridge near Paluma, which received the highest deluge over the weekend, has partially collapsed, leaving residents unable to travel along the highway.</p>
        
            <p>Bambaroo resident Jenna Fighera said it will impact the community severely.</p>
        
            <p>"We're cut off from Townsville at this point in time, and it's not looking promising to get to Ingham any time soon," she said.</p>
        
            <p>With the power down, the mother-of-two is making do with a generator, but ran out of fuel with no way to leave the house to secure more.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortunately we have an amazing little community and a few neighbours came to the rescue" Ms Fighera said.</p>
        
            <p>The Townsville Airport is open under "normal operations" today according to a spokesperson.</p>
        
            <p>"We recommend that you continue to monitor the status of your flight before travelling to the airport," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are driving to or from Townsville Airport, please be careful on the roads."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Catholic schools are closed for the day and matters in front of Townsville court have been adjourned or reallocated.</p>
        
            <p>Essential services such as elective surgery have been put on hold.</p>
        
            <p>In Townsville, supermarkets are likely to have "empty shelves" for up to a week, with key roads and rail cut off.</p>
        
            <p>North Queensland transport business owner Les Blennerhassett said some road trains meant for Townsville were stranded in Charters Towers.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't do anything when all the roads are closed, so we're just parked up with fridge vans full of food, all the groceries, produce, all that stuff," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He estimates it will be days before the roads reopen and a week before rail freight can go through.</p>
        
            <p>"Your big supermarkets, your Coles and Woolworths, use rail and that's out at this stage," Mr Blennerhassett said.</p>
        
            <p>"So they're in trouble, they'd have empty shelves."</p>
