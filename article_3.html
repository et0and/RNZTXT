            <p>The humble toastie is flying out the door of Picton business Toastie Lords.</p>
        
            <p>Founded in 2021, the business is so successful they now have their eyes set on national expansion.</p>
        
            <p>Emma Faith and her husband Brendan Faith, along with their business partner Taylor Hamilton, started the shop with a hunch that nostalgia for the tasty, toasted treat would bring punters through the door.</p>
        
            <p>"There's something so iconic and Kiwi in the toastie, there's definitely that element of nostalgia we all have of coming home from school and mum putting a toastie on the grill for us.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we knew from the get-go it was probably going to be quite a well-received idea," Taylor Hamilton told RNZ's Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>Their hunch proved right, they sold 75,000 toasties in 2023 and this year is set to top that.</p>
        
            <p>Keeping the menu streamlined is the key to turning toasties into profit, Hamilton said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were going to stick to one thing, toasted sandwiches, and we were going to do it really well, and that meant we didn't have to have a huge number of offerings on the menu.</p>
        
            <p>"And through doing that, not only are we able to minimise our wastage, but we're also able to ensure the product is super consistent."</p>
        
            <p>Good cheese, great bread and lashings of butter makes for a great toastie, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to have a great mixture of cheeses, and you've got to have a really good bread that gives great crunch and texture."</p>
        
            <p>Now they want to take the concept nationwide, having tested the idea with pop-ups in Christchurch, Wellington and Hamilton, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We did just under a week at each of those locations and we sold out every single day at all three pop ups."</p>
        
            <p>The next step is getting franchisees on board, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spent the last year really solidifying our business model and our procedures, and now we're at the stage where we are advertising and interviewing and meeting with potential candidates.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's moving pretty quickly. It's very exciting."</p>
