            <p>Police dive teams have scanned the Hutt River and a duck pond in the search for missing man Bret Hill.</p>
        
            <p>Bret Hill, 50, was last seen at 5.30pm on Sunday on Hillside Drive in the Upper Hutt suburb of M훮oribank.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing black shorts, a dark green t-shirt, a black zip-up hoodie, black jandals and cap.</p>
        
            <p>His wh훮nau are searching Akatarawa and Birchville on Thrursday.</p>
        
            <p>His son Trenton Hill said police are reviewing security camera footage and are looking for two people with a dog who last saw his father.</p>
        
            <p>He added the duck pond at Harcourt Park was drained and drones have searched the area.</p>
        
            <p>Police have confirmed they are following up information received from the public, but would not say what that information is.</p>
        
            <p>Trenton Hill told RNZ it was his and his father's birthday on Saturday - the day before he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>Some of his wh훮nau are coming over from Australia within the next week to assist with the search.</p>
        
            <p>"We've all taken time off work, and we've all just recouped at the house, and we're just planning what to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully we'll find my dad soon. I have high hopes, but obviously it could be bad, but I won't think about that right now."</p>
        
            <p>He said he has received more than 4000 messages since Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard a million things of where he could be.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had sightings in Porirua, sightings in Trentham, sightings in Petone, sightings in Taranaki even.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's been four days now, so there's every possibility that he could be anywhere in New Zealand right now."</p>
        
            <p>The 50-year-old was described as 195cm tall, of solid build, with black hair and a short, white beard.</p>
        
            <p>Trenton previously told RNZ his dad had just got a new job and had been doing really well for the past three years. He said he had a past of mental health issues, but it had been a long time since he had "an episode".</p>
        
            <p>"It's been three years, nearly four years since the last episode, so this coming out of nowhere, just doesn't make sense."</p>
        
            <p>He said if anyone saw something of note, people could contact him via his Facebook profile "Trent Bone".</p>
