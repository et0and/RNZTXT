            <p>Explainer - Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson has been diagnosed with breast cancer - and thanks to New Zealand's breast screening programme, it's been caught early.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said regular mammogram screenings had given her "the best odds of getting rid of it" and urged other women to get screened.</p>
        
            <p>If her news has prompted you to get screened, here's everything you need to know before you go.</p>
        
            <p>BreastScreen Aotearoa is New Zealand's free national breast screening programme for women aged between 45 and 69. This will soon be extended to 74.</p>
        
            <p>To make an appointment, all you need to do is freephone BreastScreen Aotearoa on 0800 270 200 and they'll schedule you in for a mammogram. Screenings are free every two years, all the way through the eligible age range.</p>

            <p>Regional access to breast screening works a little differently to the main centres. Mobile units will regularly go out to serve rural communities and remain there, on average, for a couple weeks. This means you have to book your mammogram in for the time those units are there.</p>
        
            <p>When you go for your breast screening, the mammographer will give you a gown to wear. You might be partially nude, but it's a respectful process. Your breast will be laid onto a mammogram machine and placed between two compression paddles. Once one breast is done, the other one is done exactly the same way.</p>

            <p>"It's not painful, but it can be uncomfortable," Breast Cancer Foundation NZ chief executive Ah-lee Rayner says.</p>
        
            <p>"All in all, it probably takes five minutes, and that five minutes can save your life. Women go through so many things that are far more uncomfortable than getting a mammogram. We recommend getting in there, seeing that it's not painful in any way, shape, or form, and getting that booking done."</p>
        
            <p>"Early detection is the best means of surviving breast cancer," Rayner says.</p>

            <p>"If you miss your appointment and you're due for a mammogram, you really should travel to your nearest provider to get it done."</p>
        
            <p>Women have a 95 percent chance of surviving breast cancer five years or longer if the cancer is detected by a mammogram.</p>
