            <p>"He tai e! He tai e! </p>
        
            <p>He tai e tangi ana i waho o Rehua,</p>
        
            <p>He tai mihi tāngata, he tai mate! </p>
        
            <p>Aue e kara Herewini! </p>
        
            <p>Te reo poroporoiere o te ao pāpāoho, </p>
        
            <p>Kua tūatia ki te moana o Rongo, Aue! Taukiri!"</p>
        
            <p>Māori artist and broadcaster Selwyn Muru has died, peacefully surrounded by whānau.</p>
        
            <p>The artist, from Ngāti Kuri and Te Aupouri, was 86 years old.</p>
        
            <p>His life's work includes painting, sculpture, journalism, broadcasting, directing, acting, set design, theatre and poetry.</p>
        
            <p>In 1990 Muru was awarded Te Waka Toi's Te Tohu mō Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu Award for his contributions to Māori visual art, broadcasting, journalism and whaikōrero.</p>
        
            <p>His works focused on communicating Māori pūrakau, history and injustices. His Parihaka series of paintings tell the story of Māori passive resistance.</p>

            <p>One of his best-known works was 'Waharoa', a 7m-high wooden gateway that stands in Aotea Square in Tāmaki Makaurau / Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The aim behind 'Waharoa' was to welcome and embrace manuhiri to Aotea Square, Muru said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"I chose wood as a medium because it already has mauri (life force) of its own that would exude warmth in an environment dominated by steel, glass and stone."</p>
        
            <p>Tangihanga arrangements are yet to be finalised.</p>
