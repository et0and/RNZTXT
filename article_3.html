            <p>President Joe Biden's personal doctor met with a top neurologist at the White House this year, it has been reported.</p>
        
            <p>Visitor logs viewed by the New York Post showed Dr Kevin Cannard, an expert in Parkinson's disease, met with Biden's physician Dr Kevin O'Connor on 17 January.</p>
        
            <p>Cannard is based at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in Maryland, where he has worked for nearly two decades.</p>
        
            <p>According to his LinkedIn profile, he has served as the "neurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit" since 2012,</p>
        
            <p>Walter Reed cardiologist Dr John E. Atwood was also in the 5pm meeting, the New York Post reported the visitor logs as showing.</p>
        
            <p>The publication had not been able to identify a fourth person who attended the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The revelation comes amid speculation over Biden's health and cognitive abilities following a disastrous debate with former president Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Calls have been mounting for the 81-year-old to step aside ahead of the presidential election on 5 November, with some insiders saying he is not capable of beating Trump.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with ABC News aired this weekend, Biden called the debate a "bad episode", but was resolute that he was the best person to contest the presidency..</p>
        
            <p>"No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and - and a bad night," Biden told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in a taped interview.</p>
        
            <p>"I just had a bad night. I don't know why."</p>
        
            <p>The New York Post spoke to Republican representative Ronny Jackson, who was the doctor for both president Barack Obama and Trump.</p>
        
            <p>He said Biden's health was O'Connor's primary responsibility, so it was "highly likely" his meeting with Cannard was about the president.</p>
        
            <p>"He should only be [regularly] treating the president and the first family."</p>
        
            <p>The New York Post said O'Connor gave Biden a clean bill of health at his annual physical back in February.</p>
        
            <p>That included neurological checks which specifically ruled out Parkinson's, O'Connor said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Cannard and Atwood both declined to comment when approached by the publication.</p>
        
            <p>"A wide variety of specialists from the Walter Reed system visit the White House complex to treat thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds," a White House spokesman said.</p>
