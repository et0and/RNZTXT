        <h2>Shark attacks rare, but swimmers should be wary, scientist says</h2>
        <p>
The risk of attacks is pretty low, says shark scientist Dr Riley Elliott, but people should remember "it is their supermarket we are venturing into".

            <p>Summer is upon us, and as the hordes head to the beach to enjoy the water, some sharks are also heading inshore.</p>
        
            <p>In November, diver Jade Kahukore-Dixon died in a shark attack near the Chatham Islands.</p>
        
            <p>And in recent weeks, there had been sightings of great white sharks in the Kawhia harbour, prompting the Department of Conservation to issue a warning to swimmers.</p>
        
            <p>But shark scientist Dr Riley Elliott said the risk of shark attacks was actually pretty low.</p>
        
            <p>Over summer, sharks headed inshore to drop off their pups in nursery habitats, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Those areas were usually warm, calm, shallow and had lots of small fish, and generally happened to be the nice places people liked to swim in.</p>
        
            <p>"But what that does mean is we don our Speedos and we go to the beach and we see sharks."</p>
        
            <p>The most common shark that people would see in the North Island and Upper South Island was the bronze whaler, Elliott said.</p>

            <p>Further south, they could encounter the sevengill shark and the great white shark.</p>
        
            <p>Sharks predominantly did their own thing, but to reduce being appealing to a shark, he recommended avoiding swimming in areas where people were fishing. Likewise, fishers should not discard their filleted fish parts in areas where people would swim, Elliott said.</p>
        
            <p>Sharks, like the bronze whaler, also loved fish and were drawn to areas where people went fishing.</p>
        
            <p>People needed to remember that when they were in the sea, they were in a wild environment with wild animals, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We should remember that it is their supermarket that we are venturing into."</p>
        
            <p>The deadliest of the sharks was the great white, but Elliott said they usually posed the biggest risk to surfers.</p>
        
            <p>"That's usually aligned with the fact that surfers dress up like seals wearing wetsuits and surf around where seals aggregate."</p>
        
            <p>But that was a very small portion of the population and most surfers understood that risk, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The risk of a shark attack was tiny compared to the risk of drowning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>For the safest way to enjoy the ocean, he advised people to swim between the flags.</p>
