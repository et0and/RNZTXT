            <p>A Ni-Vanuatu seasonal worker in New Zealand is scared for his young family who live on an island in Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>A large 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Vanuatu's capital Port Vila on Tuesday, flattening buildings and causing landslides.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who would like to remain anonymous, says he has four children and a wife back home and they have been through a lot together, with twin cyclones hitting the archipelago last year.</p>
        
            <p>He says while he was home to protect his family then, right now he's in New Zealand: "It's more scary... because we haven't contacted them since this earthquake happened... so the women haven't got any network yet because maybe the connection problem."</p>
        
            <p>RSE workers in New Zealand have sent shipping containers with aid to their families after previous natural disasters.</p>
        
            <p>Sources tell RNZ Pacific talks are underway to do something similar for Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>The RSE worker said it was early days but he and others may want to extend their visa and stay in New Zealand to work in order to support the recovery effort.</p>
        
            <p>"My group will nearly going back now, this Saturday, we are going back home," the man told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in the finish, but we haven't come up to some of like some decision to me about the one that you're talking about (earthquake).</p>
        
            <p>"Some of us we want to stay but it depends on our visa".</p>
        
            <p>He says conversations will be had in the coming days as to the best next steps but for now he and many others across New Zealand just want to know if their children and communities are safe.</p>
