            <p>After a whirlwind month in American politics, new Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has formally reintroduced herself in a highly anticipated speech on the final day of the convention in Chicago.</p>
        
            <p>US Vice President Harris, 59, is the first Black woman and South Asian woman to ever be a party's presidential nominee.</p>
        
            <p>Just a few months ago, such a scene would have been unthinkable, but after Biden had a dismal debate performance in late June he ended up withdrawing as a candidate last month, and Democrats quickly lined up to endorse Harris.</p>
        
            <p>She will face former president, Republican Donald Trump, in the 5 November election in a match quite unlike any in recent American history.</p>
