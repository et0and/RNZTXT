            <p>Olympic gold medalist Lydia Ko has once again found herself near the top of the leaderboard at the Women's Scottish Open.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand golfer recorded four birdies and a bogey, turning in back-to-back 69s at the halfway mark of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Ko is in a three-way tie for third, just two shots off the pace set by joint leaders Australian Minjee Lee and American Megan Khang, who sit at eight-under.</p>
        
            <p>The field had to deal with wet weather in the first round and mother nature threw another curve ball in the second round - wind.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lot of creativity is required when the wind is this much because I have to hit a 3-wood from 175 (yards), which is normally a 5-iron distance," Ko said. "I think it's kind of out of the ordinary situations, but you just have to adjust to the situations really quick."</p>
        
            <p>Ko sat in a five-way tie for fifth two shots back from Australian Minjee Lee after the first round. Khang, who put together another four-under 68, has joined Lee atop the leaderboard.</p>
        
            <p>Ko is in a three-way tie with LPGA Tour winner Charley Hull and CPKC Women's Open winner Lauren Coughlin.</p>
