            <p>An Auckland sex worker has admitted killing a man who had picked her up for her services before a physical altercation took place.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old woman slashed Daniel Otess, 57, multiple times around his head, shoulder and arm area before fleeing away from the scene with his $100.</p>
        
            <p>The father of two was found by a group of people beside his vehicle at an open-air car park on Symonds St, at about 5.20am on March 12, 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Whitney-Iraia-Burgess appeared at the High Court at Auckland on Wednesday where she pleaded guilty to causing Otess' death by assault with a weapon.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Mathew Downs acknowledged the presence of family in court.</p>
        
            <p>Burgess' lawyer, Mark Ryan, sought for his client's electronically-monitored bail to continue as she was at a rehabilitation centre. He said "fantastic progress" was being made.</p>
        
            <p>This was not opposed by prosecutor Brett Tantrum and granted by Justice Downs.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to make it tolerably clear you have pleaded guilty to a very serious charge, you have taken someone's life unlawfully with a weapon and a sentence for a crime of this nature would ordinarily be a term of imprisonment, that may still come to pass," Justice Downs told Burgess who said she understood.</p>

            <p>She will reappear in court for sentencing in October.</p>
        
            <p>At about 4.20am on March 12, Otess, who worked as a cleaner in the Auckland CBD area, was travelling on Liverpool St in his car.</p>
        
            <p>He stopped nearby where Iraia-Burgess was standing. She commonly worked in the vicinity of Liverpool St and City Rd.</p>
        
            <p>The pair had a quick conversation via the vehicle window and Iraia-Burgess got into the front passenger seat.</p>
        
            <p>"Seemingly for her services of sexual activity," the agreed summary of facts said.</p>
        
            <p>
There were no CCTV cameras in the car park where Daniel Otess died despite a sign saying they are recording.

            <p>Otess then drove to the Mobil petrol station on Karangahape Rd. He purchased a twin pack of condoms and withdrew $100 cash before returning to the car.</p>
        
            <p>At 4.41am, the pair arrived at a secluded car park on Symonds St.</p>
        
            <p>"Soon after their arrival at 4.44am, Ms Iraia-Burgess and Mr Otess started a physical altercation outside Mr Otess' vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>Iraia-Burgess pulled out an unknown weapon and slashed Otess multiple times. She fled up some stairs, through an undercover car park and way from the scene with Otess' $100.</p>
        
            <p>Otess attempted to get back into his car, but due to the massive blood loss from severed artery on his left forearm, he collapsed to the ground and died next to the vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>When Iraia-Burgess was arrested following a man-hunt, she declined to comment.</p>
        
            <p>A pathologist said there were five sharp force injuries detected on Otess. The lethal one was on the front left of the arm with four other sharp force injuries to his left cheek, forehaead, front of the left shoulder and front of the right wrist.</p>
        
            <p>Otess, who is survived by a wife and two daughters, had previously been remembered by friends as "a very kind, loving person".</p>
