            <p>The Fly Ferns are testing their fishing rods and reels as they prepare to tackle the world's best in Idaho Falls later this year.</p>
        
            <p>The six dedicated anglers of the New Zealand women's team are clocking up the training hours on the world class waterways of the Central North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The team is led by captain Rachel McNae who calls the waters of the Tongariro River and Lake Taup≈ç her home territory.</p>
        
            <p>Every possible effort is being made to achieve a high placing at the fourth Ladies Fly Fishing Championships in Idaho Falls in July.</p>
        
            <p>Out on the practice rapids, the team is leaving no stone unturned.</p>
        
            <p>The women recently spent time training on the Whanganui River with two men from the Spanish championship team including a six-time world champion which Rachel McNae described as "amazing".</p>

            <p>In a male dominated sport like fly fishing, she said each woman has a unique story to tell about reaching the top.</p>
        
            <p>"All of our women are competent skippers of boats," Rachel McNae said.</p>
        
            <p>"Women often pick skills up and slowly build those skills rather than having a brute force that perhaps can be a jack of one trade but a master of none.</p>
        
            <p>"We all have all strengths and work ons.</p>
        
            <p>"The exciting thing too is that we get on so well. We're really open in terms of learning and sharing information and trying things out.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not afraid to modify and try different techniques.</p>
        
            <p>"We give each other feedback and a little bit of helpful critique is also really useful."</p>
        
            <p>Once they've reached their destination of the United States the anglers will cast their lines into spring fed creeks to hook as many trout as they can.</p>
        
            <p>The competition is hosted by US Angling.</p>

            <p>Organisers stipulate a range of rules and scoring methods with the contest based around catching the most fish in an allocated time period.</p>
        
            <p>And size matters too, with each fish measured by officials before being returned to the water.</p>
        
            <p>Every angler in the team will fish five lakes and rivers where they will catch rainbow trout, brown trout and grayling.</p>
        
            <p>"When you hook a fish and land a fish in your fishing net you will run it back to your controller," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They measure in on a score trace for centimetres and then release the fish back into the water.</p>
        
            <p>"You get scored on how many fish you catch plus the length of the fish.</p>
        
            <p>"We use barbless hooks so there is harm done to the fish.</p>
        
            <p>"For the New Zealand team the grayling have very soft mouths. We're used to striking and playing hard, so with the grayling we have to do things a little differently and retrain our reflexes."</p>
        
            <p>Rachel McNae said competition is going to be fierce from the likes of USA, Australia, the reigning Czech Republic team and Canada.</p>
        
            <p>With a weaker New Zealand dollar compared to the strong greenback Rachel McNae said the costs stack up.</p>
        
            <p>Sponsors have already come on board to help with teams travel, and the national association, Sport Fly Fishing New Zealand, has awarded a $10,000 grant.</p>
        
            <p>An auction of an original hand made fishing rod from renowned maker Neil Hirtzel will also support the team.</p>
        
            <p>The members of the Fly Ferns are Rachel McNae (captain), Lesley Hosking, Louise Stuart, Suzie Foggo, Ivy Morrison, Sarah Delany, and manager Christine Pritt.</p>
