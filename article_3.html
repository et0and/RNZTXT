            <p>Last week, Damion Bailey posted on Instagram that he had just achieved his "personal best" - a 13-and-a-half hour flight between Shanghai and Dallas without any in-flight entertainment, films, books or music.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite tough, honestly," the 34-year-old from Miami, Florida tells BBC News. But he keeps doing it.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey is part of a new travel trend, known as "raw-dogging", where passengers spend long hours mid-air just staring straight ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The longer you do it, the tougher you have apparently proven yourself to be.</p>
        
            <p>"Just raw-dogged it, 15 hour flight to Melbourne," boasts Australian music producer Torren Foot on TikTok, blinking hard as if to stay awake.</p>
        
            <p>"No music, no movies, just flight map."</p>
        
            <p>Some also avoid eating or drinking. A few say they won't get up at all, even to use the toilet.</p>
        
            <p>But health experts warn that more extreme versions of the trend can pose serious risks.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester City footballer Erling Haaland recently joined the trend, posting that he had got through a seven-hour flight with "no phone, no sleep, no water, no food" and had found it "easy".</p>
        
            <p>Responses on social media questioned if he had really gone this long on a flight with no stimulation or sustenance. Others wondered if he was a robot. And some simply asked "why"?</p>

            <p>Posts about "raw-dogging" have grown steadily over the last year.</p>
        
            <p>Increasing numbers of young men - and it is mostly athletic-looking young men - are posting videos of themselves on board, staring at the in-flight map or the safety instructions card, vowing to use the "power of the mind" to get them through.</p>
        
            <p>As for the term "raw-dogging", it might have carnal origins, but increasingly it is used for anything being done without protection or support.</p>
        
            <p>For these men, the appeal seems to be the opportunity to prove their resilience and self-control.</p>
        
            <p>Some medical experts point out that the more extreme version of the trend - going without food, water and bathroom breaks - poses significant health risks.</p>
        
            <p>"They're idiots," says Dr Gill Jenkins, a GP who also works as a medical escort in air ambulance work. "A digital detox might do you some good, but all the rest of it is against medical advice," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole thing about the risk of long-haul flying is that you're at risk of dehydration.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're not moving you're at risk of deep vein thrombosis, which is compounded by dehydration. Not going to the toilet, that's a bit stupid. If you need the loo, you need the loo."</p>
        
            <p>But on the trend as a whole, business psychologist Danielle Haig says she can see why people would want to spend time in quiet reflection, allowing their mind to wander, in our increasingly fast-paced, technology-driven world.</p>
        
            <p>"It offers an opportunity to recharge mentally, gain new perspectives," she says.</p>
        
            <p>She thinks the trend signifies "a collective yearning for balance as people seek to reclaim their mental space and foster a deeper connection with their inner selves".</p>
        
            <p>And she reckons that raw-dogging allows young men, in particular, the chance to showcase their ability to handle solitude and discomfort with stoicism.</p>

            <p>"The first time I did it was on a shorter flight, out of necessity," says Bailey.</p>
        
            <p>"I forgot my headphones, and there wasn't anything on the entertainment that I wanted to watch."</p>
        
            <p>But he has carried on doing it. "I like the challenge, for sure. I fly so often. Why not challenge myself?" he says.</p>
        
            <p>Allowing yourself to be bored for a few hours is actually quite good for us, argues Sandi Mann, academic and author of The Science of Boredom. "It can really improve our relaxation and creativity."</p>
        
            <p>People have to find ways to wean themselves off the constant "highs" they get from modern technology, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to reduce our need for novelty and stimulation and whizzy-whizzy bang-bang dopamine, and just take time out to breathe and stare at the clouds - literally, if you're on a flight," she says.</p>
        
            <p>But she acknowledges all the current advice stresses the importance of staying mobile, particularly on longer flights, and also suggests avoiding food and water would pose added health risks.</p>

            <p>"I think people need to understand this is not ideal for a seven-hour flight," says Mann. "You've got to get the balance right."</p>
        
            <p>Clearly, it is not for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"Sounds like self-inflicted torture with literally no incentive," says one social media user. "Give me my in-flight wi-fi, my sleep mask and let's throw in some snacks."</p>
        
            <p>Others doubt whether all of the people posting about their 10-hour flights really have stuck to their self-imposed rules.</p>
        
            <p>And some who have tried raw-dogging themselves haven't come away impressed.</p>
        
            <p>"Big mistake," says a user on TikTok called Brenda. "Pretty sure the only thing that took off was my sanity.</p>
        
            <p>"Note to self, won't be doing that again. Definitely an overrated experience. Not at all enlightening as people make out."</p>
