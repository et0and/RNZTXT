            <p>Government agencies have warned a lack of resources will limit what they can do to prevent suicide in the new suicide prevention plan.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Health has launched consultation on its new five-year suicide prevention plan. It comes just months after shutting down the Suicide Prevention Office, which was the first action set out to be achieved in the 2019-2024 plan.</p>
        
            <p>That current action plan under Every Life Matters - He Tapu te Oranga o ia Tangata, Suicide Prevention Strategy 2019-2029 is coming to an end this year.</p>
        
            <p>But questions are already being raised within the mental health sector on whether this new plan will be able to budge Aoteaora's high suicide rate.</p>
        
            <p>In ministry correspondence to Matt Doocey as Mental Health Minister, received by RNZ under the Official Information Act, it was said:</p>
        
            <p>"Several agencies noted that they are limited in what actions they can propose leading at this time due to uncertainty about future priorities for agencies and agency resources."</p>
        
            <p>The weekly briefing from July went on to say: "We are continuing to work through these considerations with agencies to finalise potential actions that are achievable within baseline resources."</p>
        
            <p>Labour Party mental health spokesperson Ingrid Leary said: "The minister has admitted he has a smaller set of actions in his suicide prevention plan.</p>
        
            <p>"The advice from officials shows that is a direct result of the constrained funding environment."</p>
        
            <p>Leary said this made it clear that suicide prevention was "not a priority for this National government", despite "all the big talk".</p>
        
            <p>She said that this, alongside workforce challenges, frontline cuts to mental health staff and cuts to community organisations delivering counselling, "paints a bleak picture" when it came to reducing New Zealand's suicide record.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement received from Doocey, he said there was engagement from a wide range of agencies to develop the draft Suicide Prevention Plan.</p>
        
            <p>"The actions in the draft action plan include activities that can be funded from agency baselines or 'baseline resources'", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This means that no new funding would need to be sought (e.g. through Budget processes)."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said the new action plan had a "more targeted and focused set of actions", compared to the 2019-2024 plan.</p>
        
            <p>"The action plan does not represent all that government agencies will be doing to prevent suicide over this period", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Funding will be confirmed once the plan has been finalised but approximately $18 million of Vote Health funding (the health system's main source of funding) goes specifically towards suicide prevention activities.</p>
        
            <p>Life Matters manager Clare Curran said the draft plan had some "good aspirations", but she still had some apprehension.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm concerned about is what sits behind it in terms of programs and resourcing to actually deliver," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm concerned to hear about what has happened to the Suicide Prevention Office for instance, and where does it sit now as it's not a standalone entity anymore. What's it's brief, it's role and resourcing? How will it support the sector?"</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to see evidence-based research and ensuring those voices with experience of suicidal distress have a platform.</p>
        
            <p>Curran was hopeful Doocey would act with accountability in his role as mental health minister; something she saw was a positive leadership position to have in place.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has a stubbornly high rate of suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Every year, more than 550 people die of suspected suicide and the country continues to rank among the highest youth suicide rates among OECD countries.</p>
        
            <p>Māori experience around 1.8 times the suicide rate experienced by non-Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The new suicide prevention action plan is out to the public for feedback until 1 November.</p>
