            <p>There are "grave concerns" for the wellbeing of an Auckland man who was last seen 24 days ago.</p>
        
            <p>Ronny Okeke, 60, was last seen on 27 April.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said Okeke was reported missing on 3 May.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said police urgently needed to hear from anyone who may have information about Okeke's disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been 24 days since Ronny was last seen, and our concerns only grow as each day passes," Baldwin said.</p>
        
            <p>"An investigation team has been working to try and piece together Ronny's movements and what may have led to his disappearance."</p>

            <p>Baldwin said Okeke was last captured on CCTV leaving New World on Mount Roskill's Stoddard Road at 4.42pm on 27 April.</p>
        
            <p>"This remains the last confirmed sighting of Ronny to-date."</p>
        
            <p>At 11am on that day, Baldwin said Okeke tried to call his wife, who lives overseas and whom he was usually in regular contact with.</p>
        
            <p>"For her calls to continue to go unanswered since 27 April is highly unusual and gives us cause for concern."</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said police were keeping an open mind but urged the public to come forward with any information.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation team's priority is to piece together Ronny's movements and locate him.</p>
        
            <p>"If you saw Ronny on 27 April, or if you have seen or heard from him since it is very important that you contact us."</p>
        
            <p>People can call 105, quoting file number 240501/3879 or go to the police website.</p>
        
            <p>Information can also be reported anonymously through Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
