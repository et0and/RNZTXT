        <h2>'A mammoth year' for Luxon's government</h2>
        <p>
The PM says 2024 has been a good start - but "I'll be the first to tell you we have a lot more to do".
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is closing out the year "incredibly proud" of his team which has "delivered the work throughout 2024".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media alongside Local Government Minister Simeon Brown at the year's final post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Luxon said it had been a "mammoth" year for the government - "a good start".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders should "hopefully feel confident that our plan is starting to rebuild the economy, reduce the costs of living, make all Kiwis safer by restoring law and order, improve education so our kids are ready to do what they need to do into their futures and deliver better health care for everyone".</p>
        
            <p>But, he said, "I'll be the first to tell you we have a lot more to do".</p>
        
            <p>The government had worked with "speed, focus and determination all year long to "deliver the foundations for growth, brick by brick".</p>
        
            <p>It was a government of "action and delivery", completed 160 actions in its quarterly plans, he says.</p>
        
            <p>As for its Q4 plan, by the end of the year the government will have ticked off 42 of its 43 goals, Luxon says.</p>
        
            <p>"Our fourth quarter had a heavy focus on tackling issues that have been holding New Zealand back from delivering modern, reliable infrastructure which is so critical in driving economic growth that we so desperately need."</p>
