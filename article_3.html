            <p>The last surviving member of the 28th Māori Battalion has died at the age of 99.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert Gillies, known as "Bom", served in B company during World War 2 from 1942 to 1945.</p>
        
            <p>Gillies was knighted by Governor General Dame Cindy Kiro in 2022, after previously turning down the knighthood.</p>
        
            <p>This knighthood, he told RNZ at the time, was not for him, but the more than 3000 young Māori who went to fight on foreign lands for Aotearoa, who, in the eyes of the one remaining rangatira, never got the recognition or acknowledgement they deserved.</p>
        
            <p>"All the right people for this honour have died," he said. "I agreed to this for my friends who are passed on, that was my reason for agreeing."</p>
        
            <p>He was born in Rotorua, and attempted to enlist in the battalion twice but failed. It was on his third attempt aged 17 that he was successful - after lying about his age.</p>
        
            <p>He served in B Company during World War II from 1942 to 1945.</p>
        
            <p>When asked what he would tell his 17-year-old self after his experience in the war he simply said, "stay home".</p>

            <p>RNZRSA national president Sir Wayne Shelford said it was with "incredible sadness" that he heard of Gillies' death.</p>
        
            <p>"The thoughts of all members of the RNZRSA are with his whānau and loved ones - and the many people who had the privilege of knowing him.</p>
        
            <p>"As the last surviving member of 28 Māori Battalion, Sir Bom held a special place in the hearts of all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the joy of meeting him on a number of occasions, and always enjoyed his gentle nature and willingness to share his stories. His recent appearance before the Waitangi Tribunal speaking of his experiences in the War was particularly memorable."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Wayne said Gillies' death meant another link to the past lost.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a stark reminder of the importance of remembering and honouring those who have given so much in service of their country.</p>
        
            <p>"But today - we remember and honour Bom. A true gentleman, a soldier, one of the bravest of us all.</p>
        
            <p>"Ka maumahara tonu tātou ki a rātou - we will remember them."</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu chairperson Bayden Barber said Sir Bom's death was a huge loss for Māoridom.</p>
        
            <p>He was his whanaunga, knowing him as Uncle Bom, and described him as a special person.</p>

            <p>"Quick of mind, good sense of humour, even though he has seen a lot of traumatic experiences and horrors of war. He was always a friendly, loving guy, always welcoming. You just don't see people like him around."</p>
        
            <p>Barber said a contingent from Ngāti Kahungunu have already left for Rotorua to support Sir Bom's whānau, and there will be a big turnout at his tangi.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Labour Party said the nation was mourning Gillies' death.</p>
        
            <p>Defence spokesperson Peeni Henare said: "Ta Robert Gillies was a remarkable man whose legacy will live on.</p>
        
            <p>"Ta Robert's passing marks the end of an era, as he was the last of the Māori Battalion, which played a crucial role in New Zealand's military history.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is a better place because of the service and advocacy from people like Ta Robert. His contributions will be remembered not only for their military significance but also for the impact he had on te ao Māori."</p>
        
            <p>The party said it extended his condolences to his family.</p>
