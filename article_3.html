        <h2>Council to weigh pros and cons in stoush over Wānaka McDonald's</h2>
        <p>
Hundreds are opposed to the restaurant opening, citing "excessive traffic movements" and its impact on the "aesthetic values" of the town.

            <p>The Queenstown Lakes District Council is set to hear submissions from members of the public on Monday about a McDonald's restaurant opening in Wānaka.</p>
        
            <p>The council is considering whether to grant consent to open a restaurant at the Wānaka-Luggate Highway, including a drive-through operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
        
            <p>Public submissions were sought, and of the 366 made, 339 were opposed, 21 in support and six wanted changes to the plan.</p>
        
            <p>Wao Aotearoa Charitable Trust strongly opposed the idea and had concerns about the visual and aesthetic impact on the town.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed site is highly visible at the entrance of Wānaka and is adjacent to significant landscape features such as Mount Iron," its submission said.</p>
        
            <p>"The development will have a substantial adverse impact on the visual and aesthetic values of this sensitive location.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed mitigation measures, including planting and mounding, are insufficient to address the impacts of the building, signage, lighting, and parking areas.</p>
        
            <p>"This site does not align with the community's objective to protect and enhance our natural landscapes."</p>
        
            <p>The trust also had concerns about waste management, with the submission saying Wānaka had shown leadership in the move to a zero-waste economy.</p>
        
            <p>One woman, who lived about a kilometre from the proposed site, was for the restaurant being built - but with some conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Opening hours are restricted to 10pm on weeknights and 12pm on weekends," her submission said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am concerned by the potential for excessive traffic movements, unsafe driving and anti-social behaviour by McDonald's customers speeding along Aubrey Road at night disturbing sleeping residents. Limiting opening hours would help reduce the impact."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors will hear from more than 100 people who made submissions, with the meeting expected to take about three days.</p>
