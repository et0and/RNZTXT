        <p>
The number far exceeds the figure US officials have previously provided.

            <p>North Korean forces are experiencing mass casualties on the front lines of Russia's war against Ukraine, with a thousand of their troops killed or wounded in the last week alone in the Kursk region of Russia, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>The number far exceeds the figure US officials have previously provided.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences," Kirby said, describing the North Korean troops' offensive as "massed, dismounted assaults."</p>
        
            <p>The North Korean and Russian missions to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Kirby said President Joe Biden would likely approve another security assistance package for Ukraine in coming days. Earlier this week, Biden condemned Russia's Christmas Day attacks on Ukraine's energy system and some of its cities and asked the Defense Department to continue its surge of weapons to Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>On 17 December, a US military official said North Korea had suffered several hundred casualties while fighting against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about what ranks the North Korean casualties included, the military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was from lower-level troops to "very near to the top."</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that more than 3000 North Korean soldiers have been killed and wounded in Russia's Kursk region.</p>
