            <p>Watch: Tātaki Auckland Unlimited chief executive Nick Hill explains why SailGP has decided not to race in Auckland next year.</p>
        
            <p>The unavailability of a spectator facility has seen Auckland withdraw from hosting SailGP in March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Tātaki Auckland Unlimited chief executive Nick Hill said they worked with SailGP to explore all possible options to stage the event.</p>
        
            <p>Wynyard Point land as a spectator facility was part of SailGP's original vision for the sailing competition.</p>
        
            <p>However, its unavailability proved to be a barrier to holding the event, leaving SailGP needing a new venue.</p>
        
            <p>He told a media briefing on Wednesday: "We're confirming the fact that Sail GP's not going to be happening in Auckland this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We've worked hard with Russell Coutts and the Sail GP team to find a way to hold the event the way that Russell wants to hold it - that's in the middle of the harbour, with a stand on the side of the harbour - it's just not possible to do that this year."</p>
        
            <p>"We hope we can do it in the future."</p>
        
            <p>He said the land that Coutts wanted to use for that stand - at Wynyard Point - was not available.</p>
        
            <p>That is where the old Tank Farm was, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The tanks have been removed and there's a quite a complicated process to hand the land back to the council because of the potential for contamination.</p>
        
            <p>"From a health and safety point of view, until we've completed that remediation process - or Eke Panuku has - it's not safe to assume you could put a stand there."</p>
        
            <p>He said "all sorts of other options around the harbour" had been explored with Sail GP.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day, Russell and the sponsors of Sail GP don't believe they can put the event on in a way that they want to."</p>
        
            <p>He said all major events were complex, "and particularly when you put an event on in the middle of the harbour".</p>
        
            <p>"Something like the FIFA World Cup is years in the planning, so we'll work through all of this with Sail GP and we'll come up with a model that works in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It does mean that the funding we would've put into Sail GP is now available and there's plenty of demand and ideas on how we might use that over the next 12 months."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in a statement the organisation said: "SailGP continues to work with its partners, including relevant local and central government agencies, to progress planning for its season four New Zealand event 23-24 March 2024."</p>
        
            <p>The SailGP is in its second year of a four-year deal to host alternative regattas Lyttelton and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of spectators turned out earlier this year to watch the racing at Christchurch's Lyttelton Harbour.</p>
