        <h2>Their race is not yet run - retired greyhounds looking for new homes</h2>
        <p>
As the cost of living bites, people aren't taking in as many furry companions as they used to. And as kennels fill up, greyhounds whose racing days are over aren't being adopted. Audio

            <p>As the cost of living bites, people aren't taking in as many furry companions as they used to. And as kennels fill up, greyhounds whose racing days are over aren't being adopted.</p>
        
            <p>When a greyhound in Waikato retires from racing it comes to kennel manager Carolyn Henley. She learns about each animal to figure out what sort of household would best suit it.</p>
        
            <p>"This lovely handsome boy is Nate, and he is a rare cat-trainable dog," she told RNZ, introducing some of the dogs currently in her care.</p>
        
            <p>Henley said she has never had so many dogs waiting for a home.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it had a lot to do with Covid, and how Covid has affected the country. And it's expensive, to have your family and adopt a dog, and consider what it's going to cost you."</p>
        
            <p>Greyhounds As Pets (GAP) works to rehome greys once they are retired. Adoption, events and volunteer coordinator Dawn Glover said across all the different agencies that rehome domestic pets there has been a slow down in adoptions.</p>
        
            <p>And it is not just a problem in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"For instance, it has been recorded in the UK that there's four times the number of bulldog-cross dogs waiting in rehoming kennels than there are homes available."</p>

            <p>Glover said they are seeing an increase in people who have adopted a dog but can no longer afford to keep them, and in the last three months they have had 17 dogs returned.</p>
        
            <p>"Of those, six were over two years in a home before they were returned to us, and those returns were listed as 'changes in circumstance'."</p>
        
            <p>Lewis Nicholls is a dog trainer for Think Dog. He said people do need to know that they can afford vet bills, animal insurance, dog training, and food before committing to an animal.</p>
        
            <p>However, dogs don't need fancy toys as it's not the toy itself but what you do with it that makes it fun, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A toy that is just lying around, being 'dead' basically is no fun, but then if you get an old tea-towel out and whip it around and they get to chase it, then that becomes the best toy ever."</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls said people need realistic expectations when bringing home a dog, especially a greyhound or other retired working dog that does not know what it is to be a pet.</p>
        
            <p>GAP is running a pet adoption day on 18 November at Qualified Pet Services in Takanini, Auckland, to give people an opportunity to meet some of the dogs currently waiting in Henley's kennels.</p>
        
            <p>Along with Nate, Henley points out a 'little cutie,' Zeus, who will be at the adoption day.</p>
        
            <p>"He is all good to go, the most playful, happy little soul who would just love a family."</p>
        
            <p>Glover said after falling in love with the breed as a 10-year-old, she adopted her first greyhound, Henry, three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"He has been so easy, the most perfectly fulfilled dream I've ever had," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She now has two adopted hounds and is fostering another.</p>
        
            <p>Unsurprisingly Glover thinks a greyhound might be perfect for everyone else, too.</p>
