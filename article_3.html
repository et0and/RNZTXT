            <p>Newly released documents reveal that Auckland's mayor at one point supported a plan to keep up to 15 percent of buyout money offered to some owners of flood-damaged homes.</p>
        
            <p>But the proposal was later voted against and the majority of councillors instead opted to retain just 5 percent of each home's buyout.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council plans to spend more than $700 million buying out about 700 flood-damaged homes.</p>
        
            <p>Minutes from a confidential governing body meeting in early October showed 5 percent was the minimum suggested, with 10 percent for homes worth over $1.5m and 15 percent for homes valued over $3m.</p>
        
            <p>This means homeowners of higher value properties could be left more than $100,000 out of pocket.</p>
        
            <p>The recommendation had come from the Storm Recovery Political Advisory Group and was discussed at the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Wayne Brown initially supported the original proposal for the sliding scale, and had voted against a resolution to replace it with a flat contribution rate of 5 percent for insured properties, and 20 percent for uninsured properties.</p>
        
            <p>However, he later voted for the flat rate of 5 percent, along with the majority of other councillors.</p>
        
            <p>Brown was unavailable for an interview.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from his office said his main considerations in supporting the 10 and 15 percent takes were fairness and reducing the burden on ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>Some flood-affected home owners in Auckland said they are disappointed that the council had considered taking more from struggling families.</p>

            <p>West Auckland Is Flooding group chairperson Lyall Carter is relieved it was not approved.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't know where people are sitting financially, there may be a home that's on papers worth millions of dollars, but that could mean millions of dollars in a mortgage."</p>
        
            <p>Carter, who represents at least over 200 flood-affected families in West Auckland, said there needs to be an equitable process for buyouts across different types of homes in different locations.</p>
        
            <p>He said owners will not be pleased to find out that council had once discussed an even higher rate.</p>
        
            <p>"This just adds to the mistrust between council and our people, it adds to a feeling of frustration and anger that we are not seen to be given prioritisation."</p>
        
            <p>Carter said many owners feel they are bearing the consequences of under-maintained infrastructure, and are calling for the 5 percent contribution to be scrapped.</p>
        
            <p>He said the owners will be selling their homes to council at January 2023 prices, only to go into a market that is already on the rise.</p>
        
            <p>He fears many will struggle to purchase new homes in their community.</p>
        
            <p>Aleysha Knowles, whose North Shore home was damaged by slips during the storms, said the 5 percent contribution already feels like a "kick in the gut".</p>
        
            <p>She said it is disappointing to learn that it could have been even more.</p>
        
            <p>"The sliding scale made it even more harsh and it's just really disappointing that they thought this was fair."</p>
        
            <p>Amrita Aujla's home in West Auckland was flooded up to 2 metres high, and she is now waiting for categorisation and a buyout offer.</p>
        
            <p>She said it is unfair that Aucklanders are expected to contribute 5 percent when similarly affected homes in Hawke's Bay are being offered a full buyout.</p>
        
            <p>"Even with the 5 percent, I still have a mortgage to pay, I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a house again,</p>
        
            <p>"I mean if you were considering 15 percent or whatever, that's just not fair, absolutely not fair."</p>
        
            <p>Aujla said knowing that the council had considered a higher contribution from owners erodes her trust in the decision makers.</p>
        
            <p>"The matter of fact that they actually even considered this, it breaks my heart, you know I have no confidence in the government anymore, unfortunately, not at the council, absolutely zero."</p>
        
            <p>Council records show councillor Alf Filipaina voted against the 5 percent contribution.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, it could be many more months of waiting before hundreds of affected homeowners find out whether they will even be entitled to a buyout.</p>
