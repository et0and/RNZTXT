        <h2>Why friendship break-ups can hurt just as much as romantic ones</h2>
        <p>
Besties are so good for our mental health that losing one can be physically painful.

            <p>Cutting contact with her best friend of 12 years was more painful than any romantic break-up Keeshia Pettit has experienced.</p>
        
            <p>"She was this person that I felt very safe around, very comfortable with and I could be myself," says the 31-year-old podcast producer from Sydney/Gadigal Country.</p>
        
            <p>"[We were] two peas in a pod. We used to hear it all the time."</p>
        
            <p>Keeshia broke up with her bestie seven years ago, and says she still feels sad about it.</p>
        
            <p>"She started doing some things that I just really didn't agree with… I found out that she'd lied to me.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a fracture that occurred in the friendship, and I didn't ever see it going back to how it used to be.</p>
        
            <p>"[After the break-up] I'd lost this really, really important person in my life that I'd envisioned this future with."</p>
        
            <p>Clinical psychologist Hannah Korrel has written a book on friendship break-ups, and says every person she's spoken to has gone through some kind of relationship breakdown with a friend.</p>
        
            <p>And yet, there isn't much research on how we interact in friendships.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] doesn't matter what your age is, everybody's gone through it. So I think it's a massive blind spot in society that we probably need to talk about more," Dr Korrel says.</p>
        
            <p>ABC podcast Ladies, We Need to Talk did just that, looking at the heartache of friendship break-ups - and why we're often at a loss when it comes to dealing with them.</p>
        
            <p>Yumi Stynes speaks to women who've been through the heartache of a friendship break-up to find out how they moved on, and what marks their former besties left behind.</p>
        
            <p>Female friendships are often based on talking, interacting and intimacy, explains Dr Korrel, unlike men, who focus on "physical proximity and doing a task".</p>
        
            <p>Dr Korrel says women might feel as if they have found a "kindred spirit" in another woman who feels like a sister.</p>
        
            <p>For Keeshia, her bestie was her chosen family.</p>
        
            <p>"We were the type of friends that would spend all our family vacations together, but also really big moments… even Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"She was the first person I always wanted to talk to. We always knew what each other were up to."</p>
        
            <p>There's a good reason friendship can feel so safe and special, says Dr Korrel.</p>
        
            <p>"A good friend is associated with turning off your sympathetic nervous system, and turning on your parasympathetic nervous system, which is the one that's called your rest and restore system."</p>
        
            <p>Basically, besties can help us switch off our fight or flight and feel calm.</p>
        
            <p>Melanie, who asked we don't use her real name, met her best friend in her fourth year of uni.</p>
        
            <p>The Canadian says as roommates, they had the "perfect partnership".</p>
        
            <p>"She did all the cooking and I did all the cleaning - we kind of saw the world the same way," the 33-year-old says.</p>
        
            <p>"We played a lot of dance on the [Nintendo] Wii and watched dumb reality television."</p>
        
            <p>Once their study was over, the pair were living hours apart but were in regular contact.</p>
        
            <p>That was until Melanie says her friend became pregnant and began reaching out less.</p>
        
            <p>A miscommunication about what they needed from each other at that time ultimately led to a breakdown in the relationship.</p>
        
            <p>Melanie says she knew the friendship had taken a real blow when her friend posted pictures of a baby shower Melanie was not invited to.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more complicated when you don't live close… in the sense that it's harder to reconnect because you're not running in the same circles," Melanie says.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not going to be seeing the same people. There won't be those organic opportunities to mend your friendship."</p>
        
            <p>Friendship burnout is definitely real. So how do you meet friends when you and your kids are all grown up?</p>
        
            <p>When a friendship is in trouble, many of us don't have the tools to help it get back on track, Dr Korrel says.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't teach people how to deal with conflict… or learn how to speak your boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially women, we're supposed to be 'don't rock the boat' or be easygoing."</p>
        
            <p>She says a lot of people find addressing issues in friendships confronting and awkward, so they just… don't.</p>
        
            <p>And when a friendship comes to an end, the heartache can be as crushing as the end of a romantic relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"[There is] this chemical reaction in your body [that] actually hurts… it hurts your muscles, it makes you feel heavy, physically heavy," Dr Korrel says.</p>
        
            <p>Having never experienced a romantic break-up (Melanie is married to her university sweetheart), she says it's been particularly hurtful.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a much better understanding now of what heartbreak can feel like and how you're just looking for that closure and thinking about what you could have done differently.</p>
        
            <p>"I miss her."</p>
        
            <p>Keeshia recently saw a post on social media of her friend getting married.</p>
        
            <p>"She looked so beautiful, and she looked so happy, and I didn't have any idea that this was going on in her life."</p>
        
            <p>Keeshia says she is "see-sawing" over whether she should reach out.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how each of us would feel in terms of being defensive over why the relationship ended, or whether she felt as hurt as I did, or whether she blames me for ending that friendship.</p>
        
            <p>"And I would want to think now that I [give] people more grace and a bit more of an understanding and empathy because I've been afforded those graces as well."</p>
        
            <p>Keeshia says it makes her emotional to think about what the friendship could have been.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're lucky enough to have a friendship, that feels so easy like ours did… they can be like a persistent love that you have throughout the rest of your life.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel sad talking about it because I feel as though… it could have been something that we took to our graves."</p>
