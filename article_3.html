            <p>Lorde has released her first new music in nearly three years - a cover of Talking Heads' 1978 single Take Me to the River.</p>
        
            <p>The single, released on Friday, is part of a tribute album to the Talking Heads live record Stop Making Sense.</p>
        
            <p>According to Variety, the tribute album will also feature covers by Paramore, Miley Cyrus, The National and Girl in Red.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known when the album, titled Everyone's Getting Involved, will be out.</p>
        
            <p>The single is Lorde's first since Mood Ring, off her third studio album Solar Power, was released in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In a note on Instagram on Friday, Lorde remembered the first time she ever heard Talking Heads, at the age of 12.</p>
        
            <p>She felt a "constant burning urge to express myself" but could not manage to do so, she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Her mother, poet Sonja Yelich, showed her Talking Heads performing Take Me to the River on YouTube.</p>
        
            <p>Singer David Byrne was "moving like I've never seen anyone move, and his eyes are rolling back in his head", Lorde wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel a portal open between me and the screen. Humour, lust, rhythm and ritual course through me.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't understand what I'm feeling, but I do understand that the band in the grainy video live with the same strangeness that I do."</p>
        
            <p>Immediately after viewing the clip, Lorde watched Stop Making Sense for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was "truly changed" by the experience.</p>
        
            <p>Lorde wrote that her cover was recorded and mixed over the course of "a few days" in Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>"It's my interpretation of pixellated spiritual experience. We did it fast, I didn't let myself tidy it up too much, it had to feel young and imperfect.</p>
        
            <p>"It's beyond a great honour to be part of this compilation."</p>
        
            <p>Talking Heads' version of Take Me to the River was itself a cover - the original song was written by Al Green and released in 1974.</p>
