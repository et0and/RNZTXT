            <p>Sneezing, coughing, a runny nose and sore throat: Thousands of people are falling sick every week.</p>
        
            <p>As we navigate the depths of winter and ride the back end of a Covid wave, what can be done to keep bugs away - and how do you tell whether a sniffle is serious?</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua GP Dr Cate Hill told First Up that there were some concerning symptoms people should look out for.</p>
        
            <p>"Things that would worry me are like a super high fever that doesn't come down with paracetamol, really severe headache or a lot of pressure in your face, super sore throat that makes it really hard to swallow. And any breathing difficulties, so feeling really short of breath with your cough."</p>
        
            <p>She said often, the signs of something serious were hard to miss and using over-the-counter remedies would not mask the problem.</p>
        
            <p>Hill recommended heading to the GP as soon as things felt unusual.</p>
        
            <p>"Most GPs will have some sort of emergency service where they will see people who are really unwell as soon as they practically can, or at least give you a phone call or some sort of triage process to help you decide whether you need to be seen or not."</p>
        
            <p>She said taking vitamin C and zinc supplements could help fight infection, but it was better to include them as part of a healthy diet to prevent illness.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're not getting enough in your diet, then that's going to make you more vulnerable."</p>
        
            <p>Using nasal rinses was a good idea because they helped clear the nose, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She also recommended nasal sprays.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that those are helpful. One, because they help with symptom control and two, because they help you breathe and recover faster as well."</p>
        
            <p>She said pseudoephedrine, which recently returned to pharmacy shelves, was effective if used responsibly.</p>
        
            <p>But it was not just a healthy diet and the right medications that helped, she said - it was also important to have a clean and dry living space.</p>
        
            <p>And people who were unwell were better off staying away from the workplace to avoid the spread of bugs, she said.</p>
