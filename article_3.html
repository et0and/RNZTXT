            <p>Whanganui and neighbouring iwi will travel to Ngāruawāhia at the weekend to meet with the Kiingitanga and other iwi concerned about the plans of the new coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi leaders are expected to travel from across the country to Tūrangawaewae Marae on Saturday in response to Te Paki o Matariki, a royal proclamation issued by Kiingi Tuheitia late last year, calling for all iwi to unite.</p>
        
            <p>Whanganui iwi leader Ken Mair said there was a strong desire by Māori around the country to take action against the new government's policies and plans.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never seen this concerted effort to undermine all the good work that our tūpuna have done in the past in this way … this attack right across the board, whether it's our language, the Tiriti o Waitangi, health, smoking. It's a deliberate strategy to basically erase us from legislation and policies.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they've opened up a can of worms, [they've] opened up the bare cupboard."</p>
        
            <p>Te Paki o Matariki is the highest form of royal proclamation and the first issued by Kiingi Tuheitia in more than a decade. It came a day after nationwide protests against the new government's moves to end co-governance policy and reinterpret the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Mair said Whanganui iwi would be at Tūrangawaewae to listen.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody has the right to do what they believe is correct in trying to pull this government into line. I don't know what to expect from that hui except that the king, te ariki Tumu and the Rātana tumuaki … will take the message from the hui to carry the mauri around the country.</p>
        
            <p>"I suspect there'll be quite a few actions, some co-ordinated, some not."</p>

            <p>Te Korowai o Wainuiārua chairperson Aiden Gilbert said a group would travel from the central North Island to represent the three iwi Uenuku, Tamakana and Tamahaki.</p>
        
            <p>He said the iwi collective's main concerns were the dialling back of Resource Management Act reforms in which Māori seemed to have "more say", and impacts on freshwater policy Te Mana o Te Wai.</p>
        
            <p>Gilbert said there were many Labour reforms Te Korowai o Wainuiārua did not want reversed and he was concerned that the new government could have further repeals in mind.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't started yet. They'll start in March with their portfolios. We'll get a clearer view in March, April, May."</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with RNZ on Tuesday, New Zealand First deputy leader Shane Jones said the national hui of iwi could turn into a "moan session".</p>
        
            <p>"What the country voted for was a revamp and a reset, and a reset's on the way," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones told RNZ the strengthening te reo Māori should happen around the kitchen table, and not in government documents.</p>
