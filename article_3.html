        <h2>Mixed reactions to Eftpos 'tipping' options</h2>
        <p>
New Eftpos machines prompt customers to tip an extra 5, 10 or 15 percent - and not everyone is a fan. Audio

            <p>Kiwis are debating the need for tips at New Zealand restaurants.</p>
        
            <p>New Eftpos machines prompt customers to tip an extra 5, 10 or 15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Some diners said they felt pressured to spend more money, but others said it was good for hard-working staff.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklander Liam Crawford said the prompt was awkward.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's definitely trying to play on people's morals, and just almost make you feel bad for saying no so you say yes," he said. "Otherwise you feel like a dick."</p>
        
            <p>In the United States tips were included in the minimum wage for restaurant staff, but that was not the case in Aotearoa - so Tim Mace wondered why Kiwi staff would need tips in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"Then why is the price of the food so expensive? I thought the price of the service was meant to be included in the price of the food. Are they double-dipping, or is this just a sign of the times?"</p>
        
            <p>Mace said tips should be treated as a reward for good service, not an expectation.Â </p>
        
            <p>"Tipping is definitely something to consider, but being New Zealanders the idea is so foreign. It hasn't been ingrained in our society."</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality worker Dee Harris said staff sometimes skipped over the tip screen to avoid embarrassing customers.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite a few of the servers will just go 'no,' I think they feel like a lot of us Kiwis aren't really used to the idea of tipping so they aren't trying to force it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like we get paid enough here in New Zealand, we're quite fortunate that we're not relying on tips for our base income."</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality New Zealand chief executive Steve Armitage said the new Eftpos machines were a response to changing technology.</p>
        
            <p>"With technology advancements people don't carry cash as much as they used to, and might not necessarily have a note or some coins to pass on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is another example of how technology advancement is changing the way things operate."</p>
        
            <p>But he said customers shouldn't feel pressured to tip.</p>
        
            <p>"It very much needs to be left to the customer. If it's something that's a little bit more discreet and provides an option for the customer to select, that's a much better way to go."</p>
        
            <p>Some members of the public feared New Zealand could adopt the United States' tipping culture. Anusha Chappidi said she did not want it to become the norm.</p>
        
            <p>"It should be a choice. I've been to the United States and I forgot to tip because it's not a normal thing here and they looked at me like, you know?"</p>
        
            <p>She said it was fine to ask for a tip as long as saying "no" was a comfortable option.</p>
        
            <p>"When there isn't an option [on the screen], you can't tip at all. So if there's a 'no' and a 'yes' option, I don't mind."</p>
        
            <p>Azerbaijani tourist Murad Allahverdiyev said tipping was the norm in his country. He believed the rest of the world should do it too.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] should be normal - in my country we are paying 20 percent, we have to for inspiring the people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is our society's psychology, we have to take care of the guys taking care of us."</p>
        
            <p>Steve Armitage said tipping was becoming more common in New Zealand, but many were still resistant to it.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's something Kiwis are much more open to than they used to be," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But clearly in the current environment each dollar is prized at the moment, we're being very careful about how we're spending any discretionary money we might have, so I understand why people are hesitant around it."</p>
        
            <p>He said the new Eftpos machines were a logical way to reward good service, but he said staff should make customers feel comfortable saying no.</p>
