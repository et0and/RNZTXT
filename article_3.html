        <h2>'Like a truck had hit our house': Residents wake to tornado devastation</h2>
        <p>
"It was horrific. My wife woke up screaming": Mangawhai has been compared to a war zone, with houses destroyed, roofs torn off, debris scattered across roads and power poles ripped out.

            <p>A Mangawhai resident says the tornado-like storm that struck early on Sunday felt like a truck hitting his house.</p>
        
            <p>The Northland town was hit by high winds in the early hours, damaging 50 houses and knocking down power poles, power lines and trees.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Grant Noonan was awake when it began, and said it quick, violent, and loud.</p>
        
            <p>"Lying in bed, it sort of was an eerie feeling. Things started moving sideways and back and forth, and the 'boom', it was like a truck had hit our house."</p>
        
            <p>"It was horrific. My wife woke up screaming. It was quick, it was violent, it was loud."</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara Civil Defence Emergency Management controller John Burt has told Morning Report  17 buildings have been yellow-stickered and a further nine white-stickered.</p>
        
            <p>A yellow sticker means there is moderate damage while a white sticker means there is light or no damage to a property.</p>
