            <p>A funeral for the New Zealander killed during a robbery in the United States will be held today in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Trish McKay was pulled onto the road after a struggle during an attempted robbery at a California mall earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>She was fatally hit by a car - and Jaden Cunningham and Malachi Darnell, both 18, as well as Leroy McCrary, 26, have been charged with her murder.</p>

            <p>An online obituary described the 68-year-old as a beloved wife, devoted mother and cherished grandmother.</p>
        
            <p>McKay was married to businessman Doug McKay, a former chair of BNZ's board. He was reported by US media as being with her when the attack happened.</p>
        
            <p>"She also had a special bond with her daughters-in-law... and was dearly loved by her Jack Russell, Archie," the obituary said.</p>
        
            <p>"Patricia was known for her welcoming and kind nature, and her affectionate laugh. She touched many lives with her warmth, generosity, and appreciative spirit."</p>
        
            <p>A tribute written by someone who knew McKay described her as "a beautiful soul", and said she was "one of the most treasured in our family".</p>
        
            <p>She would be deeply missed by those who knew her, the obituary said.</p>
