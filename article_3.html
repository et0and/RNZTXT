            <p>The economic impact of lockdowns and vaccine effectiveness are may be considered in a beefed up inquiry into the Covid-19 response.</p>
        
            <p>Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden said the government had committed to the expanded scope as part of the National Party's coalition agreements with both ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Officials now want the public to have its say on what to include.</p>
        
            <p>"The current terms of reference were decided by the same government responsible for the Covid-19 response and they place significant limits on what the inquiry can consider," van Velden said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders deserve a frank assessment of what occurred and how we can learn from it."</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the pandemic response last year delayed hearing public submissions until 2024 while the National-led coalition government reviewed its scope.</p>
        
            <p>Public consultation will begin this month on expanding the inquiry's scope to include:</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission will shortly announce details on how people can have their say on the consultation and share their experiences of the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a forward-thinking piece of work. It is not simply about learning what went wrong, but working out what we need to do right in the future," van Velden said.</p>
        
            <p>"This government is ensuring all New Zealanders' concerns are heard."</p>
