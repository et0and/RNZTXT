            <p>Evacuations are underway in Canterbury after a large fire broke out near Lake Pukaki.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says they were called to the scene after a farmer's burn-off got out of control shortly before 3pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze has been burning in the area where State Highway 80 and State Highway 8 intersect.</p>
        
            <p>The flames spread through about 50 hectares of grass and scrub during the afternoon, and FENZ said the fire was not contained, but was not spreading to the north.</p>

            <p>RNZ was unable to confirm the number of homes that had been evacuated.</p>
