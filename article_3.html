            <p>A teenager is being treated in hospital after being injured with hot water and sugar at a youth justice facility in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The concoction is colloquially known as "prison napalm" for its tendency to stick to skin and cause serious burns.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki confirmed that one of its young residents threw the mixture at another teen's face at the Korowai Manaaki facility in Wiri on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>"Police and ambulance attended the scene, and a young person was taken to hospital," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"For privacy reasons we are unable to comment on the nature of the injuries."</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki said the incident was "incredibly distressing" and staff were actively supporting the victim and his family.</p>
        
            <p>"Young people deserve the right to feel safe in our residences and we are investigating what occurred in this situation and how it could have been prevented," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a 15-year-old boy was before the Manukau Youth Court following the assault.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said he had been charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
