            <p>Sun then finished off the match, that took just over two hours to complete, winning the third set 6-2.</p>
        
            <p>She will play China's Lin Zhu in the third round. Zhu has had straight set wins in her first two rounds.</p>

            <p>Women's doubles second seeds New Zealand's Erin Routliffe and her Canadian partner Gaby Dabrowski defeated Mirra Andreeva and Anastasia Potapova 6-2 7-5 to move on the to second round where they'll meet either a Brazilian duo or Russian pairing.</p>
