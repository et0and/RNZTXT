            <p>A heliskier has been killed following an avalanche in a remote Southern Alps range.</p>
        
            <p>Rescuers were alerted to the avalanche in the Arrowsmith Range about 12.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>Rescue Helicopter pilot Dan McPherson said a group was heliskiing on the mountain when the avalanche struck.</p>
        
            <p>One person was trapped in the snow, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed one person had died.</p>
        
            <p>"One person was trapped in the avalanche and was in a critical condition when recovered at around 1pm. Tragically they died a short time later."</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the group was accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>McPherson said no one else was injured.</p>
        
            <p>"Details of the deceased cannot be provided until all necessary next of kin notifications have taken place," a police statement said.</p>

            <p>A four-person GCH Aviation helicopter crew was sent to the scene and Hato Hone St John sent a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby areas were under a considerable avalanche risk advisory, though Mt Arrowsmith was not.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Mountain Safety Council (MSC) said it was aware of a possible avalanche but had no further details.</p>
