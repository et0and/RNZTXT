        <h2>All Blacks: Fosterâ€™s legacy looms large over the Bledisloe Cup</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - There has been the odd comparison between this All Black coaching regime and the last, but one inescapable fact comes into play this weekend, writes Jamie Wall.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - 'Goodwill' is a word associated quite a bit with Scott Robertson's tenure as All Black coach so far. He came in with plenty of it, there's a decent display of it whenever he's in front of a camera, and he's using a decent share of it to quell worries about the team's direction after three losses so far in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Of course, it hasn't stopped some sections of All Black fandom comparing Robertson to his predecessor Ian Foster. It's a natural thing, especially for a public that generally treats the All Blacks like a sitting government rather than a sports team, with a very much 'what have you done for me lately' expectation.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson knew that full well going in, but while a lot of that noise can be dealt with by simply pointing out that the Springboks are current world champions, this weekend things get far less easy to brush off.</p>
        
            <p>Because you can say whatever you like about Foster and plenty have, however one fact cannot be disputed: the man absolutely owned the Wallabies. If there is to be any comparison between him and Robertson, it should be over there next two tests because if Robertson's All Blacks can't keep up that record, some serious questions need to be asked.</p>

            <p>Foster's record against the Wallabies finished with nine wins, a loss and a draw, with those negative results coming in the pandemic-affected first season in charge. 2020 also yielded a 43-5 win in Sydney, which is the biggest winning margin the All Blacks have ever had in 140 years of trans-Tasman rugby. The next two seasons saw 35 and 26 point margins at Eden Park, followed by a 38-7 win at the MCG last year.</p>
        
            <p>Equally impressive were the tight wins: the crazy 39-37 result at Marvel Stadium and 23-20 win at Forsyth Barr were tests the All Blacks had little right to win but were taken after they were given only the slenderest of chances in the dying stages.</p>
        
            <p>The Bledisloe Cup has famously resided in NZ Rugby's trophy cabinet for the last 21 seasons, but it's been most secure in the last four. Aside from the draw in 2020, the first test of every series saw the All Blacks kill off the Wallabies' hopes before they even started. Even Steve Hansen can't boast that - in 2014, 2015 and 2019 the series was live going into the second test.</p>
        
            <p>If Foster had just been judged on his Bledisloe Cup and Rugby Championship record, he'd be hailed as one of the great All Black coaches. But obviously there are more teams than just the Wallabies and they were the ones that made his four years at the helm so tumultuous.</p>

            <p>The irony for Robertson is that to escape Foster's Bledisloe legacy, he just needs to match it. He's been handed a golden opportunity to start, Joe Schmidt's Wallabies are in dire straits after two home losses to the Springboks and a hiding at the hands of the Pumas. Schmidt too is trying desperately to distance himself and his side from Eddie Jones' very dark shadow, something that's been a bit harder than he probably first thought.</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure though. This game will look fantastic in the beautiful sunshine Sydney's been having all week. Despite the Wallabies woes and thanks to the large New Zealand community in the city, a crowd of around 65,000 is expected at Accor Stadium for an afternoon kick-off - the perfect setting for Robertson's All Blacks to get their season back on track.</p>
