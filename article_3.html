            <p>Police have arrested four people as part of their investigation into a protest during the Auckland Pride Festival.</p>
        
            <p>Officers have been investigating complaints about protesters actions on 15 February at the Te Atatū Community Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Around 30 adults and young children had to be barricaded into a room in a library in West Auckland, when a group linked to Destiny Church tried to drown out a children's event taking place at the centre as part of the annual festival.</p>
        
            <p>Police said eight victims filed complaints with police which have been "thoroughly investigated" in recent weeks. There were also six witnesses that supplied statements.</p>
        
            <p>Waitematā District Commander Superintendent Naila Hassan said police attended addresses in south and west Auckland on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Four people were brought to the Henderson Police Station for interview and have since been arrested and charged," Hassan said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are further arrests to be made, and I strongly encourage those people who have chosen to avoid our staff today to pick up the phone."</p>
        
            <p>Those arrested have all been given bail to appear in the Waitākere District Court on Tuesday 18 March 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Police have filed assault-related charges, including indecent assault, over the alleged actions against three victims.</p>
        
            <p>Those charges are as follows:</p>
        
            <p>Hassan said further charges will be filed over the alleged actions against five further victims.</p>
        
            <p>Hassan said the group's actions created a great deal of distress for Rainbow communities.</p>
        
            <p>"This festival is important for our Rainbow communities, and they should be able to participate in events free of intimidation and interference," Hassan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Those working on site and attending the venue were subjected to violence and intimidation.</p>
        
            <p>"Any assault is unacceptable, but it is even more so when an adult is being charged for allegedly indecently assaulting a young person."</p>
        
            <p>Investigation staff have worked through a detailed process of reviewing footage and speaking with witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a place for peaceful and lawful protest in this country, but this event crossed the line, and this investigation makes it very clear that this will not be tolerated," Hassan said.</p>
