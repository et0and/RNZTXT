            <p>Three people have been taken to hospital, one with critical injuries, after a crash between a bus and a vehicle on the West Coast of the South Island on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to State Highway 6, near the Kakapotahi River, south of Hokitika, around 6.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>St John said three people were injured.</p>
        
            <p>"Two patients, one in a moderate condition and another in a serious condition were transported to Greymouth Hospital. A third patient in a critical condition was airlifted to Christchurch Hospital," a St John spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Two ambulances, two rapid response units, two operations managers and a helicopter were dispatched to the scene."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said crews freed a person who was trapped inside a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agenct said State Highway 6 was blocked north of Waitaha Road.</p>
        
            <p>It was warning motorists the road would be closed for many hours as a heavy tow would be needed.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists should delay their journeys because no detour was available.</p>
        
            <p>The serious crash unit was also expected to attend.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second crash involving a bus on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said five people were injured and about 700 homes lost power after a Wellington Metlink bus ran across a roundabout before hitting and partially knocking down a pole in Wainuiomata, a suburb of Lower Hutt, just before midday.</p>
        
            <p>Power was restored by 2:30pm.</p>
