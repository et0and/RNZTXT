        <h2>A kōrero with Te Matatini MC Miss Kihi</h2>
        <p>
Every item performed by kapa at Te Matatini carry a pūrākau (story) of people, places, and events of historical of significance for their hapū and iwi.
</p>
        
            <p>Te ihi, te wehi, te wana are terms used frequently with te ao Māori to describe the emotional and awe-inspiring impact kapa haka performances can have on those watching.</p>
        
            <p>Every item performed by kapa at Te Matatini carry a pūrākau (story) of people, places, and events of historical of significance for their hapū and iwi.</p>
        
            <p>Te Matatini's master of ceremonies (MC) Kihi Ririnui said she had to fight back tears and regain her composure while watching Taranaki kapa Nga Purapura o Te Tai'auāuru.</p>
        
            <p>"It's opened our eyes, they're taking it back, they've made us go there without googling, they have told the story."</p>
        
            <p>Ririnui, more commonly known as Miss Kihi, said the performances clearly demonstrate the powerful spiritual connection Māori have to their culture.</p>
        
            <p>"You have spoken te reo, just in English, it's in your essence, it's in your ngākau, it's in the way you read the room, it's in the way you growl your child, it's in the way you cook, it's in everything you do, just not in the linguistic, not in the tongue."</p>
        
            <p>Nga Purapura o Te Tai'auāuru rōpū based this year's Te Matatini performance on the whakapapa that binds Taranaki iwi together - Parihaka. Ririnui was drawn into the wāhine stage outfits which changed from red, black, and white kākahu to white Victorian gowns and piupiu.</p>

            <p>Just like the 'purapuraz' staunch, yet subtle stage presence, Ririnui said te reo Māori is prospering the same as history.</p>
        
            <p>"You know you go to the trending outlets and the 80's jeans has come back up to the waist again. Well, we're being brave on the stage, Purapura come through, you know what you did. They changed the game an brought back the old reo."</p>
        
            <p>But it was te hua o te ihi te wehi me te wana, the crowd reacting to a performance with excitement and passion, that blew her away.</p>
        
            <p>"You know when the iwi get up aye? It's over. That is what it did to us. Humans will react every time and Māori, they're so emotional, we get into it, and they will do that in a minute.</p>
        
            <p>"That was just epic. Someone saw themselves in each of [the performers]"</p>
        
            <p>The haka tautoko - a haka of support was done by Taranaki whānau shouting the well-known Taranaki haka, 'Paki pakia' which made waves as the unofficial 'biggest' haka tautoko at this year's event so far.</p>
        
            <p>"It was bigger than that maunga - such a lofty feeling, they make us come together."</p>
