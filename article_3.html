            <p>Taiwan's remaining Pacific Island allies have pledged support in the wake of Nauru cutting ties on Monday days after a presidential election, a move that whittled Taiwan's diplomatic footprint in the region to three countries.</p>
        
            <p>Two of those allies, Marshall Islands and Palau, have long-standing defence and funding compacts with the United States, while a third, Tuvalu, entered a security and migration agreement with Australia in November.</p>
        
            <p>With Nauru's switch, Taiwan's allies in the region have halved from six to three since 2019, amid increased US-China rivalry for security ties and offers of infrastructure and funding.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining 15 countries in the Pacific Island Forum regional bloc have diplomatic ties with China.</p>
        
            <p>China claims Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taiwan strongly disputes. Worldwide, a dozen countries maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taipei.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Thursday, Marshall Islands said its ties with Taiwan were "rock solid", and in the region's best interest.</p>
        
            <p>"The Republic of the Marshall Islands values the strong relationship with Republic of China (Taiwan) as an indispensable partner in promotion of democratic principles," a statement on its official Facebook page said.</p>
        
            <p>"In parallel, we wholeheartedly respect the sovereignty of all countries and will continue to foster open and friendly dialogue with other nations for the sake of peace and stability for all," it added.</p>
        
            <p>Taiwan's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Chung-kwang will attend the inauguration of Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine on Monday next week as a special envoy of President Tsai Ing-wen.</p>
        
            <p>Taiwan also said that Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano had reaffirmed his country's ties with Taiwan in a message to its embassy in Funafuti.</p>
        
            <p>Tuvalu's government, in a caretaker period ahead of a national election on 26 January, congratulated Taiwan's new president-elect, Lai Ching-te on its Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>Palau wrote on Facebook it stands with Taiwan, which it called a "good friend", adding that nations were free to choose whom they can build diplomatic ties with "without coercion".</p>
        
            <p>Palau's President Surangel Whipps had written to Lai, saying his nation wanted to "further strengthen our already rock solid alliance at the soonest opportunity", Whipps office said.</p>
