            <p>Long-running repairs to leaking hospital buildings in south Auckland are now forecast to cost almost $100 million.</p>
        
            <p>The children's hospital and three other major patient blocks at Middlemore Hospital and Manukau SuperClinic were beset with leaks after substandard construction.</p>
        
            <p>Hospital managers found out about it in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ revealed in 2018 the south Auckland hospital had six buildings full of rot and mould.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017, health officials settled out of court with the builder for $3m. The same year the cost to reclad six buildings was estimated at $40m.</p>
        
            <p>That has now risen to $94.5m to reclad just four - the Scott and McIndoe buildings, KidzFirst and the Mesh building at Manukau. The Scott building is finished, the others are still ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Documents showed the decay was so bad it was in danger of breaching the walls and contaminating the air.</p>
        
            <p>It found significant fungus and bacteria inside the walls of four buildings.</p>
        
            <p>In the Kidz First hospital, 90 percent of the timber framing looked at was decaying, and the wood soaked at up to 98 percent moisture levels.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora said it had no other reclad projects planned at the hospitals.</p>
