            <p>New Zealand's six Super Rugby Pacific sides name their squads for next season today. The Hurricanes have already been named (see below), next up we have the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Rob Penney has made one big off season signing, with former Wallaby James O'Connor joining a Crusaders team desperate to get back to winning ways. They missed the playoffs last season after winning seven titles in a row, due in part to a shocking run of injuries and tough draw.</p>
        
            <p>Promising Wellington halfback Kyle Preston joins Mitch Drummond and Noah Hotham, with Rivez Reihana and Taha Kemara retained outside them. Penney's other rookies are the Waikato duo of flanker Xavier Saifoloi and NZ U20 fullback Aki Tuivailala.</p>

            <p>Aki Tuivailala, Antonio Shalfoon, Brayden Ennor, Chay Fihaki, Christian Lio-Willie, Codie Taylor, Corey Kellow, Cullen Grace, Dallas McLeod, David Havili, Dominic Gardiner, Ethan Blackadder, Finlay Brewis, Fletcher Anderson, Fletcher Newell, George Bell, George Bower, Ioane Moananu, James O'Connor, Jamie Hannah, Johnny McNicholl, Kershawl Sykes-Martin, Kyle Preston, Levi Aumua, Macca Springer, Mitchell Drummond, Noah Hotham, Quinten Strange, Rivez Riehana, Scott Barrett, Seb Calder, Sevu Reece, Taha Kemara, Tahlor Cahill, Tamaiti Williams, Tom Christie, Will Jordan, Xavier Saifoloi</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw has brought in nine new players for next season. While Brett Cameron has been named, he faces a lengthy rehab for an ACL injury, so first five Riley Hohepa returns to the Hurricanes after a season with the Crusaders. Two South Island locks also make the move north, Will Tucker from the Highlanders and Zach Gallagher from the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Ere Enari joins the Canes after spending three seasons at Moana Pasifika, while rookies Tjay Clarke, Kade Banks, Arese Poliko, Fehi Fineanganofo and Lucas Cashmore come in as well.</p>
        
            <p>Laidlaw will have to look for some leadership in new areas, their biggest losses are All Blacks Jordie Barrett and TJ Perenara. Barrett will be back after a season in Ireland, but his absence gives the highly rated Riley Higgins a free run to start in the midfield. Josh Moorby has also left, which means the door is wide open for Clarke and Banks to make a case to start in the back three.</p>
