            <p>Twenty-five years after deployment to East Timor, a group of New Zealand peacekeepers are returning to the country now known as Timor-Leste as part of a documentary.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen veterans travelled to Timor Leste on Friday accompanied by a documentary crew who are gathering material for an upcoming project.</p>
        
            <p>Trip organiser Aaron Horrell said the group included the former section commander of Private Leonard Manning, who died in an ambush by pro-Indonesia militia in 2000.</p>

            <p>He said that incident was New Zealand's first combat fatality since the Vietnam War, and brought home the risks the UN peacekeepers were facing.</p>
        
            <p>Horrell said the group included former members of the army, navy, airforce and a police officer, who were all deployed to Timor Leste between 1999 and 2002.</p>
        
            <p>The trip was funded by the funded by the Returned Services Association and Southland Community Trust.</p>
        
            <p>The people travelling to Timor Leste were people who had had significant stories which were covered internationally during their deployment, Horrell said.</p>
        
            <p>Former TV3 news presenter Mike McRoberts would narrate the documentary and travel with the group.</p>
        
            <p>The group would be in Timor Leste from 19 to 28 July.</p>
        
            <p>The group planned for the trip to end with McRoberts interviewing Timor Leste President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao.</p>
