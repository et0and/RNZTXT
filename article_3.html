            <p>Defending champs Penrith Panthers are sitting just two wins away from making rugby league history - winning four consecutive premierships, a feat that has never been achieved during the NRL era.</p>
        
            <p>But standing in their way is an extremely resilient Cronulla Sharks side who have been on a rollercoaster ride all season long. With questions floating around about the Cronulla's ability to hold it down with the big boys come finals time, Penrith are the clear favourites - but that won't upset the Sharks.</p>
