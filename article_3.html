            <p>Families are cutting back on essentials and withdrawing their KiwiSaver funds as they struggle with the rising cost of living, an Auckland budgeting service says.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data released today showed household costs went up 6.2 per cent in the last year.</p>
        
            <p>An Ōtahuhu Budgeting Services' spokesperson said the public-funded service helped locals manage financial hardship.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said cost of living pressures like food, rent and power bills meant local families had to make tough financial decisions.</p>
        
            <p>They said any increases in government benefits were often not enough to cover these costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Rent goes up a couple of dollars, power prices go up. The cost of food is phenomenal."</p>
        
            <p>More households were now relying on food donations, with four to five households a day using food parcel services, they said.</p>

            <p>Struggling households - whether in employment or otherwise - were also choosing to withdraw KiwiSaver funds to help make ends meet, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of them now are looking at cashing out their KiwiSaver based on financial hardship and some on medical need."</p>
        
            <p>KiwiSaver funds can be withdrawn in limited circumstances, including:</p>
        
            <p>Westpac senior economist Satish Ranchhod said cost increases over the past few years had been "stark", with rental prices at the highest in "decades".</p>
        
            <p>"Rents costs are up by 4.2 percent in the last year, which is one of the largest we've seen in decades," Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>"Housing costs are a big squeeze on a lot of family budgets, particularly with food and utilities."</p>
        
            <p>Ranchhod said inflation and rising costs could linger until the end of next year despite hope from Te Pūtea Matua The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ).</p>
        
            <p>"Inflation is going to linger over RBNZ's target band. It will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 per cent," he Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>This pressure has meant households are winding back spending.</p>
        
            <p>"High interest and living cost mean households are scaling back purchasing, opting for value over what is nice to have."</p>
