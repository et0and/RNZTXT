        <h2>'It will wipe out this village' - Fears about council's stopbank plan</h2>
        <p>
A Hawke's Bay village says a plan to build stopbanks along its river will destroy the town out in future floods. Audio

            <p>The Hawke's Bay village of Porangahau fears a plan to build stopbanks along its river will wipe out the town out in future floods and fail to protect their precious marae.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are urging the regional council to take heed of a recent damning report into its failings during the cyclone - which recommended better engagement with local communities.</p>
        
            <p>Porangahau is the only remaining area still awaiting council decisions on flood protections following Cyclone Gabrielle and some residents feel they have been forgotten about.</p>
        
            <p>About 35 homes, the marae, kaumatua housing and the urupa all flooded when the river burst its banks in February 2023.</p>

            <p>While the community rallied together and donations flooded in, local wahine Piri Galbraith said many people felt the authorities response was lacking.</p>
        
            <p>"On the bigger scale, government agencies.. we were absolutely forgotten about. Even now there are a few homes not finished," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The village is the only area in Hawke's Bay still in Category 2A, because the regional council is yet to decide what flood protection will be built, but the proposal is for stop banks.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of uncertainty and we don't want to read 20 page reports... come and tell us to our face. We're getting reports from people who have no idea where Porangahau is or what it is.</p>
        
            <p>"If there is a burst in the stop bank it will wipe out this village - which is a huge concern," she said.</p>

            <p>Tania Nicholas and husband Orlando MacDonald are still rebuilding their house, and the fresh paint fumes is a welcome smell after 17 long months of cleaning and construction.</p>
        
            <p>"Just the way the community has come together makes you feel so proud to be living here and to have the neighbours that you do," said Nicholas.</p>
        
            <p>Since the cyclone, the family of four has been living out of a basket, moving eight times between five houses and are now living in a cabin in the back yard.</p>

            <p>Down the road, Galbraith's father Doc Ferris is worried that the regional council's proposed stopbanks don't protect the marae and kaumatua flats.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll put it very bluntly, they're not interested in our marae or our kaumatua flats.</p>
        
            <p>"There are those that say well you can move the marae, and move the kaumatua flats - well wait on, that marae has been there for about 250 years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Doc and his brother in law Paul Scia Scia are among those backing an alternative proposal from local contractor Steve Galbraith - which they say would protect their marae.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a plan in there now we believe, as locals, is almost picture perfect", said Scia Scia.</p>

            <p>Regional council chief executive Nic Peet told RNZ it was deep into the detailed design work for stop banks - but it was a complex and technical situation because the village was on one side of the river, but the marae was on the opposite bank.</p>
        
            <p>"Protection to one side or the other is possible, protection to both sides actually makes the situation more dangerous," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council confirmed it had the local proposal, and was considering it.</p>
        
            <p>"We're open to looking at all options that get put forward and making sure they've been really well considered," said Peet.</p>
        
            <p>But Mayor Alex Walker was calling on the regional council to do more.</p>
        
            <p>"I can feel the unease on how all sorts of things will feed into the decision about stop banks. It's complex and inter-generational so we have to be really really focussed on having lots of conversations, and there are a lot more we could have - that's what I'm asking regional council to help with - more intentional local conversations and structures," she said,</p>

            <p>Something Doc Ferris and Paul Scia Scia were desperate to see.</p>
        
            <p>"They (HBRC) should come and sort things out with the locals. Sure, their science counts, but the locals know where the water goes to, where and why it goes to where it does. They've been watching it come at them for years," said Scia Scia.</p>
