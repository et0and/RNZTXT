            <p>Police are appealing for sightings of a 67-year-old woman after the unexplained death of a man in the Auckland suburb of Ellerslie overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the property on Celtic Crescent around 8pm yesterday, following a report of a man found unresponsive.</p>
        
            <p>The 66-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Today, a forensics tent has been pitched in the middle of the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>A number of staff, including some in hazmat suits, could be seen entering the house.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Scott Beard said police were now wanting to hear from anyone who had seen or been in contact with Mei Han Chong, 67.</p>
        
            <p>"Mei is described as of Asian descent, small in stature and has short dark grey hair and will likely be wearing glasses."</p>
        
            <p>Beard said at this stage, the death of the man was being treated as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus is on establishing the circumstances surrounding the death and supporting the victim's family at this difficult time.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene examination is underway at the address and is expected to take a couple of days.</p>
        
            <p>"Additionally, a scene guard is currently in place and the public can expect to see an increased police presence in the area while our enquiries continue."</p>
