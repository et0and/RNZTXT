            <p>British comedian John Oliver has used his first show since the pūteketeke's landslide Bird of the Century victory to gloat over the result.</p>
        
            <p>Oliver's input into the competiton ruffled a few feathers, but saw donations to organiser Forest and Bird soar.</p>
        
            <p>Boosted by the publicity, the conservation organisation received $600,000 in donations associated with its Bird of the Year competition - six times higher than its previous record set last year.</p>
        
            <p>Forest and Bird chief executive Nicola Toki said the level of generosity from donors around the world was overwhelming.</p>
        
            <p>It came at a crucial time for the charity when there were more threats than ever facing the country's wildlife, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing on his American TV show Last Week Tonight on Sunday (US time), Oliver was estatic over the result.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't just win this by a litttle, we won it by a lot....for context the pūtekeke got over three times as many votes by itself as all the other top 10 birds got combined.</p>
        
            <p>"When you talk about historic all time levels of dominance the conversation now begins and ends with Michael Jordan, Lionel Messi, Serena Williams and the pūteketeke."</p>
        
            <p>Everything about the way New Zealand handled the contest was perfect, Oliver said.</p>
        
            <p>He referred to a speech by a representative of the Breakers basketball team conceding on behalf of the kea.</p>
        
            <p>But the real winner, Oliver said, was the pūteketeke itself.</p>
        
            <p>"Pūt, my old friend, none of this would have been possible without your Sid Vicious-esque hairstyle, your feather bone puking, or just how weird you are at sex. You are a deeply weird bird and I think at the end of the day that's what people responded to. That, and just how fun it is to say your name."</p>
        
            <p>"So, let me say this loud and proud once more. Pūteketeke today, pūteketeke tomorrow, pūteketeke for the next hundred years - we did it."</p>
        
            <p>Toki said no-one could have predicted this overwhelming level of generosity from donors in New Zealand and around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"When we accepted the request from John Oliver's team to campaign on behalf of one of our 'underbirds', we just thought it was a brilliant opportunity to have some fun.</p>
        
            <p>"The enthusiasm and budget that he brought to the campaign were mind blowing - and unexpected."</p>
