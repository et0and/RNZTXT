            <p>A 70-year-old woman has died after being stabbed in the chest in front of her granddaughter during a violent robbery at a busy shopping centre west of Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the car park of the Redbank Plains Shopping Village around 6.30pm on Saturday evening in response to reports of a serious assault.</p>
        
            <p>They were confronted with a horrific scene when they arrived to treat the woman, who a witness said was lying in a pool of blood.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Acting Superintendent Heath McQueen said the woman had been grocery shopping and was near her car when the random attack took place.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an abhorrent, cowardly violent attack on a 70-year-old grandmother in front of her six-year-old granddaughter," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said police were reviewing CCTV vision of the incident and interviewing witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>The scene was extremely confronting for members of the public nearby, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"It's extremely confronting to watch, it's extremely confronting for first-responding officers and bystanders who intervened," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many seasoned police, including myself, who reviewed the footage are taken aback by the level of violence."</p>
        
            <p>Redbank Plains local Ademola Afolabi had just arrived at the shopping centre to buy sausages when he heard a young girl cry out for help for her grandmother.</p>
        
            <p>"I followed [the young girl]... I saw a lady in a pool of blood," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Afolabi, who is a medical doctor, said he tried to administer first aid before calling triple zero, but the woman was unresponsive.</p>
        
            <p>"It was too late before I got there," he said. "She was in a pool of blood. Mostly on the left side. Her pants were soaked with blood. Probably bleeding from the chest area. But I didn't move anything. The only contact I had with her was the CPR."</p>
        
            <p>He said the young girl was uninjured but that the incident would "leave a scar on her".</p>
        
            <p>"Just the little girl. Nobody should witness that. I've seen a fair bit of dead people but this is, the whole circumstance around it is just shocking," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Investigations are ongoing, but police said one witness described a male offender of African appearance leaving the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police are urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Now is the time to step up and come forward and provide us with information about who the offender is," Detective Acting Superintendent McQueen said.</p>
