            <p>ACT party leader David Seymour says his party does not regard Te Tiriti o Waitangi as a partnership between Māori and the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>More than 10,000 people gathered at Tūrangawaewae Marae on Saturday, issuing a united call against proposed reforms.</p>
        
            <p>David Seymour told Midday Report he believed Te Tiriti o Waitangi was a founding document, but the idea that it is a partnership is based on a misinterpretation.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a document that founds New Zealand as a country, where in Article 1 the government has the right to govern, in Article 2 we each have the right to tino rangatiratanga - the right to flourish in self-chosen ways - and in Article 3 we all have nga tikanga katoa rite tahi, or the same."</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer and environmentalist Dayle Takitimu of Te Whānau Ā Apanui provided in-depth context for attendees at the national hui aa iwi before they attended a series of workshops focused on priority areas for Māori. Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the proposed reforms was one of those forums.</p>
        
            <p>In her speech, Takitimu accused the government of racism and being "treaty illiterate".</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he disagreed with the comments, and planned to continue his advancement of reforms for "benefit of all New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>He said he looked forward to participating in further debate when he attended Waitangi celebrations next month.</p>
