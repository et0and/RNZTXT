            <p>A delicate heritage building that provides a glimpse of how life was once in the Pohutukawa Coast area will undergo a facelift soon.</p>
        
            <p>McNicol Homestead, in south Auckland's Clevedon, will have repairs from August for three months.</p>
        
            <p>Set in attractive grounds in a rural area, the homestead was once home to one of the original settlers to the district.</p>
        
            <p>The Franklin Local Board said the homestead was built in 1878, about a century-and-a-half ago, and was currently used as a house museum.</p>
        
            <p>The Clevedon and Districts Historical Society, who have leased the place since 1980, also use it as a place for local activities such as painting and craft.</p>
        
            <p>"Renewal work is needed to meet the building code and seismic and asbestos requirements," the board said.</p>
        
            <p>"All going well the place should be looking good in late November."</p>
        
            <p>The McNicol Homestead, a two-storey house, overlooked the Wairoa River and the Clevedon Valley.</p>
        
            <p>According to Auckland Council's heritage team, McNicol Homestead was one of 141 scheduled historic heritage places in the Franklin District.</p>
        
            <p>This includes places that were scheduled based on their archaeological values. Of these, 78 are buildings.</p>
        
            <p>McNicol Homestead was one of a few historical buildings in south Auckland being renewed, including the Nathan Homestead in Manurewa.</p>
        
            <p>Nathan Homestead closed for more than a year in July for seismic strengthening.</p>
        
            <p>The homestead was used for arts and community events, including pottery, exhibitions, visual arts classes, jewellery making, and a cafe.</p>
