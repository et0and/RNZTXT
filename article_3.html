            <p>Thousands of protesters are expected to 'activate' today for the second National Action Day aimed at government policies and rhetoric toward Māori.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time Māori have mobilised on a national scale with the first hikoi taking place last December.</p>
        
            <p>Hīkoi, or 'carkoi', are expected to disrupt traffic and city centres with protests planned from Kaitaia down to Dunedin, each with their own coordinator.</p>
        
            <p>The national protest coincides with today's budget announcements.</p>
