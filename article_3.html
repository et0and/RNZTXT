            <p>A skier has been dug out from under a metre of snow after being caught in an avalanche near Treble Cone.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who was with a well-prepared group of five, including three avalance professionals, was dug out from beneath a metre of snow, the Mountain Safety Council said.</p>
        
            <p>Incredibly, the man was not injured and did not lose consciousness. He was able to create an air pocket around his face as the avalanche slowed.</p>
        
            <p>The event on Monday was the second human-triggered avalanche in the area, with a previous one on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Avalanche Advisory said: "Thanks to a high-level of training and knowledge of their rescue equipment, the party were able to reach and clear the victims airway within seven minutes.</p>
        
            <p>One of the party was able to notify rescuers immediately using an Inreach device and they were all transported safely back to Treble Cone by helicopter."</p>
        
            <p>A member of the group recorded on the Avalanche Advisory report, "We realise we made mistakes, and it's a valuable lesson in recognising that there's times where everyone can let their guard down and get caught out, no matter your skill level or experience."</p>
        
            <p>The Mountain Safety Council's chief executive, Mike Daisley, told Morning Report the group was encouraged out with a brief window of good weather during "a bunch of storms that are thrashing the South Island".</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily this group in particular are well prepared. They had the correct equipment and knew how to use it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were able to use transceivers and probes to sift through the snow and be able to isolate where the individual had last been seen and start from there. And move pretty quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're buried that deep you can't get out yourself."</p>
        
            <p>The Mountain Safety Council is warning people to not rush into alpine environments if they're not prepared properly.</p>
        
            <p>Daisley said that people shouldn't be exploring the back country when the weather is not conducive to being there.</p>
        
            <p>"Increasingly we are, and this is not related to this particular incident, but we are seeing people looking to explore some of these environments with less knowledge and less experience," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Daisley added the avalanche risk in the area is high at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"The avalanche risk has stepped up from considerable to high. So that's what we're expecting to see for the next couple of weeks."</p>
        
            <p>"Some brief weather windows encouraging people out mixed in with a constant storm cycle for the next two or three weeks."</p>
        
            <p>He recommended sticking to ski fields, where the avalanche risk is actively managed.</p>
