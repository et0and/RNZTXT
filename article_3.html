            <p>The Warriors have bought a bar - and they want your name suggestions.</p>
        
            <p>A public callout on the NRL team's Instagram page has received hundreds of suggestions since it went live on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Creative names like 'It's Our Beer', 'Wah Bar' and 'Up The Bars' are currently leading the scoreboard, with 'The Backfence', 'Wahs Ki Runga' and 'Church' - for those who kept the faith - trailing closely behind.</p>
        
            <p>Other notable suggestions include 'Ma Te Wah', 'The Gym' ("so we can tell our Mrs we are going to The Gym") and 'Pinot Wahs'.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors' sidestep into hospitality was announced back in March.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors CEO Cameron George told RNZ the move is aimed at expanding business opportunities and revenues streams, and furthering fan engagement.</p>
        
            <p>"We're huge on our fans contributing to our footy club and our future, and this is just another way to have them involved in what we're doing and how we're doing it."</p>
        
            <p>"Excited to see what names coming in, in the next three of four days."</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors-themed sports bar will be located in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland.</p>
