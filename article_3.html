            <p>Labour MP Duncan Webb has apologised after tweeting a jibe about ACT leader David Seymour, asking if he does not like hummus because it is too close to Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour had earlier criticised the Middle Eastern dip as part of his campaign against so-called woke food - when rolling out the new school lunch programme.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, Webb said his tweet was an error of judgement and he promptly deleted it.</p>

            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said he told Webb indirectly the tweet was inappropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand it was deleted within a matter of minutes. I think he probably reflected on it, realised that he'd made a mistake. It is a mistake, he shouldn't have done it," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bad judgement and I think he realises it's a bad judgement."</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not understand the point of the tweet.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everybody now and then needs to take a deep breath and think a little bit more before they engage in tweeting or sometimes speaking."</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis said the tweet was "offensive".</p>
        
            <p>"It is not a laughing matter. There are people dying in an extreme conflict which is, I think, very upsetting to all of us who watch it and I don't think it's a subject for Parliamentary humour."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said Webb's deletion of the tweet was the right thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a big believer that when people make mistakes and correct them, we should give them credit for that. So good on him".</p>
