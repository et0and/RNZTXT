        <h2>Microsoft bans US police using AI for facial recognition on cloud service</h2>
        <p>
It comes shortly after taser maker Axon, that NZ Police use, launched a new tool using AI to transcribe audio from bodycams.

            <p>Microsoft has banned US police departments from using generative artificial intelligence (AI) for facial recognition on a key cloud computing service.</p>
        
            <p>This comes shortly after big taser maker Axon launched a new tool using AI to transcribe audio from police bodycams.</p>
        
            <p>Media reports in the US say the new ban covering Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service does not apply to police in other countries.</p>
        
            <p>But it does ban police globally from using the AI on mobile cameras, including bodycams or dashcams, to identify someone in public in realtime.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Police are still debating the use of bodyworn cameras (BWC) and have begun rolling out $30 million of new tasers without any cameras.</p>
        
            <p>Axon leverages its taser sales to also supply both bodyworn cams and the data handling systems to store the footage from them.</p>
        
            <p>The police annual review shows its tactical operations manager at headquarters went to Australia a year ago for an Axon "public safety tech" conference, to "better understand their Taser/BWC programmes".</p>
        
            <p>An Axon news release said its new product, Draft One, saved an hour's paperwork per day per US officer, with "a revolutionary new software product that drafts high-quality police report narratives in seconds based on auto-transcribed body-worn camera audio" using generative AI.</p>
        
            <p>It would lift a big "burdensome" load of daily report-writing off understaffed forces, the multi-billion-dollar company said.</p>
        
            <p>Its research showed the technology was not biased, Axon said.</p>
        
            <p>Microsoft put the OpenAI service into its leading cloud products for the government three months ago.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand public agencies regularly use Microsoft's cloud services.</p>
