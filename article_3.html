            <p>A cordon is in place around a property in Sydenham as police work to ensure a person's safety.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby residents have told RNZ there had been a bomb threat.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called to an address on Percival Street about 10.40am to reports a person was making threats.</p>
        
            <p>As a precaution, police evacuated people from adjacent properties and a cordon of approximately 100m is in place around the Percival Street address.</p>
        
            <p>People are asked to stay clear until the situation can be safely resolved.</p>

            <p>Tennyson Street resident Leon said police told him there had been a bomb threat, and he was asked to move to Colombo Street.</p>
        
            <p>Some Colombo Street businesses near the scene have also been evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>A shop owner who did not wish to be named told RNZ there had been rumours of a potential bomb around the area.</p>
        
            <p>"We were told to evacuate the building as quickly as possible and go at least 100 metres away and that was all the information we'd heard," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuated cafe worker Aidan Mytton said the situation was scary.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never had to experience anything like this before. It's a little frightening I guess but everyone's evacuated so that make me feel a bit safer."</p>
        
            <p>Another business owner, who did not wish to be named, told RNZ she could see at least a dozen police officers and a police dog.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite a lot of us just standing round on Colombo Street evacuated, it's been going on for over an hour now," she said.</p>
