            <p>Wānaka snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has pulled out of the Snowboard Big Air finals in Switzerland after taking a tumble in practice.</p>
        
            <p>Less than an hour before the start of the final, Sadowski-Synnott fell during a practice run - and she was not the only one.</p>
        
            <p>Germany's Annika Morgan was also a DNS (Did Not Start), and the eight-women final suddenly became a six-women final, opening the door to other contenders.</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend Sadowski-Synnott was crowned the 2025 FIS Snowboard Slopestyle World Champion in Switzerland for a third time, after taking gold in the final.</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old was the top qualifier for this morning's Big Air final and was in a prime position to achieve double-gold at this year's world championships.</p>
        
            <p>Sadowski-Synnott missed most of 2024 with an injury, but the Olympic and world champion has been in sublime form on her return.</p>
        
            <p>Japan took a clean sweep on the podium with Kokomo Murase winning gold, and Reira Iwabuchi, and Mari Fukada, second and third respectively.</p>
