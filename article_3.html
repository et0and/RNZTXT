            <p>Robert Downey Jr is returning to Marvel movies - but not as Iron Man.</p>
        
            <p>A panel at the San Diego Comic Con today announced that Oscar winner Downey will be returning to play an entirely different character, the iconic comic book villain Dr. Doom, in two new Avengers movies, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.</p>
        
            <p>Downey was unveiled as Dr. Doom, a foe who first appeared in Fantastic Four comics in the 1960s, to a rapturous crowd at the comic convention.</p>
        
            <p>"New mask, same task," Downey said. "What can I tell you? I like playing complicated characters."</p>
        
            <p>In the comics, he's the evil ruler of the European nation Latveria and has battled the Avengers and Fantastic Four many times. He's also one of the few major characters yet to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although he was portrayed in poorly received previous Fantastic Four movies.</p>
        
            <p>The live reveal of Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom at the Marvel Studios Hall H panel during San Diego Comic-Con 2024 was insane! #SDCCpic.twitter.com/0wsjk6Qt1J</p>
        
            <p>Downey played Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, in multiple Avengers and Iron Man movies before being killed off in 2019's record-breaking Avengers: Endgame.</p>
        
            <p>This time, he's back as a character famous for wearing a metal mask covering his scarred face.</p>
        
            <p>Downey won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for last year's Oppenheimer.</p>
        
            <p>Joe and Anthony Russo, who directed Endgame, will also return to direct the two new Avengers movies.</p>
        
            <p>Originally they were set to feature actor Jonathan Majors as the villainous Kang but his career has been derailed by arrests for domestic assault and harassment.</p>
        
            <p>The upcoming Avengers movies are scheduled for 2026 and 2027, and will also star Harrison Ford, set to appear in 2025's Captain America: Brave New World, and cast members from upcoming movies Fantastic Four and Thunderbolts.</p>
