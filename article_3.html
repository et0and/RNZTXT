        <h2>Government pumps a further $3m into Wairoa flood recovery</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon has been in flood-stricken Wairoa as the government announces a further $3 million for the region's flood recovery.
</p>
        
            <p>The government is pumping a further $3 million into Wairoa for its flood recovery.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement comes as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has visited Wairoa on Saturday to inspect the damage.</p>
        
            <p>The region was devastated by rising waters last week, including areas that had never been flooded before.</p>
        
            <p>"The Wairoa District Council has identified what it needs, and this additional funding is immediately available for the work," Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>The funding was set to go towards the clean-up of household waste and sediment for more than 400 properties impacted by last week's weather event.</p>
        
            <p>This included the collection, removal, and disposal of sediment, debris and household waste.</p>

            <p>The government has already released $600,000 worth of funding for Wairoa.</p>
        
            <p>"In total, this means $3.6 million of government funding is available to assist Wairoa communities with the recovery and rebuilding process," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority is to ensure that communities can return to normalcy as quickly as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to standing by the people of Wairoa and all affected regions during these challenging times."</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa mayor Craig Little said the extra boost from the government was "huge" and would give people some peace of mind.</p>

            <p>He said the situation was still bad.</p>
        
            <p>"We're quite under the pump ... but to have the backing of the government is huge.</p>
        
            <p>"The priority is always going to be the people and their homes, trying to get them sorted and get their rubbish away.</p>
        
            <p>"You can imagine, you've lost your livelihood, all your possessions, everything."</p>
        
            <p>Little has previously estimated there was about $40 million worth of damage.</p>
