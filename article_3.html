            <p>Vandals have smashed windows at Christchurch synagogue Beth-El, leaving Jewish community members scared for their safety.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating the attack at the Durham Street North property last week, following earlier property damage at the synagogue last month.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Jewish Council spokesperson Ben Kepes said he was concerned the vandalism could escalate.</p>

            <p>"They started off being verbal on social media, but now have strayed into the realms of vandalism property damage," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our concern really as a community is there's been lots and lots of threats straying into physical attacks, and we're concerned that will actually happen."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they received a report of vandalism at a Durham Road North property last week.</p>
        
            <p>"Our enquiries revealed no further lines of enquiry to identify those involved and the matter has been filed," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are providing reassurance and prevention advice to the community. We will follow up on any further lines of enquiry that may come to light."</p>
        
            <p>Kepes said anti-Semitic slogans had been sprayed on buildings around the country since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, and urged authorities to take the threats against the Jewish community seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like there is a little bit of an imbalance in terms of response. They are not quite so active when it comes to this particular marginalised group," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kepes said politicians should tone down the language they used around the conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"It's no surprise that translates into action from people, and that action is addressed against us," he said.</p>
