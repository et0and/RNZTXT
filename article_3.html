            <p>A refugee lost almost everything in her Auckland home when a neighbour broke in, burgled it and sold what little she owned.</p>
        
            <p>It was the woman's first home in this country, but she was away overseas when Neil Thomas Gascoigne broke in.</p>
        
            <p>Her late father's watch, a treasured memento of him and one of the few possessions she owned, was among the items stolen by the 43-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>According to a recently released decision from High Court Justice Timothy Brewer, the woman moved away after being burgled.</p>
        
            <p>"Gascoigne broke a window to gain entry and then removed and sold virtually all the unit's contents," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reparation sum is $11,520. Gascoigne has no means of paying it."</p>
        
            <p>The judgment did not say which country the woman had come from as a refugee or how long she had been in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Gascoigne also burgled a second neighbour when that person was away, taking items worth $2927.</p>
        
            <p>He broke a window in each burglary to gain access and his fingerprints were found in both homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Burglaries can have a profound effect on victims," Justice Brewer said, noting Gascogine knew both of the people he stole from.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case, both victims felt unable to remain in their homes and moved away."</p>
        
            <p>Gascogine was sentenced to two years and one month in prison when he appeared in the District Court in July.</p>
        
            <p>That sentence was just above the two-year threshold at which offenders are eligible to be considered for home detention.</p>
        
            <p>It also means Gascoigne's release date will be determined by the Parole Board, rather than come automatically when he has served half his time.</p>
        
            <p>Gascoigne appealed his sentence to the High Court at Auckland as being "manifestly excessive", but Justice Brewer turned down that appeal, noting he had 11 previous convictions for burglary.</p>
        
            <p>"He is 43 years old with an extensive criminal record. He has served a number of terms of imprisonment. He shows no remorse or signs of reform," Justice Brewer said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the safety of the community, it is better to leave his release in the hands of the Parole Board."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Brewer said Gascoigne's sentence was at the "lower end" of the range available to the District Court judge.</p>
        
            <p>"These were serious burglaries of residential units and the effects on victims were profound."</p>
