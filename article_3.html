            <p>Keep New Zealand Beautiful chief executive Heather Saunderson said out of all the towns and cities she visited, Taupō ranked among the best for the many climate conscious initiatives it undertook.</p>
        
            <p>The North Island town excelled across every other criteria, making it the clear winner of the Supreme Award, Saunderson said.</p>
        
            <p>As a prize, Taupō will receive a mural painted by a local artist worth up to $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Sandra Greenslade, who was among those representing Taupō district at the awards, said the Taupō group could hardly believe their ears when they won.</p>
        
            <p>"We were surprised and then we were over the moon," Greenslade said.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō District Mayor David Trewavas said he was absolutely stoked and it was amazing news for the community.</p>

            <p>Tauranga won the award for the most beautiful large city, while Whakatāne was named the most beautiful small city.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth and Arrowtown won awards as the most beautiful small cities and Awanui won most beautiful tiny town.</p>
        
            <p>A range of community, individual and best place awards were also given out on the the night.</p>
        
            <p>Saunderson said the awards were an opportunity for communities to rally together and shine a light on climate, conservation and environmental education projects over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"Public nominations were one of the criteria for the selection of our awards recipients and finalists, so it was fantastic to see the overwhelming passion Kiwis have for the towns and cities they live in, the places they enjoy and the unsung environmental heroes who unite the community together."</p>
