            <p>An Auckland dad is in shock after his child had to run from a naked man doing a lewd act on himself on her way home from school.</p>
        
            <p>Police were investigating the incident on Gladwin Road in Epsom which they said happened at about 3:35pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The dad, who wished to remain anonymous for his family's privacy, said his 14-year-old daughter saw the perpetrator after getting off the bus close to home.</p>
        
            <p>"She passed a van and noticed a young-ish guy with shoulder-length hair with no clothes inside on performing a lewd act on himself."</p>
        
            <p>As the van began to move in her direction, he said his daughter ran home.</p>
        
            <p>He said she had taken time off school after the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"We are just in shock," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everything is just sinking in."</p>
        
            <p>He said his daughter's school had offered counselling, which he was appreciative of.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was more wary about letting his children be alone in the area after what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't expect this to happen in your area let alone to your children.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll definitely be thinking more carefully about letting the kids walk and bike around the area now."</p>
        
            <p>He said police told him they would be checking CCTV footage in the area and he hoped the man would be reprimanded soon.</p>
        
            <p>Area Investigations Manager for Auckland City East Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Greaves said police had obtained a photo of the light-coloured van in the Gladwin Road area.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like anyone who saw this vehicle, or has further information concerning it to contact us."</p>
        
            <p>"I'd also encourage the driver of this vehicle, who knows who they are, to stop delaying the inevitable and come to speak with Police."</p>
