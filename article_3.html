            <p>A group of young people occupying the rooftop of their youth justice facility say they are protesting because they weren't let outside.</p>
        
            <p>Shouting to media from the roof at Korowai Manaaki in Wiri, south Auckland, the group also claimed they hadn't been fed.</p>
        
            <p>Police officers could be seen on the ground, walking the perimeter.</p>

            <p>Oranga Tamariki Acting deputy chief executive youth justice services and residential care Iain Chapman said a group of 13 youths accessed the roof at around 6:40pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>While nine had since been coaxed down overnight and Tuesday morning, four remained on the roof.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to work with police to resolve this matter," Chapman said. "We can confirm there are no concerns for public safety."</p>

            <p>Despite initial reports suggesting the youths were demanding Big Mac combos from McDonald's, cigarettes and a getaway car, Chapman said the group "have made no requests or demands to our staff on site".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter at Korowai Manaaki said people could be seen on the roof, where a small piece of roofing appeared to have been pulled up and damaged.</p>
        
            <p>Two appeared to have climbed through a hole made in one of the buildings, then re-emerged back onto the roof.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were supporting Oranga Tamariki.</p>

            <p>Speaking to Newstalk ZB, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said authorities will not cave to the youths' demands.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not coming down for KFC," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"These are some of the most serious and hardcore young offenders."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time young people have climbed on to the roof of Korowai Manaaki, a similar incident in July 2023 was blamed on staff shortages.</p>

            <p>A damning report in July found staff at the facility were smuggling in contraband, roughing up children, and silencing any informants.</p>
