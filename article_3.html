            <p>A North Canterbury community is vowing to fight a proposed solar farm near their homes.</p>
        
            <p>Australian company Energy Bay Ltd has applied to the Waimakariri District Council for a resource consent to build and operate a solar farm on an 80ha site on Upper Sefton Road, north of Rangiora.</p>
        
            <p>David Fordyce, a spokesperson for the residents, said neighbours planned a street meeting after hearing the council had notified the consent last week.</p>
        
            <p>He said residents had received advice indicating it was unusual to build solar farms close to houses.</p>
        
            <p>''There's still plenty of concerns out there, especially for the people living next door.</p>
        
            <p>''We've got thousands of acres of poor quality land in North Canterbury which would be suitable if someone wants to put one up, so why build it here?''</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Dan Gordon has met with the residents and offered for council staff to meet with residents to discuss the consent process.</p>
        
            <p>Residents previously raised concerns with the council at a public meeting in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>''I think there will be a lot of people making submissions, but I have been reminding them that feelings don't mean as much as facts, so we will be focusing on gathering evidence,'' Fordyce said.</p>
        
            <p>Submissions close on 28 February.</p>
        
            <p>Energy Bay Ltd has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed Sefton solar farm is one of at least four being proposed for North Canterbury in the future.</p>
        
            <p>A hearing for a proposed solar farm at Tram Road, Swannanoa, south of Rangiora, was held last week after four submissions were received.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland-based Lightyears Solar Ltd applied for a resource consent to build and operate a solar farm with 9077 solar panels on an 8ha site.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurunui District Council received a resource consent application in March last year from Far North Solar Farm Ltd for a 180.8ha solar farm near Waipara.</p>
        
            <p>The council's planning team leader Nicola Kirby said the application is on hold while staff review the application and a peer review of the information ''in relation to landscape and visual effects is undertaken''.</p>
        
            <p>Local residents have called on the council to publicly notify the consent.</p>
        
            <p>The Waimakariri District Council granted a resource consent last year for MainPower, North Canterbury's energy network, to build a solar farm on a 10ha site at Thongcaster Road at Eyrewell Forest, to the north of Waimakariri River.</p>
