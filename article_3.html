            <p>Smoke from raging bushfires in Australia has made its way to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Climate scientists at NIWA (the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research) confirmed on Thursday the smog lingering over New South Wales had made it across the Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>Air quality in Sydney plummeted on Tuesday to levels among the world's worst as smoke from bushfires in the north blanketed the harbour city, taking large swathes into index ranges on par with New Delhi, one of the world's most crowded capitals.</p>
        
            <p>The air quality index hit 161 in areas just north of the city's downtown after 5pm, reaching a level at which people are advised to avoid prolonged outdoor exercise.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post on Tuesday NIWA said the bushfires were sending plumes of smoke across the Tasman Sea and New Zealanders should not be surprised to see some hazy skies or unusually colourful sunsets this week.</p>
        
            <p>Aussie bushfires are sending huge plumes of smoke across the Tasman Sea. Don't be surprised if you see some hazy skies or unusually colourful sunsets over the next week One fire is over 100,000 hectares and currently burning out of control in northern New South Wales. pic.twitter.com/mlzOs2FwpW</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday it indicated smoke from the bushfires had reached Christchurch.</p>

Model data  (bottom right) shows that this plume (yellow-orange ) originates from Australia pic.twitter.com/KiOhqwa9Q0</p>
        
            <p>Photos showed a haze over Christchurch while satellite footage revealed the extent of the smoke cloud.</p>
        
            <p>In Australia, the Rural Fire Service said the smoke had drifted hundreds of kilometres south from fires burning across roughly 136,000 hectares, an area almost the size of Greater London.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities have warned of a high-risk bush fire season in Australia this summer after two quiet seasons, compared with the 2019-2020 "Black Summer" fires that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.</p>
