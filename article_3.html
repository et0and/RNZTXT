            <p>The Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown says New Zealand is asking for too much oversight over its deal with China, which is expected to be penned in Beijing next week.</p>
        
            <p>Brown told RNZ Pacific the Cook Islands-New Zealand relationship was reciprocal.</p>
        
            <p>"They certainly did not consult with us when they signed their comprehensive partnership agreement [with China] and we would not expect them to consult with us," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no need for New Zealand to sit in the room with us while we are going through our comprehensive agreement with China.</p>
        
            <p>"We have advised them on the matter, but as far as being consulted and to the level of detail that they were requiring, I think that's not a requirement."</p>
        
            <p>Brown is going to China from 10 to 14 February to sign the "Joint Action Plan for a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership".</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands operates in free association with New Zealand. It means the island nation conducts its own affairs, but Aotearoa needs to assist when it comes to foreign affairs, disasters, and defence.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is asking for more consultation over what is in the China deal.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters said neither New Zealand nor the Cook Island people knew what was in the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is we've been not told(sic) what the nature of the arrangements that they seek in Beijing might be," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, China and Solomon Islands signed a deal on police cooperation as part of an upgrade of their relations to a "comprehensive strategic partnership".</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he had assured New Zealand "over and over" that there would be no impact on the countries relationship and "no surprises" especially on security aspects.</p>
        
            <p>"But the contents of this agreement is something that our team are working on with our Chinese counterparts, and it is something that we will announce and provide once it is signed off."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was similar to an agreement New Zealand signed with China in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the agreement was looking for areas of cooperation, with deep sea mining research being one area.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the immediate area that the Cook Islands wanted help with was a new inter-island vessel to replace the existing ageing ship.</p>
        
            <p>Brown has backed down from his controversial passport proposal after facing pressure from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He said the country "would essentially punish any Cook Islander that would seek a Cook Islands passport" by passing new legislation that would not allow them to also hold a New Zealand passport.</p>
        
            <p>"To me that is a something that we cannot engage in for the security of our Cook Islands people.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether that is seen as overstepping or not, that is a position that New Zealand has taken."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Peters said the two nations did "not see eye to eye" on a number of issues.</p>
        
            <p>However, Brown said he always felt the relationship was very good.</p>
        
            <p>"We can agree to disagree in certain areas and as mature nation states do, they do have points of disagreement, but it doesn't mean that the relationship has in any way broken down."</p>
        
            <p>On Christmas Day, a Cook Islands-flagged vessel carrying Russian oil was seized by Finnish authorities. It is suspected to be part of Russia's shadow fleet and cutting underwater power cables in the Baltic Sea near Finland.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' spokesperson said the Cook Islands shipping registry was an area of disagreement between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the government was working with Maritime Cook Islands and were committed with aligning with international sanctions against Russia.</p>
        
            <p>When asked how he could be aligned with sanctions when the Cook Islands flagged the tanker Eagle S, Brown said it was still under investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"We will wait for the outcomes of that investigation, and if it means the amendments and changes, which I expect it will, to how the ship's registry operates then we will certainly look to make those amendments and those changes."</p>
