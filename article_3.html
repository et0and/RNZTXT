        <h2>El Niño is on the way out</h2>
        <p>
El Niño, which has delivered a lack of rain in the east and cooler weather lately, is on the way out, NIWA says. Audio

            <p>The El Niño weather event which has been dominating the country's weather for the past year has been declared as officially over - with a La Niña weather pattern set to prevail.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasters say there are some changes going on in the Pacific Ocean which are likely to gradually start to affect the weather coming into winter and then into spring.</p>
        
            <p>It should mean a tailing-off for El Niño's frequent, strong westerly winds and long periods of dry weather along the east coast.</p>
        
            <p>National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) forecaster Ben Noll said El Niño was waning in the tropical South Pacific Ocean.</p>

            <p>It has also meant cooler weather than usual over the last two months and it might persist into May as "a lag effect".</p>
        
            <p>"So cooler and for some regions drier and there's many regions around the country that could use more rain after what has been a pretty dry start to 2024."</p>
        
            <p>Noll said the ocean water below the surface near the Equator (thousands of kilometres from New Zealand) was cooling off rapidly.</p>
        
            <p>He compared the impact to the ripples in a pond that would take some time to reach this part of the world as the move from one weather system to another was completed.</p>
        
            <p>This meant that it was unlikely the country would experience a repeat of the massive weather events that occurred last year, such as the Auckland floods and Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>"For the short-term probably more of the same [weather] but if La Niña does develop later this year - that's when we will pay more attention to the tropics to the north, weather patterns that can be a little more supercharged as the oceans warm up in the western Pacific."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was in a transition period, he said, and recalled that the last time the country experienced La Niña there were "a handful" of weather events.</p>
        
            <p>However, last time there were three in succession and over that time a lot of heat built up culminating in the release of it through storm systems in the third year.</p>
        
            <p>So it was difficult to forecast what the summer of 2023-2024 might deliver.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still a lot of time to watch and wait and see what that next La Niña might bring."</p>
        
            <p>La Niña is part of a climate phenomenon called the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system.</p>
        
            <p>It has two opposite states - El Niño and La Niña - both of which significantly alter weather patterns across the globe.</p>
        
            <p>For the last few years, the world has been in successive La Niña periods, which have lowered temperatures and brought heavy rains to Canada and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Winds blowing along the Equator above the Pacific Ocean - from South America in the east towards Asia in the west - were stronger than normal.</p>
        
            <p>These "trade winds" piled warm water off the coast of Asia, raising the sea surface level. In the east, near the Americas, cold water flowed upwards to the surface.</p>
        
            <p>During El Niño the opposite happens - weaker trade winds mean the warm water spreads out back towards the Americas, and less cold water rises towards the surface.</p>
        
            <p>The phenomenon was first observed by Peruvian fisherman back in the 1600s.</p>
        
            <p>They noticed that warm waters seemed to peak near the Americas in December, and nicknamed the event "El Niño de Navidad", Christ Child in Spanish.</p>
