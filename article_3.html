            <p>A Talley's staff member has died at the company's wharf at Port Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>Talley's Ltd chief executive Tony Hazlett said a staff member was fatally injured at its Nelson wharf on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the person was located in a critical condition after a workplace incident shortly before 1pm and CPR was commenced, but they were unable to be revived.</p>
        
            <p>St John was notified at 12.35pm and sent an ambulance and three rapid response vehicles to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still working to notify the next of kin.</p>
        
            <p>Enquiries into the circumstances of the incident were ongoing and the death would be referred to the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>Hazlett said the company was extremely saddened by the death and sent its deepest condolences to the person's family.</p>
        
            <p>It was providing the family and its employees with support.</p>
        
            <p>Talley's runs two fishing fleets - small inshore boats that fish New Zealand's coastlines out of Port Motueka, Nelson, Westport and Timaru, and its large deep sea fleet, Amaltal, which also operates out of Port Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>It has processing facilities at both ports.</p>
        
            <p>Hazlett said the company was working with police and Maritime NZ as both were investigating.</p>
