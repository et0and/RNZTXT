            <p>MetService is warning scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected from 2pm until 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Watches are in place for Waikato, Waitomo, Taumaraunui, and Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Some thunderstorms might be slow moving and produce localised downpours of up to 40mm of rainfall, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>It has also issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Rotorua, Taupō, Taranaki, and Taihape.</p>

            <p>It says driving conditions may be hazardous, with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>The MetService has issued severe thunderstorm watches for the following regions:</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said thunderstorms could bring the risk of downpours of 35-40mm to some of the central regions.</p>
        
            <p>"Remember these are a watch which really shows these are the areas where all the ingredients are coming together, you've got the moisture, you've got the rising air, you've got the potential for some severe thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>"If we find a severe thunderstorm forming we issue a severe thunderstorm warning which tracks that individual cell and shows where it's heading."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand avoided extreme temperatures seen globally for the month of January, but National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) principal scientist Chris Brandolino says that should change in the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>Last month was the world's warmest on record, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p>
        
            <p>There was a 1.75 degrees Celsius increase globally, but regional variants meant New Zealand instead had its coldest January since 2017.</p>
