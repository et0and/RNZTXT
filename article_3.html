            <p>A Gisborne resident has told RNZ she was shocked to see the build-up of rubbish on the ground during Rhythm and Vines.</p>
        
            <p>The popular festival took place between 29 and 31 December at Waiohika Estate, near the East Coast city.</p>
        
            <p>A video has emerged online of rubbish built up along a fence at the event's entrance.</p>
        
            <p>Hayley Maxwell - who took the video - said she was dropping off her daughter on day two of the festival when she saw the rubbish.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just shocked to see when we entered the event itself from the entrance, lined up along the fence line was just a whole pile of rubbish."</p>
        
            <p>Maxwell said anyone who was a proud caretaker of property or land would have been quite taken back by it.</p>
        
            <p>"If we've got visitors coming into Gisborne, I would hate to leave that impression that they think that Gisborne is a place you can come to and just dump rubbish everywhere and it's fine."</p>
        
            <p>She said she understood that groups picked up the rubbish after the event, but believed there should be better management of it during the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe we need signage, maybe we need to have fines, and be quite strict about it too, because I think there was too much of a lax attitude."</p>
        
            <p>Maxwell said she did think it was an awesome event, but it was important to raise awareness around this issue.</p>
        
            <p>Rhythm and Vines organisers said they could not speak specifically to how rubbish was managed during the event until a full debrief was completed.</p>
        
            <p>They said Thursday was the final day of the post festival clean-up, which can take up to four or five days.</p>
        
            <p>They said there was a crew of 40 waste teams doing the final clean-up, and they were working closely with iwi and the local council.</p>
        
            <p>"As per our yearly process, a thorough post-festival clean-up is being conducted. The main road connecting Gisborne to Waiohika Estate is being surveyed and cleared of all rubbish to leave the area in the best condition possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to work with suppliers, sponsors, [the Department of Conservation] and local iwi to reduce the impact of the festival on the environment. The festival is a single-use plastic-free event, approximately 90 percent of rubbish produced is recyclable and our Bookatent system has reduced landfill waste by over 30 tonnes."</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne mayor Rehette Stoltz said she would not want to put down the whole event due to a minority of people's behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"I have seen those videos where people dump rubbish, but I also want us to be realistic - with any huge festival, you will have a small group of people that don't respect the rules."</p>
        
            <p>Stoltz said she understood Rhythm and Vines organisers were well prepared to leave the area in the same shape or better than the way they found it.</p>
