            <p>A Kawerau man is facing numerous charges after allegedly pointing a gun at police, evading arrest and holding people hostage in their own homes.</p>
        
            <p>The "dangerous and unpredictable incident" began when two police approached a "suspicious" vehicle on State Highway 30 in the eastern Bay of Plenty about 10pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The occupant fired a gun, then pointed it at the officers before driving off.</p>
        
            <p>"An immediate police response allowed officers to set up cordons and locate the vehicle, preventing the suspect from leaving the area," detective senior sergeant Paul Wilson said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The suspect stopped at a property on Hydro Road, just south of Edgecumbe, and held two people living there hostage, Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>He then entered another building where he allegedly assaulted and held a third person, in their 70s, hostage.</p>
        
            <p>Police managed to rescue the first two hostages safely at about midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after at 12.30am, the suspect gave himself up without incident.</p>
        
            <p>One person was taken to hospital with minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A sawn-off .22 rifle was recovered, Wilson said. Police will continue to examine the scenes.</p>
        
            <p>A 31-year-old man has been charged with using a firearm against law enforcement, kidnapping, wounding with intent to injure, aggravated burglary, failing to stop, threatening to kill, unlawfully taking a motor vehicle and wilful damage.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear in the WhakatƒÅne District Court on Thursday.</p>

            <p>"This was a dangerous and unpredictable incident," Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Three victims have been through a distressing ordeal in their own home, a place where they should feel safe, and two police officers have faced a totally unacceptable threat while going about their duty.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are ensuring the victims and the officers have the support they need.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud of the actions of our police, who brought this volatile incident to a peaceful conclusion. Events like this are distressing for our communities; there will be an increased presence in the area and officers will be carrying reassurance patrols."</p>
