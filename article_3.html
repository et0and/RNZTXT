        <h2>City Mission residents: To blame - or scapegoats?</h2>
        <p>
K'Road locals say they feel unsafe and intimidated amid aggression and anti-social behaviour. They also want more support for those in a housing facility.
</p>
        
            <p>Locals on Karangahape Road are calling for more support for high-need residents at a City Mission-run property nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Some are blaming residents at the property on Day Street, just behind K' Rd, for anti-social behaviour in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Residents and business owners at a central city law and order meeting last week, raised their concerns with Police Minister Mark Mitchell saying they felt unsafe and intimidated in town.</p>
        
            <p>Some point the finger at those living in a city mission-run facility, but is that really the case?</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland City Mission runs 2 Day Street; a former hotel used as a permanent housing facility for 60 residents, half of them are in need of greater support. It is known as Te Ao Mārama.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council said over the last year, the address had five official complaints against it, one for rubbish, two for noise, and three for illegal dumping.</p>

            <p>"[There had been] significant change since the Mission moved its social housing into the former Haka Hotel on Day Street," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing a lot of aggression, a lot of anti-social behaviour, that can include violence against ourselves, the community, as well as each other."</p>
        
            <p>Roger said there had been drug dealing, property damage, and violence spilling over from Day Street.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a lot of 'For Lease' signs up and it's hard, it's really really hard, and it's not just the recession."</p>
        
            <p>She thought support for residents at Te Ao Mārama needed to go further.</p>

            <p>"I don't think the high-needs tenants are getting wrap-around support at Day Street, not from what I see and the conversations I've had with the people at the mission," Roger said.</p>
        
            <p>"They should not be putting high-needs people, housing high-needs people, in that location without proper support, and I do mean proper wrap-around support.</p>
        
            <p>"These people are people with chronic addictions, both drugs and alcohol, they are chronically mentally ill, there's a lot of generational trauma involved, and I think that needs to be addressed."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Roger said she thought the mission did good work, and wanted to thank them for their hard mahi, but said the model at Day Street was not working.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had also spoken to the low-need tenants at Te Ao Mārama.</p>
        
            <p>"They're struggling in that housing as well, they are feeling intimidated, so it's not just the wider community that's being impacted it's actually their own community as well...</p>
        
            <p>"It needs to be safe for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Just up from Day Street, Liam Fox owns the Fort Greene cafe.</p>
        
            <p>He was worried the building's residents were just an easy target for those wishing to apportion blame.</p>
        
            <p>"I think a lot of people find it much easier to assign blame then to actually look at the causes of problems that exist in society," Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's much easier to have a scapegoat than to actually spend money and time fixing problems."</p>
        
            <p>There was not an easy fix to address the issues around Day Street, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are problems surrounding the Day Street Auckland City Mission housing scenario.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's difficult from the point of view of the Mission in that they have limited funding and limited personnel they can assign, and there is, realistically, a limited amount of good will that people can put towards processes like this."</p>
        
            <p>People within Te Ao Mārama were vulnerable, something easily exploited by bad actors, Fox said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's too easy and too simple to just point the finger at Day Street, they're part of a more complex problem that is easy to attribute blame to."</p>
        
            <p>Residents at Te Ao Mārama had 24 hour support from safety officers, alongside tenancy managers on site from Monday to Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The high-needs residents were provided key workers, supported by Mission staff.</p>

            <p>Auckland City Missioner Helen Robinson said they had support from the community around Day Street.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that the mission has experienced support from a significant number of individuals there [On K Road] as the Mission actually more broadly does, people are very, very good to us," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I also know that the reality of Day Street has presented some real challenges for people."</p>
        
            <p>The mission did not tolerate criminal or anti-social behaviour at any of their sites, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said she stood with those saying residents at Te Ao Mārama need more support.</p>
        
            <p>"One of my biggest jobs to be honest is to advocate to the Ministry of Health and particularly mental health, to really come to the table so that we can provide access in a very timely manner to people who need good support."</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said they relied on the community to do they best they could.</p>
        
            <p>"If it was not for the Mission, and the facility at Te Ao Mārama, there would be 30 people who would still be living on the street, and there would be an additional 30 that would be stuck in emergency or transitional housing somewhere, so it's really good work that's happening there," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly our job at the Mission to be in relationship, and to be a good neighbour, and our residents have a right to also expect good neighbour-ship.</p>
        
            <p>"The individuals who there are just like you or me, good people just trying to make the best of what they can, with often pretty difficult realities."</p>
        
            <p>Police in Auckland have acknowledged the number of calls for service around the Day Street area, largely around disorder.</p>
        
            <p>Area Commander Inspector Grant Tetzlaff said while police continued to take action when incidents occurred, they were also working to support other agencies on solutions to the complex issues behind these incidents.</p>
        
            <p>Police were working with all parties to find solutions - including the Auckland City Mission, residents groups, and the K' Road Business Association, as well as elected representatives and council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Two additional CCTV cameras were installed around Day Street through this work, and Tetzlaff said it would enable improved monitoring and response to incidents that may be occurring in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Police were also continuing to increase their visibility and presence along Karangahape Road, he said.</p>
