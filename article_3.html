            <p>Some roads surrounding Auckland's Queen Street will be closed for part of Sunday for the annual Farmers Santa Parade.</p>
        
            <p>Most will be shut from 11am until 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>"People are advised to get into the city before 11am," the parade's website said.</p>

            <p>This year's procession is being led by High Jump Olympic gold medallist Hamish Kerr, and floats will include TV pup Bluey and one made out of Lego.</p>
        
            <p>At 2.30pm there will be a party in Aotea Square "filled with festive Christmas music and dance including the Bluey Live Christmas Experience, where you have the chance to interact with the loveable Heeler siblings, Bluey and her little sister Bingo".</p>
        
            <p>"There will be a collection for Surf Life Saving New Zealand pre-parade so please give generously," the website said.</p>
        
            <p>If weather gets in the way, the parade will be postponed until Sunday, 1 December.</p>
