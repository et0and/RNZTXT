            <p>An elderly woman is "understandably distressed" after her Whangārei house was shot at overnight, police say.</p>
        
            <p>They were called to the Collingwood Street property just after 4am on Saturday, where they found "damage both inside and outside the address" consistent with gun shots.</p>
        
            <p>No one was hurt, and the house's occupant - a grandmother in her 70s - would be receiving support, Detective Sergeant Paul Overton said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police want to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident or who might have knowledge as to who is involved.</p>
        
            <p>"We would also like any drivers who were in the area to please check dashcam footage and let us know if you have captured anything significant."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information was urged to contact police on 105, quoting file number 240713/7934, or to call Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
