        <h2>Tiny sign doesn’t stop swimming in poo</h2>
        <p>
"It's kind of disgusting," says one local who got caught out.

New Plymouth's council quietly changed the arrow to red only after LDR raised concerns.

            <p>A small warning sign pinned low on a parking barrier was not enough to stop a whānau swimming in - and swallowing water from - a river that had been polluted by sewage from a New Plymouth shopping centre.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth District Council said its warning signs matched the risk - yet it changed a crucial alert sign from green to red after Local Democracy Reporting raised concerns.</p>
        
            <p>A private sewer line at the Valley Shopping Centre blocked by fat from a food outlet first overflowed for two hours on Saturday morning, sending human waste via a stormwater drain into the nearby river.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday the council issued a second alert about an ongoing spill from the sewer.</p>
        
            <p>Council advisories said both spills had "potential to affect public health".</p>
        
            <p>"Warning signs against swimming (48 hours) and collecting kai (28 days) have been erected at affected water bodies."</p>
        
            <p>The temporary spill warning sign at Te Rewa Rewa bridge carpark was the length of two ballpoint pens, pinned at about knee-height to one of 30 short posts bordering open ground down to the river.</p>
        
            <p>Arohaina Rangipunga did not see the 30 x 20cm sign as she headed to the riverbank with whānau on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>
Arohaina Rangipunga was worried about her son Pango Foster, who swallowed water and even splashed himself in the face when paddling in for a photo.

            <p>Paddling his kayak, her son Pango Foster inevitably swallowed water.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of disgusting," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They should put big signs out. It's not good. You know, warn everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Rangipunga (Parihaka, Ngāruahine, Ngāti Ruanui) said warnings ought to be unavoidable for anyone arriving at the reserve.</p>
        
            <p>"The council should notify people properly, instead of everyone having to search up whether the water is good enough to swim in."</p>
        
            <p>"I don't even look. I'm just like 'yep, go' because [the tamariki] are already going anyway."</p>
        
            <p>Two large signs on the road in to the council reserve were set to green, indicating water nearby was clean enough to swim in and eat from.</p>
        
            <p>Ten times bigger than the temporary warning sign - a metre high by over half a metre wide - these permanent signs have movable arrows at eye level pointing to green, amber or red alerts about the water.</p>
        
            <p>When Rangipunga parked near the tourist drawcard Te Rewa Rewa walkway bridge on Tuesday the arrow on the big sign pointed to green.</p>
        
            <p>That arrow was changed from green to red alert after NPDC three waters manager Mark Hall went there to check out concerns raised by LDR on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>
The sign warning of the Valley sewage spill was the length of two ballpoint pens.

</p>
        
            <p>Hall did not mention raising the alert level during a half-hour briefing and interview the next morning.</p>
        
            <p>At the Waiwhakaiho River's mouth, the arrow there had already indicated red alert - no swimming or shellfish collecting - but that is more than half-a-kilometre on from Rangipunga's parking spot.</p>
        
            <p>The river-mouth sign does not mention fishing, but Hall said no food should be taken from there.</p>
        
            <p>And as LDR investigated the area, two children were being taught to fish at the contaminated Waiwhakaiho River mouth, where all seafood is currently considered unsafe.</p>
        
            <p>The children were having rods baited by a caregiver.</p>
        
            <p>The red alert arrow was easy to miss, between and behind signs about freedom camping and the danger of 1080-poisoned possum carcasses to dogs.</p>
        
            <p>Hall said the swimming whānau was fortunately at much lesser risk as the second spill did not reach the river, despite the council advisory.</p>
        
            <p>NPDC workers contained the waste in a stormwater sump before pumping it out for disposal.</p>
        
            <p>The public health engineer said he understood how people might miss the small warning sign, but the public alert rules did not need to change.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe we are doing what we can that's practical, because it's about being practical, right?"</p>
        
            <p>"It's simply a balance. We do what we can practically, and commensurate with the risk that's posed."</p>
        
            <p>The risk alert system had been created by NPDC along with the regional council, public health authorities, and iwi and hapū.</p>
        
            <p>Public health staff checked on serious spills and could call for council to post more warnings.</p>
        
            <p>"In a situation like this, the risk is very low."</p>
        
            <p>Hall said the spill was small.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's going into a river, which is very, very, very wide, which is then going to an ocean.</p>
        
            <p>"The probability of someone happening to swallow that [contaminated] piece of water that happened to be there at the time is very, very, very, very low."</p>
        
            <p>But he said one overflow is too many.</p>
        
            <p>"It's still a sensitive thing. A little bit of sewage is still too much."</p>
        
            <p>Hall said no one should pour fat down a drain.</p>
        
            <p>"The sewage system is not a rubbish disposal system... Pees, poohs and paper only."</p>
        
            <p>Last January a brief rainstorm overwhelmed New Plymouth's sewage treatment and the outflow of partially untreated waste closed city beaches.</p>
        
            <p>The local representative on water-watchdog Taranaki Regional Council reckoned the risk was low and went surfing with his daughter - without telling her about the pollution.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor and surfer advocate Craig Williamson confirmed the spill signage promised by NPDC was a mirage.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no signage. People don't know."</p>
        
            <p>Over the past eight years New Plymouth suffered an average of 20 sewage spills a year, mostly caused by fat blockages, heavy rain flooding or tree roots.</p>
        
            <p>The current annual count, beginning last July last year, is at six spills - three due to fat blockages, two caused by tree roots and one from a power surge.</p>
