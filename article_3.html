        <h2>School left with no gym for four years</h2>
        <p>
It is one of many schools struggling to overcome mounting paperwork and rising costs as it tries to finish a building.

            <p>A central Auckland school which has a gym that is sliding down a slope is frustrated by the delays in fixing it.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of many schools around the country attempting to get their building projects over the growing hurdle rising costs and mounting paperwork</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Girls' Grammar students have had no gym for four years, since cracks in the floor were spotted. The girls have to walk a kilometre to the YMCA if they want to practice basketball.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm relying on the experts.... who told us that it wasn't safe, and who now tell us that with the right remediation that it will be safe," principal Ngaire Ashmore said.</p>
        
            <p>"What worries me is [that with] not enough money to actually complete the project, will we be compromising on areas of safety?</p>
        
            <p>"That is my biggest worry."</p>
        
            <p>There was a small fire and asbestos worries at the gym four years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We noticed cracks in the floor," Ashmore said.</p>
        
            <p>Experts took a look and shut the building down.</p>
        
            <p>"The reinforcements of the floor and the footing seemed to be sliding down the bank.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't been back in our gym since."</p>

            <p>The floor inside remains cracked and slumped in one corner.</p>
        
            <p>A whole cohort of Year 13s had never had a gym, Ashmore said.</p>
        
            <p>The 1100-student school is built on a steep street near Karangahape Road in central Auckland. It has other parts of its ageing buildings where upgrades are taking place.</p>
        
            <p>It does not have its own fields, and Ashmore suspected a boys' school that was similarly constrained in sports would not be treated the same way.</p>
        
            <p>"I do, I do think there's a bit of that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The crack experts were the first in a procession of "maybe 20 or 30 experts" over the years.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry-funded consultants initially told the school it needed a whole new gym. But in 2022 the ministry intervened, and said the existing one could be fixed, said Ashmore.</p>
        
            <p>Last year the gym flooded during the Anniversary Day deluge.</p>

            <p>The ministry conceded the $4m in funding would not be enough for the fix, but that was okay as they could just apply for more, the principal told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>But that was not the case.</p>
        
            <p>"When we had our first meeting of this year with our ministry officials, I think the first thing that was said is that, 'Just letting you know, there is no more money'."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's stories about the wider issues facing school projects then broke, with a government directive for a widespread review.</p>
        
            <p>"My heart sank because I knew we needed at least another $2 million," Ashmore said.</p>
        
            <p>Most recently, the ministry has asked for a new business case, which will be submitted this week, and the school is hoping for a clear answer in several more weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Ashmore had no choice but to trust the ministry as the school could not afford to hire its own independent expert advisers.</p>
        
            <p>Ashmore said she had lost confidence in the process.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a school of 1100 young women who traipse into the city to get the best education and we just don't have the facilities to deliver.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's not acceptable and not okay."</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said on Tuesday that the gym required maintenance, structural repairs and to make sure it met building code requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Some funding was approved in March 2023 and "we are currently preparing a business case for the full funding", it said.</p>
