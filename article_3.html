            <p>A second Sydney performance by US comedian Jerry Seinfeld has been interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday night's show at ICC Sydney Theatre was paused while the demonstrators holding a Palestinian flag were escorted out of the venue after they heckled the Jewish actor.</p>
        
            <p>Two members of the audience shouted out and waved a Palestinian flag before security intervened while some members of the audience booed.</p>
        
            <p>It is not clear from footage of the incident what the protesters said during the show.</p>
        
            <p>Seinfeld responded to the protesters from the stage, acknowledging their "strong political feelings".</p>
        
            <p>"But you don't know where to say them," he said to the pair.</p>
        
            <p>"You think that ruining the night, it doesn't affect me, all these people, you're ruining their night."</p>
        
            <p>He then made light of the incident before adding: "I love them, too, they just need a little direction of, you know, where to use their tremendous brain power."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday night, his first Sydney show was also interrupted with videos from social media showing pro-Palestinian chants, including "From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free" before those members of the audience were escorted out.</p>
        
            <p>Some supporters of Israel consider it as a call for the eradication of the nation but others, including many Palestinians, argue it is simply a call for freedom.</p>
        
            <p>Seinfeld has been outspoken in his support for Israel since the 7 October Hamas attack in which more than 1100 people were killed, with dozens still help captive, according to Israeli officials.</p>
        
            <p>Two months later, Seinfeld went on a solidarity trip to Israel.</p>
        
            <p>Since 7 October, more than 37,300 Palestinians have been killed and almost 85,500 have been injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>
        
            <p>In May, dozens of students left their own graduation during his commencement speech at North Carolina's Duke University over his support for Israel, leaving the football field while chanting "free Palestine".</p>
