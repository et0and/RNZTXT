            <p>A critically injured person has been freed from the wreckage of a caravan by emergency services and a digger, more than two hours after a tree fell on the vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>The incident unfolded in the tiny rural settlement of Balmoral, in Canterbury's Hurunui district, on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency NZ spokesperson said they received reports of the fallen tree just before 7:30pm.</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance had been treating the patient while they were still trapped.</p>
        
            <p>However, a Fire and Emergency New Zealand spokesperson said they were able to remove the trunk of the tree using heavy machinery, and the person was extricated just before 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>It was not clear if the incident, in Balmoral, was caused by the weather, although there were severe thunderstorm warnings in the area earlier, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts to get a rescue helicopter to the incident were unsuccessful and it had to be stood down due to weather.</p>
        
            <p>The person would instead be transported to hospital by road.</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance said the patient had critical injuries.</p>
