        <h2>The (almost) lost art of making a trug</h2>
        <p>
Country Life: Trugs have been used for centuries, and "when I start building one, I fall into a wonderful state of mind", Tony Hitchcock says.

            <p>Trugs have a long history. The Sussex slatted carry-alls have been lugging veggies and fruit into kitchens in the UK for centuries.</p>
        
            <p>Tony Hitchcock has been crafting the wooden garden baskets for several years using untreated willow or hazel and poplar sourced locally from around Golden Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"When I start building one, I fall into a wonderful state of mind," the fifth-generation local told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>A childhood spent in the Anatoki Valley, where he still lives with his partner Maddy and their three children, in part inspired Hitchcock to become a Kahurangi National Park ranger.</p>

            <p>So how did a park ranger become a trug maker?</p>
        
            <p>"It goes right back to when I got my first job mowing the lawns of the old trug maker, Brett Hutchinson in the Anatoki Valley near Tākaka. We became good friends, he became a mentor and over the years I helped around his workshop," Hitchcock said.</p>

            <p>Hutchinson had been making trugs for nearly 25 years when he decided to hang up his draw knife, a long two-handled knife used to shave wooden slats down to the required thickness for a trug.</p>
        
            <p>"He said he wanted to retire and asked if we were interested in taking over the business, which was a surprise and an honour," explained Hitchcock.</p>
        
            <p>He accepted and became Hutchinson's apprentice, but with young children and working part-time, it was a hectic few years.</p>
        
            <p>"So yeah, I've slowly became a trug maker and I'm still learning. It's the kind of job you're always learning, you never stop."</p>

            <p>Apart from the copper fixings, everything the trugs are made of come from the Tākaka River catchment, mainly from around the farm margins and orchards.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'll fell the tree and cut it into logs. We have a wonderful local sawmiller and he mills the timber into two inch timber."</p>
        
            <p>Once in the workshop, the wood is fillet stacked and dried. Hitchcock works the timber down to thin slats with a draw knife. Then they're steam-softened and curved to fit the body of each basket.</p>

            <p>The handles and rims are made from strips of split-down hazel or willow that he's harvested in winter when the sap's not running</p>
        
            <p>"It means that when we process that timber under steam, the bark adheres to the timber and becomes a beautiful and a hard-wearing laminate."</p>
        
            <p>Making a trug is like putting a puzzle together, he told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm assembling a trug I'm steaming the slats and getting everything nice and symmetrical and tight so there's no little gaps, it's a real challenge!"</p>

            <p>As well as making Sussex Trugs, the biggest seller, Hitchcock also makes Devon Maunds. He believes he's one of only a handful of people in the world who can make them.</p>
        
            <p>The larger maunds are traditionally used for potato and apple harvesting,</p>
        
            <p>"They are by far the hardest and the slowest item we make but the great thing is once you start building one you can't stop!"</p>
        
            <p>Hitchcock still does some fencing and forestry work in the winter but with Christmas fast approaching, the busy season is well underway.</p>

            <p>"From now on it's usually pretty hectic and now that all our kids are growing up, it's getting easier be out here and making trugs full-time, it's a wonderful feeling."</p>
        
            <p>His old mentor Hutchinson still lives on the other side of the Anatoki River, a stroll over a swing bridge from where Hitchcock now has his own trug workshop.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'm stuck with something, he's happy to come over and we'll talk it over, and I'll show him what's going wrong and his experience comes out."</p>
