            <p>The fire danger has gone up steeply in Otago, prompting fire tighter fire season restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Westerly winds and a lack of widespread rain had dried out much of the vegetation across the Otago District, Fire and Emergency New Zealand's Otago District Manager Phil Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"In these conditions, with more wind forecast, a fire can get out of control very quickly. We have already seen several unwanted fires across Otago in the last week, with one likely to have been caused by fireworks," Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"Wind can easily carry sparks and embers from fireworks large distances into dry vegetation."</p>
        
            <p>From this Monday, fire prohibitions will apply for the Central Otago, Naseby, Upper Waitaki, Otago Lakes, Glendhu Bluffs and Lake ÅŒhau zones, Fire and Emergency New Zealand said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire Prohibition means no open air fires or fireworks are allowed - including the suspension of any fire permits that had already been granted.</p>
        
            <p>While the Strath Taieri zone will move to a restricted fire season, where a [www.checkitsalright.nz. permit has to be granted] before anyone can have an open-air fire.</p>
        
            <p>The new restrictions begin from 8am on Monday 18 December, and continue until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>More information is available here about what is or is not allowed as well as details on getting a permit.</p>
