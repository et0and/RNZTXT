            <p>As animals go, the sheep might be considered by some as the perfect embodiment of docility.</p>
        
            <p>It seems like a sedate life, hanging out in paddocks as flocks of round cotton balls, standing around and chewing all day long.</p>
        
            <p>The term "sheep" is also a metaphor for people who follow en masse without question.</p>
        
            <p>But sheep are not mundane mindless mammals - not in the slightest.</p>
        
            <p>There's plenty going on behind their horizontal pupils.</p>
        
            <p>They're clever creatures, deftly thwarting our defences to get to the greener grass (or flowers, as you'll discover) on the other side.</p>
        
            <p>Sheep can recognise and remember dozens of sheep faces. They can also recognise human faces, and like us, they prefer them when they're smiling.</p>
        
            <p>And they've contributed far more to human existence than lamb chops and cosy jumpers.</p>
        
            <p>Their history stretches back millions of years, when …</p>
        
            <p>There are hundreds of domestic sheep breeds today, from the Turkish Acıpayam to Zulu sheep in South Africa, but they're pretty much all one species: Ovis aries.</p>
        
            <p>Their earliest ancestors evolved between 10 and 20 million years ago in the mountains of central Asia, according to Sally Coulthard, historian and author of A Short History of the World according to Sheep.</p>
        
            <p>"That really early predecessor split and went different ways and some trotted west, into Europe, some went east into China and Siberia … and some even crossed over what would have been the frozen Bering Strait and went into North America," she says.</p>
        
            <p>As populations separated, and were domesticated and bred, they developed unusual features, such as the twirly spiral horns of the Racka ...</p>

            <p>... and the North Ronaldsay, which lives on a remote Scottish island and eats only seaweed.</p>
        
            <p>It may not look like it as you drive past, but a flock of sheep in a paddock is a dynamic little system, splitting and rejoining as conditions change.</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes they huddle together, and other times they spread apart - but rarely, if ever, do sheep hang out alone.</p>
        
            <p>A team led by Stephan Leu, an animal behaviour researcher at the University of Adelaide, found a daily pattern to this ovine fission and fusion.</p>
        
            <p>"The largest group sizes are early in the morning and late in the afternoon. And there's also another sort of peak in the middle of the day," Dr Leu says.</p>
        
            <p>"They meet up with smaller subgroups and form these larger groups."</p>
        
            <p>Those times coincide with lulls in sheep activity, when they forage less and rest more.</p>
        
            <p>"The benefits of being in a larger group are, for instance, spotting predators," Dr Leu says.</p>
        
            <p>"They form these larger groups to be protected because everyone is watching out for each other a little bit."</p>

            <p>Like many domesticated animals, sheep are clever creatures. They can solve complex mazes, and remember the solution weeks, even months, later.</p>
        
            <p>This is something sheep farmer and YouTuber Tara Farms knows only too well.</p>
        
            <p>If there's a hole in a fence, the sheep are on it.</p>
        
            <p>"They know where to escape through the fence. You can take a sheep out of a paddock and put them back in there three months later and they'll still find the same hole, if you haven't patched it," Tara says.</p>
        
            <p>"They know."</p>
        
            <p>But the measure of sheep intelligence is perhaps best illustrated by a mystery that hit the English village of Marsden in 2004.</p>
        
            <p>Something was eating the flowers in the village's flowerbeds, and residents simply could not work out who the culprit was, Coulthard says.</p>
        
            <p>There were sheep in the moors around Marsden, but the village was protected by sheep grids, and they were too wide for the sheep to leap over.</p>
        
            <p>The residents finally decided to stay up overnight and watch - and what they saw amazed them.</p>
        
            <p>"Apparently the sheep had learnt to do commando rolls over the sheep grids," Coulthard laughs.</p>
        
            <p>The likeliest scenario was one or two sheep figured out they could lay on their side and roll across, then showed the rest of the flock, she adds.</p>
        
            <p>"So not only is that showing amazing problem solving, but also the communication of knowledge, all of which are things that we associate with higher intelligence.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly after looking after sheep, I realise sheep are much cannier than people give them credit for."</p>

Before rubber, condoms could be made from sheep intestine.

            <p>Before rubber, condoms could be made from animals, including sheep - their intestine, to be specific.</p>
        
            <p>"Sheep gut is actually fabulously flexible and robust, and really useful," Coulthard says.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the earliest evidence for condoms in Europe was found in the 1980s.</p>
        
            <p>Archaeologists excavated a toilet at Dudley Castle near Birmingham in England, which was sealed in the middle of the 17th century.</p>
        
            <p>Along with remains like coriander seeds and fish bones, the researchers found 10 animal membrane condoms.</p>
        
            <p>Five were burnt and blackened, while the other five were nestled inside each other, like an intestine-condom-Matryoshka doll.</p>
        
            <p>Making them took time and care, according to researchers who published the Dudley Castle condoms in Post-Medieval Archaeology.</p>
        
            <p>The cut intestine was scraped, cleaned (possibly turned inside out), dried and cut to size, which was between 15 and 20 centimetres long.</p>
        
            <p>"In many cases, the open end was trimmed with a ribbon tie," the researchers wrote.</p>
        
            <p>They couldn't say whether the condoms were used primarily for contraception or to protect against sexually transmitted infections, but considering the laborious manufacturing process, a condom was a luxury at the time.</p>
        
            <p>And there's a chance the Dudley Castle sheaths were not single-use.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst there is some dark staining on some of the Dudley Castle condom tips, some mottled dark patches also occur on … remains of the [condom] shafts; it is unclear whether or not these patches testify to repeated use," the researchers wrote.</p>

            <p>Advances in artificial insemination were largely thanks to sheep (and some scientists, of course).</p>
        
            <p>Back in the 1950s, Australia was well and truly riding on the sheep's back.</p>
        
            <p>The US needed wool to make uniforms for soldiers heading to the Korean war, and they bought much of it from Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The price of wool skyrocketed. Where before it sold for a few shillings per pound, woolgrowers suddenly got "a pound a pound".</p>
        
            <p>Sheep needed to be bred to meet demand. Artificial insemination, where sperm from a ram is inserted directly into a ewe's uterus, was a way to do it quickly.</p>
        
            <p>And a Hungarian agricultural scientist, who spent three years in a Siberian gulag then fled Europe during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, would play a huge role in developing that technology.</p>
        
            <p>That scientist - Steven Salamon - arrived in Australia, where he eventually made his way to the office of the University of Sydney's head of animal husbandry, Terry Robinson.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Robinson recognised Dr Salamon's talent. They led a team that developed ways to freeze sheep sperm, and modify the female reproductive cycle so a bunch of ewes could become pregnant at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>Artificial insemination was born. And it worked, says Gareth Evans, an animal reproduction researcher at the University of Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"If you get a particularly valuable ram, it might be able to cover 50 ewes or something in a season … whereas it could be many hundreds through artificial insemination," Professor Evans says.</p>
        
            <p>These days, artificial insemination - sometimes known as intrauterine insemination - is a fertility treatment for human animals too.</p>
        
            <p>As is in-vitro fertilisation or IVF … and this had its origins in sheep, too.</p>
        
            <p>In the 1960s, a young agricultural scientist named Alan Trounson, working in a southern NSW woolshed, wondered why some sheep had more lambs than others.</p>
        
            <p>He soon realised it came down to the number of eggs the ewes produced.</p>
        
            <p>After studying embryology, he and collaborators worked on a solution for women who were struggling to conceive. It involved increasing egg production, which increased their likelihood of falling pregnant - just like he'd seen in sheep.</p>
        
            <p>And these days, one in 18 babies in Australia is born via IVF.</p>
