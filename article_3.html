        <h2>Scott Robertson rolls the dice for must-win clash</h2>
        <p>
Analysis: Will we have to get used to reactionary All Black selections?
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis: Scott Robertson has rolled the changes for Saturday's test against the Springboks in Cape Town, in a sign that perhaps what the opposition is doing is going to force his hand a lot more.</p>
        
            <p>It's something that All Black fans may well need to get used to going forward, although there is plenty of evidence to suggest it's the right approach.</p>
        
            <p>The first is that it was clear the bench effort was not only poor last weekend at Ellis Park, it arguably cost the All Blacks the test match. Something needed to be done to counter the Springbok bomb squad, so the only real way was to shift experience to the back end of the game. Beauden Barrett and TJ Perenara have played over 200 tests between them; they've seen and done it all before.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, we've looked at it and it's really important to have experience at the end of games," said Robertson at the team naming press conference yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"A couple of names to put on there with a lot of tests and a lot of experience to come on and finish the job for us."</p>
        
            <p>It's a decidedly un-All Black plan, because it might show the side is rattled after dropping their second test of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to look at Cortez (Ratima) starting," Robertson elaborated, after handing the Chiefs halfback a start in the biggest game of his career so far.</p>

            <p>"It just worked out this way this week in that regard."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett reverting to the bench and Caleb Clarke's injury sees a rejigged back three.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Tele'a and Sevu Reece both get reprieves after dropping down the depth chart, although the bigger question mark is over Will Jordan at fullback. Jordan was lethal in the 15 jersey for the Crusaders, but his only test start there was a stuttering effort last year against the Wallabies in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a massive change from week to week in the way we play â€¦ it depends what sort of kick cycles we get into, counter-attack opportunities we get," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>However, all three of those players have proven test experience and it's an impressive body of work between them.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>While he's an obviously promising player, the same can't be said of Wallace Sititi, especially since he's been picked at blindside despite playing the entire Super Rugby Pacific season with the Chiefs at number eight.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a hell of an athlete. He's built for these types of games, [has got a] great skillset and he's really impressed us over the last month," said Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>Sititi has all the attributes to be a game-changer, but if he can do it against a Springbok forward pack brimming with confidence, it'll go down as one of the best All Black performances in recent memory. Sam Cane is in to do the dirty work at the ruck and hurt people, Ardie Savea is there for the highlight reel plays, so Sititi simply needs to get his hands on ball often and early.</p>
        
            <p>But really, this one needs to be closed out with either a couple of tries or at the very least with the All Blacks holding possession in the Springbok half at the end of the game.</p>
        
            <p>While outwardly reactive selections are not part of the All Black brand, punishing final periods of tests definitely are - and it's been a while since we've seen them do it.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's match will be a watershed moment for this All Black side, because a loss at DHL Stadium will mean they would've lost the Rugby Championship for the first time since 2019. That fact has somewhat escaped the attention of reporters this week as the hype around a proposed full All Black tour of South Africa in 2026 gathers momentum.</p>
        
            <p>But make no mistake: this is now crunch time for Robertson's side. If there's a rebuild to be done, it needs to start happening - fast.</p>
