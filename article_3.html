            <p>Tasman Moko have defended the Ranfurly Shield for the first time in their history after beating Wellington 28-15 in Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>The two previously unbeaten teams in this year's National Provincial Championship took time to settle but Tasman opened the scoring with a try from Winger Timoci Tavatavanawai.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell Parata later stretched the lead to 8-nil with a penalty kick.</p>
        
            <p>It looked like Wellington full-back Ruben Love was going to cross the line with five minutes left in the first half but some desperate defence saw Tasman manage to hold him up.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington finally got on the scoreboard when Jackson Garden-Bachop scored a penalty before the main break but Tasman led 8-3 at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>Tjay Clarke scored Wellington's first try, which was then converted and the visitors trailed by just one.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman found it hard to penetrate Wellington's wall-like defence but sheer persistence eventually saw Finlay Christie score Tasman's second try.</p>
        
            <p>Riley Higgin's then replied with Wellington's second try and again the visitors were behind by just one.</p>
        
            <p>But a brilliant try by local product Kyren Taumoefolau, which was then converted, stretched Tasman's lead to 23-15 with eight minutes left.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman put the icing on the cake after a long build up was rewarded with a try from Nic Sauira.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman Moko captain Quinten Strange had to go off with any injury early, but they benefited from the experience of All Black David Havili, who was released to play.</p>
        
            <p>"It just shows how much it means to this region ...it's awesome to come back and play in front of our fans. I wanted to come down and try and defend it and be able to hold it today and really grateful for the opportunity," Havili said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington still sit at the top of the NPC table, but Tasman have a game in hand.</p>
