            <p>A Whangārei woman is distraught - as well as out of pocket and without transport - after her car was destroyed during a spate of seemingly random arson attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Police say three cars have been set on fire in the suburb of Tikipunga this month, all of them on people's driveways in the early hours of the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Sara May, 25, said her car was torched about 4.15am on Wednesday this week; another car a few streets away was burnt out on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The fire also destroyed her driver's licence, her three-year-son's car seat and pram, clothing, and personal belongings.</p>
        
            <p>May said her partner was jolted out of bed when the fire triggered the car horn.</p>
        
            <p>"He said, 'babe, you car's on fire'. My first thought was, 'it can't be'. Then I saw the flames coming out the windows and I went into a panic. It was right there outside the window. It was terrifying," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The car was parked on the driveway, within the property, and less than a metre from a tall wooden fence.</p>
        
            <p>Her partner raced outside and started dousing the fire with a hose while she called 111.</p>
        
            <p>She feared the flames could spread via the fence and trees to the house.</p>
        
            <p>May said she knew no reason why she would be targeted, and believed the fires were random.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems like someone's just going around doing this for no reason."</p>
        
            <p>The car, which she'd bought second-hand four years ago, was insured - but the amount she'd get back was so minimal it would not come close to covering the cost of a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>She also had "zero savings".</p>
        
            <p>Once her son was in day care she'd be able to look for a job, but she'd need transport first.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze had left her distraught and in disbelief, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She had been pleasantly surprised, however, by the response when she set up a Givealittle page explaining her plight.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some amazing people out there, who've been incredibly supportive and generous."</p>
        
            <p>As of 5pm on Friday more than $3700 had been donated.</p>
        
            <p>Some "lovely ladies" had given her a pram and car seat, and neighbours had dropped off toys to replace what her boy had lost in the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Between the Givealittle appeal and the small insurance payout, she hoped she would have enough to buy a reliable, road-legal car.</p>
        
            <p>May said she'd become attached to her old car, a 2002 Honda Torneo, in the four years she'd owned it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was reliable and safe and it always got me from A to B. I never had any issues with it."</p>
        
            <p>She said she didn't want anyone else to lose their car to a random arson attack.</p>
        
            <p>"This just has to stop. Someone could be killed," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Pieter Serfontein, of the Whangārei CIB, said police were "keeping an open mind" as to whether all three fires involved the same offenders.</p>
        
            <p>There was no known link with a fire that took the life of Tikipunga resident John Reuben, also known as Hoani Reupena-Tuoro.</p>
        
            <p>The 61-year-old died after a car fire spread to his Thomas Street home just before 3am on 29 April.</p>
        
            <p>A 48-year-old Whangārei man, August Lemon, was arrested last month in relation to that fire and charged with knowingly endangering life by setting fire to property.</p>
        
            <p>Lemon was denied bail and is in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Serfontein urged Tikipunga residents to be vigilant, especially in the early hours of the morning, and report any suspicious activity by calling 111.</p>
        
            <p>While no one had been injured in the latest fires, they had a serious effect on families who had lost their only means of transportation.</p>
        
            <p>Serfontein asked anyone with information about the fires to call 105 or use the online reporting form, quoting reference number 240912/0211.</p>
