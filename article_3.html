            <p>An Auckland Jewish community centre's fence has been vandalised overnight, with an attempt to set it on fire.</p>
        
            <p>Pro Palestinian graffiti was sprayed on the fence of the Beth Shalom centre in Epsom on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour said she saw two small fires, one on either side of the fence, but they did not take hold.</p>
        
            <p>Google maps wrongly lists the property as being the Israeli Consulate.</p>
        
            <p>Epsom MP David Seymour lives nearby and said he was on his way home last night shortly after the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"I noticed the police and the graffiti and I stopped and could smell a lot of petrol and neighbours told me they had had to call the fire department," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously this is highly distressing."</p>
        
            <p>He was back today helping to clean the graffiti off the fence.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was disturbing to both the Jewish community as well as those living nearby, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he understood why people were upset by what was happening in the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>"But you are not going to help a single person in Gaza by terrorising innocent people in New Zealand and this is completely unacceptable," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the incident happened at about 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>They were back speaking to neighbours on Wednesday and asked anyone in the area who had CCTV footage to contact them.</p>
