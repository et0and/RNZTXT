            <p>A major fire north of Christchurch has been contained but Fire and Emergency continue to battle multiple blazes in the region.</p>
        
            <p>A vegetation fire broke out on Racecourse Road just outside Amberley. It has burnt through grass, tree stumps and car wrecks.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it has been contained to an area 1km long and 600 metres wide.</p>
        
            <p>It said multiple tankers and three helicopters responded when it was reported early this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>This evening it said two helicopters and several crews were still working to put out the fire, and heavy machinery had been brought in to assist. The fire was still contained.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, some residents on Racecourse Road were evacuated from their homes and told they could go to the Amberley Library for support.</p>
        
            <p>In an update at 4.45pm, the Hurunui District Council said FENZ had confirmed residents could return home.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the situation could still escalate and people should be prepared to evacuate, if the fire flares up again," the council said in a social media post.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions are hot and dry in the region, and Fire and Emergency said several appliances will remain on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the increasing winds it's likely that we will have crews on site through the night," FENZ said in a social media post.</p>
        
            <p>However, it said resources have been shifted to four other fires which continue to burn at Loburn near Rangiora.</p>
        
            <p>Crews are also fighting four vegetation fires on Loburn Whiterock Road, near Loburn.</p>
        
            <p>Eight fire trucks, three tankers and three helicopters are attending the Loburn fires which are estimated to cover about a square kilometre.</p>
        
            <p>Police are in the process of evacuating those affected.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby residents who may be affected by smoke should close windows and doors and reduce outdoor exercise, a FENZ spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are advised to call Healthline on 0800 611 116 if they have any concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The council has also appealed to residents in both Amberley and Loburn to limit their water use and not to turn on appliances such as washing machines.</p>
        
            <p>"We have diverted extra water supply to allow the emergency crews to fight the fire."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ has appealed to people to stay away from the scene of the fires so they do not hamper efforts to bring it under control.</p>
