            <p>The Commerce Commission has reaffirmed banking rules need to be eased, Kiwibank beefed up and open banking promoted to bring greater competition into personal banking services.</p>
        
            <p>The commission on Tuesday released its eagerly awaited final report into competition in the retail banking sector.</p>
        
            <p>Commission head John Small said stimulating competition in personal banking services requires a "multi-faceted approach to ensure that it's baked in."</p>
        
            <p>Small said open banking could be a game-changer, giving thousands of underserved Kiwis access to financial services and revolutionising consumer choice.</p>
        
            <p>The recommendations are little changed from the draft report in March and steer clear of suggesting the big four Australian banks should be broken up.</p>
        
            <p>The draft report had also recommended the government look at ways to beef up Kiwibank by increasing its capital.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
