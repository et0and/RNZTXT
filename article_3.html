            <p>Labour is calling on the government to pause its funding of I Am Hope/Gumboot Friday, after campaigner Mike King said alcohol was not a problem for people with mental health issues.</p>
        
            <p>The mental health minister said he disagreed with King's comments, but remained positive over the support young people would get from the initiative.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Newstalk ZB on Wednesday, King questioned the link between alcohol and suicide.</p>
        
            <p>"Alcohol is not a problem for people with mental health issues. It's actually the solution to our problem, until you come up with a better solution," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would suggest to you that alcohol has prevented more young people from taking their own lives than it actually takes their own lives."</p>
        
            <p>King immediately defended his reasoning, saying he had used drugs and alcohol to "stop that little voice inside my head" and that it was a "release" and a "lifejacket" until he got counselling.</p>
        
            <p>The government has funded $24 million towards King's Gumboot Friday initiative, over the course of four years.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's mental health spokesperson Ingrid Leary said that should be reviewed.</p>
        
            <p>"The comments are deeply problematic and fly in the face of well-established body of literature that links alcohol use both directly and indirectly with mental ill health, including with suicide risk," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"To continue to fund Gumboot Friday sends a message to young people that alcohol use is a recognised treatment for mental health issues."</p>
        
            <p>The minister for mental health, Matt Doocey, said he had a lot of respect for King and the work he had done for young New Zealanders, but he disagreed with his comments.</p>
        
            <p>"Excess alcohol consumption can cause a lot of harm in our communities, that is why this government is taking alcohol harm seriously," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said he was committed to ensuring people had access to appropriate alcohol and other drug addiction services, and that substance use was treated as a health issue.</p>
        
            <p>He defended the government's funding of I Am Hope, which would provide counselling services to five to 25 year olds.</p>
        
            <p>"My interest remains with the additional 15,000 young New Zealanders a year who are able to access free mental health support due to the funding that has been provided."</p>
        
            <p>The procurement process for the funding, part of National's coalition agreement with New Zealand First, has come under the spotlight.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in October, the Auditor-General criticised the process, saying the contract was "inconsistent and unusual" and that the funding was to a specific supplier rather than to a broad policy initiative or to achieve a policy outcome.</p>
        
            <p>Leary said King's latest comments added fuel to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"It must be galling for the many wonderful non-governmental organisations with safe and evidence-based approaches to providing mental health support and services to hear these comments, and know that they weren't able to contest for these funds and help these young people," she said.</p>
