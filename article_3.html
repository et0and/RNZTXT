            <p>The head of Oranga Tamariki (OT) says he has confidence in his staff - even if the public does not.</p>
        
            <p>The Chief Ombudsman found the agency is failing on almost every level, in a scathing report released last week.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at Oranga Tamariki's annual Parliamentary review on Monday, chief executive Chappie Te Kani said he still had confidence in his staff.</p>
        
            <p>"They get out of bed each day to come to work to do everything they can to make a difference for those kids.</p>
        
            <p>"While our reputation of Oranga Tamariki may not give the public confidence, I am confident in our people."</p>
        
            <p>Te Kani told MPs even if OT was a "high performing agency enjoying the trust and confidence of New Zealanders", child abuse would still exist.</p>
        
            <p>The agency was making progress on a number of its standards and targets and would continue to do so despite damming reports, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot afford to knee-jerk when things go wrong, as they inevitably do in a high-risk operational environment.</p>
        
            <p>"Nor can we be scared when a report does not go in our favour. We need to hold the line and be steadfast in our strategic direction."</p>
        
            <p>Te Kani said he did not have the answers but his frontline staff - and communities - did and Oranga Tamariki was increasingly partnering with local people to care for children.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to devolve our resources and decision making powers to those who understand their communities best so they can prevent children from coming to our attention in the first place."</p>
        
            <p>Existing programmes were piloting this approach, where Crown and communities held dual accountability, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki's representatives were quizzed on other topics during yesterday's review, including staff turnover and the impact of the new government's public spending cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the coalition's plans to repeal 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act, Te Kani said it would not materially change his agency's operations.</p>
        
            <p>"Our core purpose remains the same, our approach to partnering and working with MƒÅori remains the same. That does not change."</p>
