            <p>A baby giraffe has been born at Wellington Zoo for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
        
            <p>The female calf was born at 6am on Wednesday to parents Zuri and Sunny, without veterinary intervention.</p>
        
            <p>Zoo chief executive Karen Fifield said the calf and mother were being kept separate from the other giraffes, while still being able to see and smell each other.</p>
        
            <p>Once the mother and calf had bonded, they would be reintroduced to the herd, including father Sunny and Zuri's niece, Zahara.</p>
        
            <p>The last time a giraffe was born at Wellington Zoo was 2004.</p>
        
            <p>Fifield said the newborn's arrival was long-awaited. Giraffe pregnancies lasted more than a year, and zoo staff set up CCTV in the giraffe habitat and consulted with experts around the world throughout.</p>
        
            <p>"We are grateful to both our zoo whƒÅnau and the Wellington community that have supported us throughout Zuri's pregnancy."</p>
        
            <p>Animal care manager Nic Dunn said: "Our animal care and veterinary team had been monitoring the footage every single hour for the past few weeks, making sure we would be ready for the birth."</p>
        
            <p>Established in 1906, Wellington Zoo is New Zealand's oldest conservation organisation, home to more than 500 native and exotic animals.</p>
        
            <p>The zoo said since the 1980s, habitat loss and poaching had resulted in giraffe populations declining from 155,000 to approximately 110,000 today.</p>
