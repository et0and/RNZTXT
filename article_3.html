        <h2>'Bigger than my head': Children find large, valuable chunk of kauri gum on Coromandel beach</h2>
        <p>
The siblings are undecided on what they will do with their bounty - but if they can sell it, they've definitely got plans. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Two children have discovered a chunk of kauri resin potentially worth thousands of dollars at a secret spot on a Coromandel beach.</p>
        
            <p>In the past the fossilised resin, a by-product from kauri trees, has been used for chewing gum and medicines but is now mainly decorative when polished. </p>
        
            <p>Previously, a 10kg lump of the gum sold for $16,000.
  
Callan McMillan, nine, told Checkpoint he and his sister Eva, seven, were wandering along a remote part of the coastline with their parents when they spotted what they thought was a rock.</p>
        
            <p>On closer inspection, Callan - a keen beachcomber - realised it was kauri gum. </p>
        
            <p>James McMillan - Callan's father - said it was not the family's first such find - they often turned up after heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>"We seem to find of kauri gum on the coastline so the kids got their eye in for collecting little bits, but they've never found one this big before."</p>
        
            <p>
The piece of kauri resin weighs just over 2kg.

            <p>Callan said the chunk was "bigger than his head" and weighed just over 2kg. The location is a "big, big secret", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The large discovery was potentially worth a fair amount, his father said. </p>
        
            <p>"If we can find the right buyer, it might be worth up to a dollar a gram. People might like to make jewellery out of it."</p>
        
            <p>So what would the children buy with the proceeds of their bounty?</p>
        
            <p>Callan: "I would buy an ant colony... but I might like to keep it for a bit, polish it then sell it."</p>
        
            <p>Eva says sell: "I want a golden retriever."</p>
        
            <p>"They'll have to work on sharing," said James.</p>
