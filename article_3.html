            <p>A former New Zealand soldier fighting for Ukraine in the war against Russia has been sentenced to 14 years in jail by a Russian court.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan O'Brien was sentenced in absentia for what the Russians said was fighting "as a mercenary" and participating in hostilities "for material reward".</p>
        
            <p>A report from the joint press service of the judicial system of Kursk, a Russian border territory, said O'Brien invaded the Kursk region as part of the Ukrainian armed forces.</p>
        
            <p>The Russian court also ordered "the amount of over 1.3 million rubles" to be confiscated from O'Brien.</p>
        
            <p>That converts to $20,690.</p>
        
            <p>The Russians say O'Brien's sentence may come into force if he is ever extradited or deported to Russia.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media, O'Brien responded: "Lol".</p>
        
            <p>"I've received my sentence lol. 14 years and docking me 12 and a half grand," he wrote on X.</p>
        
            <p>O'Brien maintains a regular presence on the site, formerly known as Twitter, where he mocks his Russian opponents and boasts of his unit: "We go where we are sent and we break Russian bodies and machines".</p>
        
            <p>O'Brien, who previously served with the New Zealand Army for six years working in logistics, has spoken previously about his experience in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ that he made the decision to help Ukraine after seeing a news report of a child covered in dust and blood after an explosion that happened at a residential complex.</p>
        
            <p>"Something in my head just clicked and I knew there was just so much more I could do to help."</p>
        
            <p>He said he walked out of his job at the time in New Zealand and went to Ukraine "on a whim" in March 2022.</p>
        
            <p>In February, he described the Russian forces as "meat waves".</p>
        
            <p>"There's no other way to describe it," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Wave after wave of human meat being thrown at our defensive positions, in case our positions get exhausted of their ammo supply."</p>
        
            <p>Initially signing up with the Ukrainian 131st Separate Recon Battalion, O'Brien is now part of a small first-person-view drone team.</p>
        
            <p>"Our job is to smash the enemy position," he told The Spinoff in September.</p>
        
            <p>He also told the outlet he had split from his partner in New Zealand and planned to stay in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't believe I'm suffering from any post-traumatic stress or something like that," he told RNZ earlier this year, noting it's been "a long time dealing with the constant fear of death".</p>
        
            <p>"It's changed all of us. I don't know if I'll see the true effects until after the war," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He has an inkling of what that future might hold.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm telling you right now though, the whirring of drones in the air is probably gonna send shivers down my spine in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if it's just some kid flying [one] at the park, I'm probably gonna run for the nearest tree ... You hear it so much out here - and the follow-up from that noise is artillery."</p>
