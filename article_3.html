        <h2>Trump says he wants to debate Harris</h2>
        <p>
The vice president has taken a slight lead over Donald Trump, according to a first poll, after securing her party's nomination.

            <p>Donald Trump has indicated he's ready to engage in a debate with Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election, as the presumptive Democratic nominee kicks off her campaign in earnest with a rally in the battleground state of Wisconsin.</p>
        
            <p>The vice-president has secured the broad support of her party to replace President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket.</p>
        
            <p>In his most extensive comments since Biden dropped out of the race, Trump said he would be willing to debate Harris "more than once".</p>
        
            <p>"I think debating is important for a presidential race. You sort of have an obligation to debate," he told reporters in a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, local time.</p>
        
            <p>The Republican presidential candidate stopped short of committing to the next scheduled debate, which was due to be hosted by ABC News America in September.</p>
        
            <p>He had agreed to take part in a second debate with Biden before the president dropped out of the race. But today he expressed that he was "not thrilled" with ABC, having previously suggested the debate should be moved to Fox News.</p>
        
            <p>Harris's first rally since launching her campaign for the White House perhaps sets the stage for how the vice-president would approach a debate with her Republican opponent.</p>
        
            <p>The speech to an energetic crowd in Milwaukee followed the strategy laid out at campaign HQ in Delaware on Monday, with Harris pitching her case against Trump as "a choice between freedom and chaos".</p>
        
            <p>"In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week," she told her supporters at West Allis Central High School.</p>
        
            <p>"In this election, we face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion, and the rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate? We each have the power to answer that question."</p>
        
            <p>She continued to highlight her background as a district attorney and attorney-general in contrast with Trump's chequered legal history, and sought to criticise his record in office.</p>
        
            <p>"America has tried these failed economic policies before. But we are not going back," she said, prompting a chant of "we're not going back".</p>
        
            <p>It came as the party rallied further behind Harris, with the Democrats' leaders in both chambers of Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, officially endorsing the vice-president.</p>
        
            <p>"She is ready. She is willing. She is able to energetically and emphatically lead America into the future," Jeffries said.</p>
        
            <p>The Harris campaign also announced that donations had reached a historic fundraising milestone, with more than US$100 million received since Sunday, the majority from first-time donors.</p>
        
            <p>The vice-president also appears to be enjoying a bump in public support, with a Reuters-Ipsos poll showing she has opened up a marginal two-point lead over Trump.</p>
        
            <p>In a survey conducted this week, respondents were asked who they would vote for if an election were held today - 44 percent said Harris, compared to 42 percent who said Trump. The difference is within the 3-percentage-point margin of error.</p>
        
            <p>It shows a slight improvement in Harris's support before Biden dropped out of the race.</p>
        
            <p>Although national polls indicate broad voter sentiment, when it comes to election day, it will be the swing states where the winner is decided.</p>
        
            <p>The president announced on Tuesday that he would address the nation on Wednesday evening, local time, to discuss his plans to see out the rest of his term.</p>
        
            <p>He is planning to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this week, who is in Washington DC to address Congress.</p>
        
            <p>The visit is expected to draw significant protests in the US capital.</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 members of Congress have signed an anonymous letter stating they will boycott the address.</p>
