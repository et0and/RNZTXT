        <h2>What lives in Antarctic sea ice?</h2>
        <p>
Scientists are uncovering the secrets of the tiny critters that live among the sea ice in Antarctica.

            <p>In some places, the underside of the sea ice looks like giant green clouds.</p>
        
            <p>These are the 'grass meadows' of Antarctica, made up of phytoplankton, or microalgae - the foundation of the complex food web that powers all life here.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Jacqui Stuart is the self-described champion of these 'little guys'. Sitting in a heated shipping container that's kitted out as a mini laboratory, she pulls arranges a sample under the microscope lens, bringing into focus a tiny floating shape on the attached monitor screen.</p>

            <p>It's a diatom. A long, thin type of microalgae that likes to group together to form a fan star array. But this is just one type of microalgae, amongst a whole community of them.</p>
        
            <p>"You can get them in all shapes and sizes. And I think that's, that's one of the things that I underestimated for a very long time: the amazingness of algae," says Jacqui.</p>
        
            <p>She's investigating these microalgal communities in the sloshy layer found just under the sea ice of McMurdo Sound. In this 'sub ice platelet layer', big ice crystals known as platelets provide a safe haven from the currents for the algae to live.</p>
        
            <p>Microalgae, or phytoplankton, can photosynthesise - just like plants on land do. When they take in energy from the sunlight and use it to make food, it's the first step in supporting some of the iconic Antarctic life that we think of: emperor and Ad√©lie penguins, Weddell seals, skua, orca, and humpback whales.</p>

            <p>In the warmer months, when the sea ice melts and there is an influx of nutrients, blooms of free-floating phytoplankton occur - massive patches of green that can be seen from space. It's the kick starter for the giant Antarctic buffet that attracts the world's largest whales to these waters each summer.</p>
        
            <p>But in the dark winter and the shorter days of the year, the microalgae associated with sea ice is a vital food source for a host of tiny critters and fish.</p>
        
            <p>That's why NIWA's Dr Natalie Robinson and her team have been camping out on the land-fast sea ice. Each day they travel to one of their study sites to collect samples for investigation back in the makeshift biology lab.</p>

            <p>Collecting 'platelet ice cores' is a difficult task, because it requires drilling down through the solid ice and then devising a way to recover the layers of these sloshing platelet crystals without mixing them all up.</p>
        
            <p>The system that Natalie and her team have engineered took many years to devise and test. Now, it's used extensively as they try to figure out how microalgal communities change under ice of different structures.</p>

            <p>Snow, solid ice, and that sloshy platelet ice can all occur in different thicknesses, which will impact the amount of light that gets through to the phytoplankton. This then impacts what the microalgal community looks like: some species like high light levels, others not so much.</p>
        
            <p>And different types of pf phytoplankton provide different nutrients to those that eat them, says Jacqui. So as the sea ice cycle changes, there are microalgal winners and losers, and she's keen to figure out this ebb and flow.</p>
