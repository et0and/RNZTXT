            <p>Three people are dead after what police have called a "horrific" crash between a truck and a car in Rangitikei.</p>
        
            <p>Central district road policing manager inspector Phil Ward said the collision happened between Putorino Road and Te Hou Hou Road in Hunterville at about 2pm on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A large number of emergency service staff responded to the scene, where the three people were found dead.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the truck received treatment at the hospital, Ward said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any fatal crash, but particularly one where multiple people have lost their lives, is confronting even for veteran emergency service personnel," Ward said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will also be making sure our staff at the scene have the support they need following this horrific event.</p>
        
            <p>"Crashes of this nature are confronting for everyone, including those involved, those first at the scene, and emergency responders."</p>

            <p>Police were in the early stages of the investigation to determine what caused this tragic event, Ward said.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit has conducted a scene examination, and the vehicles have since been towed from the scene.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 was due to reopen shortly.</p>
        
            <p>Police were also speaking with and arranging support for witnesses of the crash who were first on scene and swiftly alerted emergency services.</p>
