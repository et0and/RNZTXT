            <p>No new bottle shops will be allowed to open in some of Auckland's most vulnerable suburbs from Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The first phase of Auckland Council's Local Alcohol Policy (LAP) will be implemented from 16 September, with a two-year freeze for new off-licence applications and discretionary conditions on licensees.</p>
        
            <p>The two-year freeze applies in the CBD and 23 town centres in areas with the highest alcohol-related harm, called the priority overlay areas.</p>
        
            <p>Council principal specialist alcohol licensing Rob Abbott said the freeze also includes applications currently before the District Licensing Committee (DLC).</p>
        
            <p>"Every application that has not been determined by September 16, no matter when it was filed," Abbott said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're aware of only two completely new applications for off licences and when they come up, the DLC will have to... apply this policy."</p>
        
            <p>An off-licence applies to a premises where the licensee can sell alcohol for consumption elsewhere, and includes supermarkets, grocery stores and bottle stores.</p>
        
            <p>Abbott said the freeze only applies to new off-licence applications that have not traded as a bottle shop in the past six months.</p>
        
            <p>"So generally, we're talking about something that's either a shop that suddenly wants to be a bottle shop, or a new building that has been built and a bottle store is going to go in there, and there has never been anything there before in the previous six months."</p>
        
            <p>It would not include liquor shops that have been sold, but continued to operate under a new owner, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's someone new coming into the business, it's swapping hands, [and] for the purposes of the LAP - that's not a new off-licence premises that comes under the consideration of a temporary freeze."</p>

            <p>Abbott said new off-licence applications would have to meet a high threshold to be considered by the DLC.</p>
        
            <p>The DLC was bound by the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act to regard a LAP when making a decision.</p>
        
            <p>"The expectation from everyone I know is that it will be rigidly enforced."</p>
        
            <p>Abbott said the LAP had been through a thorough consultation process, and after being subjected to scrutiny from the Alcohol and Regulatory Licensing Authority, the temporary freeze was found to be reasonable.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're the DLC, you have to have some pretty strong grounds why you wouldn't follow what the council and the community want."</p>
        
            <p>
The second phase of the LAP, where all liquor shops have to stop trading at 9pm, will be implemented on 9 December.

            <p>On the other part of the policy that is implemented from Monday, Abbott said these were a range of discretionary conditions to be applied to all on-licences, off-licences, club licences and special licences.</p>
        
            <p>These included clear guidelines on host responsibility, prohibition of customers and patrons, and registering of alcohol-related incidents.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 23 suburbs in the priority overlays, 13 were in South Auckland: Hunters Corner, Māngere, Māngere East, Manukau, Manurewa, Ōtāhuhu, Ōtara, Papakura, Papatoetoe, Pukekohe, Takanini, Weymouth (Clendon) and Wiri.</p>
        
            <p>The other 10 suburbs are Avondale, Glen Eden, Glen Innes, Helensville and Parakai, Henderson, Mt Wellington, Oranga, Panmure, Point England, and Wellsford and Te Hana.</p>
