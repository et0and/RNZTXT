            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it is aware of reports that a New Zealand-Israeli citizen has died in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the government agency was currently seeking further details.</p>
        
            <p>Posts about the death were shared on social media; one was an image of a wreath dedicated to the mother of the person who died.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Jewish community stands together with you in this difficult time ... on the falling of your son," the tribute placed beside the wreath read.</p>
