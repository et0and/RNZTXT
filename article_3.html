            <p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard has announced she is pregnant, eight months after being released from a US prison for her role in her mother's murder.</p>
        
            <p>TV mini series The Act is based on the now 32-year-old American's life. She was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by Proxy, where her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, pretended Gypsy Rose had an array of medical problems as a child - resulting in a number of unnecessary surgeries.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholas Godejohn, who had met Gypsy Rose Blanchard online, murdered Dee Dee Blanchard on 10 June 2015. Gypsy Rose Blanchard had planned the murder and spent seven years in prison for her role.</p>
        
            <p>Now, Gypsy Rose Blanchard has announced she is 11 weeks pregnant. She was married to Ryan Anderson, whom she married whilst still in prison.</p>
        
            <p>But the pair have since split up, and the baby's father is Ken Urker, who she was once engaged to while in prison.</p>

            <p>In a YouTube video, Blanchard said rumours had been circulating for some time - and she confirmed she was pregnant.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy to announce that I am 11 weeks pregnant. Ken and I are expecting our very first child come January of 2025. We're both very excited, this was not planned at all, it was completely unexpected, but we're both very excited to take on this new journey of parenthood. I have already experienced the symptoms."</p>
        
            <p>Blanchard said in terms of morning sickness, she had been lucky to not experience it - but she had had a lot of cravings and fatigue.</p>
        
            <p>All the "drama" she had experienced on social media recently no longer mattered, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The drama on social media, the feud between creator and me and all that drama just all faded. It didn't matter anymore.</p>

            <p>"All that matters is making sure I'm healthy, the baby's healthy, my relationship with Ken is healthy and we are moving forward in a positive way."</p>
        
            <p>She said taking care and providing her baby with love and protection was her focus.</p>
        
            <p>"All of the things I wished I could have had when I was little.</p>
        
            <p>"All the things I wanted in a mother I want to give to this baby."</p>
        
            <p>She went on to say that both she and Urker came from broken homes and it was not something they wanted for their child.</p>
        
            <p>"I grew up without a father pretty much and he grew up in a family where his parents got divorced and I think we both agree neither one of us want our child to be in that kind of situation."</p>
        
            <p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard planned her mother, Clauddine "Dee Dee" Blanchard's murder in 2015. Her mother had subjected her to a lifetime of abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Gypsy Rose was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>She was released in December 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Anderson was Gypsy Rose Blanchard's husband from 2022 until this year.</p>
        
            <p>They got married while she was still in prison and he picked her up when she was released last year.</p>
        
            <p>In her own recently released reality show, Gypsy Rose: Life After Lockup, her ex-fiance Ken Urker is discussed - and there is mention of him wanting to talk to Blanchard now that she is out of prison.</p>
        
            <p>The pair rekindled their relationship after Blanchard and Anderson separated.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA), formerly Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSP), is "a mental illness in which a person acts as if an individual he or she is caring for has a physical or mental illness when the person is not really sick".</p>
        
            <p>"When someone has this mental illness, they might act as though their child or dependent has a medical condition that needs attention. However, the child or dependent person isn't sick. People with factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) lie about an illness in another person. This other person is usually someone in their care - often a child under the age of 6. In some cases, the dependent person can be another adult, disabled person or an elderly person.</p>
        
            <p>"Previously called Munchausen syndrome by Proxy, factitious disorder imposed on another is one type of factitious disorder. Another type of factitious disorder involves making up false medical conditions about yourself. Factitious disorders are considered mental illnesses because they're associated with severe emotional difficulties."</p>
        
            <p>Cleveland Clinic said the condition can be dangerous and lead to unnecessary medical tests and procedures with health professionals try to work out what is wrong with the person who claimed to be sick.</p>
        
            <p>When a child is involved, the Cleveland Clinic said it is considered a form of child abuse.</p>
