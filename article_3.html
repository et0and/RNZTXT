            <p>Many homes and businesses in Northland are without power after a Transpower tower fell near Kumeū about 11am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The crisis arose after Northpower lost a major high voltage line into the substation at Maungatapere, a major feed from the grid, which caused much of the region to lose its supply.</p>
        
            <p>A Transpower service provider is on site to assess the damage and determine an expected time when power could be restored.</p>
        
            <p>While no time has been announced yet, some areas are now running on backup generator, however, Transpower says power needs to be conserved until normal supply is up and running.</p>
        
            <p>Follow updates on RNZ's blog</p>
        
            <p>By mid-afternoon Transpower said power had been partially restored and some people have already been reconnected. It was not clear how many people this affected.</p>
        
            <p>"Transpower is restoring as much capacity as possible through its lower capacity 110 kV network. However, until one of the larger 220 kV circuits is returned to service there will be insufficient electricity available to fully power the region," the national grid operator said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower has been able to reconfigure the power system to provide power including from local sources, such as the geothermal generation at Ngāwhā.</p>
        
            <p>A Grid Emergency Notice lasting till noon tomorrow as an interim period.</p>
        
            <p>"A return to service time for the impacted circuits has not been confirmed."</p>
        
            <p>The tower fell while a second transmission circuit supplying these areas was out of service for scheduled maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower is also assessing how long it will take to return that circuit to service.</p>
        
            <p>More details will be provided on Transpower's website and Facebook page. Consumers should also check the websites of their retailers and local lines companies for up-to-date outage information.</p>

            <p>Transpower says its too early to say.</p>
        
            <p>However, workers were at the site at the time the tower fell.</p>
        
            <p>The area where the tower fell has now been made safe.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a full investigation, but the priority was restoring power to the region.</p>
