            <p>More than 400 jobs could go as the Ministry for Primary Industries and the Ministry of Health look to cut their budgets.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries is proposing cutting around 231 staff as part of a cost-cutting initiative.</p>
        
            <p>Like many government departments, MPI is trying to cut 7.5 percent of its budget - and told staff in an email on Thursday it wanted to reduce staff numbers by an estimated 9 percent, including vacancies but also disestablishing roles.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry is looking to reduce a total of 384 roles of which 40 percent are vacant.</p>
        
            <p>Director-general Ray Smith told staff that department heads would meet with staff across the business on Thursday to discuss the proposals to improve efficiency.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said the organisation had grown by more than 1100 people in the last five years, in areas like biosecurity, policy, trade and regulatory systems - but greater efficiency was needed.</p>
        
            <p>"With programmes now bedding down across the organisation and in the current fiscal environment, we need to make some efficiencies and change the way we operate while still delivering the excellent service and support our sectors require and expect."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would not propose any reductions to frontline services and statutory roles, including veterinarians, animal welfare, fishery and food compliance officers, or our biosecurity teams at the border.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we are proposing changes to roles and reporting lines in other areas of MPI, including the disestablishment of some positions."</p>
        
            <p>Consultation runs from Thursday to 9 April, with final decisions expected by mid-May.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, almost 200 jobs could go from the Ministry of Health.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were told about a proposal for organisational change at a meeting on Thursday as the ministry responded to the government's direction to cut 6.5 percent from its budget.</p>
        
            <p>The director of the ministry's Transformation Management Office, Geoff Short, said just over a quarter of jobs or 180 roles could go.</p>
        
            <p>Some positions would be disestablished and some existing vacancies would not be filled, he said.</p>
        
            <p>There had already been a hiring freeze but that had not made enough savings.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were told they would receive more details on the planned changes on 5 April, and a three week consultation period would follow.</p>
        
            <p>It was a difficult and unsettling time for staff, Short said.</p>
        
            <p>
Nicola Willis says she is "sure that there will be other job opportunities" for those affected.

            <p>Minister for the Public Service Nicola Willis said on Thursday she could not yet say how many public servants would lose their jobs overall.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have that number yet. I expect that there will be people who will lose their jobs as we prioritise funding for frontline services."</p>
        
            <p>She said her heart went out to people who could be made redundant, but said public agencies had known for some time their back office staffing levels were unsustainable.</p>
        
            <p>"These are skilled, capable people and I am sure that there will be other job opportunities."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was a "very tough" day for people whose jobs were affected.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the government needed to "right size" the public service.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Labour government had added 16,000 extra public servants and increased government spending by 84 percent during its time in power.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the reality, we have to get government spending under control."</p>
        
            <p>Agencies needed to "stop doing dumb stuff" and cull the programmes that were not working, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>They had also been told to stop spending on consultants and make their back offices as efficient as possible.</p>
        
            <p>The full scale of the government's public service cuts will be revealed in May's Budget.</p>
