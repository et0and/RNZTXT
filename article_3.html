            <p>Police say there's "no doubt" two women were indecently assaulted in a Wellington restaurant by Vietnamese officials visiting New Zealand on business.</p>
        
            <p>But as the men had left New Zealand, officers were unable to lay charges.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff reported a former staff member at Saigon on Willis, who was 19 at the time of the official's visit, recalled the men "pulling us into their laps, pinning us against the wall".</p>
        
            <p>Criminal investigations manager for the Wellington District Detective Inspector John Van Den Heuvel said they had received two complaints regarding this matter in March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation was carried out, including reviewing CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Police established who our suspects were and that they were Vietnamese officials, visiting on official business."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Vietnamese Embassy had made every effort to assist them with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The embassy has not responded to RNZ's request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Van Den Heuvel said as the men had since left New Zealand, and there was currently no extradition treaty with Vietnam, it meant the police were unable to lay charges.</p>
        
            <p>However, police had written a letter, sent via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade - who shared their concerns - to the Vietnamese Ambassador, "outlining what had taken place and expressing New Zealand Police's deep concern over this behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>"Police have no doubt these two women were indecently assaulted by two men while working and had these men still been in New Zealand we would have pursued criminal charges," Van Den Heuvel said.</p>
        
            <p>Police had updated the victims regularly with their progress, as well as offering Victim Support to ensure they had the appropriate support in place.</p>
        
            <p>"While we know this is not the outcome they would have hoped for, police have exhausted all plausible investigative avenues."</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the events by reporters at Parliament, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he learned about the incident on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>He said he understood the men were part of an independent delegation which met with New Zealand police at the police training college - it wasn't associated with the Vietnamese prime minister's visit.</p>
        
            <p>It would be unlikely for the police to extradite the men even if they had that ability, but New Zealand police officers were today meeting with their counterparts in Vietnam to understand what actions would be taken there.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the minister had been briefed on it, but would not be commenting as it was a police matter.</p>
        
            <p>The Vietnamese Embassy and Saigon on Willis have both been approached for comment.</p>
