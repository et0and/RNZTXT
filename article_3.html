            <p>A member of the public has momentarily derailed a Parliamentary select committee with an anti-trans rant and verbal abuse of an MP.</p>
        
            <p>The Justice Select Committee was hearing feedback on a bill which would give remand prisoners more access to rehab programmes.</p>
        
            <p>It includes a provision giving transgender and intersex prisoners the right to choose the sex of the prison officer searching them.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier had earlier told MPs it would preserve the dignity of gender-diverse prisoners.</p>
        
            <p>One of the submitters - introduced as Rex Landy from a group called "TAW" - voiced her strong opposition before attacking Labour's Ginny Andersen.</p>
        
            <p>"Security breaches happen all the time, and no I'm not here to answer questions from you - you get men out of women's jail and stop this bill. It's a load of rubbish and as for you Ginny you're a f****** disgrace."</p>
        
            <p>MPs on the committee groaned at that, before the chair - National's MP for Rangitata James Meager - stopped the submission.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for your time, we'll end that there - sorry about that Ginny," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's alright," she replied.</p>
        
            <p>Landy has previously appeared at select committees to oppose the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Relationships Registration bill, and the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation bill. Both times she clashed with MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Nicknaming herself the "TERF Jester" on YouTube, Landy has been banned from X for violating its hateful conduct rule.</p>
        
            <p>In a later statement, Andersen said select committees were a place for respectful and robust discussions on matters before Parliament and any disorderly behaviour during a committee was "totally unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>"We still have some way to go to before the Rainbow community can live free from the fear of violence and be able to access to the support needed. Using a select committee submission to attack trans people is something I will not tolerate. Trans rights are human rights."</p>
        
            <p>It follows Labour MP and former Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson's valedictory speech the night before, in which he identified concerns about rising bigotry targeted towards trans people.</p>
        
            <p>"I am particularly concerned at the way our trans community have been the subject of increasing hatred, bigotry and lies as a result of the ongoing culture wars," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw this especially in the Sports portfolio. People with absolutely no care for women's sport suddenly became warriors for safety in pursuit of an imagined enemy.</p>
        
            <p>"The othering of trans people is despicable. We have to support people to live the lives that they want to live and to show them some respect."</p>
