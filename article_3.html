            <p>The Solomon Islands Minister of Home Affairs is considering fraud charges against the Samoan beauty pageant judge who is at the centre of controversy following the crowning of the 2025 Miss Pacific Islands in Honiara.</p>
        
            <p>Leiataualesa Jerry Brunt was prevented from boarding his flight back to Apia after the Solomon Islands government intervened, saying it had issued a "stop notice" against all four judges of the Miss South Pacific Pageant after receiving serious allegations of "fraudulent activities" on the final night of the event.</p>
        
            <p>The stop order prevented Leiataualesa and Ni-Vanuatu judge Jane Canas from leaving the country; two of the other judges had already left by the time the notice was issued.</p>
        
            <p>Leiataualesa, who was the head judge at the pageant, has denied any wrongdoing and announced that he would be pursuing legal action against Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with RNZ Pacific, he said the "speculation and gossip" regarding rigging the outcomes was unfounded and that he would work with his legal team on possible action for unlawful detention.</p>
        
            <p>"I was not technically detained, but my freedom to leave was restricted," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Solomon Islands Home Affairs Minister Junior Isikeli Vave told RNZ Pacific that he initially considered letting the matter go, but as more allegations surfaced, he decided to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>"I witnessed everything happening that night," he said, adding that "the crowd could see; their reaction indicated that something was amiss."</p>

            <p>He said after the results were announced, in which Miss Samoa Litara Ieremia Allan was crowned the winner, everyone got up and left in disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>He said that the next morning, on 9 February, there were numerous issues surfacing online.</p>
        
            <p>"I discovered that the votes had been tampered with," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, on Monday, 10 February, the Miss Pacific Islands Pageant director and committee met with the Solomon Islands Pageant committee to recount the votes, and found that Miss Samoa had won by 12 points, ahead of Miss Tonga, that were not accounted for the previous night.</p>
        
            <p>Vave said that a spreadsheet used by the scrutineers recorded the votes, indicating that Miss Samoa had points deducted.</p>
        
            <p>He said that he had spoken with the Solomon Islands chief legal advisor about providing physical evidence for the case to press charges against Leiataualesa.</p>
        
            <p>"I have had that conversation with our Attorney-General; verbal evidence is more than adequate," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Samoan government also reached out, as he is their citizen, and I understand their concern.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we submit our report, they will comprehend and respect our decisions as well.</p>
        
            <p>He said it is not a bilateral issue between the two nations.</p>
        
            <p>"It pertains to the fact that this individual from Samoa potentially committed serious actions in the Solomon Islands."</p>
        
            <p>He also acknowledged that he "was wrong for posting on social media" about the events.</p>
        
            <p>"But I wanted to inform people of my perspective. There were many assumptions being made."</p>
        
            <p>Vave added that he hopes there would be neutral judges who are not from the Pacific in future events.</p>
