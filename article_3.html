            <p>A curious great white shark has been captured eyeballing a camera set up to record footage of fish species in Fiordland and snapping at a bait pot.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists working on the project were amazed by the rare on-camera appearance, as part of a survey in Tamatea Dusky Sound last month.</p>
        
            <p>Sea Through Science researcher Adam Smith was the first to spot the shark while working on the Department of Conservation (DOC) contract.</p>
        
            <p>"While reviewing the videos, I saw a mature male white pointer shark turn up to the [camera] - it was quite a shock," he said. "We had been laughing about how cool it would be to see something like that. It's very rare to get such great footage."</p>
        
            <p>The great white mouthed the bait pot a couple of times before slowly swimming away.</p>

            <p>The team collected more than 200 hours of footage from two GoPro cameras that recorded many other shark species, as well as hāpuku, blue cod and octopus.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said great white sharks were vulnerable to overfishing and protected under the Wildlife and Fisheries Acts.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to see these majestic creatures in their natural environment and to see how curious they are," he said. "We've only seen a white shark once before during our surveys, at the Kermadec Islands, the other end of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>DOC senior ranger Richard Kinsey said the survey allowed researchers to compare fish inside and outside of two of Fiordland's 10 marine reserves and the health of the recreational fishery.</p>
        
            <p>"This information will also be helpful for assessing whether Fiordland's new fishing regulations benefit fish stocks in the coming years."</p>
        
            <p>DOC encouraged the public to report details of any sightings, captures or strandings of great white sharks to 0800 DOC HOT.</p>
