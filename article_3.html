            <p>A Whanganui High School teacher who groomed two students can now be named as Jason Shepherd.</p>
        
            <p>Shepherd was sentenced to 10.5 month's home detention in October 2024 after pleading guilty to charges of grooming for sexual conduct with a young person and meeting following grooming.</p>
        
            <p>His offending took place over a four years while he worked as a secondary school teacher.</p>
        
            <p>The victims were aged 12 and 13 when they first met Shepherd.</p>
        
            <p>"The strength and bravery from these victims who came forward to assist in the prosecution of this offender cannot be overstated," Detective Sergeant Carey Priest said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police worked closely with the victims of this offending, their families, and the Teaching Council to ensure that Shepherd was held to account.</p>
        
            <p>"We know it can be incredibly difficult and at times distressing to report or talk about incidents of this nature, but we would like to reassure any victims of sexual offending that we take these matters seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"Police has a number of officers and detectives dedicated to these cases, and we will ensure you have a safe space to report offending in confidence."</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
