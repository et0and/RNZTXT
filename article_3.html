            <p>There has been another shark sighting this summer, this time at Omaha Beach, which was packed with beachgoers.</p>
        
            <p>The bronze whaler was spotted at the popular beach, about an hour's drive from the Auckland CBD, at about 4.40pm.</p>
        
            <p>One of the life guards who spotted the bronze whaler called it in and a Westpac helicopter which was in the area also confirmed that the shark was in the water.</p>
        
            <p>St John said the helicopter was in the area responding to a medical event on the beach, which was not water related or shark related.</p>
        
            <p>Holidaymakers pressed pause on their swimming plans for 30 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Lifesaving NZ had recorded more than 40 first hand sightings of sharks across two regions in the past fortnight.</p>
        
            <p>And while lifeguards were used to sharing the water with sharks and most of those seen were not big enough to cause alarm, Surf Lifesaving eastern manager Chaz Gibbons-Campbell said, he warned people to be cautious.</p>
        
            <p>A teenager was killed in a shark attack late in December off South Australia's coast.</p>
        
            <p>And several shark attacks had also already been reported in New Zealand waters this summer, including on the Wairarapa coast and in knee-deep water in a Southland estuary.</p>
