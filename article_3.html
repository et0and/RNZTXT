        <h2>'Such a load of s***' - Speed limits test mayor's patience</h2>
        <p>
More hurdles have appeared for Tasman District Council as it continues to try and lower speed limits after being forced to restart the process by the government.

            <p>Additional hurdles have appeared for Tasman District Council as it continues to try and lower speed limits after being forced to restart the process by the government.</p>
        
            <p>The unforeseen challenges have raised frustration among councillors, even leading the mayor to a swearing outburst during a Wednesday meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The council is currently in the process of preparing to re-consult residents on lowering several speed limits across Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>A suite of new speed limits for the district - which were widely supported by residents, approved by the council, and adopted by the New Zealand Transport Agency - were invalidated by the government's new rule for setting speed limits.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the new consultation that would allow speed limit changes to be implemented, the council must include a cost benefit disclosure statement on what the changes are expected to cost.</p>
        
            <p>These statements are estimated using a tool developed by NZTA, however "glitches" have been discovered in the tool.</p>
        
            <p>The council's senior transportation planning advisor Bill Rice told elected members that the glitches have added at least a couple days' work to finalising the consultation document for the public, but warned that it may take longer to fix.</p>
        
            <p>"That may also delay the consultation timing as well, depending on how long it takes us to go through that process," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, to allow time for re-consultation to take place and to avoid having 30km/h variable speed limits outside schools in high-speed zones, speed limits reductions outside of rural schools and on high-risk roads have been pushed back from January 2025 until the third quarter of that year.</p>
        
            <p>Elected members' patience was wearing thin with the uncontrollable and continued delays to the speed limit reductions that have been long-awaited by many communities around Tasman.</p>

            <p>Mayor Tim King said the entire process seemed "entirely stupid" and was "such a load of s***".</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Jo Ellis said it was embarrassing to have to delay implementing lower speeds around schools and suggested the situation wouldn't help get young people engaged in council activities.</p>
        
            <p>"We talk about wanting to have young people engaged in government and local issues, and here is a whole group of children who will be throwing their hands in the air."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Stuart Bryant said the "extremely frustrating" process had turned into a "right 'mare", while councillor Christeen Mackenzie said the additional delays and costs were "appalling".</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the region's transport committee agreed to write to Simeon Brown, the Minister of both Transport and Local Government, requesting a waiver so Tasman can implement its already-agreed-to speed limits.</p>
        
            <p>However, staff and elected members "don't hold a great deal of hope that he will".</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tim King facetiously suggested changing the speed signs before the formal process was complete as a "pragmatic way forward".</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged that the speed limits wouldn't be legally enforceable by police but would instead be "informational" and send a signal to motorists.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not illegal to put up a sign, is it? We're not breaking any law by having a sign that's effectively just information-only and it just coincidentally happens to be in a similar place to the one we're consulting on?"</p>
        
            <p>
Councillor Jo Ellis thought the uncontrolled delays were embarrassing and wouldn't help get children engaged in local issues.

            <p>Council staff advised against the suggestion, with strategic policy manager Dwayne Fletcher saying that road signs were governed by "a whole bunch of amazing regulations".</p>
        
            <p>"Without doing a bit of further digging, we couldn't give you the specific thing that we'd be contravening, but I'm pretty confident that we would be breaking some rule somewhere."</p>
        
            <p>"Worth a shot," King replied.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on high-risk rural roads and base speed limits outside rural schools is due to begin in mid-January 2025 and will run through until the end of February.</p>
