Morning meditation can help us learn to start the day with positivity and fend off worry, says Julia Rucklidge, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Canterbury.

            <p>Until a couple of years ago, Julia Rucklidge assumed her own 'mile-a-minute' brain would never be capable of meditation.</p>
        
            <p>But tasked with teaching about the science of wellbeing, the University of Canterbury psychology professor - and director of the university's Te Puna Toiora/ Mental Health and Nutrition Research Lab - realised she had to give it a go.</p>
        
            <p>Now, every morning before her cold-water shower, Rucklidge starts up her Insight Timer app for a 10-minute session.</p>
        
            <p>She highly recommends everyone try out morning meditation with a free app.</p>
        
            <p>"You're going to have a more calm day, you're going to start on a good note and that's going to influence your experience and the interactions that you have with other people."</p>
        
            <p>Meditation in the morning not only helps put a positive spin on your day, it's been shown to regulate stress and blood pressure levels, Rucklidge tells RNZ's On The Air.</p>
        
            <p>It is also a way to "reclaim the real estate" of our own minds.</p>
        
            <p>"We can spend so much time ruminating about how we've messed up in our past or worrying about how things are going to go in the future."</p>
        
            <p>While learning how to meditate, Rucklidge discovered that part of the process is accepting that your mind will inevitably keep wandering off to produce thoughts.</p>
        
            <p>To bring it back to the present, some people internally repeat a mantra, she says, but many simply focus on observing and slowing down the flow of their breath.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Rucklidge recommends influential medical-celebrity Dr Andrew Weil's 4-7-8 breathing technique.</p>
        
            <p>And with the health benefits of cold water treatments now backed up by science, students in Rucklidge's 200-level Science and Practice of Wellbeing course endured sitting in 8C ice baths.</p>
        
            <p>While many were very scared in advance, she says, they all reported benefits from pushing through the initial panic.</p>

            <p>It's really hard for your mind to be chaotic when the strong sensations of cold water have you focused on the present moment, Rucklidge says.</p>
        
            <p>"It gives you a little space so that you can then better reflect on what's really bugging you, and become able to work through that more easily."</p>

Starting the day calm and with space to think can help make the rest of the day better, Julia Rucklidge says.

            <p>As we now know, being around nature is good for our health, Rucklidge says, so her PSYC214 students also learned to tend the soil in community gardens.</p>
        
            <p>While bush bathing - the Japanese-inspired practice of sitting or lying on the forest floor - is a great idea when available, just getting in your own garden will boost wellbeing, Rucklidge says.</p>
        
            <p>And because simply being in the presence of "greenery" has mood benefits, she says we're wise to seek it out as often as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"If you can even look after a plant then I'd recommend you start there," Rucklidge says.</p>
