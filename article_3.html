        <h2>The cocktail everyone's drinking at the US Open - and how to make one</h2>
        <p>
On a muggy New York evening spent on sticky stadium seats, you're going to want something refreshing.

            <p>Who won the US Open this year?</p>
        
            <p>Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner might have hoisted the trophy following the women's and men's singles finals. However, the star of one of the biggest tournaments in tennis was arguably the event's signature drink, the Honey Deuce cocktail.</p>
        
            <p>And I can imagine why. A muggy New York summer evening sitting on a sticky stadium seat watching even sweatier athletes slog it out on the court. You're going to want something to remedy that.</p>
        
            <p>The medicine: a refreshing Honey Deuce Cocktail or two, or five.</p>
        
            <p>40 ml vodka</p>
        
            <p>90 ml lemonade (as in the American old fashioned kind not Sprite)</p>
        
            <p>10 ml raspberry liquor</p>
        
            <p>3 honeydew melon balls that look like itsy, bitsy tennis balls.</p>
        
            <p>No. The cocktail was created in 2007 when restaurateur Nick Mautone was inspired by a honeydew melon at a farmer's market, according to CNN. At the time, Mautone was an ambassador for Grey Goose, the US Opens alcohol sponsor.</p>

            <p>Close to half a million Honey Deuce cocktails (deuce is a tennis term used when competitors are tied at 40/40) were sold during the tournament in 2023. At about $23 each, the Honey Deuce netted about $10 million, which more than pays for the multi million winner paychecks, CNN pointed out.</p>
        
            <p>This year, record crowds - more than a million fans - descended on the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. So, we can only assume that more Honey Deuces were sold in 2024,</p>

            <p>It doesn't hurt that every self-respecting celebrity, including Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, made sure they were courtside with a Honey Deuce in hand and US Open cap on head (the tournament normally draws celebs, but this year seemed a little extra).</p>
        
            <p>A lot seemed a little extra.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament also debuted a $100 chicken nugget offering (equivalent to $162 New Zealand dollars). The nuggets, from the hard-to-get-a-table-fried-chicken-joint Coqodaq, came with Petrossian caviar and a dollop of crème fraîche. And you could only purchase the 24 Karat Edition chicken nuggets if you had a club level ticket, which cost about US$1,000.</p>
        
            <p>If you're a normal person and don't have raspberry liquor in your cabinet at home, do not be defeated.</p>
        
            <p>Evander Manac, bartender at Queens Rooftop & Wineshop in Auckland's CBD, came up with a muddled raspberry jam and some water to replace the liquor. Instead of old fashioned lemonade, he used Sprite and cut down the sweetness with a squeeze of lemon juice. "It's very refreshing and simple. I can see why it is so popular," he said.</p>

            <p>40 ml vodka</p>
        
            <p>50 ml sprite</p>
        
            <p>20 ml lemon juice</p>
        
            <p>Teaspoon of raspberry jam muddled with water and strained</p>

            <p>Last year, Grey Goose also sponsored the event and served up the Love One cocktail, a version of the Honey Deuce. The drink contained vodka, tart strawberry liquor, old fashioned lemonade, a squeeze of lemon and lime juice, and topped with heart-shaped strawberry pieces.</p>
        
            <p>Let's hope the Honey Deuce makes an appearance. After all, January is honeydew melon season in New Zealand.</p>
