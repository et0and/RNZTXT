            <p>Bolton's family said she was born in England but grew up in Diamond Harbour and Heathcote Valley. She attended Christchurch's Rangi Ruru Girls' High School.</p>
        
            <p>Bolton had been working as a ski guide in Niseko since November, having previously worked on ski fields in Canada, Tekapo and Wanaka.</p>
        
            <p>The family said she had an "adventurous spirit and love for skiing and the outdoors".</p>
        
            <p>"Our family would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of her fellow colleague and friend whose life was also tragically lost," they said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Mt Yotei is in the Hokkaido region, which is a popular destination for skiers and snowboarders.</p>
