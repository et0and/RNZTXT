            <p>The Fiji men's sevens team's reign as Olympic champions is over - beaten 28-7 by France in the gold medal match at Stade de France this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji scored first and early, but that was the last time they crossed the tryline.</p>
        
            <p>The French scored four tries, including a double to Antoine Dupont - his second coming with time up on the clock.</p>
        
            <p>In Fiji's semifinal against Australia earlier this morning, it was 7 - 7 at halftime before Fij pulled away in the second half to win 31 - 7.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa earlier claimed the bronze medal over Australia, 26-19.</p>
