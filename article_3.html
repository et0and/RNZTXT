        <h2>What kai was flavour of the week at Te Matatini?</h2>
        <p>
While aihi kirīmi, pāua, and hāngī have sold like the clappers at this year's Te Matatini, other stalls not so much.

            <p>While aihi kirīmi, pāua, and hāngī have sold like the clappers at this year's Te Matatini, other stalls not so much.</p>
        
            <p>Tek'z Tuka food truck has been the earliest food stall to shut shop early every day.</p>
        
            <p>They have opened at 8:30am every day and sold out by 2pm, but on 1 March - the finals day - they were shut just after midday.</p>
        
            <p>The owner Frances Richardson said they have gone big on food supply to accommodate for the thousands that headed to the Bowl of Brooklands. On the last day, they quadrupled the stock.</p>
        
            <p>"We've over compensated, but we sold out anyway so we're happy as we've got nothing left," she said.</p>
        
            <p>On a regular day they would sell about 60 to 80 burgers. Over the last five days they have sold over 1600 cream pāua smash burgers alongside seafood chowder and rēwana.</p>
        
            <p>"It's out the gate how much we've sold. We're shocked because we thought we would give it a go, and the number we did target; we blew that out of the water."</p>
        
            <p>
Ever heard of a cream pauā smash burger with cheese? Well, the demand for it was next level.

            <p>All up, they have made over $50,000.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband Simon and daughter Karlee are also very chuffed with how well business went, and have got to watch the last of performances.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbouring food truck Island Style Kitchen has also been a crowd pleaser and closed their kitchen early this week.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, the Pātea Hāngī shop has also been a hit.</p>
        
            <p>Kushette Jelley said her and her partner Leroy Thompson have had sleepless nights to prepare thousands of food items.</p>
        
            <p>They pre-made 5000 hāngi, and 500 pies (at the beginning of each day), but after day one they quickly learnt to make double the amount of boil up and pāua pies.</p>
        
            <p>"We tried to get a day ahead," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Both Jelley and Thompson recently moved from Rotorua to Pātea, and with Thompson's cheffing experience and the pairs' manaakitanga, they opened their shop to give people a slither of what marae kai is like.</p>

            <p>"What we wanted to do was bring the marae to the people, especially people who don't get a chance to go to a marae," Jelley said.</p>
        
            <p>"So in Pātea, we're on State Highway 3, so we actually get a lot of tourists, and actually just normal Kiwis who actually have never tried a hāngī."</p>
        
            <p>Their whānau flew in from Australia and Pōneke to help out. The kaupapa that drove them at Te Matatini was 'I Am Hope'.</p>
        
            <p>"That's something that we got on board on that waka as well, which is close to Leroy's heart."</p>
        
            <p>"There's too much of that, especially in Pātea it has been heart-breaking within the last year sadly. It hits home, well, it hits everyone doesn't it?"</p>
        
            <p>A percentage of what they earn at the festival will go towards the I Am Hope campaign with an aim to spread the word to kura.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Sunway Food stall selling Asian fast food items such as bao buns and dumplings has not hit the mark.</p>
        
            <p>Kaimahi Eddie Liu said his boss is grumpier than usual.</p>
        
            <p>"My boss was here last time, and he keeps scratching his head, because the business is not going very easy [compared to] last time," Liu said.</p>
        
            <p>Looking back to previous events, Sunway Food was banking $15,000 per day, he said. This time round they are not even making half that amount.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a struggle for Liu's boss with the lack of profits, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely not better than last time, we can still handle it."</p>

            <p>The Whangārei based store have been to multiple events like Rhythm and Vines and cultural festivals - including Te Matatini, and over the last few years, they have not needed to increase their event sales prices.</p>
        
            <p>Their stall position also is not an issue unlike previously being put towards the back of other events.</p>
        
            <p>Although they cannot fathom why sales have been so low at Te Matatini o Te Kāhui Maunga, Liu puts it down to the state of the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"People don't like spending money at the moment, economy issues I guess?"</p>
        
            <p>At the end of each day, they have enough food for every worker to take home.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hungry, so I will eat it all, but hopefully it's better next time."</p>
        
            <p>Liu said overall, the vibe has been great.</p>
