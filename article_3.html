            <p>One person is dead and another in hospital following a "disorder incident" in Auckland's Mt Albert on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to He Ana Way around 1.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Upon arrival, two people were located with injuries ranging from serious to critical," Detective Senior Sergeant Lisa Anderson said. "Sadly, despite efforts from emergency services, a male died at the scene."</p>
        
            <p>The second person was taken to hospital with serious, but not life-threatening injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will have a visible presence in Mt Albert this afternoon, and likely tomorrow, as our investigation progresses," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"While at this stage, no arrests have been made, we do not believe there is a wider risk to the public in relation to this incident. It is understood those involved were known to each other."</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter said the police appeared to be focusing on an alley behind a Kainga Ora development.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be speaking to those in the area who witnessed what has occurred and we encourage anyone else with information that may assist to please contact police as soon as possible," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>Information can be provided via 105, citing file number 240226/2541, or anonymously to Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
