            <p>Passengers have been unloaded from a Qantas flight that suffered an engine fault ahead of its departure from Auckland Airport this on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>A Qantas spokesperson said they understand passengers from flight QF148 bound for Sydney would be put up in accommodation while engineers inspected the plane for any damage.</p>
        
            <p>They said no one was hurt in the incident but passengers may have heard a loud bang.</p>
        
            <p>People took to social media to report other flights being delayed as crews swept the runway clear of debris.</p>
        
            <p>The airport said in a statement, "A departing international aircraft reported an issue during takeoff roll just after 7.30pm tonight and left the runway shortly afterwards, returning safely to the departure gate.</p>
        
            <p>"The safety of travellers is always Auckland Airport's top priority and we quickly carried out a routine inspection of the airfield, meaning the runway needed to close for a short time."</p>
        
            <p>I'm stuck on a plane at one of the gates, all we've heard so far is that they're sweeping debris off the runway</p>
        
            <p>After discovering debris on the runway, the airport dispatched two sweeper trucks to clear it.</p>
        
            <p>The short closure of the runway created a number of flight delays and some diversions for arriving flights, the airport said.</p>
        
            <p>Nine flight departures were delayed, three aircraft diverted and three held in a holding pattern.</p>
        
            <p>The runway had since safely reopened after being closed for about an hour.</p>
        
            <p>An airport spokesperson said there would be an investigation into the incident.</p>
