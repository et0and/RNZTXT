            <p>The woman who died in a tragic crash in Martinborough has been named as a UK resident who had previously lived in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>One person died and three others were seriously injured when a car and a four-seater bike collided on Puruatanga Road on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The woman who died in the crash was first named by Stuff as Alison Korny.</p>
        
            <p>Korny's LinkedIn lists her as working for the Royal Bank of Scotland as an operations support financial analyst.</p>
        
            <p>She had previously worked for the National Bank between 1995 and 2002.</p>
        
            <p>A friend who had posted following the news of Korny's death said the pair went back to when she had worked for the National Bank.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts go out to your family and friends especially your NZ family," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a woman understood to be Korny's sister had posted a picture of the pair on social media, which several people had replied to with condolences.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the weekend, I received an email from Amanda, the sister of one of the cyclists involved in Thursday's tragic accident," South Wairarapa District Deputy Mayor Melissa Sadler-Futter posted on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"She wrote from the heart about what her family is going through - the physical injuries, the emotional pain, and the long road ahead for all those affected."</p>
        
            <p>Sadler-Futter said that the friends and family of all four cyclists have been following news articles, and social media posts about the accident, and had been "blown away with the show of support".</p>
        
            <p>Police said the investigation into the crash was ongoing, and would not confirm the deceased's identity.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect to release the name in due course but are not yet in a position to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the British High Commission had confirmed to RNZ that the crash involved British people.</p>
