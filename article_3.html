            <p>A mammoth total proved a mountain too tall for Pakistan as the Black Caps claimed victory in the first T20I in Auckland by 46 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Half centuries to Daryl Mitchell and returning captain Kane Williamson propelled the hosts to an imposing 226/8 after being sent in to bat.</p>
        
            <p>Regular wickets meant Pakistan never seriously threatened the target, Babar Azam providing the only real resistance before his side lost six wickets for just 21 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee made history as he brought up 150 T20 international wickets, the first man in the game to do so.</p>
        
            <p>A strong batting performance by New Zealand was slightly marred by several dropped catches, though Ish Sodhi did manage to snaffle a screamer off his own bowling.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell told TVNZ you are never quite sure how many runs are required at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"The partnerships we built through the middle allowed us to have a platform, and the way the boys bowled at the end was superb."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Auckland conditions suited him well.</p>
        
            <p>"The pitch here always has decent pace and carry so just tried to play nice cricket shots."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Santner was a late withdrawal after testing positive for Covid-19, which was not the only early adversity for the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>Shaheen Afridi dismissed Devon Conway first ball after chipping straight to cover as the Kiwis found themselves 1-1 after the first over.</p>
        
            <p>Allen then erupted Eden Park with a barrage of boundaries, blasting 24 off Afridi's second over.</p>
        
            <p>Aamer Jamal castled Allen two balls later with an absolute peach, but the young opener was brought back to the crease after the umpire called a no ball for over stepping.</p>
        
            <p>More drama followed as Williamson attempted to lap Jamal, Pakistan reviewing the not-out as replays confirmed the umpires' decision, the skipper surviving by a whisker.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was given another life after skying one, only for Babar Azam to spill the opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan finally got some luck when Allen miss-timed one to debutant Abbas Afridi.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson continued at a run a ball while Mitchell increased the run rate with back-to-back sixes off Usama Mir.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson brought up his half century off 40 balls with a classy four over cover, but held out shortly after for 57.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips joined Mitchell and the pair put on 36 before Phillips was out for 19 with New Zealand 164-4.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Chapman and Mitchell continued the carnage as Mitchell notched his half century but was dismissed by the Pakistan captain.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Milne was then out off Shaheen's final delivery of his spell, which ended at 3-46.</p>
        
            <p>A golden duck followed for Ish Sodhi, but Chapman ensured the Black Caps powered past the 200 mark.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee swept a six off the last ball to bring the total to 226/8, their highest ever in T20IsÂ against Pakistan.</p>

            <p>Debutant Saim Ayub returned the favour and cut Southee for four off the first ball of the chase, as Williamson then grassed a regulation chance to send the newcomer back to the sheds.</p>
        
            <p>Another dropped chanced followed for Matt Henry who was unable to snag a difficult caught and bowled opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>Ayub punished the Kiwis for his reprieve, taking Henry for 17 from his first over as he raced to 27 from eight.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Milne picked up the Kiwis first scalp as Ayub was run out at the non-strikers end by the fast bowler.</p>
        
            <p>Mohammed Rizwan was next to go after a blistering 24 before Ish Sodhi took a stunning caught and bowled to dismiss Fakhar Azam for 15.</p>
        
            <p>Babar kept ticking things over for the tourists but was losing partners, Iftikhar Ahmed holding out for 24 just as the partnership was looking dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>Babar scored his 50 from just 33 balls, surpassing Martin Guptill on the all-time T20I run scorers list as Pakistan required a further 68 from the final five.</p>
        
            <p>Their cause was further dented as Azam Khan found the once again reliable hands of Williamson.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Shaheen came and went with Milne picking up his second wicket of the over.</p>
        
            <p>The match was then all but over when Ben Sears claimed the crucial wicket of Babar for 57 and then Usama Mir for one.</p>
        
            <p>Southee's third brought up the 150 milestone for the veteran seamer, with Chapman taking a stunning catch to give Southee a four-wicket bag and wrap up an emphatic victory to open the series.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson told TVNZ things are always pretty chaotic at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"You are always in the game, a lot of credit to the bowlers, we knew the lengths we wanted to hit."</p>
        
            <p>He praised Southee for his outstanding and history-making figures.</p>
        
            <p>"It's credit to his consistent performances over the years."</p>
        
            <p>Game two is in Hamilton on Sunday night.</p>
