            <p>The Postal Workers Union is slamming NZ Post for its failure to remove Hawke's Bay post-boxes that have been sitting dormant for months.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Today reported on six NZ Post boxes across Hastings and Havelock North that are slated for removal, but are poorly sign-posted, with the public continuing to post mail for collection.</p>
        
            <p>It reported on one woman who had just completed a free bowel screening test provided by Health NZ, and posted it in one of these boxes.</p>
        
            <p>Two weeks later she saw the post box was overflowing and realised her test had never been sent.</p>
        
            <p>Co-president of the Postal Workers Union of Aotearoa John Maynard told Nine to Noon it was alarming to hear of people waiting on bowel screening results that would never arrive.</p>
        
            <p>He said NZ Post should have consulted with the community before shutting the boxes, and it's failure to do so "was a serious violation of their obligation to have regard for the interests of the community".</p>
        
            <p>Maynard said ideally no road-side post boxes would be abandoned but if they had to go, they should be clearly marked as 'closed' and removed swiftly.</p>
        
            <p>"There's much more efficient ways than just sticking a piece of paper on there - and taking nine months, I mean a lot of them they whip them out very quickly."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Post apologised for the confusion and said signs on a Hastings post box - that has been closed for nine months - were ripped off multiple times.</p>
        
            <p>It said the box should have been removed sooner, although it is unclear why it is taking so long for the boxes to be removed.</p>
