            <p>Fire and Emergency is responding to a vegetation fire in the Spinnaker Reserve in the Porirua suburb of Whitby.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was reported at around 1.40pm, and was around 480sqm in size at 2.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>There are nine crews on site, with more trucks responding.</p>
        
            <p>People are asked to stay away from the area, so trucks can get through.</p>
        
            <p>The entrance to Mercury Way is blocked by police.</p>
        
            <p>It is very windy.</p>
        
            <p>There is some smoke in the area, so those nearby should keep their windows closed.</p>
        
            <p>Police at the scene of the fire have told RNZ residents are not being asked to evacuate at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>The restricted fire season was declared for Porirua and KƒÅpiti Coast on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who wants to light an outdoor fire now needs to apply for a permit from Fire and Emergency.</p>
        
            <p>District Manager Brett Lockyer said those areas had become extremely dry since the beginning of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a very risky time of year for wildfires, so we're asking everyone to help us keep Wellington District's people, property and environment safe from fires this summer."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
