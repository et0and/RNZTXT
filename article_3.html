            <p>One person has been arrested amid a Greenpeace protest outside the Wellington office of mining lobby group Straterra, which caused police to cordon off an office building.</p>
        
            <p>The activists were protesting Straterra's plans to fast-track a seabed mining project for one of its clients, Trans-Tasman Resources, in the South Taranaki Bight.</p>

            <p>There were two protesters on a ledge on the outside of the building on The Terrace on Tuesday morning, and at least one other was inside.</p>
        
            <p>There were two police cars, a van, and two fire trucks, and the area around the building had been cordoned off for health and safety.</p>

            <p>About 30 people were watching from the street, with some unable to enter their workplaces.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Greenpeace said it was "a demonstration of the resistance promised" in a recent open letter to companies considering using the fast-track process, which aims to speed up infrastructure consenting.</p>
        
            <p>More than 7500 people had co-signed the letter, Greenpeace said.</p>

            <p>The group called Straterra a "malignant force in New Zealand politics, operating in the shadows and backrooms to exert a pernicious influence over Government policies".</p>
        
            <p>Campaigner Juressa Lee told RNZ the disruption was justified.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a peaceful protest, and peaceful protest is an important and legitimate part of civil society. I'm very concerned. We're in the midst of a climate crisis."</p>
        
            <p>She said Greenpeace had "tried lots of different avenues", including written and oral submissions, a petition and protest march.</p>
        
            <p>"We are putting companies that wish to use the Fast-track Approvals Bill to get their polluting projects over the line, on notice... This is the kind of action that we're prepared to take in order to protect our environment."</p>
        
            <p>Trans-Tasman Resources declined to comment. RNZ has also approached Straterra.</p>
