        <h2>Cannabis decriminalised in Germany from 1 April</h2>
        <p>
Germany has, as of 1 April, partly decriminalised marijuana use. But police unions are warning of real-world harm.

            <p>"Some German people drink their beer after work. We just want to smoke our weed."</p>
        
            <p>So says Marcel Ritschel who's celebrating as Germany - traditionally "beer land" - becomes a more cannabis-friendly country.</p>
        
            <p>Germany has, as of 1 April, partly decriminalised marijuana use.</p>
        
            <p>But police unions are warning of real-world harm. The law-change may have come on April Fool's Day but for them it is no joke.</p>
        
            <p>We meet Marcel Ritschel in the Neustadt area in Dresden, the heart of the city's alternative scene.</p>
        
            <p>Here, as in other places, it wasn't hard to find people openly smoking joints even before the rules were relaxed.</p>
        
            <p>That's one of the arguments behind decriminalisation; millions of people were smoking the stuff anyway.</p>
        
            <p>It will help kill the black market and improve quality control - say supporters.</p>
        
            <p>From April 1st</p>
        
            <p>From July 1st</p>
        
            <p>Ritschel is planning on setting up a growers association or "cannabis social club" that will be allowed under the law, from July.</p>
        
            <p>"A gardening club but for hemp," as he describes it.</p>
        
            <p>"Every gram that goes from the cannabis social club is one gram that's not on the black market," he says. "So it's a win-win situation."</p>
        
            <p>These places won't be like the famed Amsterdam-style cannabis coffee shops, which have themselves been hotly debated in the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>The not-for-profit clubs in Germany are supposed to be only for people who actually live here, in order to stop a wave of tourists pouring in to enjoy liberal cannabis laws.</p>
        
            <p>There are many caveats and complexities within the legislation; a product of the political controversy that's forced the plans - as originally envisaged - to be watered down.</p>
        
            <p>The halfway house has left people disgruntled, on both sides of the debate.</p>
        
            <p>There are warnings that April 1 will mark the start of a "chaos phase" for Germany.</p>
        
            <p>"We assume that the black market will be strengthened," says Alexander Poitz from Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP), the German Police Union.</p>
        
            <p>He believes that demand will quickly outstrip legal supply given growing weed at home requires perseverance and care while it'll be months before cannabis clubs can start to function.</p>

            <p>Longer-term, criminal networks will adapt and even "infiltrate" the social clubs while enforcing the law will be a "mammoth" task, claims Poitz.</p>
        
            <p>Smoking weed within 100 metres of a children's playgrounds, schools or sports centres - for example - is not allowed.</p>
        
            <p>In busy, crowded cities, it may take some dedication to find a spot to light up a spliff that's actually, technically, legal.</p>
        
            <p>There's also the problem of how police will be able to tell the difference between a consumer and dealer, if a person is able to carry up to 25 grams of the drug - enough for dozens of joints.</p>
        
            <p>Concerns that cannabis can be addictive and adversely affect mental health have also been voiced by groups such as the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME).</p>
        
            <p>The new measures will "increase use and health related harms, especially among youth," says CPME Vice President, Professor Ray Walley.</p>
        
            <p>Given under 18s can't take advantage of the new laws, it's thought that many young people will still resort to drug dealers.</p>
        
            <p>Germany is one on a long list of nations that have wrestled with the pros and cons of decriminalising marijuana.</p>
        
            <p>The government in Berlin cited a 2021 survey which found 10.7 percent of men and 6.8 percent of women had used cannabis at least once in the past 12 months, most commonly in the 18-24 age group.</p>
        
            <p>No approach yet exists that's been "truly successful" in killing the black market or preventing youth issues, according to Dr. Robin Hofmann - an assistant professor for criminal law and criminology at Maastricht University.</p>
        
            <p>Curbing the black market is a goal that "hasn't been fully achieved" even in countries where the drug has been properly legalised such as in Canada or Uruguay.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a long process," says Dr Hofmann, "A marathon, not a sprint."</p>
        
            <p>Germany's journey towards part-decriminalisation has similarly been a long road, in a debate typically pitting left-wingers against conservatives.</p>
        
            <p>This proposal emerged in 2021 when the three ruling parties carved out their coalition agreement, following years of stasis under conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
        
            <p>The party Merkel headed, the Christian Democratic Union party (CDU), has already pledged to reverse the changes if it wins power at the next election.</p>
        
            <p>Marcel Ritschel accepts that the change he's long campaigned for might not last the decade.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe we have two years and then it's all over."</p>
