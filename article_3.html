Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia tell RNZ's Corin Dann that comments at a Trump rally labelling their homeland island as "garbage" have energised the community to get out and vote. Audio

            <p>Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia say comments from a comedian at a Trump rally last week labelling their homeland island as "garbage" have energised members of the community to get out and vote.</p>
        
            <p>And that could spell bad news for Donald Trump, as the battleground swing state of Pennsylvania has a massive Puerto Rican population of close to 500,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>Puerto Rico is a US territory, not a state, but Pureto Ricans who live in the US are citizens and can vote in the election.</p>
        
            <p>At a suburban carpark 20 minutes from downtown Philadelphia, members of the local Puerto Rican community have come together to show pride in their homeland, their music and their flag.</p>
        
            <p>Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's description of Puerto Rico as "garbage" are still very much in the minds of those here, like political activist and union leader Evelyn DeJesus.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm Puerto Rican. There's two things you don't mess with Puerto Ricans - you don't mess with our flag and our island. That's taboo, that's sacred to us. He invited us to this fight, and one thing about Puerto Ricans - we are warriors… Now you want a fight? You're gonna get it."</p>

            <p>DeJesus said many Puerto Ricans living in the US are Catholic, and in the past have tended to vote for socially conservative candidates who want stricter laws on things like abortion. But she says it is different this time.</p>
        
            <p>"People are coming out in droves, the youth… The youth want change, and [Kamala Harris is] the one for change."</p>
        
            <p>The outpouring of rage in the Puerto Rican community over the garbage comments is something Democratic politicians such as US Congresswoman Nydia Velázquezare also hoping will turn the state their way.</p>
        
            <p>"That tiny island might be instrumental in saving democracy."</p>
        
            <p>Trump has since sought to distance himself from the comments, saying he did not know who the comedian was and that he did a lot for Puerto Rico when president.</p>

            <p>Velazque, who was the first ever Puerto Rican elected to the US Congress, said that did not wash.</p>
        
            <p>"Donald Trump has a record of contempt and disrespect toward Puerto Rico. We saw it when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico he tried to withhold money that was given to Puerto Rico.</p>
        
            <p>"So we know that Donald Trump is small-minded kind of person who will do that. And he has fostered this climate of hate and rhetoric that brings a comedian to feel he could make jokes at the expense of the Puerto Rican community. So this is payback time."</p>

            <p>Some people have come from out of town to help local organisers like Karen Rodríguez , who has been out canvasing Puerto Rican voters in Philadelphia since September.</p>
        
            <p>"If the Puerto Rican vote breaks for Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris wins. So it comes down to outreach and who comes out to vote, and I think with all of the outreach that has been happening across the state, it's going to be a very significant impact in the election."</p>

            <p>If the state does go the way of Harris, Puerto Rican Americans will no doubt be dancing and having the last laugh.</p>
