            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis is insisting the overall cost of replacing the Cook Strait ferries will be cheaper than the previous government's plan.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Rail Winston Peters outlined the plan on Monday but gave no information on the cost of the new proposal.</p>
        
            <p>The government will buy two ships with tracks for roll-on, roll-off rail freight, to replace its current Interislander fleet in 2029. The coalition had scrapped Labour's IReX mega-ferry project which was projected to cost $4 billion.</p>
