        <h2>'About one in a million': Marine biologist sees shark throw up echidna</h2>
        <p>
He's helped tag about 200 tiger sharks, but this was the first and only time he had seen a shark vomit an echidna.

            <p>A scientist who witnessed a tiger shark vomiting up an echidna during the course of a three-year project off the Queensland coast says it was a "one in a million" sight.</p>
        
            <p>James Cook University marine biologist Nicolas Lubitz shared the story ahead of the release of project data later this year.</p>
        
            <p>He said tiger sharks were scavengers and had been known to eat seabirds, tyres, licence plates and even a small TV screen.</p>
        
            <p>But Dr Lubitz said watching a shark throw up a dead echidna near Orpheus Island, east of Ingham in North Queensland, was something else.</p>
        
            <p>"I reckon it's about one in a million," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Biopixel Oceans Foundation researcher is part of a state-wide, multi-agency project that tagged more than 800 marine animals with 10-year-trackers between 2020 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Dhufish, snapper, mullet, shovelnose rays and various species of sharks were tagged with acoustic and satellite trackers from the Gold Coast to the Torres Strait.</p>
        
            <p>Lubitz said he had helped tag about 200 tiger sharks, but this was the first and only time he had seen a shark vomit an echidna.</p>
        
            <p>"This one just threw up an echidna, which was quite a surprise to us," he said of the May 2022 incident.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that they have quite a wide range of prey species that they feed on, but I definitely didn't think an echidna was on the menu."</p>
        
            <p>Lubitz said the shark was stressed and vomited as it was restrained and tagged near the boat.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometime when you wrangle them they get a little bit stressed, and one of the stress responses is to throw up their food, especially if it's food that is not quite sitting right," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And I can imagine that an echidna wasn't quite sitting right."</p>
        
            <p>Lubitz said it was not uncommon to see echidnas swimming in the mangroves around Palm Island.</p>
        
            <p>"They use their little nose as a snorkel - they're quite good swimmers, actually," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the tiger shark probably caught the unlucky echidna swimming in a narrow channel between Orpheus Island and Fantome Island.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen other food items coming out of tiger sharks, but never an echidna."</p>
        
            <p>Lubitz said new information about the behaviour of a range of marine animals had been gathered during the project.</p>
        
            <p>A James Cook University spokesman said more data from the project would be made available later this year.</p>
