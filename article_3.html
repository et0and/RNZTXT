            <p>Young reporters Imara Ruth Tamou and Anahera Apanui Hohepa have been asking the tough questions at Rātana this week.</p>
        
            <p>In a single day, the pair - aged 10 and 11 - interviewed more than 10 people, including Rangīkei mayor Andy Watson.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just bored, and we wanted to make people smile," Anahera said.</p>
        
            <p>The pair interviewed the mayor for about 10 minutes, asking him what it was like to be in office.</p>
        
            <p>"It was so exciting interviewing someone that was, like... famous.</p>
        
            <p>"And people said to us, 'you can interview people and then get, like, big (well-known).'"</p>
        
            <p>Imara and Anahera were inspired by watching interviews on YouTube, but do not currently publish their own interviews there. Instead, they said they were using them for practice.</p>

            <p>This week, they spoke to a range of people, from radio hosts to the National Party's deputy leader Nicola Willis.</p>
        
            <p>Anahera wants to be an "interviewer" when she grows up, while Ruth is torn between that profession and becoming a mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Both kōtiro are followers of the Rātana church, or mōrehu, and enjoy catching up with whānau at Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>They said what they particularly enjoyed about this year's celebrations was meeting Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, or the "girl who did the haka" in parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"The 25th is just amazing, how people just run around, play, be happy," Imara said.</p>
        
            <p>Their next goal was to interview new Māori Queen Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po, who made her first visit to Rātana Pā as queen this year.</p>
