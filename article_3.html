            <p>A public toilet block in a small Southland town is battling ongoing vandalism, forcing the council to explore new solutions.</p>
        
            <p>Since October 2023, Lumsden's toilets have been vandalised on at least five separate occasions.</p>
        
            <p>The stop was popular with people travelling through the region.</p>
        
            <p>Northern Community Board chairperson Greg Tither said security cameras were now being considered for identification and deterrent purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"(They have) absolutely gone berserk in there, and just been a menace," Tither said.</p>
        
            <p>Hand dryers, basins, bowls and dispensers had all been targeted, with graffiti emerging as an issue last month.</p>
        
            <p>The toilets had been upgraded several years ago and were a popular stopover for people, Tither said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very seldom there's not vehicles parked there ... so they are well-used toilets.</p>
        
            <p>"When they've been done up, they're in good shape, as long as the vandals stay out of it."</p>
        
            <p>The issue was highlighted at a Southland District Council meeting last week where community board chairs presented to councillors.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Rob Scott said a lot of signs had also been vandalised throughout the region, adding that the Lumsden damage could be linked to the "needless, wanton" destruction of ratepayer property.</p>
        
            <p>ÅŒraka Aparima Board chairperson Michael Weusten said it was interesting to hear cameras mentioned because of the swell of support for them at Riverton.</p>
        
            <p>"Local police and community patrol both want to see some cameras in Riverton at both ends of the town."</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson said the cost of vandalism at the Lumsden facility was estimated to be about $11,000 so far.</p>
        
            <p>Hand dryers alone cost $1800 each and had been replaced three times.</p>
        
            <p>Cages were now being made for those, featuring special bolts which made their removal difficult.</p>
        
            <p>The toilets were last hit on 15 April, when dispensers were targeted.</p>
