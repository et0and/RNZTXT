            <p>The family of a man missing in Auckland's Manukau Harbour after his boat capsized say they are "heartbroken" as the search continues for a third day.</p>
        
            <p>The search began on Tuesday evening, when police received a distress call just before 6pm saying a person was missing in the water near Puketutu Island.</p>
        
            <p>A second person, believed to be a nephew of the missing man, was able to swim back to shore and raise the alarm.</p>
        
            <p>The boat was towed back to shore by Coastguard on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>The missing man's niece, Lovina Fa'ukafa, said the family "were still in shock" over the capsize.</p>
        
            <p>"My brother … went with my uncle and he made it to the shore, but my uncle didn't."</p>
        
            <p>Search and rescue efforts continued on Thursday, a police spokesperson confirmed, with the police national dive squad joining in.</p>
        
            <p>"Further aerial searches will be conducted by the police Eagle helicopter at low tide."</p>
        
            <p>A rāhui had been put in place by local iwi, covering much of the harbour for at least seven days.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard were not participating in the ongoing search on Thursday, a spokesperson confirmed, but were available if needed.</p>
