            <p>A seven-year-old girl has been killed and eight others have been injured in a knife attack at an elementary school in the Croatian capital Zagreb.</p>
        
            <p>The 19-year-old attacker, believed to be a former student, entered a first-grade classroom at the Preƒçko Elementary School early Friday morning and attacked the teacher and several children with a knife, CNN affiliate N1 reported.</p>
        
            <p>Helicopters have been transporting the wounded to hospitals across the city. The teacher sustained life-changing injuries and is in critical condition, the Sveti Duh Hospital said.</p>
        
            <p>"The attacker is under police custody. The injured persons are receiving medical treatment," Zagreb police said.</p>
        
            <p>Among the five injured, three were students, Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said in a statement. Those students' injuries are not thought to be critical, he said, praising the police for subduing the attacker just 10 minutes after he began the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses reported chaotic scenes as ambulances rushed to the school and people fled the building. Videos shared on social media showed dozens of people running away from a building across the school's sports fields.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Croatian daily 24sata, the attacker's mother said that her son had an "emotionally unstable personality" and that he had been admitted to a psychiatric ward several times.</p>
        
            <p>"I begged the doctor not to discharge him because he is not fit to be out," the mother - who was not named - told 24sata, N1 reported.</p>
        
            <p>The attacker reportedly lived near the school from which he graduated five years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Various officials, including the city's mayor Tomislav Tomasevic and Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic, are on the scene, N1 said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the country is "appalled" by the "tragedy" and that his government would announce a day of mourning for the victims. Plenkovic added that Health Minister Irena Hristic will visit the hospitals where the wounded are being treated.</p>
        
            <p>School attacks are rare in Croatia and the Balkan region. Last year, Serbia was rocked by two mass shootings in as many days, the first of which targeted a school in the capital Belgrade.</p>
