            <p>More than 200 people have gathered outside Parliament in support of Ngāpuhi opposition to the repeal of Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>The country's largest iwi will deliver its submission to Select Committee against the removal of 7AA which legally binds Oranga Tamariki to improve and report on outcomes for Māori in care.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi representative Hinerangi Himiona said Ngāpuhi are taking a stand against a government it believes is running roughshod over Māori.</p>
        
            <p>She said iwi have the skill base and passion required to affect meaningful change.</p>
