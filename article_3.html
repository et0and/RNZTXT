            <p>Orange heavy rain and road snowfall warnings have been issued for some South Island regions, while watches for heavy rain, snow, and wind are in place for a large part of the remainder of the island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said for the 12 hours from 10am Monday, the area northwest of Motueka could expect between 70 and 100 millimetres of rain.</p>
        
            <p>But there was minimal chance of the warning being upgraded to red, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>North Otago, Dunedin and Clutha southeast of Raes Junction also had an orange heavy rain warning, with a forecast of about 80mm to 120mm of rain, from Monday noon until Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The rain is expected to turn to rain snow above 300 metres for those regions during Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>There was a moderate chance of the warning being upgraded to red.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain could cause flooding, slips and difficult driving conditions.</p>

            <p>A heavy rain watch is in place for Mount Taranaki, Westland District, Southland and Clutha about and northwest of Raes Junction on Monday. There was a moderate chance of these being upgraded to a warning.</p>
        
            <p>But MetService said there was a high chance of the strong wind watches being upgraded to warnings for Westland (in place Tuesday morning to Wednesday noon) and The Fiords (in place Monday night to Wednesday morning).</p>
        
            <p>These winds may approach severe gale in exposed places, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>And a snow watch will be in place for South Canterbury, including the foothills, inland areas of Otago and Southland as well as eastern Fiordland from Monday until Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>There was a moderate chance of the watch being upgraded to a warning, with snowfall possibly reaching warning criteria for the Otago, Southland and Fiordland areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Snow level is expected to lower to 300 to 500 metres overnight Monday and during Tuesday morning with significant accumulations shifting towards eastern Otago."</p>
        
            <p>A road snowfall warning will be in place for Lindis Pass (State Highway 8), Crown Range Road, and Milford Road (State Highway 94), from Monday morning until night.</p>
