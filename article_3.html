            <p>If there was a template on how to not peak too soon in life, Steven Alker could write the book.</p>
        
            <p>After battling away on various golf tours without ever quite breaking through, the 52-year-old has gone from strength to strength on the US Champions tour (50 and over).</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Alker notched his seventh tour win in two years at the Charles Schwab Cup Championship in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
        
            <p>He told First Up that winning in his adopted home town made it even better.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of one I've focused on and wanted to win. It was extra special with the family and friends. Sleeping in your own bed - I mean you can't beat that.</p>
        
            <p>"On the flip side, you've got to try and stay in tournament mode and treat it as a normal week, do the things you normally do on the road and and prepare and all that stuff."</p>
        
            <p>After a career fluctuating between the US PGA Tour and the second-tier Korn Ferry Tour, Alker has been on a golden run on the Champions Tour, earning nearly US$8 million (NZ$13.3m) since July 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He puts his success down to his tenacity.</p>
        
            <p>"With all the experiences, all the golf I've played, the places I've played, it's ... built me up for this time. It's been amazing - you look back and you go, geez, I couldn't see this a couple of years ago, but it's happened quite quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just enjoying myself, not just because I'm playing well, but because the company I'm amongst and still having the opportunity to play for some nice money."</p>
        
            <p>Alker's win was one of three last weekend for New Zealanders, with Ben Campbell winning the Hong Kong Open on the Asian Tour, and Kerry Mountcastle winning in Gippsland on the Australasian Tour.</p>
        
            <p>Alker said the depth in New Zealand golf was great to see, pointing also to Ryan Fox and Daniel Hillier's strong play.</p>
        
            <p>"You know Foxy last year was playing great and he was an inspiration to many, especially me. I believe things go in cycles, and right now we've got this bunch of players who are doing great.</p>
        
            <p>"Daniel Hillier... is a young guy who can do something special. I think he's got an amazing game. I played with him last year at New Zealand Open. Hopefully that inspires young ones to to come up and play."</p>
        
            <p>Alker said he hoped to return home in February for the 2024 NZ Open, but still needed to finalise his schedule before committing to the event.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd love to come back. I haven't got too many left in me."</p>
