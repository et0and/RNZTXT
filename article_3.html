            <p>A planned vigil for a Dunedin teenager who was fatally stabbed last Thursday has been cancelled, hours before it was scheduled to get underway.</p>
        
            <p>A 90-minute ceremony was to be held for Enere McLaren-Taana in The Octagon in the central city from 3.30pm on Friday with community leaders scheduled to lead tributes.</p>
        
            <p>But Dunedin City Council said it had abandoned the plans after consulting with organisers and they decided a vigil was "not appropriate at this time".</p>
        
            <p>"We recognise other schools and organisations have been holding their own events, which is helping to bring people together, and we thank them for their mahi," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The DCC will continue to offer support around the Bus Hub as we've been doing this week, along with other parties."</p>
        
            <p>McLaren-Taana, 16, was attacked and stabbed outside the bus hub in Dunedin on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The Trinity Catholic College student was rushed to hospital but later died, sparking an outpouring of grief among the local community.</p>
        
            <p>A 13-year-old boy charged with murder was granted name suppression when he appeared in the Youth Court last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The council first announced plans of a vigil on Thursday afternoon, which was to include representatives from mana whenua with community leaders such as Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich speaking during the ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the council backtracked on its comments that the vigil was to include Enere's whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"The DCC wishes to clarify that the whānau of Enere will not be present or speaking at the vigil.</p>
        
            <p>"The vigil has been organised as a public time and space to hold the outpouring of grief felt by the community for the passing of Enere.</p>
        
            <p>"The DCC apologises for any misunderstanding."</p>
