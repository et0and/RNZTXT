            <p>The Duchess of Sussex has criticised the "seemingly endless toxicity" of social media, revealing she was targeted with "bullying and abuse" while pregnant with Archie and Lilibet.</p>
        
            <p>Meghan was the keynote speaker on a high-profile panel marking International Women's Day at the annual SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.</p>
        
            <p>She said she now keeps her distance from such comments for her wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>Prince Harry was in the front row of the audience watching the speech.</p>
        
            <p>Meghan said people have "forgotten our humanity" in certain parts of the media and digital sphere.</p>
        
            <p>"The bulk of the bullying and abuse that I was experiencing on social media and online was when I was pregnant with Archie and with Lili", she explained.</p>
        
            <p>"You just think about that and really wrap your head around why people would be so hateful - it is not catty, it is cruel."</p>
        
            <p>The event was titled Breaking Barriers, Shaping Narratives: How Women Lead On And Off The Screen.</p>
        
            <p>The 42-year-old former Suits actress also discussed issues ranging from the importance of diverse representation to portrayals of motherhood in film and entertainment.</p>
        
            <p>Meghan said she found it "disturbing" that women were "spewing" hatred at each other online, adding: "I cannot make sense of that."</p>
        
            <p>"If you're reading something terrible about a woman, why are you sharing it with your friends?" she asked.</p>
        
            <p>"If it was your friend, or your mum or your daughter, you wouldn't do it.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that is the piece that is so lost right now (with) what is happening in the digital space and in certain sections of the media - we have forgotten about our humanity and that has got to change."</p>
        
            <p>At fellow panellist Katie Couric's urging, Meghan also re-shared how a letter she sent aged 11 to consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble led to a sexist advert promoting dishwashing liquid being changed.</p>
        
            <p>Meghan said that experience showed her the power of speaking up and advocacy. "Your voice is not small, it just needs to be heard," she told a live audience.</p>
        
            <p>Actress Brooke Shields, also on the panel. joked: "This is one of the ways we're different, when I was 11 I was playing a prostitute," referring to her background as a child actor and role in 1978 film Pretty Baby.</p>

            <p>The SXSW keynote panel event was also simultaneously streamed on YouTube, with most of the comments about Meghan being overwhelmingly positive.</p>
        
            <p>The Duke of Sussex and Meghan have come under heavy criticism, particularly in the UK tabloid press, after they stepped back from the Royal Family.</p>
        
            <p>Scrutiny of the couple intensified following a revealing interview on Oprah and a Netflix documentary.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's public appearances have been less frequent since they moved to California and set up the Archewell Foundation. Meghan was last in England in September 2022.</p>
        
            <p>There has been significant online speculation about a possible return to the UK to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Invictus Games - set up in 2014 by Prince Harry.</p>
        
            <p>Meghan's latest appearance comes during a difficult period for the Royal Family as the King undergoes cancer treatment and the Princess of Wales recovers from abdominal surgery in the UK.</p>
        
            <p>They have been put further under the microscope by the appearance of Kate Middleton's maternal uncle, Gary Goldsmith on Celebrity Big Brother.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith has criticised Meghan on the ITV reality show and reportedly claimed that Prince William has offered an olive branch to his brother.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday evening, he became the first housemate evicted from Celebrity Big Brother on ITV.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Prince Harry's memoir Spare was shortlisted for the British Book Awards in two categories.</p>
