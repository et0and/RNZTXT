            <p>An Auckland cinematographer has picked up an Emmy Award for his work on successful Netflix show Sweet Tooth.</p>
        
            <p>Dave Garbett won Best Cinematography for a single-camera live action programme at the Children's and Family Emmys, held in Los Angeles in the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Garbett, along with cinematographers John Cavill and Rob Marsh, was responsible for shooting season two of the dystopian drama. Sweet Tooth imagines a world where the human population has been decimated by a mysterious virus and hybrid babies are born with animal characteristics. The series features a host of local stars, including actors Robyn Malcolm, Jodie Rimmer and Rhys Darby, and musician Marlon Williams.</p>

            <p>His was the sole Emmy win for Sweet Tooth, which was nominated for 11 awards.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ from Los Angeles, Garbett said Sweet Tooth was "a really great story with universal appeal".</p>
        
            <p>"It was a pleasure being able to be a part of telling it. New Zealand has a huge wealth of film making talent, having it recognised in this way is just brilliant."</p>
        
            <p>Sweet Tooth was filmed entirely in Aotearoa and many Auckland locations, including the Winter Gardens in Auckland Domain, are recognisable to series viewers. The third season of the show is expected in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Filming is always a series of challenges. We had a really harmonious team, so we worked our way through it and we're all still friends at the end," Garbett said.</p>
        
            <p>His career to date includes working on a wide variety of shorts, series and films, including the David Bain drama Black Hands, and horror film Evil Dead Rise.</p>
        
            <p>"I finished high school with no idea what I wanted to do," Garbett said.</p>
        
            <p>"I decided to go to film school just because my mate was. I've been in it ever since and I love it! It has taken me far and wide and continues to provide variety and keep my working life interesting."</p>
