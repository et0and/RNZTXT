            <p>A New Zealand sky diver has died in Australia after taking part in a sky diving event in Western Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>Australian media are reporting 25-year-old Liam Newman died after he over corrected his landing and hit the ground at speed.</p>
        
            <p>His workplace iFly Brisbane Indoor Skydiving took to social media confirming his death.</p>
        
            <p>The post said he was a much loved staff member of their team and their thoughts were with his family at this difficult time.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes have been pouring in on social media remembering Newman.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency crews were called to a rural area at Tarawera near Goondiwindi about 8am on Tuesday, the ABC has reported.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Parachute Federation (APF), which is investigating the death, said Newman from Scarborough, north of Brisbane, was an experienced skydiver.</p>
        
            <p>"[He had] successfully landed more than 600 jumps since taking up the adventure sport in 2022," the federation said.</p>
        
            <p>The APF said he attempted a group jump at an organised event for experienced skydivers.</p>
        
            <p>It said it believed his parachute opened and functioned normally, but he landed badly and sustained multiple serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Four other skydivers landed safely.</p>
        
            <p>The APF said first aid was administered to Newman, but he could not be saved.</p>
        
            <p>APF chief executive Stephen Porter said Newman had grown up in the skydiving community.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the young man's family, which has been part of the skydiving community for many years, and we offer our condolences at this sad time."</p>
        
            <p>He said an AFP safety officer was travelling to the site to begin a thorough investigation to understand the cause of the incident and improve safety measures in the future.</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland police forensic crash unit is also investigating.</p>
        
            <p>Darling Downs police superintendent Doug McDonald said the incident was "absolutely tragic".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a terrible tragedy, a recreation sport where someone has lost their lives.</p>
