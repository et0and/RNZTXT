            <p>Junior doctors plan to strike next month over an "unfair" offer that sees some get a pay rise will others take a cut.</p>
        
            <p>About 2500 resident doctor's working for Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand issued a strike notice for 25 hours from 7am on 7 May. Further strike action next month was also being considered.</p>
        
            <p>Under the current pay offer many doctors would get a pay rise, but for 600 registrars the proposed changes would equate to a pay freeze or in some cases a cut, the union said.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Doctors Association national secretary Deborah Powell said the offer was a "cruel irony".</p>
        
            <p>"Te Whatu Ora has presented us with a pay offer which represents a significant uplift of around 15-20 percent and up to 25 percent in salary rates for some resident doctors. Because of the salary model in our collective agreement however, the impact on our members is uneven and unfair.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Whatu Ora has proposed an unacceptable set of remuneration options, including what would be pay cuts or a pay freeze for nearly 600 registrars including 300 GP trainees in 2025."</p>
        
            <p>She said members were united in ensuring no resident doctor received a pay cut.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand declined an interview with RNZ, but in a statement it's chief people officer Andrew Slater said initial negotiations guaranteed no resident medical officer would get a pay cut.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora was focussed on continuing good faith bargaining, which was the best way to resolve issues and avoid disruption, Slater said.</p>
        
            <p>Further discussions with the union were scheduled for next week, but contingencies were also being made in case the strike did go ahead, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Resident Medical Officers are a vital and valued part of the Health NZ workforce and we have already indicated that we are prepared to make a very significant investment in settling the NZRDA collective agreement. "</p>
