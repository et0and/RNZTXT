            <p>OK, so who came into this season thinking this fixture would be a battle of the cellar-dwellers? Admittedly we're only three weeks into Super Rugby Pacific but another loss for either of these sides would call for panic stations, not least because of their excellent 2024 campaigns.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues are coming off a shock loss to the Highlanders and the Canes were one last-minute try away from feeling the same way against the Drua, so really this is a case of who can sort themselves out the fastest.</p>

            <p>Raymond Tuputupu comes in at hooker in a bit of surprise over the in form Jacob Devery, the other change in the forwards sees Peter Lakai and Brayden Iose swap places at number eight and the bench. North Harbour wing Kade Banks starts at fullback, replacing the injured Callum Harkin.</p>

            <p>Not many changes for Vern Cotter's side other than Josh Beehre coming into the second row to replace Lachlan McWhannell. Cam Christie comes off the bench for his debut and Sam Nock will make his first appearance of the season.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues have won seven of their last 10 Super Rugby Pacific games against the Hurricanes including a 31-27 win in their most recent meeting; however, they had lost 9 in a row against them prior to those 10 most recent encounters.</p>
        
            <p>Five of the last six Super Rugby Pacific games between the Hurricanes and Blues at Sky Stadium have been decided by a margin of fewer than 10 points on the day, with each team picking up three wins in that stretch.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes have missed four or more tackles leading to a line break in each of their two games in the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season after not doing so in any of their last four games in the 2024 campaign.</p>

            <p>"If it was easy, we'd just do it, wouldn't we? There's some simple stuff around execution. We left ourselves down around set piece launching and the first three phasis. But opposition circumstances don't make it easy." - Canes coach Clark Laidlaw.</p>
        
            <p>"We felt we were undercooked right from the startâ€¦you have to deal with losing. The whole thing is about constructing our game but it doesn't take away the disappointment of losing." - Blues coach Vern Cotter.</p>
        
            <p>Blues 31 - 27 Hurricanes</p>
        
            <p>One of the best games of last season, the two sides went blow for blow in front of a big crowd at Eden Park. The home side got there in the end thanks to a concerted forward effort close to the line, scoring four tries from one metre barge overs.</p>
        
            <p>How the mighty have fallen, not just in ladder placings but personnel too. The Canes relied on big games from TJ Perenara and Jordie Barrett last year, so Cam Roigard and Peter Umaga-Jensen need to combine to give them a decent crack. Meanwhile the Blues are just trying to figure out what they're doing wrong, when it worked so well last year. Still, there is enough talent on the park to make this a highly watchable match - so expect the linesmen to be spending a good bit of time under the posts.</p>
