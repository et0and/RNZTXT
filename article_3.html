            <p>Sydney's Luna Park is being put up for sale for the first time in two decades, with a price tag expected to be in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>The heritage-listed amusement park on Sydney's harbour foreshore opened in 1935 and remains one of the city's most recognisable landmarks.</p>
        
            <p>Investment firm Brookfield acquired Luna Park Sydney in 2007 as part of its acquisition of builder Multiplex.</p>
        
            <p>Luna Park Sydney CEO John Hughes said it was the right time to sell.</p>
        
            <p>"The business is in really great shape," Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a couple of years of extreme growth with new immersive experiences launched here at Luna Park Sydney and our shareholders think now is the right time to go on market."</p>
        
            <p>Sydney's version of Luna Park was based on the concept of the "first" Luna Park which opened at Coney Island in New York in 1903.</p>

            <p>American entrepreneur Herman Phillips brought the idea to Australia and opened Luna Park in Melbourne in 1912 and Luna Park Glenelg in Adelaide in 1930.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips won a tender to develop the site at North Sydney in 1935 and dismantled the amusement rides at the Glenelg site and transported them to Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said the amusement park had played an "important role in Sydney's social and cultural fabric" and remained protected by legislation.</p>
        
            <p>"The park is protected by parliamentary legislation and is one of only two parks globally that is protected by this type of legislation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Meaning that Luna Park Sydney must remain an amusement park for all of Sydney and Sydneysiders to enjoy."</p>
        
            <p>Sydney's Luna Park opened to immediate success and remained popular throughout the wartime period of the 1940s.</p>
        
            <p>The site was sold a number of times over the years and by 1975 it was operating on a weekly basis because the managers were unable to negotiate a long-term lease.</p>
        
            <p>The park was shut down when its Ghost Train caught fire and burnt down on June 9, 1979, killing six children and one adult.</p>
        
            <p>Luna Park Sydney reopened in 1982 and again in 1995 before reopening for a final time in 2004.</p>
        
            <p>International real estate firm CBRE has been contracted to oversee the sale.</p>
