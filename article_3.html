            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has made another flub when promoting his beneficiary crackdown, massively overstating his government's increase in case managers.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing on TVNZ's Breakfast on Tuesday, Luxon referred to a significant boost in frontline staff at the Ministry of Social Development as evidence the government was doing "everything we can" to get people into work.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got 4000 more phone case managers coming on stream. We've got 2100 more community job counsellors helping as well," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to get people into work. That's what this has to be about."</p>
        
            <p>But in response to questions from RNZ, the ministry said the new welfare traffic light regime was being introduced "within current staffing levels".</p>
        
            <p>Further investigation revealed the numbers cited by Luxon referred not to staff, but to the number of additional people able to receive that support.</p>
        
            <p>A July media release referred to a new phone-based service that would "initially provide 4000 more job seekers with case management support".</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, a release in August announced an expansion of community-led employment programmes to accept another 2100 applicants.</p>
        
            <p>When RNZ put this to the prime minister's office, a spokesperson acknowledged the mix-up and said Luxon gave the correct information during his interview on Morning Report shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, he repeated the error on Morning Report and only corrected himself after it was highlighted by host Ingrid Hipkiss.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Social Development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni said the prime minister's comments were embarrassingly inaccurate and proved he was out of his depth.</p>
        
            <p>"He doesn't know any of this stuff. He is completely removed from the reality of so many New Zealanders, particularly our poorest New Zealanders," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He cites himself as being this great businessman, but he pays very little attention to detail."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also stumbled during his interview with Morning Report on Tuesday, when asked whether he knew how much the Jobseeker benefit was.</p>
        
            <p>"No, I don't, not right now," Luxon said. "I don't know the precise number."</p>
        
            <p>Pushed to provide even a ballpark figure, he refused: "No, I'm not going to do that, because I want to make sure I get it right for you".</p>
        
            <p>When questioned again by reporters later on Tuesday, Luxon was able to lay out the range of support available, from $260 a week through to $630.</p>
        
            <p>He defended his earlier slip-up, saying: "I just told you now, so it's all fine... in the heat of an interview, I don't want to go off and not have time to explain how it all works, because it's not as simple as just a single number".</p>
        
            <p>The government's long-signalled traffic-light warning scheme for the welfare system kicked into effect on Monday, setting out consequences for those who failed to meet certain requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet also agreed to further bolster the regime from early 2025, requiring Jobseekers to reapply for the benefit every six months, instead of annually.</p>
        
            <p>Any blemishes would also remain on their record for two years, twice as long as they do now.</p>
        
            <p>Other changes include the introduction of new sanctions such as mandatory community work or money management payment cards.</p>
