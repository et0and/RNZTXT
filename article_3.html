            <p>After six years in the "incredibly stimulating" role as Tasman District Council's chief executive, Janine Dowding is handing the reins over at the end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>Dowding moved into the job in 2018 after more than 30 years in central government, most recently as the Ministry of Social Development's regional commissioner for the upper South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Local government just seemed like the place … to serve my community but at the same time really grow my experience," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an amazing role because there's so much variety and it's incredibly stimulating. You're encountering different issues and topics every day."</p>
        
            <p>Dowding arrived as the council was debating if it should proceed with the Waimea Community Dam - in the words of Mayor Tim King, "probably the biggest decision … the council's ever made".</p>
        
            <p>Leading a council for the first time during that time was "really tough" but also provided a great learning experience for the council's new chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>"There really wasn't a part of council that that project didn't touch, so it was a valuable opportunity for me to learn about council," Dowding said.</p>
        
            <p>"While I thought I had a grasp on it, working from afar, I soon found out that you just can't really understand a council until you work in it."</p>
        
            <p>Like the dam, many of council's major challenges during her time as chief executive provided Dowding with some of the real highlights of her tenure.</p>
        
            <p>The "awful" 2019 Pigeon Valley wildfire brought out the best in people as the community rallied around those affected, while the Covid-19 pandemic provided the council the opportunity to make some much-needed changes, enabling greater flexibility, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dowding said the council's successes are the result of the collective efforts of those within and outside the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"[I'm] proud to have been part of the team that has made these things happen."</p>
        
            <p>One of the council's notable achievements during the last six years has been the development and progression of its relationship with iwi.</p>
        
            <p>The eight iwi and three councils of Te Tauihu committed to work more closely together when they signed a new partnership agreement in December, the latest example of that improving relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a way to go there, but there's really deep commitment and an understanding of the value of those relationships."</p>
        
            <p>While with the council, Dowding spent a year on secondment, supporting the independent panel charged with trying to address the sector's massive challenges through the Future for Local Government review.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and severe weather, as well as the cost of infrastructure across small, dispersed communities.</p>
        
            <p>Dowding said it's important that the local government review and its recommendations are not overlooked.</p>
        
            <p>Despite enjoying the job, Dowding acknowledged that it can be "tough gig" with periods of incredibly high stress and a need for endurance.</p>
        
            <p>The rising amount of abusive behaviour being directed towards council staff "takes a toll" on people's wellbeing, but being chief executive is also simply an "all-consuming job".</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't say I go home and stress every night, but it's very hard to switch off because there's always so much happening," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dowding considered her future and the realities of her job as the end of her term approached, eventually deciding not to seek an extension to her contract.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time in her career, Dowding has no plans after she finishes up at the council and will spend the next couple of months resetting and rebuilding her reserves.</p>
        
            <p>"It just feels like a good time to let somebody else come in and take the reins."</p>
        
            <p>But it sounds like that somebody has big shoes to fill with Mayor Tim King praising Dowding's leadership during her final council meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no one I would have preferred to go through the last five years, and particularly the whole Covid experience, leading our organisation."</p>
        
            <p>Dowding's advice to her successor is to value and appreciate all the people both inside and outside the council who make Tasman what it is.</p>
        
            <p>"We can do so much more together."</p>
