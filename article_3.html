            <p>All Whites v New Caledonia FIFA World Cup 2026 - OFC Qualifier</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7pm Monday, 24 March (NZT)</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Live blog coverage on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>The stage is set. Eden Park - where New Zealand won their first-ever game of test cricket, two Rugby World Cup finals and, two years ago, Hannah Wilkinson secured the Football Ferns a historic first FIFA Women's World Cup win over Norway. Now, the All Whites can etch their names into the pantheon of Kingsland heroes.</p>
        
            <p>With the OFC region finally having a direct qualification route to the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada, this date has long been earmarked as a possible moment of significance for New Zealand sport - much like their 1-0 triumph over Bahrain in Wellington in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Standing in the way is the All Whites' biggest rival in the region, excluding our now-absconded neighbours across the ditch, in the form of New Caledonia. They will also be looking to make history, amid a testing time domestically after the 2024 unrest across the south-west Pacific archipelago.</p>

            <p>Ever since it was announced that Oceania would have a direct entrant to the 2026 World Cup the All Whites and New Zealand football fans have been waiting for this moment. For potentially the first time, the All Whites go into a one-off play off for the World Cup as overwhelming favourites. They are in incredible form, with five wins in succession, including thumping triumphs over Vanuatu, Samoa and Fiji in Friday's semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps that is the biggest challenge for head coach Darren Bazeley. Those expectations will become potently evident the moment his team steps out onto the field on Monday night and it may be a level of pressure some will struggle with.</p>
        
            <p>But after the disappointment of inter-confederation playoff defeats to Mexico, Peru and Costa Rica in their last three attempts to reach football's biggest showpiece, this opportunity is one they simply have to grasp.</p>

            <p>Who can write themselves into the record books alongside Rory Fallon, Stephen Wooddin and Wynton Rufer?</p>
        
            <p>After the manner of their 7-0 humbling of the Bula Boys in the final four, it would be a surprise to see many changes to Bazeley's starting XI.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood will lead the line after an exceptional hat-trick of headers in Wellington four days ago spearheaded New Zealand's route to the final. Other players, who may have considered themselves on the fringes such as Sarpreet Singh and Tim Payne, also played themselves into being undroppable in that fixture.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The most likely change could be in the attacking midfield area. Matt Garbett is clearly not at 100% match sharpness following an unfortunate sidelining at club level which has seen him out of the NAC Breda team since December.</p>
        
            <p>With Eli Just an injury doubt with a shoulder problem, Logan Rogerson might be the most likely beneficiary. His defensive output evidenced at Auckland FC this season could come in handy against the frenetic counter-attack of their opponents.</p>
        
            <p>Potentially, Alex Rufer comes into the team for the same reasoning but minimal changes are likely after Friday's impressive manner of victory.</p>
        
            <p>Predicted XI</p>
        
            <p>Crocombe; Payne, Bindon, Boxall, Cacace; Bell, Stamenic, McCowatt, Singh, Rogerson; Wood.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand squad</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeepers: Max Crocombe, Alex Paulsen, Oli Sail.</p>
        
            <p>Defenders: Tyler Bindon, Michael Boxall, Liberato Cacace (c), Tim Payne, Nando Pijnaker, Tommy Smith, Francis de Vries, Storm Roux.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Matthew Garbett, Joe Bell, Sarpreet Singh, Marko Stamenic, Alex Rufer, Callum McCowatt.</p>
        
            <p>Forwards: Kosta Barbarouses, Jesse Randall, Eli Just, Logan Rogerson, Ben Waine, Chris Wood.</p>
        
            <p>Historically, this is easily New Zealand's most challenging opponent of the current OFC contingent. Of the nation's 33 meetings since 1951, the All Whites have a one-in-three losing record against Les Cagous. That includes a June 2012 loss, when an All Whites team containing a young Chris Wood, Tommy Smith and Kosta Barbarouses, was dumped out of the OFC Nations Cup at the semi-final stage in Honiara. It remains the All Whites' only defeat to an OFC member since their 2010 World Cup appearance and one of only two losses since Australia left OFC to join the AFC Confederation in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>One of the goalscorers that day was Georges Gope-Fenepej and the 36-year-old rolled back the years in the 3-0 semi-final win over Tahiti on Friday afternoon. His two delightful chipped efforts inspired his team to victory and his ability will be of concern.</p>

            <p>He is one of several French-based layers who form a potent threat - including captain César Zeoula and striker Lues Waya. Jekob Jeno has had a promising first season in Israel's top-flight with Beitar Jerusalem while one-time Wellington Phoenix striker Jaushua Sotirio will be hoping to get on for his international debut - after switching allegiance from Australia earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>New Caledonia squad</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeepers: Rocky Nyikéïne, Thomas Schmidt, Mickaël Ulikle.</p>
        
            <p>Defenders: Emile Béaruné, Fonzy Ranchain, Joris Kenon, Bernard Iwa, Didier Simane</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Joseph Athalé, Yoan Bearune,Pierre Bako, Jekob Jeno, Morgan Mathelon,</p>
        
            <p>Mickaël Paretodikromo, Shene Welepane, César Zéoula (c), Titouan Richard</p>
        
            <p>Forwards: Lues Waya, George Gope-Fenepej, Germain Haewegene Jean-Jacques Katrawa, Gérard Waia, Jaushua Sotirio.</p>

            <p>15 November 2016 New Zealand 0-0 New Caledonia</p>
        
            <p>24 March 2022 New Zealand 7-1 New Caledonia</p>
        
            <p>This will, undoubtedly, be the All Whites' most significant test of the qualifying campaign. New Caledonia's high-energy approach is combined with smatterings of quality throughout the squad which has always made them the least likely to fold of New Zealand's regional opponents. The 7-1 result in their most recent meeting is something of an aberration, with COVID-19 protocols at the time rendering them a shadow of the team that will step out in Auckland tonight.</p>
        
            <p>That said, this is also a vastly different All Whites set-up to the ones which have historically struggled against this sort of opponent - one which has only widened the gulf in quality present in Oceania in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>In front of a home crowd, with a generational opportunity to return New Zealand to a men's World Cup? That's a lot of pressure, but surely there can only be one result.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 3-1 New Caledonia </p>
