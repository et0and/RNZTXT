            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand is urging people to get in touch if they think they have found any Oriental fruit flies.</p>
        
            <p>The department is ramping up trapping and testing after a single male Oriental fruit fly was found yesterday in a surveillance trap in Papatoetoe.</p>
        
            <p>The insect is considered one of the most "destructive and widespread" of all fruit flies, and can jeopardise the country's produce exports if found in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand commissioner Mike Inglis said that so far no other such fly had been found in any of the other 187 traps in the Papatoetoe/Mangere area.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity staff members would do daily checks in one zone and daily testing in another zone, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you do have any concerns or you find a fruit fly, there will be messages going out in the media with pictures ... if you can catch it that's good and then just contact the line or speak to my staff who will be in the area across the next at least 48 to 72 hours."</p>
        
            <p>He also called for people in Papatoetoe not to take any whole fresh fruit and vegetables out of their property.</p>
        
            <p>"We just want to make sure that we do this correctly... We're just urging the community not to be taking any fresh fruit or vegetables out of the Papatoetoe area at this stage," Inglis said.</p>
        
            <p>So far there was no evidence of a breeding population in Aotearoa, he said.</p>
