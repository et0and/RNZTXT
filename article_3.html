            <p>Watercare says it's been an incredibly dry month, as Aucklanders are being asked to cut back on long showers and car washes.</p>
        
            <p>Dam levels dropped below a trigger point earlier this month, and with dry weather expected to last, Watercare has activated the city's drought plan.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare chief operations officer Mark Bourne told Morning Report the rain over the past 24 hours came to just under 9 millimetres in the catchment.</p>
        
            <p>He said to put that into perspective, there has been 33mm of rain so far this month, when normally it would be up around 130mm.</p>
        
            <p>"So well shy of where we would normally be - it's incredibly dry out there."</p>
        
            <p>Watercare needed to build awareness of the situation first before considering more stringent measures, Bourne said.</p>
        
            <p>This might be shorter showers or reduced watering of the garden.</p>
        
            <p>On a bigger scale, Watercare had a very large water treatment plant on the banks of the Waikato River and this supplied about one-third of Auckland's water supply.</p>
        
            <p>"What we've been doing over the course of summer is increasing the production at the facility and reducing the production from the dam sources."</p>
        
            <p>Commercial customers were also being asked to reduce the use of water.</p>
        
            <p>"If everyone saves a little, collectively it can make a huge difference."</p>
        
            <p>Bourne said Aucklanders should be aware there could be more serious restrictions to come.</p>
        
            <p>Weather forecasts indicated April would also be dry.</p>
        
            <p>"So if we continue the demands that we have at the moment and we get a very dry April and potentially it's dry into May then water levels could reduce further in the dams to the point where mandatory restrictions are required.</p>
        
            <p>"So our preference is for everyone to voluntarily reduce consumption now."</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere around the North Island and the top of the South Island, lush farms are turning into deserts as drought conditions worsen and farmers struggle to grow grass.</p>
        
            <p>A drought has been declared in the Northland, Waikato, Horizons, Marlborough-Tasman, and Taranaki regions - and there are fears about feed shortages as temperatures begin to drop.</p>
