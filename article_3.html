        <h2>Boating deaths a tragic reminder of sandbar risks - Coastguard</h2>
        <p>
The authority says the message needs to be clear after four boating deaths in a fourtnight - if in doubt, don't go out.

            <p>The Coastguard says the dangers of crossing sandbars were tragically highlighted this month with two South Island boating tragedies within a fortnight, but it hopes to better educate boaties with its first nationwide bar awareness campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Three people died when their boat capsized on the Riverton Bar in early August while a man died last Saturday when a boat overturned approaching the Catlins River bar.</p>
        
            <p>The Coastguard's campaign starts this weekend, with the first seminars at the New Zealand Fishing Hunting and 4X4 Expo in Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard bar awareness programme lead Simon Marshall said the message needed to be clear - if in doubt, don't go out.</p>
        
            <p>"[Crossing a bar] is the most dangerous thing you can do on your boat, so you've got to treat the moana with respect and do all your preparation before you head out."</p>
        
            <p>Things could go wrong crossing a sandbar whether it was your first time or the hundredth time, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Treat the bar with respect, come along to one of our bar crossing seminars around the country... always be prepared, always wear a life jacket, always carry a personal locator beacon and a VHF radio."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said the Coastguard had run seminars for quite a few years but until last year these were focused around the Auckland region.</p>
        
            <p>It ran 11 seminars in 2023, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're almost doubling that this year with seminars in more than 20 locations. This is first time we're doing a national campaign, with promotion, and we've packaged everything up as a roadshow.</p>
        
            <p>Seminars were given by local Coastguard volunteers, members of fishing clubs, and some harbourmasters, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's by the community for the community. It's been a real challenge co-ordinating more than 20 community groups.... but it's been amazing how quick everyone has come on board, because everyone understands how important this work is.</p>
        
            <p>More than 20 free seminars will be held around the motu in the next few months.</p>
        
            <p>A seminar that was to be held in Riverton had been postponed out of respect for the local community, Marshall said.</p>
