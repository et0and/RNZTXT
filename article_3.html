            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says he expects the new Human Rights Commissioner to be "very careful" in his public commentary, following concern about his previously expressed views.</p>
        
            <p>The appointment of Stephen Rainbow has prompted concern from some quarters - including Labour and the Greens - given his staunch pro-Israel views and previous comments about "a trans agenda".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ at Parliament on Tuesday, Goldsmith said he had no regrets over the appointment. He declined to be drawn into "parleying every statement [Rainbow's] made through his history", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"People express all sorts of views before they take up these roles," he said. "But I have every confidence that he will go about his work in a very open and inclusive way.</p>
        
            <p>"If we were to expect that all candidates would never have said anything controversial in their lives, we'd have a very short list."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether he expected Rainbow to now dial back his commentary, Goldsmith said: "Oh, yes. As Human Rights Commissioner, he'll be very careful how he manages these things, I'm sure."</p>

            <p>New race relations commissioner Melissa Derby has also come in for some criticism for sharing a tweet last year which said the "trans movement" could not be tolerated in civil society.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told RNZ both commissioners were "great appointments" who would now take on the responsibility of advocating for all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"None of us in New Zealand are perfect... People may regret comments that they've made in the past, but the bottom line is: these are two good hires."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also pointed to recent comments from the acting chief commissioner Saunoamaali'i Karanina Sumeo on TVNZ's Q+A programme over the wekend.</p>
        
            <p>During the interview, Sumeo acknowledged she had some differences with the new commissioners, but called them "amazing people" who cared about New Zealand.</p>

            <p>Labour justice spokesperson Duncan Webb said he was concerned Rainbow had demonstrated "a certain lack of judgement around some critical areas around race and gender".</p>
        
            <p>He said he hoped the new commissioner would not undermine the Human Rights Commission's critical role.</p>
        
            <p>"What are the values underpinning those kind of posts and comments that he's made and which he's endorsed?" Webb said.</p>
        
            <p>"Trans rights are a real issue in New Zealand today, and we need someone who will be a defender of them, not say there's some sort of trans agenda out there."</p>

            <p>Webb has himself courted controversy on the Israel-Gaza conflict, creating a video this month featuring pro-Palestine protesters chanting at the prime minister: "How many kids did you kill today?".</p>
        
            <p>"As with everyone, we don't always express things perfectly, and I accept that was the case there," Webb said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the government seemed intent on neutering the Human Rights Commission through their appointments.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody is entitled to change their opinions. I certainly hope that [these commissioners] have."</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Kahurangi Carter told RNZ Rainbow's posts were worrisome and she would be watching his conduct closely.</p>
        
            <p>"He needs to be politically neutral and be able to work with all parties to uphold human rights for everyone," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Carter said the Greens would stay connected with the local trans and Palestinian communities to ensure their voices were heard.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Morning Report on Monday, Rainbow said he was "utterly committed" to working for all New Zealanders, including trans people.</p>
        
            <p>He said social media had become increasingly polarised, and he was saddened "a throwaway comment" he made several years ago had attracted such attention.</p>
        
            <p>But his own social media history demonstrates a record of frequent provocative rhetoric.</p>
        
            <p>As recently as November last year, Rainbow bemoaned "a civilisation in self-inflicted and terminal decline", referencing images of the queer and trans community supporting Palestine.</p>
        
            <p>He also heaped praise on British Conservative MP Suella Braverman for leading "the popular revolt against woke elites and their rejection of western cultural values".</p>
        
            <p>In a separate post, Rainbow criticised the "highly selective" Human Rights Commission for giving trans activist Shaneel Lal a platform, posting on Facebook that Lal's "divisive antics" were undoing support for gay people and same-sex marriage.</p>
        
            <p>In May this year, he took aim at Ireland's "grotesque and talentless entrant" in the Eurovision Song Contest, accusing performer Bambie Thug of helping vilify the Israeli competitior.</p>
        
            <p>Bambie Thug had earlier suggested Israel should be excluded from the competition as Russia was in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Across several Facebook posts, Rainbow also attacked the current iteration of the Greens, calling them the "nasty party" and "experts at hypocritical virtue-signalling".</p>
        
            <p>"NZ's Greens have become the cheerleaders for the murderous misogynistic homophobic death cult Hamas", he posted.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, Rainbow cautioned Aucklanders against signing a petition to ban conversion therapy: "Be careful...there's some elements of the trans agenda being sneakily promoted through this campaign," he commented in a Facebook group for Auckland's queer community.</p>
