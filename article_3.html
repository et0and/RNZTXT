            <p>A hat trick to the appropriately named Miracle Faiilagi has secured a shock score win for Moana Pasifika over the Hurricanes at North Harbour Stadium. The result will be particularly satisfying for Ardie Savea against his old team, even if the Moana skipper sat out the entire second half.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the heroics were dished out by perhaps Moana's biggest success story so far in Faiilagi, the homegrown Samoan flanker dotting down once in the first half and twice in the second to wrestle the lead off the visitors and then keep them at an arm's length.</p>
        
            <p>First five Patrick Pellegrini, in his first Super Rugby Pacific start, repaid his coaches' faith in him with an inspired display. As well as nailing five out of six conversions, his kicking in general play was excellent - especially in the lead up to Kyren Tamoufolau's spectacular effort after halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Tana Umaga will be very happy with the composure shown at the death by his side, who had to withstand a Cam Roigard-inspired comeback from the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Ngani Punivai and debutante Jone Rova scored late to send a few scares through Moana and their very healthy turnout of fans, however the nerves held to pull off a memorable win.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Hurricanes had opened the scoring with a try to Brayden Iose, however like last weekend Moana hit straight back. Faiilagi scored the first of two well-executed lineout tries for Moana, then Semisi Tupou Ta'eiloa gave them the lead after half an hour with a bulldozing effort.</p>
        
            <p>But it was the double effort of Tamoufolau and Faiilagi after the break that did the damage for Moana, opening up a gap that was ultimately too much for the Hurricanes to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>The result is Moana's first win of the season, after coming desperately close in losses to the Force and Highlanders. They take a well-earned bye week, while the Hurricanes head south to Dunedin to take on the Highlanders next Friday night.</p>
