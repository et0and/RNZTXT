            <p>It has been a stormy night in Tai Rāwhiti and Hawke's Bay with rain warnings in place and some minor flooding already reported.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Civil Defence is asking people to check on their neighbours and whānau this weekend as more heavy rain batters the area.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued heavy rain warnings for Tai Rāwhiti, Wairoa and Hawke's Bay north of Napier, through until Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 180 millimetres of rain was expected in some places during that period, and about 30mm of rain fell overnight from Friday into Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Civil Defence's Juanita Savage said on Saturday morning that there was already surface flooding across some roads and paddocks.</p>
        
            <p>If anyone felt unsafe they should call 111, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She asked for reports of flooding to be left on the Wairoa District Council after hours number or the council's Facebook page - where photos could also be posted to help officials see what is going on.</p>
        
            <p>But so far, the wind appeared to be helping to push the rain away from the area.</p>
        
            <p>The district was last hit with significant downpours just two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>"There is some wind there that is pushing the weather through, where two weeks ago the weather just seemed to sit on top of us and not move off. The rain periods come and go - which I think is better for us," Savage said.</p>
        
            <p>Rivers were being monitored and road crews were at the ready if necessary.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said this weekend's storm could bring 130 to 180mm of rain to each area.</p>
        
            <p>"And for that Tai Rāwhiti-Gisborne region we are also expecting some thunderstorm activity - and ... with thunderstorms they do tend to bring quite an intense burst of rain in quite a short space of time."</p>
        
            <p>The heavy rain could make driving hazardous and cause flooding and slips, with the potential for waterways to rise, MetService said.</p>

            <p>Makgabutlane also warned that the saturation of the ground across Tai Rāwhiti and Hawke's Bay could add to the effects from the heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>In Gisborne, Tairāwhiti Civil Defence's Ben Green said rain was steady overnight but no problems have been reported so far.</p>
