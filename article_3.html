            <p>His life's work has been all about collective action - so it is no surprise long-time union leader and pioneering health and safety campaigner Ross Wilson regards his New Year's Honour as "a recognition of the work of unions".</p>
        
            <p>Wilson (Ngāi Tahu), former president of the Council of Trade Unions, who has also served on a number of boards, including the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and WorkSafe, is being made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the trade union movement and workplace safety.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel a bit awkward about it, because my work has been an integral part of the work of the trade union movement for more than 40 years, so I'm kind of a bit inseparable from the work of unions," Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>"I see it as a recognition of the work of unions, rather than an individual."</p>
        
            <p>It was while working as a lawyer in the 1970s he found himself drawn into the union movement.</p>
        
            <p>"I was doing quite a lot of personal injury work on behalf of injured railway workers and post office workers and others, and I felt that I'd like to actually get to the source of the problem rather than dealing with the very distressing casualties of the system in those days - with shunters losing limbs and lives.</p>
        
            <p>"That motivated me strongly to go and work for one of the unions that happened to be my client at the time, the National Union of Railway Workers."</p>
        
            <p>From the 1970s, he led union campaigns for an improved ACC, and was ACC deputy chair from 1986 to 1991 and chair from 2007 to 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Between 1999 and 2007, he was president of the Council of Trade Unions.</p>
        
            <p>He was also the founding chair of Unions Aotearoa International Development Trust (UnionAID), and served as chief technical adviser for the International Labour Organisation in Myanmar in 2012/2013.</p>
        
            <p>As deputy chair and chair of WorkSafe, he played a key role in bringing together government, business, union and iwi to support new legislation and regulatory frameworks to improve workers' safety and health.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, he helped establish Iti Kōpara - Public Governance Aotearoa, an independent charitable trust providing professional training for current and future Crown entity board members.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had the privilege of being able to articulate and pursue and hopefully in some areas advance some matters I feel very passionate about - health and safety, accident entitlements for injured workers, collective bargaining rights for workers to improve their pay and conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Those values I hold very dear, and at times it's been a struggle for everybody, so an individual is unlikely to achieve much."</p>
