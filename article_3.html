            <p>The Manu World Championships is likely to be held indoors in Wellington from now on, its founder says.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a year since the nationwide diving competition had its first-ever weekend clouded by the death of a man just metres from the event's planned location.</p>
        
            <p>Jarreth Colquhoun, 33, died after jumping off a waterfront crane on 26 January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>His death was unrelated to the competition, but a rāhui saw it shifted at the last minute to the Wellington Regional Aquatic Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Event organiser Scott Rice said the aquatic centre was originally a back-up location, but it would now be the event's home as it offered an all-weather venue as well as a grandstand and great diving platform.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 competitors a day were expected to participate in this weekend's Wellington 'super qualifier', including former All Black Piri Weepu, who would compete at midday on Saturday.</p>

            <p>Another 200 people a day would take part in the free 'Push Play Manu' afternoon sessions, which gave participants the chance to pop a manu at the pool, Rice said.</p>
        
            <p>Now in its second year, the event has nearly doubled in size, from 1100 competitors in five regional heats in 2024 to about 1800 competitors in nine heats this year.</p>
        
            <p>Rice said the five qualifiers held so far this summer, in Tauranga, Hastings, Nelson, Māngere and Whangārei, had already drawn hundreds of competitors and spectators.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been heaps of fun, great talent in all the different regions and really good numbers turning up to each of those, knowing it was their ticket, perhaps, if they performed well, to the grand final."</p>
        
            <p>The final of the second Z Manu World Champs will be held in Auckland on 1 March.</p>
