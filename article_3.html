            <p>Police have warned people not to approach a dangerous, high-risk violent and sexual offender who cut off his ankle bracelet and went on the run.</p>
        
            <p>Leslie Peter Ross, 52, has a lengthy criminal history including kidnapping, rape and wounding with intent to injure.</p>
        
            <p>Ross recently told a Department of Corrections psychologist he had a "significant" number of other undetected crimes, including gang-related violence and coercive sex with intimate partners.</p>
        
            <p>"He is dangerous and should not be approached by members of the public," police said in an email releasing Ross's photograph to Open Justice.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Power member has connections to Whanganui and is barred from entering the Waikato district.</p>
        
            <p>Ross was on electronic monitoring while on prison release when he cut off his ankle bracelet on 29 September.</p>
        
            <p>A High Court judgment said the pyschologist assessed Ross as having a very high risk of committing another violent offence and a high risk of committing a further sexual offence.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard and approved an application from Corrections to impose an Interim Supervision Order (ISO) on Ross, to keep him under a probation officer's management until a court date in January to consider an Extended Supervision Order (ESO).</p>
        
            <p>An ESO can be imposed for up to 10 years to keep the highest-risk violent or sexual offenders under supervision.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Neil Campbell said that based on the psychologist's report, Ross' criminal history and his self-reported undetected offending, he was "provisionally satisfied that Mr Ross has had a pervasive pattern of serious sexual and violent offending".</p>
        
            <p>This persuaded him to make the ISO, even though Ross was not in court, whereabouts unknown.</p>
        
            <p>The conditions to be imposed on Ross, when he is located, include electronic monitoring, not to use alcohol or non-prescription drugs, and to tell a probation officer of any intimate relationship.</p>
        
            <p>He will also be barred from entering the Waikato district and from associating with any Black Power members.</p>
        
            <p>Police said anyone who saw Ross should call Police immediately on 111 and reference file number 230928/5362.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about where he is was urged to contact Police or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
