            <p>Dunedin's Holly Robinson has won her first Paralympic shot put bronze medal in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>At her fourth appearance at the Games Robinson adds to the two javelin medals she has won at the last two Paralympics.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson's medal-winning throw of 11.88 metres came on her final of six attempts in the F46 shot put final at Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old fouled her first throw, bounced back with a 11.46m with her second attempt, threw 11.72m with her third attempt and marginally bettered that by 1cm with her fourth before her fifth throw went 11.59m and her final throw sealed a podium spot.</p>
        
            <p>American Noelle Malkamaki won the gold medal with a world record throw of 14.06m and Ukraine's Mariia Shpatkivska took silver with 12.35m.</p>
        
            <p>Malkamaki was a long way ahead of the rest of the field with all of her six throws going beyond 13m.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year at the Para Athletics World Championships Robinson bettered her national record with a throw of 12.25m to take silver in the women's shot F46.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson will also compete in the women's javelin F46 at Paris 2024.</p>
