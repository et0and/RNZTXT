            <p>Vandals have ripped out $2000 worth of nikau palms at New Plymouth's Pukekura Park.</p>
        
            <p>The palms - some standing more than a metre tall - have been pulled out of the ground in recent weeks, the New Plymouth District Council said.</p>
        
            <p>"These are heavy nikau palms - it would have taken a lot of effort to remove them and it's just so brazen," Pukekura Park curator Sheryl Clyma said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're developing these areas for the community to enjoy, and the staff are really disheartened to see their work destroyed."</p>
        
            <p>Two sets of park gates in the city have also been damaged in the past week.</p>
        
            <p>On 6 November the gates at the entrance to East End Reserve were rammed by a car, while on the following day a car hit the entrance sign at Bromley Place Reserve. Repairs to both were likely to cost about $2500, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>Vandalism costs the New Plymouth council about $100,000 in repairs annually, it said.</p>
