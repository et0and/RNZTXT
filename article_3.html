        <h2>US approves plan to strike Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials say</h2>
        <p>
The strikes would take place over a number of days, officials say, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.

            <p>The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.</p>
        
            <p>The strikes would take place over a number of days, officials say, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, near the Syrian border, on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The US has blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for the attack.</p>
        
            <p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq - which is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force - has said it was responsible for the strike.</p>
        
            <p>Iran has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base.</p>
        
            <p>While US officials have pledged to respond to the drone attack, President Joe Biden and other officials have said the country is not seeking a wider war with Iran.</p>
        
            <p>Several Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.</p>
        
            <p>The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies.</p>
        
            <p>A US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea.</p>
        
            <p>The bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend.</p>
