            <p>NZME is proposing to shut down 14 of its community newspapers.</p>
        
            <p>Local papers on the chopping block include the more than 100-year-old Te Awamutu Courier.</p>

            <p>"Although NZME has performed well, we are not immune to the impacts of a weaker market."</p>
        
            <p>It said the Waikato Herald and The Weekend Sun would not be included in the cuts.</p>

            <p>"The Weekend Sun is not included because of its scale, reach, digital offering, and potential to consolidate audiences and revenues."</p>
