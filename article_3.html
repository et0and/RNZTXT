            <p>Two police officers have been critically injured at an event in Nelson early on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Another person was seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said a vehicle driven by a member of the public hit a police vehicle at a gathering in the Buxton Square Carpark at 2.10am.</p>
        
            <p>"Two police officers were critically injured and one member of the public was seriously injured as a result," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A video of the incident on the New Zealand Herald shows a white vehicle driving at police officers, who were outside their vehicle at the time.</p>
        
            <p>St John said three ambulances, two rapid response vehicles and an operations manager attended, with the two officers taken to Nelson Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the vehicle was arrested and will face charges, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said Buxton Square was cordoned while a scene examination was conducted.</p>
        
            <p>I’m travelling to Nelson following the tragic incident this morning. This is devastating and heartbreaking for family, friends, the Police family and for the country to wake up to news like this.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said on X that he was travelling to Nelson following the "tragic incident".</p>
        
            <p>"This is devastating and heartbreaking for family, friends, the police family and for the country to wake up to news like this."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Mayor Nick Smith called the incident "an absolute tragic start to the new year".</p>
        
            <p>Smith said he had been in touch with the local regional commander, and Chambers had left his holiday to come down and provide support.</p>
        
            <p>"The awful aspect of this attack is that we rely on police to keep events like our New Year's Eve celebration safe, and when officers are injured in the course of doing that work just makes it all the more awful.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with them as they are treated at Nelson Hospital, and our council is providing every support to the police and providing both the support for the families but also ensuring that those responsible for this attack are held to account."</p>
        
            <p>The police association declined to comment.</p>
