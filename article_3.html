            <p>It’s fun to be part of a band that’s still evolving on their eighth album, says Crowded House frontman Neil Finn.</p>
        
            <p>The iconic band - now featuring three Finn family members - experiments with psychedelia on their new album Gravity Stairs.</p>
        
            <p>“It's something we can't be too deliberate about, but it just seems to be evolving in a nice way to take people on a bit of a trip as it were,” Neil Finn tells Charlotte Ryan.</p>
        
            <p>Although he’s “pretty restless” in terms of musical collaboration, Crowded House is a brilliant vehicle for delivering new songs, Finn says.</p>
        
            <p>Alongside his current Crowded House bandmates - sons Liam Finn (guitar) and Elroy Finn (drums), original member Nick Seymour (bass) and long-time member Mitchell Froom (keyboards) - doing music videos and promotion is a lot more enjoyable, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“You can sit around and subvert the process as a band. When you're solo, you feel quite… sometimes it feels a little bit earnest and a bit lonely. So having a band is fantastic.”</p>

            <p>Gravity Stairs takes its name from the nickname for an actual staircase Finn regularly climbs while on family holidays in Greece.</p>
        
            <p>“It's a particularly heavy staircase that we've struggled up many times with suitcases and it just always feels like it's got double gravity on it … We imagine that it opens up into the underworld and they're trying to pull you down. </p>
        
            <p>“Quite often I'm ascending the stairs, coming up from dinner, and I hear the sound of bazookas… It's kind of a magic thing and it draws you forward.”</p>
        
            <p>To Finn, the idea of a staircase with its own gravitational pull represents the struggle to be creative and also to find something like enlightenment. </p>
        
            <p>“It's [about] the mechanics of living, which involve every day getting out of bed and actually having the will to push on through.”</p>
        
            <p>A lot of Individual and team effort is required to pull a Crowded House album together these days, Finn says, as the band members are scattered between Auckland, London, Ireland and LA.</p>
        
            <p>The upside of this distance is that members get a chance to work their musical ideas through in their own environments, he says, as opposed to a recording studio where they might get “rubbished” within five minutes.</p>
        
            <p>“[Remote recording] has got mixed blessings as people work for two days on a really obscure idea and then it gets passed over and they feel sort of crushed. Sometimes it slows down the process, so it is difficult.”</p>

            <p>The process of creating music can be both “really, really difficult” and “really easy,” Finn says, and the secret ingredient is simply showing up.</p>
        
            <p>“The magic strikes every now and again inspiration comes once in a while but turning up every day improves your odds. </p>
        
            <p>“I learned a long time ago that endurance is probably the most important thing. I have natural talent that I was given but that can be squandered, and you can languish.</p>
        
            <p>“On the one hand, music is so, so cosmically insignificant, but unless you feel like it's the most important thing in the world, you'll never get anything done.”</p>
        
            <p>Music is also one of the few things that almost everybody on the world can agree on, he says - “It's got value and it’s healing.”</p>
        
            <p>Although Finn admits to being “slightly sick of” a couple of songs from the Crowded House catalogue, he’s glad to still enjoys singing the band’s hits.</p>
        
            <p>To his own ear, Finn’s singing voice has changed over the decades.</p>
        
            <p>“When I'm listening to the older Crowded House songs, I've got a certain adenoidal sound in my voice, and I sound like I'm singing really hard. Whereas now I think I've got more control over my voice, which is lovely, and I've got more range. I can sing higher and go lower so that's nice to know. Hope it lasts.”</p>
        
            <p>For Finn, the business of writing song lyric is an “unconscious” process in which he explores words and ideas which might foster human connection.</p>
        
            <p>“I sort of thread things together, hoping to provoke some or evoke some empathy, I suppose. You know when you feel a connection to the song you're singing that it's got a possibility for making people feel connection to other people. You hope for that, that's a really nice outcome, if that's the case. </p>
        
            <p>“If music can serve to accompany important things for people and bring people back to the important things, loving and living, then it feels incredibly worthwhile.” </p>
        
            <p>That the same song that helps someone “going through a really awful time” can be the soundtrack to another person’s joy is a mystery he enjoys.</p>
        
            <p>“I leave things a little bit open-ended in my songs, in part so that people can see them or hear them the way they want to.”</p>
