            <p>Since 1924, St Kevin's Arcade in Auckland has been a mecca for retail, hospitality and inner city culture.</p>
        
            <p>The K Road arcade attracts 50,000 monthly visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Broadcaster and history fan Hamish Williams said it was a special place where people from all walks of life intersect.</p>
        
            <p>People in Auckland can learn about St Kevin's Arcade's fascinating 100-year history at free evening audio tours he will be hosting until Friday 11 October.</p>
        
            <p>"Come over the next three weekends, get some headphones, go for a little walk through and discover that St Kevin's Arcade has got the most incredible history," he told Mark Leishman.</p>
        
            <p>Hamish Williams hosts the recent podcast Tangiwai: A Forgotten History.</p>
        
            <p>From the 1920s through to the 1960s, St Kevin's Arcade was Auckland's premier shopping destination, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Over the decades, many different businesses have come and gone from the arcade but current tenants include the heritage burger bar The White Lady and new music venue Double Whammy!.</p>

            <p>For Williams what really makes St Kevin's Arcade special is how its windows beautifully frame a view of nearby Myers Park and the Auckland cityscape.</p>
        
            <p>Originally built as tea rooms, the arcade's beautiful park view was central to its design, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sit around, have a cup of tea, have a lamington and some lunch â€¦ That was a big attraction for people to come to this oasis in the middle of a vastly expanding city."</p>

            <p>St Kevin's Arcade stands on a strip of land that was once on the grounds of St Keven's House - a grand mansion built by in 1848 by English entrepreneur George Nathan.</p>
        
            <p>St Keven's - which featured vast gardens and tennis courts - shared the hillside with a neighbouring mansion called Verona (site of the current K Road cafe and name-checked in a 2003 Elemeno P) single.</p>
        
            <p>In 1918, after K Road became too busy and noisy for the Nathan family, they "upped sticks and left.", Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>When their mansion was demolished in 1920, a "massive retail opportunity" emerged on K Road.</p>
        
            <p>"The mansion house that was known as St Keven's with an 'E' was torn down and St Kevin's Arcade with an 'I' was born."</p>
        
            <p>Visitors to St Kevin's Arcade can share memories, drawings and wishes for the future in the FUTURE PRESENT PAST Time Capsule until 13 October.</p>
