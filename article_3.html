        <h2>Fuel problem behind Bluebridge ferry woes - harbourmaster</h2>
        <p>
The Connemara blacked out in September after leaving Wellington and drifted for more than two hours, and has faced more issues since then.

            <p>A problem with fuel appears to be the cause of a Bluebridge ferry losing power in the Cook Strait last month.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington harbourmaster Grant Nalder said there were "early indications" from Bluebridge owner StraitNZ that fuel played a part.</p>
        
            <p>That has been backed up by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, which said StraitNZ has advised "that they believe fuel issues may have been a contributing factor in the Connemara losing power".</p>
        
            <p>Both Nalder and MBIE said it was under investigation.</p>
        
            <p>That investigation is being run by Maritime NZ, and it is still ongoing. It could take a year, the regulator said.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest in a series of disruptions, delays and issues with Cook Strait ferries.</p>

            <p>The Connemara again lost power in Wellington harbour on Friday night, though at the time deputy harbourmaster Patrick Atwood told RNZ that was a different problem, and nothing to do with fuel.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge said there was "a minor operational incident that delayed berthing".</p>
        
            <p>And on Sunday night, a return freight sailing of the Connemara between Wellington and Picton was cancelled due to engineering checks in port taking longer than expected.</p>
        
            <p>The Connemara should be sailing again on Monday evening, Nalder said.</p>
        
            <p>Until Monday, StraitNZ had declined to comment on what caused the blackout, citing the ongoing investigation. A spokesperson told RNZ it would provide a statement on Monday, but did not respond by deadline.</p>
        
            <p>But Nalder said StraitNZ knew what the problem was, and had resolved it - otherwise the Connemara would not be sailing.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not going to steam round for a year wondering why the engine stopped, they're going to sort that out a lot sooner than that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to know pretty much straight away, why was this a problem and how do we fix it."</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said as far as he knew, there was not a problem with the supplied fuel - rather, it was "something that happened when the fuel got to them" - how the fuel interacted with machinery on board.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing's been indicated to me that there's a broader problem, and I suspect if they thought it was a problem in what was supplied to them, there would have been a lot more focus on that."</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail has confirmed the Interislander has not had any issues with fuel on its vessels.</p>
