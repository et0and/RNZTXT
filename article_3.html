        <h2>Defence minister defends defence force: 'Out there with our tails up'</h2>
        <p>
While the NZDF deals with budget issues, lagging equipment, and the Manawanui aftermath, Judith Collins makes it clear it still has her support. Audio

            <p>Parliament is in the thick of scrutiny week.</p>
        
            <p>There have been hours and hours of questioning from each of the 12 subject select committees as they work their way through the annual performance reviews of their chosen government entities.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the officials and ministers fronting up to their relevant committees will have left relatively unscathed, or enjoying the collaborative discussion; while others, navigating more belligerent interrogation, may feel the seconds went by like minutes.</p>
        
            <p>One major marker of difference can be between two kinds of entities. Often portfolios that deal with uniformed service people, be it police, defence, customs or the like, attract ministers who project themselves as unwavering champions of the entities they represent, fighting in the trenches and batting away any criticism of their personnel.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, in a more policy-oriented ministry, a minister might feel less ownership, less front-line camaraderie. Officials might even be seen as causing problems, and get blamed for mishaps.</p>
        
            <p>In her annual review appearance Judith Collins showed she is in the former camp of ministers (at least in her minister of defence role), showing an assertive defence of Defence.</p>
        
            <p>She has previously held the police portfolio, where she earned a reputation for a similar approach, not to mention a nickname.</p>
