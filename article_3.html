            <p>The Black Caps have made a horror start to their first innings slumping to 42-5 at tea on day two of the first test against Australia in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing Australia's first innings total of 383, New Zealand were soon reduced to 12-3 with Tom Latham out for five and Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra both dismissed for ducks.</p>
        
            <p>In trying to get off the mark Williamson had a mid-pitch collision with teammate Will Young and was run out from a direct hit.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell (11) was the next to go as New Zealand found themselves 29-4.</p>
        
            <p>Young (9) followed the very next ball strangled down the leg side, New Zealand crumbling to 29-5.</p>
        
            <p>At the break Glen Phillips was on 8 and Tom Blundell 5.</p>
        
            <p>The wickets have been shared around the Australian pace bowlers wtih Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazelwood, Pat Cummins and Michell Marsh all taking a wicket apiece.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a rough day for the home side.</p>
        
            <p>In the first session Australia posted a record tenth wicket partnership against New Zealand in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Resuming on day two at 279-9, Cameron Green and Josh Hazelwood put on 116 for the last wicket with Hazelwood the last batter out making 22 and Green finishing unbeaten on 174 - his highest test score.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Henry was the most successful of the New Zealand bowlers with 5 for 70.</p>

            <p>Will O'Rourke and Scott Kuggeleijn took 2-87 and 2-70 respectively while Rachin Ravindra took 1-24.</p>
        
            <p>There were 41 extras in Australia's total which will be of concern to the Black Caps with 20 of these being wides.</p>
