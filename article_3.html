            <p>The mayor of Auckland has taken a swipe at critics in his Christmas message.</p>
        
            <p>In a post to social media, Wayne Brown said he had made the video "against his better judgement".</p>
        
            <p>"Against my better judgement... I sifted through the comment section to see what gifts of feedback you had for me this year.</p>
        
            <p>"From the good and the bad, to the downright bizarre. There's enough opinions on here to build a second Harbour Crossing out of sheer hot air.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's end 2024 with a chuckle and a reminder that democracy isn't always polite, but it's never boring.</p>
        
            <p>"Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."</p>

            <p>In the video, Brown responded to online trolls, beginning with a tweet from @BitBull82 that read, "You are a complete disappointment."</p>
        
            <p>"Well, you're a bit of a dick, mate," Brown responded back.</p>
        
            <p>A comment on Facebook from Alex Ratszor said, "My rates bill keeps going up, so does my desire to leave Auckland; NZ too."</p>
        
            <p>In which Brown responded, "Well, goodbye, Alex. Hop down to Wellington where your rates have gone up 25 percent."</p>
        
            <p>In another comment on Reddit, james_cdvm posted, "How many days can Wayne Brown go without saying stupid?"</p>
        
            <p>Brown responded: "I think he meant, how many days can I go without listening to somebody stupid, which is you, James."</p>
        
            <p>On a more positive note, a tweet from @DarthVadered read, "I used to dislike you but now i think i like you Mayor Brown."</p>
        
            <p>While another tweet from @Deez_Nuts_MF read, "How the ... are you still mayor you pathetic old wanker?"</p>
        
            <p>And part of a message from Warren Wilson read "...I live in Auckland but manage to pay not a cent to the council in rates and in fact if I want to leave my rubbish dumped around the place as a protest you can't stop me and if I want to tip waste oil in to a drain as a protest you can't stop me..."</p>
        
            <p>"God almighty, I'm not going to read this crap," Brown responded.</p>
        
            <p>Jason Baz Jones commented, "Mayor "Back Door" Brown. Not an ounce of business acumen" - to which Brown responded, "I haven't got much business acumen. I turned down what I was earning to come in as mayor and rescue drongos like you."</p>
        
            <p>A tweet from @Tammy13579Tammy read, "Can you please be mayor of Wellington - even one day a week?"</p>
        
            <p>Brown replied, "I'm sorry, Tammy, if you're in Wellington, your best chance is to leave."</p>
        
            <p>Another tweet from @MSweetaz read, "Do us a favour and just ... right off back to whatever hole you crawled out of."</p>
        
            <p>"Jeez, where do these people come from?" Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>A tweet from @HarryJonesOZ read, "Could demolish the entire North Shore and turn it into a cycle park. Then no bridge or tunnel needed. It's as boring as f&&k anyway so won't be missed. Sure fire election winner."</p>
        
            <p>"Blimming heck, there's, I don't know, some mad people in Auckland," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>The final message read was a tweet from @Stormingdino, "You're still a wanker. But well done. Credit where credits dude [sic]. Dudes growing on me."</p>
        
            <p>"Well, that's enough of that. I didn't realise there's so many idiots wasting their time sending this stuff in," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"But there you go. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm off to have a beer."</p>
