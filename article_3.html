            <p>Prince William said the past year had probably been the "hardest" of his life after a difficult period for Britain's royal family in which both his father King Charles and wife Kate were diagnosed with cancer.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to British media at the end of a visit to South Africa, the heir to the throne reflected on how he was coping while balancing his duties as a royal with family time, the BBC and other publications reported on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Asked how his year has been, William said: "Honestly? It's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."</p>
        
            <p>Charles is undergoing treatment for cancer which was diagnosed in February, although he recently travelled to Australia and Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>Kate, 42, underwent preventative chemotherapy for cancer this year, and she has previously described an "incredibly tough" year for the family.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done," William said. "But from a personal family point of view, it's been brutal."</p>

            <p>William hosted the annual awards ceremony for his multimillion-dollar Earthshot Prize in South Africa, making the trip without Kate who is still recovering from her treatment. He said on Wednesday she was doing "really well".</p>
        
            <p>Asked about his role as Prince of Wales, William said: "It's very important with my role and my platform that I'm doing something for good. That I'm helping people's lives and I'm doing something that is genuinely meaningful.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy my work and I enjoy pacing myself and keeping sure that I have got time for my family too."</p>
        
            <p>The prince, who has been sporting a beard since the summer, said his nine-year-old daughter hadn't been a fan.</p>
        
            <p>"Well Charlotte didn't like it the first time," he said. "I got floods of tears, so I had to shave it off. And then I grew it back. I thought, hang on a second, and I convinced her it was going to be okay."</p>
