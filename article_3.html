            <p>At least 20 people have been killed and hundreds of women and children displaced after four days of clashes between two clans living close to the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea's Enga Province.</p>
        
            <p>The fighting is believed to have started following a dispute between illegal miners.</p>
        
            <p>The violence further escalated overnight when one of the clans attacked the other living nearest to the mine site. Several more people were killed in the attack.</p>
        
            <p>A senior member of the Porgera community, who did want to be named, said: "This level of violence is unprecedented. Random people are being killed and criminal elements have taken control of the town."</p>
        
            <p>Multiple buildings were set on fire as retaliatory attacks continued on Sunday morning. Operations at the Porgera mine have been suspended.</p>
        
            <p>Workers at the mine were ordered into the mine's squash courts for safety, with many expressing fear for their lives.</p>
        
            <p>Women and children nearest to the mine fled into the camp area housing local workers. Dozens more have sought refuge at the Mountain Lodge, a motel near the mine site. Others were transported in tipper trucks to other locations away from the fighting.</p>
        
            <p>Currently there are 122 security personnel on the ground, including members of mobile squads and PNG Defence force.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer and community leader Lakis Ruing said police and military personnel were outnumbered and unable to adequately contain the fighting.</p>
        
            <p>"We need leadership. We need the government to send more police and military to quell the fighting."</p>
        
            <p>Late on Saturday night Police Commissioner David Manning issued emergency orders to authorise the use of force, as well as additional police to protect "critical infrastructure" and residents who are being "terrorised and attacked by illegal miners".</p>
        
            <p>"Porgera station is declared a non-access area for all persons not resident. A curfew is in effect between 6am to 8am across the Porgera Valley and this will be enforced without exception," the commissioner said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not accept such terrorism by those infiltrating the Porgera valley."</p>
