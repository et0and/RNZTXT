            <p>Much time in our lives can be spent on trying to figuring out how to get from A to B - for Jabali the giraffe, that included creating a new and bespoke trailer.</p>
        
            <p>Jabali was born nearly two years ago, the offspring of female Kiraka and male Billy, and was the tallest giraffe at birth Auckland zoo keepers could recall.</p>
        
            <p>They believed he had inherited the tall genes of his grandfather.</p>
        
            <p>"Transporting a giraffe is really tricky," said Auckland Zoo's deputy curator of mammals Amy Robbins.</p>
        
            <p>She told Midday Report it was important to transport giraffes as early as possible, before they got too tall.</p>

            <p>"Males can get in the excess of five metres, so that would be logistically impossible to drive a five metre giraffe down the road to Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to do it while Jabali was still a reasonable height."</p>
        
            <p>The bespoke transport trailer has an extendable roof, could also be used for zebra, waterbuck, nyala and other ungulate species, and could take a total weight of 1850kg.</p>
        
            <p>Robbins said Jabali was "incredible" during the journey.</p>
        
            <p>"He was so calm, so relaxed, very chilled out, just took it all in his stride.</p>
        
            <p>"I drove behind him the whole way and he just stood facing out the back ... there's a little area where he can see out the back ... and it didn't seem to bother him at all."</p>
        
            <p>Robbins credited Jabali's keepers who spent a long time helping him to get used to the trailer.</p>

            <p>"He's just a really lovely little giraffe as well."</p>
        
            <p>She said once he got to Hamilton Zoo, he stayed in his trailer for about 40 minutes before he stepped out to explore his new home.</p>
        
            <p>Jabali was joining a bachelor herd of giraffes at Hamilton Zoo and would continue to play a vital advocacy role for his species.</p>
