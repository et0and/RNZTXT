            <p>Scrapping kaupapa Māori-focused jobs at Oranga Tamariki will gut the agency of decades of cultural expertise, the Public Service Association says.</p>
        
            <p>The agency is proposing to scrap 21 Māori specialist roles as part of a wider restructure, including a number of senior, regional treaty advisory positions.</p>
        
            <p>Specialist roles proposed to be disestablished are:</p>
        
            <p>These positions fit within organisation's total proposed cut of 632 roles, including 447 jobs cuts and 70 already vacant roles - with 185 new roles to be created.</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Association (PSA) kaihautū Māori Janice Panoho said the cuts would diminish the agency's ability to grow its understanding of te ao Māori and would have long-lasting impacts on Māori communities for years to come.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important in terms of developing work, projects that come out, and listening to our people's concerns," Panoho said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to know who's going to do this work within the organisation. Who's going to actually provide this support and advice for our Māori communities?"</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki's consultation document states "our approach to Te Ao Māori has now reached a state of maturity that means we can move to the next stage of cultural capability development".</p>
        
            <p>Panoho said that was "simply wrong" and achieving cultural capability was a long process of continued improvement.</p>
        
            <p>"Any type of training with new staff - and even existing staff - is on-going. You're always wanting improve and build. You learn new things as you go along, like any organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"This should be standard practice and built into an organisation through continual training and development for new and existing staff so they keep improving how they deliver their work."</p>
        
            <p>Maintaining a well-organised team of Māori specialists was essential, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Cutting back on jobs will have a devastating effect on our communities. These cuts are ruthless and rushed and will potentially inflict profound and long-lasting impacts on Māori and all New Zealanders for years to come.</p>
        
            <p>"The affected agencies provide a critical role in providing support for the most vulnerable members of our society. Our children, our young people, particularly those from Māori, Pasifika, immigrant and disabled communities."</p>
        
            <p>Looming job cuts and the potential removal of section 7AA from the Oranga Tamariki Act had left Māori within the organisation feeling "devastated", Panoho said.</p>
        
            <p>"It seeks to develop strategic partnerships with iwi Māori and Māori organisations, including iwi authorities. I don't know how this is going to happen if you get rid of all your expertise within an organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some really serious concern from iwi Māori. Now that we've heard the national hui is going to be heard in Hastings by iwi leaders, these are the issues we should be addressing.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by RNZ what cultural capability the agency would have should the cuts be made, Oranga Tamariki said it would not comment on specific roles while formal consultation was underway.</p>
