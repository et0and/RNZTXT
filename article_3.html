            <p>The National Party's caucus and members are gathering in Auckland for its annual general meeting.</p>
        
            <p>It is the party's first big conference since they formed a government with ACT and New Zealand First after last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the coalition has progressed a suite of policies in health, housing, education and law and order.</p>
        
            <p>It has scrapped a lot of work the former Labour government started, and tax cuts - the centrepiece of National's election campaign - kicked in this week.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent 1News Verian poll, out in late June, had National as the highest polling party at 38 percent of the general vote.</p>
        
            <p>Its coalition partners ACT and New Zealand First came in on 7 and 6 percent respectively; numbers that would see the coalition re-elected.</p>
        
            <p>National's AGM this weekend will be hosted at the Due Drop Events Centre in Manukau; ticketed at $350 per person and $175 for Young Nats members.</p>
        
            <p>Attendees will hear speeches on Saturday from National Party leader Christopher Luxon, deputy leader Nicola Willis and party president Sylvia Wood.</p>
        
            <p>An economic panel discussion with National Ministers, board elections and 'a conversation' with Luxon and a surprise special guest will follow.</p>
        
            <p>The three-year terms of National Party board members Jannita Pilisi, David Ryan, Stefan Sunde and Sylvia Wood come to an end this year.</p>
        
            <p>The Board Appointments Committee has approved Pilisi, Ryan, Sunde, Wood and Grant Knight as the five candidates for these four positions.</p>
        
            <p>The weekend's programme will also feature panel discussions on health, education, justice, agriculture and infrastructure, housing, building and construction.</p>
        
            <p>It will be Luxon's first annual general meeting as prime minister and his third AGM since becoming National Party leader in November 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He was asked what his message to National Party members would be this weekend at Monday's weekly post-Cabinet media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"Look, it's a government focused on action and delivery. That's what New Zealanders put us in government to do and that's what we're continuing to do.</p>
        
            <p>"We've done a lot in a short period of time. We've got a lot more to do but again, the mantra and the message will remain unchanged: we are here to turn the country around."</p>
