            <p>King Country shearer Sacha Bond has taken out a world record by becoming the first woman to shear more than 700 sheep in a nine-hour day.</p>
        
            <p>Bond smashed the current record of 661 with a total of 720 at Centre Hill in Southland on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Shearing a lamb every 45 seconds, she also became the first woman to shear 700 sheep in a day.</p>
        
            <p>Starting at 5am, Bond was always six or seven sheep per hour ahead of the pace of the 661 shorn by Southland shear Megan Whitehead in January 2021 - breezing into the record books with about 45 minutes to go.</p>
        
            <p>There was more in the tank for 30-year-old mum who on 9 February 2024 will tackle the ewes record of 452 in a bid to become the first female to hold solo record for nine hours on both lambs and ewes.</p>
        
            <p>Shearing Sports New Zealand spokesperson Doug Laing said Bond made it look easy.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day she was going a bit quicker than the start of the day but a lot of hard work went into preparing for the record, a lot of training to make sure she was physically fit.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a quiet couple of years with Covid so now we're seeing a lot of attempts and records being broken."</p>
        
            <p>Laing said a few years ago, 700 in a day would not have even been a thought so everyone who watched the record yesterday was blown away.</p>
