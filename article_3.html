            <p>Te Kūiti has opened its main street to welcome a herd of hundreds of sheep running the gauntlet, for its annual Great New Zealand Muster festival.</p>
        
            <p>The event promised musicians, arts and crafts stalls, food and activities for children, as well as the main spectacle, with its flock of hoofed festival-goers running along crowds of cheering on-lookers.</p>
        
            <p>The event returned last year, after an absence while health and safety concerns were addressed - though a Liquorland store saw an unusual 'ram raid' when a breakaway group of sheep entered the store and took some time to disperse, during the 2024 event, Stuff reported at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson, who took part being driven along the muster's corridor, said it was a celebration of sheep, farmers, and the role they play in New Zealand communities and our economy.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a swing back to natural fibres - we're seeing good gains, with strong wool price steadily increasing over the last 18 months to be now sitting around $4 per kg (clean), which is an eight-year high.</p>
        
            <p>"The recent bar that we have crossed is that wool prices now cover the shearing costs, which is something that we have been working hard at to change, but we know there is much more to be done. I am more confident than ever that we can turn around the fortunes of wool."</p>
        
            <p>The event runs alongside The New Zealand Shearing Championships, also being held in Te Kūiti, which started on Thursday, with awards on Saturday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Organiser, Doug Laing from Shearing Sports NZ, told RNZ that shearing competitions have been seen an "almost feverish" volume of young people taking their first steps at shearing competitions this year, with many young women taking part.</p>

            <p>Patterson said wool exports were worth $549 million to the economy in the year to 30 June 2024 - an increase from $513 million in the year before.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand wool was once the backbone of New Zealand's economy and I remain excited about the future of the wool industry as we tap into new high value opportunities," he said.</p>
