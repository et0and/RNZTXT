            <p>The abandoned Reading Cinema site in the centre of Wellington is for sale.</p>
        
            <p>The Courtenay Place property, which has 1.5 hectares of freehold land on the capital's sought-after Golden Mile, was listed on One Roof by JLL on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of the last privately owned development properties in central Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The cinema complex was shut in 2019 due to its earthquake risk.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council worked on a $32 million deal with Reading Cinema to buy the land under the property and lease it back to the company, but that was axed in April.</p>
        
            <p>The One Roof listing described the property as "Wellington's most important development opportunity", boasting "unlimited potential for developers with vision".</p>
        
            <p>JLL New Zealand managing director Todd Lauchlan said the new height limit for the site was 42.5 metres.</p>
        
            <p>"A development at this full height would achieve priceless views over Wellington Harbour and to the northern ranges for potential residential, hotel or office uses."</p>
        
            <p>The area was also due to benefit from Wellington City Council and New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi's planned Golden Mile revitalisation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>That would "[breathe] new life into the CBD and create a more vibrant, hospitable place to work and play".</p>
        
            <p>JLL New Zealand's head of capital markets Jonathan Ogg told One Roof the incoming owner could benefit from the growing demand for residential and office property in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Prime office vacancy in Wellington was sitting at just 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, and average rents in the city increased 3.1 percent quarter-on-quarter in April, he said.</p>
        
            <p>That was the third highest in the country, behind only Auckland and Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>"These factors represent an opportunity for a developer to create an appealing mixed-use precinct in a rarely available location."</p>
        
            <p>JLL was calling for international expressions of interest until 15 August, unless the site was sold prior.</p>
