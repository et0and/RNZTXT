            <p>Vocal crowds have turned out to greet Te Hīkoi mō te Tiriti on its first day as it arrives in Kawakawa, after setting out from the Far North this morning and travelling along State Highway 10 and through Kaitaia and Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>In the townships and roads approaching Kawakawa, people stood on the sides of the road, waving flags, cheering and holding up placards.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reporter Peter de Graaf said - as with the "upbeat and energised" crowds in Kaitaia, there was a festive atmosphere despite the seriousness of the kaupapa - opposing the Treaty Principles Bill. Hundreds were lining the main street, vehicles tooting, music playing, flags held aloft and school children practising waiata in the town ātea (square). Musician Troy Kingi and former National MP Marilyn Waring were among the crowds.</p>
        
            <p>There has been an: "Absolutely spine tingling, ground-shaking haka pōwhiri by about 200 school children, as the hīkoi is led onto Kawakawa's town square by kaumatua Hirini Henare," de Graaf says. Hīkoi leader Eru Kapa-Kingi and Hirini Henare then addressed the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi is expected to reach Whangārei by 6pm on Monday - the first overnight stop on the journey to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, leaders of a hīkoi against David Seymour's Treaty Principles Bill have rejected the ACT leader's offer of a meeting as they set off for Wellington.</p>
