        <h2>'It would be awful': Wellington's Begonia House faces demolition</h2>
        <p>
The landmark glasshouse in the city's botanic garden needs replacing rather than being "patched up", councillors have been told.

            <p>A landmark building housing Wellington's winter gardens faces demolition as the city's council looks to save money as part of its long-term plan amendment.</p>
        
            <p>Begonia House, built in 1960, contains exotic plants and is used for events such as weddings.</p>
        
            <p>At a meeting on Wednesday, councillors were advised that instead of upgrading the glass and brick structure, it should be demolished due to safety hazards.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief operating officer James Roberts said much of Begonia House was at the end of its life, and needed replacing rather than being "patched up".</p>
        
            <p>It was badly damaged in storms this winter, he added.</p>

            <p>Councillor Iona Pannett asked Roberts if Wellingtonians would now have to travel overseas to see exotic plants.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not being facetious [but] if we're not going to have exotic plants in Wellington, will people have to go overseas to see them?"</p>
        
            <p>Roberts said that if the building was demolished that was "correct - but it's not the end of exotic plants."</p>
        
            <p>"So where would they be?" asked Pannett.</p>
        
            <p>Roberts: "Um, outdoors?"</p>
        
            <p>The recommendation to demolish the building is one of five options to be provided to councillors in a business case, Roberts said.</p>
        
            <p>Sited next to the Lady Norwood Rose Garden in the city's botanic gardens, the building is part of a heritage area.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors were told it was not a listed building but would need resource consent to remove it.</p>
        
            <p>If Begonia House was demolished the adjoining Picnic Cafe and its kitchen would remain.</p>
        
            <p>One couple at the botanic gardens said they came to Begonia House every day and were "appalled by the idea".</p>
        
            <p>Keith said he was "absolutely incredulous" at the idea that "an iconic part of Wellington" could be demolished.</p>
        
            <p>"But maybe [it's] typical of what's going on in Wellington at the moment. We just don't seem to have any plan or anything which is good for the future of Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>"I can't believe it, it would be awful if it was taken down," Wendy said.</p>
        
            <p>"We come here every day, we love it. I love everything about it, it would be awful.</p>
        
            <p>"What would replace it, would it be laid bare?"</p>
