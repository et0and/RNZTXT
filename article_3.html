        <h2>NZDF gets creative for Gallipoli Anzac Day ceremony</h2>
        <p>
Described as a "fantastic representation", the NZDF contingent made do with a loaned cornet and resized uniforms after their luggage was lost in Dubai.

            <p>A commander involved in Anzac Day services in Gallipoli is proud of his contingent for rising to the challenge after their luggage was lost in transit.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Defence Force representatives played a full part in the ceremonies, despite earlier uncertainty after uniforms and instruments went missing during the Dubai floods last week.</p>
        
            <p>But Major Peter Bowyer said Kiwi ingenuity got them through, with the uniforms they did have being swapped and resized.</p>
        
            <p>"As the commander, I'm just so proud of the contingent for what they've done. There were some challenges but I think we've [made] a fantastic representation."</p>
        
            <p>The uniforms they did get back in time were swapped and resized, as members without roles in the ceremony wore civilian clothes, Bowyer said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Anzac spirit helped ensure the Royal New Zealand Navy's bugle player could perform The Last Post.</p>
        
            <p>Able musician Orson Paine's bugle never made it, but a member of the Australia Defence Force band loaned him their cornet, Bowyer said.</p>
        
            <p>Traditionally The Last Post is played on a bugle, but he said Paine was a professional.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a very capable musician and I'm sure he would have provided a very good Last Post ... on anything."</p>
