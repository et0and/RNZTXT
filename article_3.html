        <h2>A cut above - couple making 'one of a kind' knives with deer antlers</h2>
        <p>
Jacinda and Richy Sheridan have carved out a niche for themselves, making hunting and farm knives using deer antlers.

            <p>What started as a hobby for Richy Sheridan while managing sheep and beef farms along the East Coast, soon turned into a business that keeps both him and his wife Jacinda busy.</p>
        
            <p>The couple operate Sheridan Hunting Knives, making farm and hunting knives using deer antlers for the handles, from a spare shed which overlooks the surrounding bush at their Motu home.</p>

            <p>Richy manages the 470-hectare property on behalf of Integrated Foods Limited, along with another block closer to town, but it's this farm which sits above the Motu falls off State Highway 2 between Gisborne and WhakatƒÅne that the couple love most.</p>
        
            <p>"I like it here because it's an isolated block. It suits me, it suits my lifestyle," Richy told Country Life. "Yeah a real cool place to be."</p>
        
            <p>The couple was operating out of a studio closer to town in Gisborne, but juggling so many other jobs on farm, they have found it easier to operate from there.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little bit of a work-life balance," Jacinda said. "Most of our orders are made to order so our turnaround we say is four weeks. It's about balancing farmwork, weekends, three children and the side hustle."</p>
        
            <p>A keen hunter himself, Richy began making knives as a shepherd from old crosscut saw blades, the ones used to cut big old trees down. That slowly progressed to integrating antler handles. In the beginning he used $2 coins to put the brass on the end.</p>

            <p>These days the knives are more uniform, though still very much one of a kind.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very tricky to find the right size antler, it's got to be the right size, right colour, right shape so that can be a bit tedious," Richy said.</p>
        
            <p>One rainy winter, Richy decided to try his hand carving a design into the antler handle. However, Jacinda found his attempt lacking and, after giving it a go herself, discovered she had a knack for the art of carving rural silhouette scenes.</p>
        
            <p>The bespoke knives caught the eye of friends and family and the Sheridans turned it into a small business through the power of social media.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be a feast or famine now that we've slowed it down and we do an organic trade," Jacinda said.</p>

            <p>They've had to make some changes though. Instead of crosscut saw blades, the knives are now created from New Zealand-made knife blanks - using German steel - and brass.</p>
        
            <p>Each knife is 100 percent New Zealand made, and one of a kind.</p>
        
            <p>While it was good to find a new use for antlers, which are a natural resource, the couple have found sourcing antlers is becoming more difficult. Also, one hefty specimen may only yield one handle.</p>
        
            <p>Pointing to a large pile of antlers in a bin in the shed, Richy said he was "almost down to no handles left".</p>
        
            <p>
Though it may look like a bin full of antlers, not all of them are useable and Richy says he's near empty.

            <p>Most of the antlers he sources himself or from hunting friends. He also sometimes trades pieces he doesn't want for fresh sets from an antler merchant and of course he fields regular requests to use people's own antlers from deer they have hunted.</p>
        
            <p>"People get a lot of enjoyment [out] of their knife being made out of their stag," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Different deer species have different antler qualities but the Sheridans prefer working with red deer antlers.</p>
        
            <p>It takes about three to four hours to make each knife from scratch, not including the time spent carving or engraving by Jacinda.</p>

            <p>"There's nothing we can't do," she said, adding many of the knives were really sentimental gifts. They are often given for special occasions such as weddings and 21st birthdays or to children starting their farming journey.</p>
        
            <p>She carves all sorts of country silhouettes - from hunting and fishing, farming on horseback and working dog teams to roaring stags, fishing, rodeo, and Brahman cattle and helicopters.</p>
        
            <p>"The personal side of things ... they seem to really enjoy having that and they have it the rest of their life," Richy said. "I think that's the main point of difference."</p>
        
            <p>"They should last you a lifetime unless it's very high use and they wear out the blade."</p>
