        <h2>Springboks taking no chances against All Blacks</h2>
        <p>
Springboks winger Cheslin Kolbe says you can never write off the All Blacks and expects Sunday's game to be 'tougher, more intense'.

            <p>Springboks v All Blacks</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 3am Sunday 8 September NZT</p>
        
            <p>DHL Stadium, Cape Town</p>

            <p>The Springboks appear to not be taking any chances for this weekend's test in Cape Town against the All Blacks, at least according to Cheslin Kolbe.</p>
        
            <p>The star winger stressed the importance of focus for the world champions as they headed to DHL Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very important that we are fully focused this week because matches between the Springboks and All Blacks are always a war," Kolbe told media at the team's hotel.</p>
        
            <p>"They are going to come out firing, so we need to stay on task and put in the hard work from the start to the end, and hopefully we will reap the rewards in the end."</p>
        
            <p>Midfielder Lukhanyo Am also warned against taking the All Blacks lightly after the Springboks' 31-27 win at Ellis Park last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"You can never write off New Zealand; they're a quality side. This game will be even tougher â€¦ more intense, but we still back our prep we've done this week. We'll go out there and accept the challenge," said Am.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks have traditionally had strong support in the Cape's large Coloured community, dating back to the apartheid era when the Springboks were a racially segregated side.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing we can do more is to win, and hopefully earn a bit more respect here," Kolbe said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, the All Blacks do have a good support base in Cape Town, but I'm sure the majority of supporters will be cheering on the Springboks."</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks came back from a 10-point deficit in the first test to win, after tries to replacements Kwagga Smith and Grant Williams took them into the lead. Kolbe said that effort had given them great confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past, we weren't able to come back from 10 points behind and finish a game off with a win. But it just shows you the character of this group and the belief of each and every player, and the willingness not to give up. We don't want to have any regrets when we go onto the field."</p>
        
            <p>Both teams are named this evening NZT, with the All Blacks at 5pm and the Springboks at 7pm.</p>
