            <p>Melania Trump released a statement in the hours after a gunman attempted to shoot and kill her husband, calling on Americans to repair political divisions and focus on love.</p>
        
            <p>"Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy and political games are inferior to love," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In her message, she referred to the man behind the assassination attempt on Saturday as a "monster" and denounced the "violent" attack on Donald Trump's life.</p>
        
            <p>Melania Trump's statement breaks a relatively long streak of silence, having mostly stayed off the campaign trail during the former president's re-election effort and away from cameras amid his legal battles.</p>
        
            <p>The former first lady's quiet resignation to her personal life, however, ended at least temporarily, with the statement on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life were on the brink of devastating change," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband."</p>
        
            <p>She also paid tribute to the other victims of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>"To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident, allegedly took aim on Saturday evening at Donald Trump with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire. The Republican presidential canidate's ear was grazed, one person was killed, and two others injured, police have said.</p>
        
            <p>During the attack, Crooks was shot and killed by authorities.</p>
        
            <p>In her message, Melania Trump sought to remind readers of her husband's humanity, the Trump family's humanity - and America's humanity.</p>
        
            <p>"Let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here in this earthly realm."</p>
        
            <p>The former first lady recently made news headlines when she was not listed as a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin this week.</p>
        
            <p>She did, however, speak at the conventions in 2016 and 2020, underscoring possibly how much she has chosen to avoid the limelight recently.</p>
        
            <p>But the gravity of the moment forced her back into the spotlight.</p>
        
            <p>"This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first and love transcends."</p>
