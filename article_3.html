            <p>New school lunches - love them, or hate them, and who's keeping track?</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty bad, I hate it," one year 8 student in Auckland told RNZ about the new school lunches.</p>
        
            <p>But Minister David Seymour has moved from saying feedback was mixed, to being quoted by Newsroom saying "we're getting a lot of feedback from principals who actually say they believe that their children think that the food is better than the previous offerings".</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, RNZ set out to find out more.</p>
        
            <p>We asked how the minister was keeping track of positive versus negative feedback.</p>
        
            <p>He had been quoted saying, the positive stories "aren't being reported because good news seldom is".</p>
        
            <p>This was a chance for him to report the positive stories.</p>
        
            <p>We asked Seymour's office: "Could you pls let me know in what format or way that 'lot of feedback' is collected/collated for the Minister. You keep a record of each principal's call, and what they said? A record of emails about this? Pls detail how you record this feedback."</p>
        
            <p>His press secretary responded: "Positive feedback from schools has been emailed to the School Lunch Collective and the Ministry of Education.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry and area managers are also receiving positive comments when they visit schools.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't believe there is an official record of positive comments from schools maintained."</p>
        
            <p>So we went to the Collective and to the Ministry, asking each to provide copies of representative feedback both positive and negative - this was where the "good news" Seymour had said was not being reported might be.</p>
        
            <p>We also asked them to summarise how much is positive and about what, and how much negative and about what.</p>
        
            <p>The Collective responded that any media enquiries had to go to the PR company Acumen or to the big lunch contractor Compass Group.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Acumen sent us a five-line email, quoting Paul Harvey of The School Lunch Collective:</p>
        
            <p>"The School Lunch Collective welcomes feedback from schools.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a feedback portal on the School Lunch Collective website, we also have an 0800 number or, if people prefer they can contact their School Lunch Collective Area Manager.</p>
        
            <p>"This feedback from schools enables us to respond and continue to improve the programme.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been a range of both positive and constructive feedback so far. Key themes include delivery, logistics and enjoyment of the meals."</p>
        
            <p>Harvey did not provide any copies of actual feedback.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has not heard back from the ministry yet.</p>
