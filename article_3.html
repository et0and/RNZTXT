            <p>The holiday road toll has moved to 10 after a person was killed in a single-vehicle crash on State Highway 69 in Inangahua in Tasman last night.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the crash at about 1am, and police said the person died in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>The road would remain closed for some time this morning, and motorists were being asked to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>This follows a death yesterday after a crash on State Highway 29 in Lower Kamai between a truck and car.</p>
        
            <p>The crash which happened around midday and also left two others injured, resulted in a lengthy detour for people travelling between Hamilton and Tauranga before the highway was reopened.</p>
