            <p>"I just met my idol. In a stained shirt, baggy shorts and bare feet," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"You have no idea. This country kiwi kid is so happy."</p>
        
            <p>This is not the first video Blyde has posted about Fraser-Pryce.</p>

            <p>"Oh my god, oh my god," she said, wiping her eyes.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens will take to the field for the first time on Monday against China, then Canada in Pool A.</p>
