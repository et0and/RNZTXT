            <p>Canterbury are through to their eighth consecutive premiership final in the Farah Palmer Cup, with a new crop of players helping keep that run alive.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury beat Counties Manukau 36-31 in last week's semi-finals to advance to Saturday's title decider in Hamilton against top qualifiers Waikato, who crushed defending champions Auckland 69-12 to advance to the final.</p>
        
            <p>With nine Canterbury players in the Black Ferns WXV squad away in Canada, the Farah Palmer Cup team have had to blood more than ten debutants and overcome the loss of those stars to reach the title decider.</p>

            <p>Captain Laura Bayfield said the team's rookies have stepped up.</p>
        
            <p>"Really proud of the team. It's been a challenging year with all the changes in the squad, but it's also been an awesome opportunity for the younger girls to step up, so super proud of where we've got this season, Bayfield said.</p>
        
            <p>There are only three players in the current Canterbury side who took part in last year's final, but Bayfield doesn't think that lack of experience will hinder her side in the title decider.</p>
        
            <p>"It provides that freedom of the unknown and maybe there's a little bit less pressure on them for the first final. I'm hoping they just embrace the opportunity. It's a privilege to be in the position we're in, so I'm looking forward to seeing those younger girls experience their first final and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did my first one."</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury beat Waikato 10-7 in the regular season, but the hosts are favourites to win Saturday's final and claim their second premiership title since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato finished the regular season in top spot with five wins from six games with their only loss at the hands of Canterbury, who finished third on the ladder behind Counties-Manukau with four wins from six matches.</p>
        
            <p>Bayfield said Canterbury are happy to be underdogs.</p>
        
            <p>"It motivates me more knowing people don't think we can do it," Bayfield said. "I'm happy going into it where we are, I'm feeling confident and looking forward to a great show."</p>
        
            <p>Bayfield believed the two finalists were evenly matched.</p>
        
            <p>"They play a similar game to us in terms of speed and getting the ball out wide. I suppose our speed matches their speed so we'll look to release our speedsters on the edge and play a nice dynamic game.</p>
        
            <p>"Line speed and connection on defence is going to be crucial for both teams who are keen to play with a bit of speed."</p>

            <p>Loose forward Alana Bremner was one of those nine Canterbury Black Ferns who will be cheering her teammates on from Canada, where New Zealand were playing in the WXV tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Bremner said the Farah Palmer Cup players had been outstanding.</p>
        
            <p>"We are so proud of them. We were screaming all the way from Canada watching that semi-final. They've been absolutely amazing the way they've built throughout this season. There were 11 our 12 debutants in their opening game [of the season], and seeing how far they've grown is a testament to the growth and hard work they've put in.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been awesome to see Laura step up as captain and lead the way as she always does. We'll be watching them this weekend and wishing them all the best."</p>
        
            <p>The Farah Palmer Cup Premiership final in Hamilton kicks off at 12.35pm.</p>
