        <h2>Residents say solar farm will ruin 'rural outlook'</h2>
        <p>
The solar farm could power 2400 houses once built. But residents in the quiet rural area are devastated it's going ahead without public consultation.

            <p>Residents of a quiet rural south Auckland community say they are devastated a solar farm has been given the green light for development without any public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Kenny Ardmore Limited (KAL) plans to build and operate a solar farm with 18,000 solar panels, on 13 hectares of land at Ardmore, south Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In applying for resource consent, KAL chose to proceed without public notification, which was not mandatory for its application.</p>
        
            <p>However, residents Allan Bell and Chris Wise said locals had a lot to say about the development, and wished they had had a chance to have their views heard.</p>
        
            <p>Wise, who lives directly opposite the site, said he was not consulted.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not against solar farms or renewable energy but in this case we are against the location they have chosen to put the solar farm," Wise said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of the owners have been in this location for over 30 years and chose to reside here because of the beautiful rural outlook which will now be destroyed."</p>

            <p>Bell said they first found out about the proposed development through a news article in a community paper, with a circulation "that didn't reach all residents".</p>
        
            <p>Bell said after they found out, they collected more than 300 signatures from residents, petitioning against the lack of transparency.</p>
        
            <p>He said the development would affect 13 families and parents of a 400-pupil school, all within 100 metres of the site.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were also concerned with traffic from the development and the dramatic impact to property values, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] are flabbergasted that this development could go ahead in this way and not be consulted."</p>
        
            <p>Council approved the resource consent for the solar farm on 13 February, with work expected to begin in June or July.</p>
        
            <p>Once built, it would generate 17,488 megawatts of power from 3m-long fixed solar panels, enough to supply electricity to 2400 houses in the area.</p>
        
            <p>KAL director Ben Kenny said they chose to apply for a non-notified resource consent after receiving advice from consultants.</p>
        
            <p>He said they cared about the residents' view, and hoped the groundwork proved how serious they were in mitigating issues.</p>
        
            <p>"People have this preconception of what we're doing and that we're bad people, but I'm not a bad person, I'm a good person.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm doing something for the planet, I'm trying to help New Zealand reach [its] renewable energy goals, I'm trying to mitigate anything as best I can.</p>
        
            <p>"People won't know that until they come and sit down with us and see the lengths we're going to."</p>
        
            <p>Kenny said he was open to sitting down with locals to talk about the project.</p>
        
            <p>"I've realised some of the locals are upset but I hope they can see the effort we're going to," Kenny said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council manager resource consents south James Dowding said the final decision was made by an independent commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>"In this instance, the application underwent a detailed and thorough notification assessment, and council planners provided the commissioner with quality information and assessments so they could make an informed decision," Dowding said.</p>
        
            <p>"The commissioner found any adverse effects to people, traffic and the environment to be less than minor, and so granted the application without the need for notification."</p>
        
            <p>Dowding said before submitting a resource consent application, an applicant could choose to engage with local residents.</p>
        
            <p>"However, there is no legal requirement to do so."</p>
