            <p>Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding could be on the way for Auckland, Northland, Great Barrier Island, Coromandel, the Bay of Plenty and Rotorua, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasters issued a watch notice for the period from 6pm Sunday to midnight due to an unstable northwest airflow.</p>
        
            <p>"...Whether these thunderstorms occur or not, there is a chance of localised downpours of 25 to 40mm per hour," the agency said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips."</p>
        
            <p>They urged people to plan ahead, and be vigilant for changing or threatening conditions; and to stay updated on weather warnings.</p>
        
            <p>"Driving conditions will also be hazardous, with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain."</p>
        
            <p>The weather was expected to ease after 10pm for areas in the north.</p>
        
            <p>Advice about how to prepare for a storm can be found here.</p>
