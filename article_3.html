            <p>A moment of unity in Parliament has been tainted by accusations of broken tikanga, with the assistant speaker facing calls to apologise from all opposition parties.</p>
        
            <p>The Whakatōhea Claims Settlement Bill passed its third reading in Parliament on Tuesday with the support of all parties.</p>
        
            <p>Supporters in the public gallery then rose to perform a waiata in celebration - a waiata they had permission to perform.</p>
        
            <p>However, the waiata was prefaced with a karakia that was allowed to proceed for 20 seconds before being interrupted by assistant speaker Maureen Pugh, who called for order.</p>
        
            <p>"Excuse me, can I call for order in the gallery please. Order in the gallery. Order in the gallery. There is permission for a waiata - the gallery is not the space for speeches," she said, as the performers continued then began singing.</p>
        
            <p>After the waiata, Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi rose to his feet with a point of order and said he found it "extremely insulting that one of our rangatira was cut off, which is part of the protocol of the waiata today".</p>
        
            <p>He called for an apology from the assistant speaker, saying he was insulted - with his co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer offering support.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Steve Abel also stood and offered his support, saying the purpose of the settlements was to acknowledge the wrongs of the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>"To acknowledge the constant trampling and insults committed against Māori and direct losses. In this process which is a meaningful one for the iwi who have come and agreed to this settlement there is an opportunity for the Crown to actually receive the dignity offered by the iwi in the making of the apology and yet in the whole process we find we keep committing further harm and insult."</p>
        
            <p>Pugh responded that she would consult with speaker Gerry Brownlee on what to do next.</p>

            <p>"It's be common practice for permission to be granted for a waiata, it is not the position for member of the gallery to make further speeches," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer bristled.</p>
        
            <p>"What we allowed was to give you warning. You didn't use any of your cultural support you could have to ensure the mana of this kaupapa, the mana of our iwi, was respected. There was a very wrong here done today, and they must be apologised to before they leave - otherwise the very process which every party supported today has been takahi."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Willie Jackson also rose and voiced support for Te Pāti Māori's request for an apology.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not about trying to get one up on you, madam chair, this is about tikanga and our people have been slighted. They've come from a long way away and we ask you to respect the request te pāti Māori."</p>
        
            <p>National's leader of the house Chris Bishop said it would be worth the House "dialling down a touch".</p>
        
            <p>"My read of the situation having watched it quite carefully was no offence was intended by you Madam Speaker, I'm sure," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My sense is that it was a misunderstanding around what was intended to happen and what members thought was likely to happen at the conclusion of the third reading speech."</p>
        
            <p>When MPs interrupted again, Bishop said he was "trying to be helpful", to which Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi responded, "we've been misunderstood for the last 180 years, come on all of us deserve an apology".</p>
        
            <p>Bishop acknowledged where Waititi was coming from but suggested it was "worth everyone taking a breath and dialling it down a touch".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think the speaker intended any offence and it would be a shame if we left the third reading and moved on to later items of business in a spirit where there was acrimony across the Parliament, because I actually think there's unanimous agreement for reconciliation."</p>
        
            <p>When Pugh moved on to the next matter of business, after hearing all parties' points of view, MPs from Te Pāti Māori could be heard in the House calling out the assistant speaker for "being wrong" and "making a mistake". Others yelled "shame".</p>
        
            <p>At this point Brownlee entered the debating chamber and told the House the argument had been heard from both sides.</p>
        
            <p>"My job is to protect the tikanga of this Parliament - this Parliament," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is the Parliament of all people in New Zealand and there is no intention to offend anybody in the upholding of its own tikanga, and tikanga does not allow for speeches from the gallery, it never has.</p>
        
            <p>"On that basis we will now proceed and those who do not want to accept that, well, unfortunately no change can be made."</p>
