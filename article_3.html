            <p>A project manager for a planned Richie McCaw statue to be erected in his hometown said he hopes it can finally be built this year.</p>
        
            <p>Long-awaited plans to establish a life size bronze sculpture of the rugby legend and former All Blacks captain in the Waitaki town of Kurow date back almost a decade.</p>
        
            <p>However the venture, which has the backing of the McCaw family, has struggled to get off the ground, largely because of sluggish fundraising contributions.</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittle page was set up in January 2018, and raised only $3333 of a $50,000 goal before closing 12 months later.</p>
        
            <p>McCaw grew up on a family farm in the Hakataramea Valley, north of the Waitaki River, and played his junior club rugby south of the river in Kurow.</p>
        
            <p>A large cardboard cutout of McCaw, alongside signage appealing for donations for the project, remains situated in the centre of town along State Highway 83.</p>
        
            <p>Waitaki Valley Community Society member John Sturgeon told RNZ the committee had raised about $40,000, enough for the work to be done.</p>
        
            <p>"It's in limbo," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just waiting on a couple of things."</p>
        
            <p>Some of the outstanding matters included finding a 3D photography outfit for the project.</p>
        
            <p>Although other details remained under wraps, it was expected to be made from Oamaru limestone.</p>
        
            <p>Lyttelton sculptor Mark Whyte was initially earmarked to take on the job, but this was no longer the case.</p>
        
            <p>Alternative proposals have also been weighed up.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese sculptor and Auckland University graduate Yang Li built a seven-metre industrial styled statue of McCaw, mostly made from scrap metals.</p>

            <p>He went ahead with his creation despite a pre-build offer to the Auckland Council in 2012 being rejected.</p>
        
            <p>The fundraising committee had signalled an interest in housing Li's creation when fundraising efforts on the original concept stalled, although other committee members were less keen.</p>
        
            <p>McCaw played 148 tests for the national team between 2001 and 2015, including 110 as captain.</p>
        
            <p>He led the All Blacks to back-to-back Rugby World Cup triumphs in 2011 and 2015.</p>
