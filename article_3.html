            <p>The National Wax Museum in Dublin is "committed" to creating a new wax figure of Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor after significant public backlash.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the museum unveiled a waxwork of the late singer and activist to coincide with the first anniversary of her death.</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor was found dead at the age of 56 in her south London home last July.</p>
        
            <p>The figure was first unveiled on Thursday as a tribute to the singer, but the museum has now said it will be removed in order to create "a more accurate representation".</p>
        
            <p>Among those who criticised the original figure was O'Connor's brother, John.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was shocked when he first saw the waxwork online and said it was "inappropriate".</p>
        
            <p>"It looked nothing like her and I thought it was hideous," he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ's Liveline radio programme on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He added that the figure looked "between a mannequin and something out of the Thunderbirds".</p>

            <p>The museum says it will remake the waxwork to create a more accurate representation</p>
        
            <p>A statement from the museum said: "In response to the public's feedback regarding the wax figure, we acknowledge that the current representation did not meet our high standards or the expectations of Sinéad's devoted fans.</p>
        
            <p>"We have listened closely to the reactions and agree that the figure does not fully capture Sinéad's unique presence and essence as we intended."</p>
        
            <p>The museum said O'Connor's impact on music is "immeasurable" and its goal was to honour the late singer in the "most fitting and respectful manner".</p>
        
            <p>"With this in mind, we are committed to creating a new wax figure that better reflect's Sinéad O'Connor's true spirit and iconic image," it added.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team of skilled artists will begin this project immediately, ensuring that every detail is meticulously crafted to celebrate her legacy appropriately."</p>
        
            <p>It said the museum looks forward to unveiling a new figure that "truly honours" O'Connor and her "extraordinary impact".</p>

            <p>Sinéad Marie Bernadette O'Connor was born on 8 December 1966 in the affluent Glenageary suburb of Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>Her debut album in 1987, The Lion and the Cobra, was a storming success, earning O'Connor a Grammy nomination for best female rock vocal performance.</p>
        
            <p>But it was her 1990 Prince cover single 'Nothing Compares 2 U' which saw her catapult to worldwide fame.</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor was outspoken on subjects including religion, women's rights and racism.</p>
        
            <p>In 1992, she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while performing on US television programme Saturday Night Live in protest against child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, she converted to Islam, changing her name to Shuhada Sadaqat.</p>
        
            <p>However she continued to perform under her birth name.</p>
        
            <p>On 26 July 2023, the musician was found unresponsive at her home in Herne Hill, south London and was later pronounced dead.</p>
        
            <p>A coroner ruled that she died of natural causes.</p>
