            <p>Three police cars have been damaged and one person has been arrested in a dramatic end to a pursuit on Auckland's Northern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>The fleeing car was brought to a halt with spikes on the motorway near Oteha Valley.</p>
        
            <p>"Three police vehicles were damaged after the fleeing driver collided with them in the process of being brought to a stop," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The left southbound lane after Tristram Ave has reopened. Motorists should still expect delays as the congestion eased, NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>FINAL UPDATE 7:30PM All southbound lanes have now RE-OPENED. Expect residual delays in the area as congestion eases. https://t.co/iG7Rq1E89l</p>
        
            <p>Police said one person was arrested "following a protracted fleeing driver incident" on Tuesday afternoon. Charges are being considered.</p>
        
            <p>"At around 4.45pm a vehicle failed to stop for police when signalled to do so, on State Highway 1, Northern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>"Police had concerns for the wellbeing of the driver and maintained observations of the vehicle, eventually spiking the tyres and bringing it to a stop on the Northern Motorway near Oteha Valley on/off ramps."</p>
        
            <p>No injuries have been reported.</p>
        
            <p>"Delays are still being experienced on the roading network but are expected to clear soon," police said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a truck is on fire on the Peka Peka to Otaki Expressway north of Wellington was causing delays this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said the northbound road was down to one lane and Fire and Emergency crews were responding to the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Police were aware of a number of other collisions on the road, with one car rolling on to its roof and at least two other minor nose-to-tail crashes.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists were warned to slow down and be prepared to wait.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries have been reported.</p>
