            <p>The South Island will be the place to be this Easter weekend with sunny weather forecast, but there's a chill coming first.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Clare O'Connor said there would be a large spread of temperatures across Aotearoa in the lead up to Easter.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay was expected to reach 27C Tuesday and Wednesday, whereas the lower South Island, Dunedin and Southland in particular, would reach maximum temperatures of only 13C or 14C.</p>
        
            <p>By Thursday, a chill will begin to be felt in the North as well as the South Islands.</p>
        
            <p>⚠ The latest from our Severe Weather desk: Two Strong Wind Watches and a Heavy Rain Watch come into effect in the early hours of Wednesday morning with the passage of a front over the South Island pic.twitter.com/aZbmrzV9Jo</p>
        
            <p>Cold south-westerlies will bring snow down to about 600 metres in Southland and Otago, as a cold front moves northwards over southern and central New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The South Island would see the "driest and brightest weather, particularly the West Coast" on Easter weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Central Otago and inland Canterbury will also see the sun.</p>
        
            <p>But a low pressure would bring an unsettled time for the North Island, especially for the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>"Wherever you'll be, a couple of extra layers will be required as we've some cold weather in store," O'Connor said.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, heavy rain and strong wind are expected to hit parts of the North Island for a time.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said that could result in rain warnings for Gisborne/Tairawhiti, Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa, and severe gale warnings for parts of eastern Bay of Plenty, eastern Taupō, Taranaki, Manawatū, Horowhenua, Kāpiti , Wellington and the Marlborough Sounds.</p>
        
            <p>There was a heavy rain warning for Canterbury High Country till Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>And Crown Range Road can expect some snow showers overnight with a road snowfall warning, and Clutha and Dunedin have a strong wind watch in place.</p>
