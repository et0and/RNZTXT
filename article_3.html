            <p>The development of a "world's first" relationship agreement between the Whanganui District Council (WDC) and Ngā Hapū o Whanganui is one step closer after the two parties signed off on a draft document.</p>
        
            <p>Originally the draft relationship agreement was due to be considered at a full council meeting in February, but was now available to view on the WDC website.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Andrew Tripe said talks on the relationship agreement - known as Te Tomokanga ki Te Matapihi - had progressed more quickly than expected.</p>
        
            <p>"Developing this world-first agreement is a real milestone for Whanganui."</p>
        
            <p>Tripe was pleased the draft agreement had been released while community engagement was still open and ahead of the council's meeting on 13 February.</p>
        
            <p>"Through our information sharing and engagement sessions, we heard a number of people say they'd like to read the agreement to gain a greater understanding of what's involved.</p>
        
            <p>"Prior to this we had only shared a summary of the relationship agreement."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors would discuss adopting the agreement at the council 13 February meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Tripe said as the relationship agreement was part of the wider Treaty settlement between the Crown and Hapū/Iwi, a decision needed to be made on it before the Treaty settlement process with the Crown could be concluded - this was why a two-month community engagement period had to be scheduled for December and January.</p>
        
            <p>Treaty settlement negotiations between Hapū/Iwi and the Crown were always confidential until an agreement had been reached and negotiations were still progressing and likely to conclude early this year.</p>
        
            <p>Tripe said relationship agreement was intended to set a platform for joint work between the council and Takapau Whāriki, the post-settlement governance entity for the settlement.</p>
        
            <p>"We can see that a one-size-fits-all approach hasn't worked for many of the social issues our community faces and I'm grateful to the Iwi and Hapū of Whanganui for their enthusiasm for finding ways to improve life for everyone in our community."</p>
        
            <p>Tripe said there was no rates impact from the relationship agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about us joining together to look at local needs and find local solutions that suit our community."</p>
        
            <p>Iwi leader Ken Mair encouraged people to come to the drop-in sessions to hear about how the approach of the relationship agreement would set a foundation for work that would benefit everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"Through the informal drop-in sessions, it's been great to hear people's thoughts and help them understand our intention.</p>
        
            <p>The purpose of the relationship agreement is to foster collaboration so both parties are working in a strong partnership to strengthen our community - while we don't yet know exactly what initiatives will emerge, we are united by a desire to benefit the hāpori (wider community)."</p>
        
            <p>Drop-in session times:</p>
        
            <p>Thursday 30 January, 9.30 - 11.00am Lakefront lawn at Rotokawau Virginia Lake (weather dependent)</p>
        
            <p>Thursday 30 January, 4.15 - 5.45pm Castlecliff Community Hub and Library</p>
