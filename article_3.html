            <p>Consumer NZ wants people to be aware of their rights when returning and exchanging gifts.</p>
        
            <p>The Consumer Guarantees Act does not require a retailer to give a refund if a person buys something and then changes their mind about it.</p>
        
            <p>But Consumer NZ spokesperson Jessica Walker said some stores had generous returns policies.</p>
        
            <p>Consumers would however need either a receipt or proof of purchase, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't just rock up at a store and say 'hey, I think that somebody bought this from here and I want to return it or exchange it please' because obviously that's not fair on the retailer."</p>
        
            <p>The consumer watchdog also warned people against adding extended warranties to their purchases when hitting the sales this season.</p>
        
            <p>The Consumers Guarantees Act afforded people enough protection, Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"With an extended warranty, most of the time you're actually getting less protection or equal protection to what you've already got under existing law ...</p>
        
            <p>"That means that if your good develops a fault pretty quickly, then you are entitled to get it repaired, to get an exchange or, if the fault is catastrophic, to get a full refund - it should last longer than the manufacturer's warranty as well."</p>
        
            <p>Walker said if something did not work, consumers were entitled to a refund, even if it was bought on sale.</p>
        
            <p>Shopping malls in Auckland were busy today with people searching for Boxing Day bargains.</p>
        
            <p>Westfield Newmarket was evacuated for a time this morning when a fog cannon was accidentally set off. Fire and Emergency sent two fire trucks to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Footage on social media also showed long queues to enter Dressmart in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>And traffic around Westfield Manukau was heavy as shoppers tried to find parks at the precinct.</p>
