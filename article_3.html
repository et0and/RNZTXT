        <h2>Seymour announces policy directive on 'need, not race'</h2>
        <p>
Cabinet ministers have issued a directive to the public sector, reminding them all services must be delivered based on need rather than race - and that contracts be awarded on value.

            <p>Cabinet ministers have issued a directive to the public sector, reminding them all services must be delivered based on need rather than race - and that contracts be awarded on value.</p>
        
            <p>The letter fulfils commitments secured by ACT and New Zealand First during coalition negotiations with National last year.</p>
        
            <p>The directive can be read as both a rebuke and a ruling: it says the government is concerned that public servants have been using race as proxy for need.</p>
        
            <p>The new policy says: no more.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the Health Minister stepped in to scrap a Hawke's Bay health initiative granting free GP visits to young Māori and Pasifika based on their ethnicity.</p>
        
            <p>The Coalition is also scrapping a Labour policy encouraging departments to give at least 8 percent of their contracts to Māori providers.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
        
            <p>You can watch RNZ's livestream of the event at the top of this page.</p>
