            <p>The Reserve Bank (RBNZ) has activated debt to income (DTI) rules as a further means of managing the property sector.</p>
        
            <p>The DTIs, which limit the amount that can be borrowed in relation to income, have been well signalled as another protection against financial risks raised by a booming property market and high household debt.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 July banks will be limited to no more than 20 percent of new lending to owner-occupiers with a DTI ratio of more than 6, and no more than 20 percent of new investor lending over a DTI of 7.</p>
        
            <p>That means most owner-occupiers with an income of $100,000 would be able to borrow $600,000, and investors $700,000.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time the RBNZ is loosening the loan to value ratios (LVR) which have restricted the amount of low deposit lending by banks.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Governor Christian Hawkesby said the two measures were complementary and would reduce risks to the financial system.</p>
        
            <p>"LVRs target the impact of defaults by reducing the amount of potential losses in the event of a housing down-turn. While DTIs reduce the probability of default by targeting the ability of borrowers to continue to repay debt.</p>
        
            <p>"Both act as guardrails reducing the build-up of high-risk lending in the system."</p>
        
            <p>The revised LVR limits will be eased to allow a greater number of low deposit borrowers.</p>
        
            <p>Hawkesby said the limits had been designed to give banks flexibility to use discretion and manage complex cases.</p>
        
            <p>A just released report from property research firm CoreLogic said debt to income ratios would in time become a significant factor in the market over time as mortgage rates fall by slowing the rate at which property investors can grow a portfolio, especially in more expensive areas.</p>
