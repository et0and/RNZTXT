            <p>The Wellington Blaze have swept up the Super Smash women's title, proving too strong for the Otago Sparks in the final at Wellington's Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>It was a low-scoring final, with the Blaze choosing to bat first but only registering 104 for eight off their 20 overs in the T20 format.</p>
        
            <p>It hardly seemed enough, but the Sparks got away to a poor start and struggled to get partnerships going.</p>
        
            <p>In the end, they were still in with a chance to steal a win during the final over, requiring 20 - and gave it a shot, being in contention until the second to last ball.</p>
        
            <p>They finished on 96 for nine, losing by eight runs, with the Blaze erupting into celebrations, after seeing off the Northern Brave in yesterday's elimination final.</p>
        
            <p>Australian import Hannah Darlington was the star for the Blaze, top scoring with 26 and taking four for 16 off four overs, with her medium pacers, while fellow Aussie Maitlan Brown supported well with bat and ball also.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Amelia Kerr marshalled her troops well, taking two wickets at vital stages in the Sparks innings.</p>
        
            <p>Felicity Robertson was the best performer for the Sparks, taking three for 16 with the ball, and being unbeaten at the end on 29.</p>
        
            <p>It was a tough result for the Sparks who had been the dominant force for most of the competition and wanted to reward retiring coach Craig Cumming with a T20 title, but the Blaze had the momentum of a home team meaning business.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
