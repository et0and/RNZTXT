        <h2>'Living with uncertainty' - Let's Get Wellington Moving halt questioned</h2>
        <p>
A cycling advocacy group called the decision disgraceful, and the capital's Chamber of Commerce wants more clarity on the future of the Golden Mile.

            <p>Neither businesses nor cyclists in the capital are jumping for joy at the government's ditching of the $7.4 billion Let's Get Wellington Moving programme.</p>
        
            <p>The government, Wellington City Council and the Greater Wellington Regional Council have agreed in principle to dump the plan.</p>
        
            <p>Central government will now build and fund the Basin Reserve upgrade and second Mt Victoria tunnel, which it says will create opportunities for urban development and housing.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council will bring the Golden Mile project in-house and bus corridors will be priority projects, improving access to the airport and hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The Cycling Action Network called the change disgraceful - especially the loss of light rail running to Island Bay on the south coast.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Morgan from the group said the government was dusting off old plans for the city.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a disgraceful plan from the government and it flies in the face of what Wellingtonians have consistently voted for, which is a compact city with less reliance on private vehicles, better walking, cycling, public transport and affordable housing," Morgan said.</p>
        
            <p>The city's Chamber of Commerce described the axing of Let's Get Wellington Moving as a mercy killing, but wanted more clarity on the future of the Golden Mile.</p>
        
            <p>That job involves removing cars from the main route through the city from Parliament to Courtenay Place and now becomes the responsibility of the City Council.</p>
        
            <p>But the business lobby group wanted a rethink.</p>
        
            <p>Chamber chief executive Simon Arcus said there had not been a proper risk analysis on what would happen to businesses if it went ahead in its present form.</p>
        
            <p>"There was one very flimsy risk analysis done, and so businesses are still living with uncertainty," Arcus said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is you take out carparks and make the kind of changes proposed without understanding the risks and you will see prosperity and the economy hit the city.</p>
        
            <p>"The questions about the Golden Mile are really about going back to council and working out what the priorities are for that street and there has always been a risk [with] the Golden Mile that we could cut off our nose [to] spite our face and end up driving people out of the city," Arcus said.</p>
