            <p>The chief executive of the New Plymouth District Council ditched the suit and tie and picked up a paint roller to deliver the residents of a block of pensioner flats an early Christmas present on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Gareth Green helped repaint the car parking markings for eight council-owned units on List Street.</p>
        
            <p>He said the residents had wanted the work done for some time, and it was great to simply get it done.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously Christmas time, and rather than putting it through to the contractors and clogging up the team we thought it's a simple job - let's come out and do it."</p>
        
            <p>Green had the chair of the age and disability committee, Sam Bennett, and councillor Max Brough in tow.</p>

            <p>He was keeping an eagle eye on the elected members' handiwork.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be too critical actually, but there's a little bit of dirt in that line and I'm not sure how straight this one is. But that's okay, they're doing okay, it's all about the intent and there's certainly intent there today."</p>
        
            <p>List Street resident Lynette Hartley was surprised when the chief executive turned up ready to get his hands dirty.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really nice, because who expects the CEO to get out in his shorts, you know, and physically do things? Because he's busy with his head, not his hands."</p>

            <p>John Sexton was also keeping a close eye on things from his unit.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they're going alright, especially the CEO of the council, who looks pretty good in real work clothes instead of office gear. He's got some skill, but he's a bit gentle with the roller. He needs some practice with that."</p>

            <p>Lyn Sommerville was impressed.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought it was going to be contractors, but they're doing not too bad, pretty good. A lot of direction there from our man there in the middle, councillor Brough."</p>
        
            <p>Brough reckoned it was a learning experience.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a new skill, I'm learning here today as you can see. Painting between the lines, staying between the lines and it's going great despite the chief executive's input that we're no good at it. I think we're doing fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>Bennett said there was a serious side to their work.</p>
        
            <p>"Just even simple little jobs like this by redefining a parking lot and putting a new security light in is looking after our elderly."</p>
        
            <p>The New Plymouth District Council owned about 147 pensioner units throughout the district.</p>
