            <p>We spend more time scrolling on social media than we do eating and exercising a day according to a new study.</p>
        
            <p>A Canterbury university study surveyed almost 400 social media users aged 18 to 44 years old about their use of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>Those surveyed spent an average of two and a half hours a day on the platforms.</p>
        
            <p>Study participants showed signs of addiction, reporting being subconsciously drawn to using social media.</p>
        
            <p>University of Canterbury lecturer Knseniia Zarhai spoke to Checkpoint's Lisa Owen and said many people underestimate time spent on the platforms.</p>
        
            <p>"The average user spends around 2.5 hours on social media daily.</p>
        
            <p>"This amount of time might not sound like much, but it adds up to 37 days, more than one month spent nonstop on social media per year."</p>
        
            <p>For young people across Aotearoa, that number is significantly higher, often seven or eight hours per day.</p>
        
            <p>"There were many other stories telling [us] that [some] some social media users are spending more than 10 hours per day.</p>
        
            <p>"This use has consequences, and there are many studies showing that excessive use of social media can lead to anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and distorted perception of self and others."</p>
        
            <p>There is also a physical danger. For example, drivers who don't put their phones down behind the wheel.</p>
        
            <p>"There were different cases that our participants shared.</p>
        
            <p>"One of them said that they had a situation when they were driving in a rural area ... they received a push notification and they reached to their phone, there was a big animal crossing the road. A deer.</p>
        
            <p>"They were lucky to avoid this accident."</p>
        
            <p>Due to the way our brains work, checking social media is often an impulse rather than a deliberate decision, she said.</p>
        
            <p>So even when users understand the harm caused by excessive use, it can be very difficult to stop.</p>
        
            <p>"That is why people sometimes connect impulsively, even against their values, and despite understanding the harm to their well-being."</p>
        
            <p>And while there is no magic bullet when it comes to cutting down time spent on social media, there are measures that can be taken.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on our study, we suggest at least three simple steps.</p>
        
            <p>"First of all, try to reduce impulsive triggers by turning off notifications and trying to keep your phone out of immediate reach.</p>
        
            <p>"The second step is to set goals for social media use based on your intentions of social media use, rather than time limits.</p>
        
            <p>"This is very important.</p>
        
            <p>"The third one is to engage with valuable content.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have heard about social media algorithms, they show content we constantly engage with, so you can actually control what you see in your newsfeed.</p>
        
            <p>"This is how you can upgrade, [and] switch from mindless, to mindful use of social media."</p>
        
            <p>Some Wellingtonians who spoke to RNZ said they were spending up to six hours a day checking their feed.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're hanging out at a friend's house, definitely just the easiest thing to do is go on your phone and scroll... [we'll] Snapchat each other when we're right next to each other, where we should actually be getting active. And, you know, talking."</p>
        
            <p>Another user said she deleted TikTok after spending up to five hours glued to the screen.</p>
        
            <p>"And after I deleted it, it was way better."</p>
        
            <p>Another said they found social media "so addictive".</p>
        
            <p>"You pick up your phone, absent-mindedly, open an app, and then half an hour later, you might still be scrolling through reels.</p>
        
            <p>"It's enjoyable, but maybe too enjoyable. I found it much harder to get into things like reading a book."</p>
