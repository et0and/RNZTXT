            <p>Graeme was marked up and sitting in a hospital gown, ready for his cancer operation when he was told his surgery had been cancelled due to staff shortages.</p>
        
            <p>But Health New Zealand says no surgeries were cancelled that day due to staffing shortages at Christchurch Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Graeme had been diagnosed with stomach cancer in December and was waiting for his surgery at Christchurch Hospital - scheduled for last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint the cancer he had was "quite aggressive" and the sooner he was operated on, the better.</p>
        
            <p>Having a long wait for the surgery already was "pretty dodgy".</p>
        
            <p>"[It] makes you feel like it might be growing inside you, which it is. The sooner you can get it out, the better."</p>
        
            <p>Graeme finally got his surgery date and was in a hospital gown, having already met with the surgeon and had a marking put on his body for where the incision would be made.</p>
        
            <p>He waited an hour before an anaesthetist came in with the bad news - the operation would not go ahead as the hospital was short of technicians.</p>
        
            <p>Graeme told Checkpoint could not understand how the hospital was short as surgeries had already taken place that day.</p>
        
            <p>"I was gutted, I was just gutted. It was terrible to prepare yourself for a major operation, to be told to go home and come back in two weeks' time because 'we are short of technicians'."</p>
        
            <p>He was never given any detail as to why technicians were not available.</p>
        
            <p>But Health New Zealand said in a statement that no planned surgeries were cancelled at Christchurch Hospital on Friday due to staff shortages.</p>
        
            <p>"A non-clinically urgent surgery was deferred on Friday afternoon due to a morning surgery running overtime as a result of complications. Due to the morning overrun the medical team determined the afternoon surgery couldn't safely start.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge how distressing it is for patients who have planned for, and are expecting, their surgery to have it deferred at short notice. The deferred surgery has been rescheduled."</p>
        
            <p>But Graeme said the surgery was "a life and death situation, it's not an accounting situation, its life and death for me".</p>
        
            <p>"Those people need to buck their game up What are we living in? A third world country?"</p>
        
            <p>In a letter to the unions dated 17 April, Te Whatu Ora - Health New Zealand set out a raft of cost-cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitals have been ordered to end double shifts, not backfill staff when people were sick, cut back on public holiday staffing and encourage more people to take annual leave.</p>
        
            <p>Graeme said it was "disastrous" and while the government gave landlords a break, it was cutting costs on people's health.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government could "stick" its tax cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"I want a proper health system, not tax cuts. I want to know that when I'm diagnosed with cancer that they will do something about it quick-smart."</p>
        
            <p>Graeme's surgery had been rescheduled and he would now be seen under the public sector - but questioned how the health sector was saving money by paying for him to go private.</p>
        
            <p>"How is that a saving?"</p>
