            <p>The New Zealand Rugby Players' Association have hit back at NZ Rugby's plans to enact a modified governance change to the ones proposed by the Pilkington report last year.</p>
        
            <p>In a 16-page document released today, association head Rob Nichol reiterated that they had "not supported any of the proposals NZR or the provincial unions have made regarding NZR's Governance Reform".</p>
        
            <p>The proposal cited a "lack of trust and confidence in the current leadership of NZR" and is in favour of adopting the recommendations of the report with no concessions.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been eight months since the release of the review. The game is widely regarded as impotent/disorganised and incompetent and is essentially in a state of governance chaos," the statement read.</p>
        
            <p>"The very issues highlighted in the review and that contributed to its conclusion - that NZR governance is not fit for purpose - are literally manifesting themselves in front of New Zealand's eyes.</p>
        
            <p>"There is now a leadership vacuum, and, as such, this proposal is designed to fill that vacuum and provide something the entire game can unite behind and support."</p>
        
            <p>Nichol called for the current board, chaired by Dame Patsy Reddy, to step down and reapply for their positions under the framework of the Pilkington report.</p>

            <p>"It therefore stands that the existing NZR board is not fit for purpose and potentially finds itself acting in a caretaker capacity, pending the appointment of a new NZR board," Nichol said.</p>
        
            <p>"Against that background, the honourable and appropriate thing to do is for the existing NZR board to offer their resignations and, should they desire, reapply through the newly constituted process."</p>
        
            <p>That process would involve an independent board appointment committee, and "multi-stakeholder Implementation steering group", which would oversee the Pilkington Report's recommendations. NZR had favoured a model that would see the current board serve until the end of their terms over the next couple of years.</p>
        
            <p>The statement comes after a highly charged fortnight for the national game's leadership, in which provincial unions (PUs) had offered a counter proposal for NZR's upcoming Special General Meeting, which Reddy said she could not support and would offer her resignation if it was voted in.</p>
        
            <p>This main sticking point for the provinces - who are understood to be concerned at their potential reduction in influence at board level - was addressed by Nichol, who said that "rugby now operates in a complex world".</p>
        
            <p>"Ensuring the NZR Board has people with direct experience operating in these environments, and at the various levels, is important.</p>
        
            <p>"Including this principle in any competency framework is aimed at assuring concerned PUs that this issue is recognised and will be addressed under the new model."</p>
