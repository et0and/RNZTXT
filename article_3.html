        <h2>Meet the Māngere locals on a mission to get more people cycling</h2>
        <p>
A new cycleway is in the works in the area, which will connect Māngere town centre to the Māngere bridge township and over the Manukau harbour. Audio

            <p>Māngere locals are on a mission to promote cycling in the south Auckland suburb - aiming to make the area the cycling capital of the pacific.</p>
        
            <p>A new cycleway was in the works in the area, which would connect Māngere town centre to the Māngere bridge township and over the Manukau harbour.</p>
        
            <p>The local cycling hub hopes once that is finished it will get even more people using two wheels instead of four.</p>
        
            <p>The Māngere Bikefit Community Hub helps fix up bikes, and then donates or lends them to people who need them, and organises group rides.</p>
        
            <p>Teau Aiturau, or Mr T, runs the hub and has seen cycling grow in Māngere since he first started his charity TTT, or Time to Thrive, in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>"More people are wanting to get on a bike. A lot of kids are riding. Just need to get their parents riding too."</p>
        
            <p>One of the biggest hurdles in getting people biking was their concerns for safety, Aitarau said.</p>
        
            <p>That is something volunteer Selwyn Lilley can attest to - he had now mostly given up biking after a nasty accident last year.</p>

            <p>"As I was rounding the roundabout on Robinson Road, as I was coming around the corner this car came out of Bader Drive, didn't even see me and collected me. Spent four days in hospital and three weeks on crutches."</p>
        
            <p>That is why cycleways - like the one under construction connecting Māngere and Māngere Bridge - were important, Aitarau said.</p>
        
            <p>"When they complete all these cyclelanes then you'll see the network coming. You'll see everybody wanting to get around on the bike."</p>
        
            <p>People felt safer in numbers when they were all out riding together, Aitarau said.</p>

            <p>When passersby saw them out and about in their hi-vis vests, it got their attention, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"People laugh at us but it's all good. We'll just laugh back. We're laughing riding past them - we wave out 'keep the wheels spinning'. It's great fun man ... that's what it's all about - having fun."</p>
        
            <p>It was not just about getting people from A to B.</p>

            <p>"I thought it would be a really good idea to collaborate, use the bikes, load up our resources and head out into the community to deal with invasive pest plants."</p>
        
            <p>Some Māngere bridge locals have been complaining about the construction of the new cycleway online, saying the community do not want it and it is a waste of money.</p>
        
            <p>But Mr T was not fazed.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep complaining man, because it's not going to stop. We just gotta keep pushing forward, we're making a change in Māngere - making an impact instead of seeing the same old road."</p>
        
            <p>Construction of the new cycleway will be completed in three stages between now and the end of October.</p>
