            <p>Auckland Council has decided to oppose the plan for a tunnel to run alongside the Harbour Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>A draft business case put together by WaitematƒÅ Harbour Connections project recommends an underwater tunnel that would cost $56 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff advised the Transport and Infrastructure Committee not to support the draft in its current form.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Wayne Brown agreed, and said the tunnel was a bad idea that should be dumped by the new government.</p>
        
            <p>"Fifty-six billion dollars to disappear in a tunnel to go underneath the harbour.</p>
        
            <p>"In the size of the economy, it's a wonder that grown-up people who can feed themselves and walk could come up with such a stupid number.</p>
        
            <p>"And I'm shocked that it hasn't actually yet been dumped by the government."</p>
        
            <p>The committee almost unanimously agreed to oppose the plan, aside from one member who abstained due to a conflict of interest.</p>
        
            <p>The new local government minister said his party will work closely with Auckland Council to deliver the infrastructure the city needs.</p>
        
            <p>Brown has been vocal about having more autonomy to meet the needs of the city.</p>
        
            <p>He released his manifesto for Auckland earlier in the year, saying he and his councillors can not make the fixes needed for Auckland unless Wellington moves out of the way.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown said he and the mayor would meet on a regular basis, and stay in touch on important issues.</p>
