            <p>The Jehovah's Witnesses must pay $48,000 in court costs to the Crown for a string of failed cases brought against the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care.</p>
        
            <p>The Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses Australasia sought a judicial review in 2023 in a bid to get out of being part of the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The legal action was launched after three years of legal wrangling with the inquiry behind the scenes to avoid its scrutiny.</p>
        
            <p>The bid was declined and the faith appealed the decision, but in April the Court of Appeal dismissed its argument.</p>
        
            <p>The church has agreed to pay $32,321 in court costs to the Crown for the high court judicial review and $13,212 for the claim made to the Court of Appeal, according to Crown Law documents released to RNZ under the Official Information Act.</p>
        
            <p>The faith has since applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, but a decision on this has not yet been made.</p>
        
            <p>In June, the church tried - and failed - to get an advance copy of the inquiry's final report into the faith after filing an urgent claim at the High Court in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It has agreed to pay the Crown $2629 in court costs for that action.</p>
        
            <p>Just days before the final report was due to be released publicly, the faith made an unsuccessful last ditch-effort to block the case study in the final report about them. Crown Law said these cost were still being calculated.</p>
        
            <p>The Jehovah's Witnesses was the only faith to file legal action against the Abuse in Care Inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>It has taken legal action against similar inquiries that have occurred around the world, including in the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>
