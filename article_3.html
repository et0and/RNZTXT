            <p>An Auckland man says he had to wait one and a half hours at a hospital emergency department as blood poured from his mutilated fingers.</p>
        
            <p>But Health New Zealand says it is confident in the care he was provided, based on a review of the case by clinicians.</p>
        
            <p>Hamangoda Gedara Gayan Madusanka Amaranayake, 34, was rushed to Middlemore Hospital after the fingers of his right hand were "crushed" in a workplace incident.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened at 4.20pm on 9 September, he was rushed to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Amaranayake was made to stand in a queue before being administered first aid an hour after arriving at hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"One of my fingers was hanging off. All I could see was blood and flesh in my hand and a long queue of people in front of me," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was trying hard to hold the broken fingers with a piece of cloth in my left hand. I couldn't bear the pain. I felt thirsty. Everything around me turned blurred. I thought it was the end of my life.</p>
        
            <p>"I was only thinking about my children. I was thinking what would happen to them if I lose my life."</p>
        
            <p>He said a woman waiting in the queue told him to move up his hand to control the bleeding.</p>
        
            <p>"I could see my fingers turning black before they [hospital staff] called me inside [a room] for the first painkiller injection."</p>
        
            <p>Amaranayake's wife Dushani De Silva said she's "shocked" and "horrified" to see her husband waiting in the queue when she reached hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"I reached hospital at 5.10pm. I was shocked to see him waiting in pain. He tried to hide his injured fingers from me because he didn't want me to panic but I knew he was in huge pain."</p>
        
            <p>Silva said her husband underwent a three-hour long surgery that started at 7.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Doctors took off his index finger in the first surgery and said they were trying to fix the ring and middle finger.</p>
        
            <p>"Two days later, they [doctors] said there's no point of keeping the ring finger."</p>
        
            <p>He underwent another surgery for his ring finger.</p>
        
            <p>"He can't do anything by himself. He can't even eat properly. I have to feed him, brush his teeth and do the washing and everything."</p>
        
            <p>The couple sold off their property in Sri Lanka to come to New Zealand and they were waiting to apply for their residency after spending two years in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We came to New Zealand with a lot of dreams," the wife said.</p>
        
            <p>"My husband has more than 10 years of experience as a mechanic. He's very talented. He cleared NZQA qualification to come here. He wanted to be a qualified WOF inspector and then start his own workshop.</p>
        
            <p>"But this injury has made him disabled.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't go back as we have sold off our house and I don't know if we can still get a PR as he's injured now. I don't know what to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I am only looking at today. I am not looking at tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>A trained mechanic from Sri Lanka, Amaranayake came to New Zealand in April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The couple has a seven-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son.</p>
        
            <p>Krishan Gallage, founder of SLNZ helpline, said he was shocked after hearing about the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"The hospitals should only get basic information if possible but they should not prioritise lengthy paperwork which can take a significant amount of time, especially in urgent situations.</p>
        
            <p>"I request the health authorities to [should] consider the challenges faced by new migrants, such as language barriers and unfamiliarity with the system and processes."</p>
        
            <p>Gallage said migrants generally had strong faith in the New Zealand health system.</p>
        
            <p>"There is always a room for improvement, particularly in addressing the needs of those who may not be fully aware of how the system operates. I appreciate the hard work of medical staff, but I think steps can be taken to better support new migrants in navigating the healthcare processes."</p>
        
            <p>A Health New Zealand spokesperson said their clinicians reviewed the case and were confident with the care that was provided.</p>
        
            <p>"The amount of time that a person waits in ED - both before and after seeing see a doctor - is complex.</p>
        
            <p>"People coming to ED are assessed upon arrival and prioritised based on their clinical need and acuity, rather than by order of presentation.</p>
        
            <p>"All decisions around patient care are made on a case-by-case basis by experienced clinical staff, with patient safety at the heart of all decision.</p>
        
            <p>"We recognise that it can be frustrating for people waiting in ED and our staff work extremely hard to assess, treat, and discharge or admit patients within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>"Generally with finger/hand injuries, the timing of pain relief can vary due to the need to assess feeling and movement."</p>
