        <h2>'Blown away' by extreme need as families swamp free dental clinics</h2>
        <p>
Hauora providers say the free clinics revealed the severity of dental health issues among Māori and the extreme need for access to treatment.

            <p>Free dental clinics in the Whanganui region have been swamped by whānau who say oral health care has been out of their reach for years.</p>
        
            <p>Hauora providers say the free clinics revealed the severity of dental health issues among Māori and the extreme need for access to treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 400 people were seen by volunteer dentists during the school holidays in a six-day, iwi-led hauora Māori initiative.</p>
        
            <p>The dental work included hundreds of extractions and fillings. Many patients had multiple extractions, including one person who needed 14 teeth pulled out.</p>
        
            <p>An estimated $150,000 worth of treatment was provided.</p>
        
            <p>Te Oranganui mātaiwhetū/chief executive Wheturangi Walsh-Tapiata said many people without appointments had to be turned away and more than 100 patients were referred to an oral health surgeon at the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"They had much more extensive issues that needed to be addressed," Walsh-Tapiata said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to have to work with them to try to ensure that they get access to those more specialist services."</p>
        
            <p>Iwi health providers heard stories about the barriers preventing patients from accessing dental health care more frequently, and the consequences of that for their oral and overall health.</p>
        
            <p>Many had not seen a dentist since primary school. The most severe case had 14 extractions, and another had their three remaining teeth removed so they could get dentures.</p>
        
            <p>Some had performed their own extractions, including some who used fishing line or pliers.</p>
        
            <p>"The stories they're telling us are incredibly sad. Many just can't afford it.</p>
        
            <p>"They had to choose other priorities like paying bills or putting kai on the table - or, in the case of whānau in our rural areas, they couldn't afford to travel to a dentist."</p>
        
            <p>Others were afraid of dental treatment or "whakamā" (ashamed) because of the state of their teeth.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh-Tapiata said patients were grateful to be treated, and many were overwhelmed.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been inundated by people who have not had good oral health and been in pain for a long period of time."</p>
        
            <p>The first clinic in Ohakune had four dental chairs in use and saw nearly 150 people, with 124 receiving treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"They came from as far as Hiruharama up the river, Raetihi, Waiouru and the Taihape area. We were just blown away by the number."</p>
        
            <p>Four chairs in Castlecliff, Whanganui, were fully booked the following weekend, with 170 patients from Ngā Rauru, Tūpoho, Tamaūpoko, Ngā Wairiki and Ngāti Apa.</p>
        
            <p>Referrals to the three-day clinics in Ohakune and Whanganui were made by iwi hauora providers and the clinics were fully booked ahead of time.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh-Tapiata said providers had tried to contain the number of referrals "because we could only see a certain number of people".</p>
        
            <p>Despite that, news spread and kaimahi in Whanganui were swamped by more than 200 phone calls and people walking in off the street.</p>
        
            <p>"We only touched the tip of the iceberg," Walsh-Tapiata said.</p>

            <p>The initiative was organised by regional iwi and health leadership group Te Hononga and iwi hauora providers, funded by Te Whatu Ora, and run as a collaboration between Te Whatu Ora Whanganui, the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF), local dentists and Te Oranganui - a health and social services provider governed by four iwi entities.</p>
        
            <p>In Ohakune, the local dentist volunteered her time on a Sunday, and low-cost Castlecliff practice Cliff Dental provided free treatment for two days.</p>
        
            <p>Hauora providers were especially grateful for the support of the NZDF, whose dental staff treated patients at both sites, Walsh-Tapiata said.</p>
        
            <p>"They offered all their dental staff throughout New Zealand the opportunity to come and volunteer, so we had their people from Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington and even Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"We wouldn't have been able to do this without them, or the support from Te Whatu Ora Whanganui, who gave us their mobile dental clinics."</p>
        
            <p>Patients were also offered a free health check, including blood pressure readings, and rongoā kaimahi provided mirimiri (massage).</p>
        
            <p>Called Menemene Mai (Smile), the initiative was organised after a Te Oranganui survey indicated oral health was a key concern for whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"Having events like this are critical to our community but ongoing services on a regular basis is our ultimate goal."</p>
        
            <p>Walsh-Tapiata said hauora providers hoped to secure government funding for a permanent mobile oral health clinic that could circulate throughout the region to provide free care.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, providers are hoping to repeat the exercise next year.</p>
