            <p>Analysis - It feels a bit wrong to quibble about a 64-19 thrashing. Especially in a fixture where the All Blacks' photo opportunities during the lead-up were probably the most important part of their week in Tokyo, as well as the fact that the job was completed with no injuries.</p>
        
            <p>But really, by about the 70-minute mark of the win over Japan, that same annoying feeling was being noted by All Black fans. That one that's been felt in all but two tests this year, because they had failed to score in yet another second half situation.</p>
        
            <p>For a while there, it looked as though the All Blacks were potentially going to rack up a century, but after Cam Roigard's try the whole game just fell apart.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks weren't helped by a Japanese side which was, by that stage, making it up as they went along.</p>
        
            <p>Whatever Eddie Jones said before the game had the desired effect as the Brave Blossoms scored two very good tries and were only just denied a third in the opening stages, but his halftime speech seems to have just been to try and run it from everywhere.</p>

            <p>What resulted was 40 minutes where the ball spent most of its time between the 22s, when it wasn't being dropped or illegally pulled out of rucks. At least the All Blacks were able to trouble the scoreboard operators eventually, with two tries to Ruben Love on debut as the clock ran down.</p>
        
            <p>However, you don't score 64 points without a few things going right. For starters, the All Blacks consolidated well after being shocked with an early try to Jone Raikabula and found the one weak spot in the Japanese defence.</p>
        
            <p>In truly ruthless All Black style, they then targeted the exactly the same place thanks to the Japanese right edge being about as sturdy as a piece of origami. That's the sort of thing that obviously wins tests like this in the first half because it resulted in four tries but is overall an important mindset for busting down tougher defences.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest question was who would put their hand up for the main test side and play a role against England, Ireland and France. Unsurprisingly Cam Roigard was the standout, although he was certainly in the reckoning anyway.</p>
        
            <p>While Samipeni Finau was very effective, most notably because his trademark big hits were perfectly executed without going anywhere near the unfortunate ball carriers' heads, it's pretty hard to get a gauge given the intensity was about that of a lower grade club game at times. Also what didn't help his cause is that Wallace Sititi was excellent as well, so unless Scott Robertson pulls the trigger on Ardie Savea moving to openside, Finau's path back to the top side is blocked for now.</p>

            <p>Mark Tele'a and Sevu Reece were essentially auditioning for the one free wing spot next weekend, if Robertson hasn't already decided to fill it with Will Jordan. Both had pretty different roles: Tele'a finished well and distributed near the line, while Reece had a few touches out wide but was mainly effective being a pest at the breakdown.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie's night seemed to get more frustrating as it went on, culminating in him dropping a pass cold on his 22 that nearly led to a Japanese try. His main contribution was on defence, pulling off two excellent cover tackles, but even that raises a point that his positional play is more suited to fullback.</p>
        
            <p>That's where he found himself when Opeti Helu burst through the line though, with the 127kg replacement prop chucking on a sweet sidestep to leave McKenzie clutching thin air as Helu scored under the posts.</p>

            <p>So really, a lot of what we already knew about the All Blacks was on show. It was always going to be a test that was going to get loose once the benches emptied, but at least this time they didn't go completely through the back end without scoring thanks to debutant Ruben Love.</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure though. One of the best New Zealanders out on the park wasn't wearing black, and if 22-year-old Warner Dearns decides that he wants to move back home and play in Super Rugby Pacific, it's highly likely there'd be a few teams fighting over his services.</p>
        
            <p>Dearns almost scored his second try against the All Blacks and was only denied by the TMO. It was just a shame for him after that his team mates completely forgot how to defend for the next 20 minutes.</p>
