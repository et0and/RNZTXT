            <p>Consumer credit demand rose in November as households looked to take advantage of retail sales leading up to Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Data from credit bureau Centrix showed demand rose 8 percent year-on-year in November, driven by credit cards (up 11.8 percent) and buy-now-pay-later products (up 7.1 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Mortgage demand and car loans fell 7.7 and 4.2 percent respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Credit arrears were slightly higher as households continued to face pressure from higher inflation and interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer arrears rose 6.1 percent in the year ended October, with 11.8 percent of the credit active population in arrears, up from 11.7 percent in September.</p>
        
            <p>Centrix said the 431,000 people were behind on their repayments, up from 427,000 a month earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Arrears were tracking close to pre-Covid levels after falling to historic lows during the Covid pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>It said 156,000 consumers were more than 30 days past due, while 103,000 were more than 60 days behind, and 83,000 were more than 90 days past due.</p>
        
            <p>Mortgage arrears also rose slightly, with nearly 1.3 percent of home loans in arrears in October, compared to 1.25 percent in September.</p>
        
            <p>Centrix chief operating officer Monika Lacey said while it was a small increase, it was not without concern.</p>
        
            <p>"The concern is really the trend. Ultimately the mortgage arrears level is still really low," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look back at the GFC [global financial crisis of 2007-08] the numbers were much higher, so we're nowhere near that point."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, company liquidations rose 36 percent year-on-year in October, down from an annual rate of 40 percent in September, driven by retail and construction sectors.</p>
        
            <p>"Businesses are doing it really tough out there, especially the smaller businesses," Lacey said.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost of doing business has increased and the cost of funding has increased. A lot of these small business owners will be using their own personal homes as security or using a mortgage to fund their business."</p>
