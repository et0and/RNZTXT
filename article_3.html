            <p>A Wellington garden centre says customers are concerned about how their gardens will fare as the region faces stricter water restrictions this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the Wellington region has today entered level 2 water restrictions, meaning no sprinklers or irrigation use is allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water says there is a 76 percent chance it will jump to level 3 later this month, which would see a total ban on water use outdoors.</p>
        
            <p>Palmers Garden Centre Miramar co-owner Phil Hughes says customers started asking him last month about what they could do to keep their gardens going during water restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Palmers had been trying to arm people with useful information that will hopefully reassure them that "they're not going to lose all their plants", Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of them were switching to hardier plants and vegetables but Hughes said the main thing was to change the way they watered.</p>
        
            <p>His tips for using water efficiently include watering early, conserving the water you have, using water butts and to water plants "deeply - don't water too frequently and get the plants to go looking for the water, they'll find it. It's amazing how resilient plants are".</p>
        
            <p>This week Palmers set up a display featuring plants that fare better in an environment with hotter temperatures and lower water levels.</p>
        
            <p>They include native grasses and colourful portulaca and verbena flowers.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua's Leacroft Nurseries nursery assistant Sam Dearsly said he was telling customers to keep plants watered "until the restrictions really kick in".</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, he suggested soaking the roots in a trough full of water when planting, and using mulch to lock the water in.</p>
        
            <p>"But apart from that they're obviously limited while the water restrictions apply."</p>
        
            <p>Dearsly said "any kind of succulents do well, obviously", in the dry, as well as native flaxes.</p>
        
            <p>"But it really varies site to site. So look at your garden and decide what will be best suited."</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said it would be interesting to see how Wellingtonians complied with the restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>But he said water was an issue everyone needed to think about anyway because of climate change.</p>
