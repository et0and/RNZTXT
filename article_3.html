            <p>A TikTok influencer who amassed 700,000 followers on the social media app had her account taken down recently over fears her content could encourage disordered eating.</p>
        
            <p>The Wall Street Journal profiled Liv Schmidt, a New York-based social media influencer, earlier this week detailing her often-controversial advice regarding body weight and image. The publication's questions to TikTok ahead of publishing the story triggered the platform to shut down Schmidt's profile over concerns her posts promoted disordered eating and an unhealthy body image.</p>
        
            <p>Here is a breakdown of the controversy.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt is a model and social media influencer who is, well, very slim. Her Instagram profile, which was not taken down and had about 70,000 followers, shows Schmidt attending celebrity-studded events and locations such New York Fashion Week and Ralph Lauren's exclusive Polo Bar.</p>
        
            <p>In a LinkedIn profile, Schmidt called herself a "social event coordinator" with a bachelor's degree in marketing and PR from the University of Arizona.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt often shared videos on TikTok that detailed her daily food consumption and weight loss tips, including how to avoid emotional eating at work or the weight gain that new university students sometimes experience.</p>
        
            <p>In one of Schmidt's more controversial videos, she said she "prayed" for her mum's skinny genes, not her dad's apparent fat genes, according to the Daily Mail, which called her a "skinny influencer".</p>
        
            <p>The profile on Schmidt questioned whether her dietary advice - Schmidt has no qualifications in nutrition - crossed a line into promoting disordered eating.</p>
        
            <p>"Weight is a touchy topic but that is what the viewers want," Schmidt, 22, told the paper. She also said a skinny body was her preferred aesthetic.</p>
        
            <p>Eating disorders are mental disorders that include anorexia and bulimia, and can impact both women and men. The mental disorders can have long-term health impacts and, in severe cases, lead to death.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt previously struggled with body dysmorphic disorder, according to US Weekly - a mental health condition where people obsess over "something they believe is wrong with their appearance," according to the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Some followers said they found Schmidt's advice helpful, but others, including dietitians, said her advice was harmful, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
        
            <p>Wall Street Journal reporter Sara Ashley O'Brien reached out to TikTok for comment. TikTok's response included taking down Schmidt's profile.</p>
        
            <p>It appears that Schmidt violated TikTok's guidelines on disordered eating and body image.</p>
        
            <p>TikTok and Schmidt did not respond to RNZ's request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The platform states that it does not "allow showing or promoting disordered eating and dangerous weight loss behaviours", including extreme low-calorie diets, binge-eating and intentional vomiting, over-exercising and promoting unhealthy body measurements.</p>
        
            <p>TikTok has faced criticism in the past for not doing enough to curb content that celebrated disordered eating or specific body types. Earlier this year, the app did ban "legginglegs", a hashtag that promoted thin legs apparently ideal for tight-fitting leggings.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, a New Zealand woman who struggled with an eating disorder, told RNZ said the platform was not doing enough to clean up 'Eating Disorder TikTok'.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if you are actively in recovery, and you're trying your hardest to stay away from those triggering posts, social media will now feed that to you," said the woman, who RNZ agreed not to name.</p>
        
            <p>"The algorithm will make sure that you have to watch it, or you have to at least swipe past it."</p>
        
            <p>If you think you might have an eating disorder, the first step is to tell your GP even if that's difficult.</p>
