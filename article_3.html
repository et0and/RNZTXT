            <p>Analysis - Super Rugby Pacific kicks off on Friday 14 February, with one less team than last season and a whole host of things to talk about. We're once again previewing each New Zealand team from the worst to first finishes last year, today it's Moana Pasifika.</p>

            <p>It really feels like this is the make or break season for Moana. To paraphrase Sir Michael Jones, the goodwill period is over, they've made arguably the biggest acquisition in the competition's history and the feeling is they're coming in with some actual on field expectations for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Off field there's been some changes, with new owners and a new home at North Harbour Stadium. Just how many people show up is just as important as how many wins they get, so if they can get on a roll with both, the narrative around Moana will change dramatically.</p>

            <p>Ardie Savea's arrival and subsequent naming as captain has been the biggest story of the off season, which has meant that Moana have finally got the eyes on them that they've so desperately needed all along. While Savea will sit out his share of games through All Black rest periods, he is one of the most consistent performers in world rugby so Moana will get a decent amount of output from him. He also joins a very solid loose forward unit that has now only got stronger from last year.</p>

            <p>The backline is certainly capable on attack but will need to seriously improve its defence this season if Moana is going to have a fighting chance. They ended 2024 with easily the worst points difference in the competition, getting gashed badly by the Blues and Chiefs (twice), and giving up 47 points to the Drua.</p>

            <p>The acquisition of Jackson Garden-Bachop has been overshadowed by Savea, but the other former Hurricane to join Moana could have just as much of an impact. Garden-Bachop takes over from the steady Christian Laeli'ifano and brings a big kicking game, something that Moana will need to utilise to take territorial advantage of their opponents.</p>
        
            <p>"First and foremost I've got to lead myself first and that's through my performance on the field and how I operate at trainings, and off the field as well. I also want to serve the brothers, serve the team, serve the franchise and serve the people anyway I can." - Ardie Savea.</p>

            <p>This is certainly the season that Moana can lift their attendances to more than just their friends and families, which has sometimes meant that turnouts have been legitimately lower than suburban club matches. North Harbour Stadium is the most maligned of all the grounds in New Zealand - it now features a massive hole in one stand thanks to an ill-fated commitment to the now-defunct Tuatara baseball team. So if you're wanting to watch a free fame of rugby, head over to that side of the park.</p>
        
            <p>All of them. Moana have a good start to the season with a fixture in Perth they won handily last year, but things will get tough once they return home. Put simply, every victory will be worth its weight in gold, especially if they can draw a crowd to North Harbour Stadium.</p>
