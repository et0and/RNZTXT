        <h2>Frustration at council view on 'benign' coastal landfill</h2>
        <p>
A southern council says it needs to "draw the line" with a community over its old dumpsite.

            <p>A southern council says it needs to "draw the line" with a community over its old dumpsite.</p>
        
            <p>At Colac Bay/Ōraka, 40 minutes west of Invercargill, a former landfill sits behind a crumbling coastal road next to the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>Affidavits signed by past and present residents claim the site is home to a range of hazards including car bodies, batteries, oil and herbicides.</p>
        
            <p>But how the site should be managed appears to have reached an impasse with the council saying there's no imminent threat while others demand action.</p>
        
            <p>Sediment testing in the area conducted by Southland District Council in October showed "everything's fine", strategic manager water and waste Grant Isaacs said last week.</p>
        
            <p>Isaacs made the comments in response to a question from councillor Derek Chamberlain, who was present at a September council meeting held at Colac Bay/Ōraka.</p>
        
            <p>"The sediment tests are about what you'd expect," Isaacs said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll go back out to the community I think, and have a chat. And I think we need to draw the line on what we do there.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spent a lot of money."</p>
        
            <p>Isaacs took exception to previous coverage of the dumpsite in the media, saying it didn't represent the effort the council had gone to.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a lot of work done there. It's pretty conclusive that it is a pretty benign domestic landfill."</p>
        
            <p>The site wouldn't be a problem unless erosion ate into it, but that would be 50 to 100 years away, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Isaacs' comments have not been taken well by Deen McKay - a nearby resident of Colac Bay/Ōraka who has been in discussions with the council over the landfill for about 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>McKay described what Isaacs said as "quite ludicrous" and took exception to the belief the landfill had up to 100 years left.</p>
        
            <p>"He obviously has no idea of the rate of erosion and the impact of the tidal action and possible storm events," she said.</p>

            <p>McKay also believed that because the old dumpsite had multiple entry points, rubbish was buried in a wider vicinity than people realised.</p>
        
            <p>While the remains of the crumbling Colac Bay Foreshore Rd provided some protection from the ocean, there were fears that would only last so long.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the sea reaches that remaining road they'll have no time to do anything."</p>
        
            <p>Southland mayor Rob Scott said he hoped the next step of meeting with the community would lead to everyone being on the same page going forward.</p>
        
            <p>He was pleased sediment testing had come back clear, but said the site would still be monitored regularly.</p>
        
            <p>The historic landfill sits on land now owned by Ōraka Aparima Rūnaka, who have been contacted multiple times but are yet to provide a comment.</p>
