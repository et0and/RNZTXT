            <p>As New Zealand's Asian communities celebrate the lunar new year on Wednesday, what can we expect from the Year of the Snake?</p>
        
            <p>Revered for an ability to shed its skin, the snake (蛇, shé) is typically associated with wisdom, mystery and transformation in traditional Chinese culture.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, the next lunar new year is likely to be a period of rebirth as we move away from our old ways, learning from the past as we move forward to a new future.</p>
        
            <p>In Chinese folklore, snakes are also called "little dragons".</p>
        
            <p>According to ancient legend, the snake undergoes a transformation over hundreds of years to eventually become a jiao (蛟), a mythical creature that lives underwater.</p>
        
            <p>One thousand years later, the jiao becomes a dragon without horns.</p>
        
            <p>It eventually grows horns several centuries later before ultimately becoming a celestial dragon that soars through the sky after another millennia.</p>

            <p>In traditional Chinese culture, snakes are closely associated with auspicious creatures such as fish (symbolizing wealth), dragons (power) and turtles (longevity).</p>
        
            <p>All four creatures are thought to share transformative connections.</p>
        
            <p>According to legend, a carp that successfully swims upstream and leaps over the Dragon Gate undergoes transformation into a dragon.</p>
        
            <p>Some say the carp's arduous journey from the sea to the Dragon Gate required it to take the form of a snake to traverse the sandy shallows at the mouth of the Yellow River.</p>
        
            <p>The snake sheds several layers of skin along the way, enduring excruciating pain as it tries to reach its goal.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed only carp that were able to jump over the Dragon Gate became dragons.</p>
        
            <p>Other parts of the world hold snakes in similar high regard.</p>
        
            <p>Ancient Greek mythology connects snakes with wisdom and healing through the rod of Asclepius that is wrapped by a serpent.</p>
        
            <p>Southeast and South Asian cultures are rich with cobra myths and tales of snakes safeguarding Buddha.</p>
        
            <p>In Egyptian mythology, the sun god often appears in serpent form, symbolising the creative force of the universe and the cycle of renewal.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, ancient Chinese myths describe Pangu, the creator of the world, as having a dragon's head and a snake's body.</p>
        
            <p>Even the sibling founders of the Chinese civilisation, Fuxi and Nüwa, are often depicted as having a human head and the body of a snake or dragon.</p>
        
            <p>What's more, the ancient rulers of China - the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor - are frequently portrayed as being part snake or dragon.</p>

            <p>The snake is the sixth of the 12-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac.</p>
        
            <p>Its stealthy movement, hibernation patterns, dietary habits, moulting and adaptability in different environments generally give the creature an air of mystery.</p>
        
            <p>That said, a snake's ability to coil lazily yet strike with speed, climb trees, swim and move with uncanny precision also give it a sense of unpredictability, elusiveness and ruthlessness.</p>
        
            <p>In Chinese culture, snakes are also valued for their intuition, elegance and strategic thinking, traits associated with adaptability and patience - qualities needed to overcome challenges.</p>
        
            <p>People born in the Year of the Snake are believed to be insightful, graceful and resourceful.</p>
        
            <p>They are also known for their vigilance, caution and rationality, making them adept at handling complex situations and pursuing creative endeavours</p>
        
            <p>Snakes also share some traits with their more illustrious dragon counterparts, including emotional depth and long-term planning.</p>

            <p>Anyone born in the Year of the Snake can typically expect a year filled with challenges.</p>
        
            <p>Indeed, it's possible they may experience mood swings or pessimism over the next 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>It's believed that travelling may help relieve such emotional knots.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone born on the Year of the Snake would be wise to pay attention to their relationships and health.</p>
        
            <p>They would also be advised to take extra precautions about safety, especially when engaging in outdoor activities or when using metal tools.</p>
        
            <p>Some believe that those born the current zodiac year can reduce the misfortune that may arise over those 12 months by donating blood or getting their teeth cleaned.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, they can alleviate misfortune by getting married, buying a new house or securing a promotion at work.</p>
        
            <p>It's important for those born in the Year of the Snake to adopt a conservative approach in terms of their finances and career over the next 12 months to avoid risk.</p>
        
            <p>People born in the zodiac signs that conflict with the snake - tigers and pigs - may face obstacles over the next 12 months and will need to exercise patience.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, zodiac signs that are compatible with the snake - roosters and oxen - are likely to have smoother lives, possibly even encountering new opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the zodiac animals, ancient Chinese tradition believes that five elements also influence one's fortune in a year: wood, fire, earth, metal and water.</p>
        
            <p>And if that wasn't getting complicated enough, the opposing balance of yin and yang also plays a role, with the former representing a cool, calm and contracting state and the latter representing an active, bright and expansive philosophy.</p>
        
            <p>According to a traditional Chinese calendar, 2025 is a yin wood year associated with soft greenery.</p>
        
            <p>As such, the Year of the Little Green Wood Dragon is expected to bring abundant rainfall in spring and summer, favourable agricultural conditions and bountiful harvests in autumn and winter.</p>
        
            <p>However, some challenges are likely to persist in other industries, with high prices and limited growth opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the next 12 months is also the second year of a 20-year "li fire" cycle that is characterized by global unrest, natural disasters such as wildfires, and shifts in technology, art and intellect (e.g., artificial intelligence).</p>
        
            <p>Stability continues to be the best strategy for navigating such challenging times.</p>
        
            <p>We would like to conclude by wishing all our readers a very happy new year - whatever zodiac animal you happen to be!</p>
