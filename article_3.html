        <h2>Barrett praises NZR for showing 'a bit of backbone' over eligibility rules</h2>
        <p>
Beauden Barrett says NZ Rugby's current rules of only picking players who play in this country is the way to go.
</p>
        
            <p>Incumbent All Black first five Beauden Barrett is backing NZ Rugby's stance on eligibility for test selection, praising the game's governing body for showing "a bit of backbone" around the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett is back with the Blues after spending the last Super Rugby Pacific season playing in Japan's Rugby League One for Toyota Verblitz and admitted that the debate around eligibility rules "opens a huge can of worms".</p>
        
            <p>"But I think we just have to back what NZ Rugby, are going with. Otherwise, it sets a bad precedent for the next generation," he said at the Blues' training base at Alexandra Park in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's different for South Africa, they've got the reasons why. But for the time being, I think NZ Rugby have showed a little bit of backbone around [eligibility]."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett was unaware that Richie Mo'unga had chosen to stay in Japan to see out his contract with Toshiba Brave Lupus, despite heavily rumoured attempts by All Black coach Scott Robertson to get him back playing in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Is he? OK. Well it's Super Rugby time and we're pretty keen to get into that … all I can focus on is playing well for the Blues. I'm sure Richie will be back in a couple of years which will be great for New Zealand rugby."</p>

            <p>Barrett rejoins a much-changed Blues side from the last time he played. They are defending champions, with coach Vern Cotter instituting a far more direct style that emphasised heavy carries and time in possession inside the opposition half.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt a shift when I came back from Japan and trained for a couple of weeks [last year]. Obviously, Vern's edge is different, so that the way that you saw the Blues play last year is different to what New Zealand's experienced in recent times," Barrett said.</p>
        
            <p>It can take a bit of getting used to - Barrett revealed what was supposed to be a 10-minute meeting with Cotter in December turned into an hour and a half discussion - but it will be tailored to the two-time World Rugby Player of the Year's skillset.</p>
        
            <p>"(Cotter)'s pretty keen to grow the game. And that's something that I'm pretty keen to offer and collaborate with, around that game because like I touched on before, what we did last year, teams are going to be a little bit more aware and will adapt."</p>

            <p>Barrett finds himself in a very interesting situation around the first five/fullback positions, with Stephen Perofeta, Harry Plummer and Zarn Sullivan all gunning for the two starting spots. He said the competition will be "huge".</p>
        
            <p>"We know that depth is going to be critical. That's healthy competition that makes it makes us better. But also it's a long season, there's going to be injuries. Everyone needs to stand up when we get our opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Barrett also re-joins a formidable group of experienced All Black leaders in the Blues, something that will help the coaching staff.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be times for sure where Vern might get grumpy, and the ideal environment is where players lead that kind of thing. Patty (Tuipulotu), Dalton (Papali'i), Reiko (Ioane), Ofa (Tu'ungafasi) and the like. That's I guess been the biggest growth of this team is that leadership. The beauty of this side now is that the leaders in the group who stamp that out. "</p>
        
            <p>Barrett has also been keeping an eye on brother Jordie's progress at Irish province Leinster.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been playing really well; I've been enjoying that and he has been to. He's now on a little two or three week break, which he'll need and is looking forward to. But what a fantastic experience for him so far.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that the Irish have really been enjoying his contribution, on and off the field. (I've been) getting a bit of FOMO, seeing those Snapchats of Guinness pints and some of the golf courses he's playing."</p>
