            <p>Unattractive cars are at an advantage for once - police say that by being ugly, they are better protected from theft.</p>
        
            <p>There has been a spike of cars being broken into and stolen in northern Auckland, and police are urging vehicle owners to take caution.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant, Roger Small, said police are following a bump in reports of vehicle crime in KumeÅ« and Huapai.</p>
        
            <p>He said, as well as vehicles being stolen, there have been reported attempts to steal vehicles, and valuables have been stolen from inside parked cars.</p>
        
            <p>Small said that police are asking drivers to take precautions to make their vehicle less of a target.</p>
        
            <p>"We want your vehicle to be as unattractive as possible," Small said.</p>
        
            <p>"Think about removing property from your car when you park up for the day: debit cards, the jacket on the back seat and even the two gold coins in the centre console."</p>
        
            <p>Drivers should avoid leaving money or wallets in parked cars, and park inside a closed garage if possible.</p>
        
            <p>"By taking a few additional steps it could help in stopping your vehicle becoming an easy target and avoiding unnecessary frustrations at this time of the year," Small said.</p>
