            <p>A Russian drone attack has caused significant damage to the radiation shelter of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says.</p>
        
            <p>Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civil nuclear catastrophe when one of its four reactors exploded in 1986. That reactor is now enveloped by a protective shelter, known as a sarcophagus, to contain the lingering radiation.</p>
        
            <p>The Russian drone struck the shelter of the destroyed power unit at the plant, causing a fire that had since been extinguished, Zelensky said on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"As of now, radiation levels have not increased and are being constantly monitored," he said, adding that an initial assessment had found significant damage.</p>
        
            <p>"The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today's Russia," he said.</p>
