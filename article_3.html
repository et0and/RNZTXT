            <p>Mid Canterbury SPCA is backing a push for tougher rules around owning cats.</p>
        
            <p>Ashburton SPCA centre manager Natasha Sutton said she was fully behind the Ashburton District Council's decision to investigate a policy.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't stress desexing and microchipping enough."</p>
        
            <p>They both should be a basic requirement for cat ownership, Sutton said.</p>
        
            <p>The SPCA had seen the "kitten season get longer and longer" in recent years and something needed to be done, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation has previously pushed for the government to introduce cat legislation, mandating desexing and microchipping that would allow councils to pass bylaws to manage cats to protect biodiversity.</p>
        
            <p>That's the reason for the push for a cat policy in Mid Canterbury from the Methven Birdsong Initiative through the Ashburton Biodiversity Advisory Group.</p>
        
            <p>Birdsong spokesperson Mac McElwain said people may had missed the point of a cat policy.</p>
        
            <p>It's not to imprison pet cats, but it is about ensuring their safety and enabling the management of the "unwanted cat population".</p>
        
            <p>"It's pet cat protection. It is simply a step to put in place guidelines to help manage the stray and feral cat population.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a people issue. Cats will do what cats do and they need help from people to make sure they don't run amok."</p>
        
            <p>McElwain said there was no legislation for cats like there was for dogs and other pets so it needed the council to have a policy they could work off.</p>
        
            <p>How that policy could look and work was now being investigated.</p>
        
            <p>The council voted to move forward with an investigation, with councillor Lynette Lovett the only one to vote against it.</p>
        
            <p>She was concerned about the cost and staff time involved in the investigation and any potential policy process.</p>
        
            <p>"This all comes at a cost, whether it ends up like dog registration.</p>
        
            <p>"It will have to be managed by someone as there is no use having policies if they are not going to be managed and policed."</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Hamish Riach said all the details would be covered in the investigation report.</p>
        
            <p>He said the investigation would be done in-house, but it would have to fit within the existing work programme.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no specific timeframe in the recommendation and unless council imposes one we will just slot it into the work programme."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Tony Todd supported the investigation going ahead and said Gareth Morgan "was well ahead of his time many years ago when he advocated something like this".</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's either cats or birds we want to look after."</p>
        
            <p>Morgan had famously made headlines when he called for stronger cat regulations in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>There are already 12 councils around the country with existing forms of cat management policy - including the Selwyn District which requires microchipping and registration but not desexing.</p>
