            <p>The lawyers assigned to represent the Christchurch mosque terrorist in his appeal have been granted permanent name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>In March 2020, Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty to 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of engaging in a terrorist act.</p>
        
            <p>But in November 2022, he lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence.</p>
        
            <p>The two lawyers who were assigned to act for him for the appeal applied for an order permanently suppressing their names and identifying details.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer A said they have appeared in many high-profile cases and in that capacity, had received a limited amount of abusive emails.</p>
        
            <p>They were concerned that the Tarrant case was both different and unique because of the nature of the crimes he had been convicted of.</p>
        
            <p>The lawyer said they were concerned not only for their own safety but that of their children.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer B is also an experienced criminal defence lawyer. They also said they were concerned for their own safety and that of their spouse and children.</p>
        
            <p>The court said it was likely the two lawyers would be the recipient of abuse and threats from people "hiding behind the relative anonymity that social media platforms provide".</p>
        
            <p>"It is impossible to predict the exact sources of this abuse and we consider it possible that the abuse would come from both those who abhor and those who support Mr Tarrant."</p>
        
            <p>The court said Tarrant was a unique offender having been convicted of crimes which rank him as the worst mass murderer in New Zealand - and a convicted terrorist.</p>
        
            <p>The court said the lawyers were likely to receive abuse and threats which are extreme, and thereby cause them undue hardship.</p>
        
            <p>It granted the application.</p>
