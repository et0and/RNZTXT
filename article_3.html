            <p>The wife of a well-known Auckland businessman has been killed in a robbery while at a shopping centre in California.</p>
        
            <p>Patricia "Trish" McKay, 68, was pulled onto the road following a struggle during an attempted robbery and was killed after being hit by a car driven by one of the offenders.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Steve Oberon of the Newport Beach Police Department said the incident was "surprising and shocking", especially as it occurred in a city generally regarded as safe.</p>
        
            <p>Patricia's husband, Doug McKay, was with her at the time of the robbery but was unharmed.</p>
        
            <p>But who are the McKays?</p>
        
            <p>Patricia McKay was a mother, wife and friend and her family asked for privacy as they came to terms with her death.</p>
        
            <p>"No words can express their sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia."</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported one of Trish McKay's neighbours was in tears after learning of her death.</p>
        
            <p>He told the Herald the McKays were just beginning to enjoy life as grandparents and Trish McKay "loved being a grandmother".</p>
        
            <p>"We are all in shock."</p>
        
            <p>The neighbour told the Herald the couple were well-liked by their tight-knit community in Remuera.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a lovely, lovely woman."</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour told the Herald Trish McKay's death was "just so tragic".</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he knew the couple well and Trish was a wonderful person.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tragic situation and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this incredibly difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>He said he had "incredible respect" for Doug McKay.</p>

            <p>He expressed the hope relatives and friends would surround them with love.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's deputy mayor Desley Simpson said in a Facebook post she was "beyond devastated" to hear of McKay's death.</p>
        
            <p>"Trish was the wife of Doug McKay who was (amongst other significant roles) the inaugural CEO of the amalgamated Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>"Trish was amazing- funny, loyal, and loving. My absolute deepest sympathies to Doug and her family."</p>
        
            <p>Doug McKay was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2015 for his contributions to business and local government.</p>
        
            <p>He has held governance roles in a number of large businesses including Fletcher Building, Genesis Energy, Ryman Healthcare, Insurance Australia Group New Zealand Ltd, Bank of New Zealand, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He is also a former chairperson of Auckland Civil Defence and Emergency Group and former Auckland City Mission board member.</p>
        
            <p>Doug McKay was the first chief executive of the new 'supercity' Auckland Council when it formed in 2010. He left that role in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, a Gulf News article reported McKay had to apologise for comments he made about Waiheke Island locals in which he said the place was "full of lunatics and activists".</p>
        
            <p>He said his comments, which were picked up by a microphone he did not realise was on, were regrettable.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to say my comments were flippant and regrettable, and although they were made privately, they ended up public. It was inappropriate, and I should not have said them in any context," he was reported as saying.</p>
