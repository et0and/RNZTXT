            <p>Seamer Brydon Carse took six for 42 as England dismissed New Zealand for 254 to bring up lunch on the fourth day of the first test in Christchurch on Sunday to move to the brink of victory.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell frustrated England with a defiant 84 but the tourists will be comfortable with a victory target of 104 on a good batting pitch with five sessions of the test remaining.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand resumed in a parlous state at 155-6 with a lead of just four runs and the writing was on the wall when Carse removed Nathan Smith and Matt Henry cheaply in one over to claim his first test five-wicket haul.</p>
