            <p>The Pulse have suffered a major blow to their ANZ Premiership campaign, losing starting centre Maddy Gordon for up to 12 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon had to leave the court in their round three game against the Steel in Wellington on April 28, tweaking her ankle.</p>
        
            <p>Scans have confirmed a significant ligament sprain, which will rule her out of action for up to 12 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The dynamic midcourter was the 2023 ANZ Premiership Player of the Year, featuring consistently in the top 10 for feeds, intercepts and deflections during the 2023 season.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Fern was continuing where she left off in the first few rounds of this year's ANZ Premiership. The Pulse have made a great start to the season and are unbeaten after four rounds.</p>
        
            <p>"Maddy has been in superb form this season and is a key team member on and off court,'' Pulse coach Anna Andrews-Tasola said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are all extremely disappointed for Maddy and remain hopeful we will see her on court again this season.''</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington based side's final regular season game is in about 10 weeks time on 22 July.</p>
        
            <p>Pulse management were currently working through the logistics of an interim replacement player which should be known later this week and will continue to re-evaluate Gordon's progress before confirming any long-term injury replacement.</p>
        
            <p>The Pulse have also been missing front-line shooter Tiana Metuarau, who has been sidelined with a foot injury. Metuarau told Sky Sport last weekend that she could be out for another month.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, former Silver Ferns midcourter Claire Kersten, who retired last year after two seasons with the Magic and eight seasons with the Pulse, answered an SOS from her old franchise.</p>
        
            <p>Kersten played 53 minutes at centre. The Pulse pulled off a stunning turn-around to beat the Mystics, who were missing strike shooter Grace Nweke.</p>
        
            <p>Trailing by 11 goals at half-time the Pulse held the Mystics to just 10 and six goals through the third and fourth quarters to win 52-47.</p>
