            <p>Ōpōtiki District Council dog control staff have confirmed that four dogs that bailed up a woman outside a Ford Street property on 27 December were from the same household as those that seriously wounded a woman in September.</p>
        
            <p>In the latest incident, a woman in her 60s was badly frightened when she was rushed and surrounded by four dogs.</p>
        
            <p>She made a report to the council's after-hours service just after 8am while the council offices were closed for the Christmas-New Year break.</p>

            <p>Council compliance officer Annette Munday said contractors followed up at 10.05am but the dogs were no longer at the property.</p>
        
            <p>After the Christmas break, council staff investigated and four unregistered dogs were uplifted and impounded.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 22 dogs and puppies have now been uplifted from the same property since mid-September.</p>
        
            <p>Most of them were taken after a young woman was hospitalised with serious injuries after being attacked by a group of four dogs on 14 September.</p>

            <p>Emergency services and Ōpōtiki District Council dog control contractors responded to the event on Church Street at around 10.30pm .</p>
        
            <p>Police said dogs continued to rush at police and ambulance staff and members of the public as they attempted to help the victim.</p>
        
            <p>Animal control officers worked with police to secure and impound the dogs at the Ōpōtiki pound.</p>
        
            <p>The owner agreed to surrender the dogs, and they were put down.</p>
        
            <p>Ōpōtiki animal control officers, following up on the incident two days later, discovered 13 puppies at the property, from two litters, which the owner surrendered to animal control.</p>

            <p>The property was re-inspected on September 18 and yet another unregistered dog was discovered and uplifted.</p>
        
            <p>The owner was allowed to keep one elderly dog which was registered and not involved in the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Munday said the property did have adequate fencing but the owner had been fined for each unregistered dog and for the unconfined-uncontrolled activity of the dogs.</p>
        
            <p>She said over the two-week Christmas break the after-hours service provider had logged nine dog-related calls, which were all attended to.</p>
