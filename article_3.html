            <p>A landowner is so frustrated with a council over access to a beach he will not now accept thousands of dollars in payment even if it is offered.</p>
        
            <p>The man has installed boulders blocking an access point to the popular Hawke's Bay beach, Waimārama.</p>
        
            <p>Domain Beach Road runs parallel to Waimārama beach - but it is also on Eru Smith's land, at the Waimārama holiday park.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said he has now given up fighting the council over the use of his land after seeking compensation over the last three decades.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council put the road there 40 years ago, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Smith had been asking Hastings District Council to pay $8000 a year to lease the road, topped up with another $200,000 in backpay.</p>
        
            <p>But even if it came to the party now, it was unlikely he would accept, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll live another 20 years, but I'm not gonna fight them for that long, they'll owe me more money."</p>
        
            <p>He has chosen instead to block the road so the public could not use it.</p>
        
            <p>"I told them, I'm over it, and I'm gonna block the road," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>"Fight's over now, and we're never gonna remove them. I don't care if they come and offer me what I wanted, I still won't take them off the road."</p>
        
            <p>It was the principle of the matter that bothered him, but there were also health and safety issues, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone gets hurt in a crash on that road, we'll be liable because it's on our property."</p>
        
            <p>Residents were mostly in his corner, Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>There were gaps between the boulders so walkers and cyclists could get through, and there were other nearby access points to Waimārama beach, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While I was doing it, I spoke to six people. Two of them were anti, and the other ones supported me.</p>
        
            <p>"They know I've been fighting the council for years."</p>
        
            <p>The council was "in discussions" with Smith to try and find a solution, it said in a statement, but could not comment on the content of those discussions.</p>
        
            <p>"The sealed drive through the domain is not legally speaking a road, and people have driven over a portion of the camping ground's land for many years at the pleasure of the landowners whose section runs from Harper Road to the beach," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"They [the owners] are now exercising their private property rights."</p>
        
            <p>While people were not required to put up private property signs, the council would install some to advise the accessway was closed, to clarify the issue for the public.</p>
        
            <p>Boulders were also recently installed at Tiakitai Road by other locals who wanted to stop people driving on the beach - and although Smith supported what they had done, he had nothing to do with it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The only similarity was the boulders themselves, which were obtained from the nearby quarry.</p>
