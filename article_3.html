            <p>The Blues hopes of rushing All Black Beauden Barrett into their squad for the Super Rugby playoffs have been dashed.</p>
        
            <p>The 123-test All Black has returned to Auckland from Tokyo, where he has spent the Japanese domestic season playing for Toyota Verblitz.</p>
        
            <p>He has been training with the Blues and the franchise confirmed that they were "seeking clarification around the application process for including Barrett at the Blues for the remainder of this season".</p>
        
            <p>However in a statement, Super Rugby Pacific tournament director Matt Barlow said Barrett had failed to meet the necessary requirements for a dispensation.</p>
        
            <p>"The eligibility rules state that any players holding overseas contracts at the beginning of the 2024 SRP (Super Rugby Pacific) season would have to be eligible to play in the country of that team on or prior to April 1 2024," Barlow said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is in alignment with World Rugby regulations which precludes the holding of dual contracts."</p>
        
            <p>Super Rugby teams can apply for dispensation for a player who's arrived after 1 April "but dispensation can only be granted in the event the arriving player has played four regular season matches and signed a contract to play in SRP the following year".</p>
        
            <p>While Barrett is contracted with the Blues for 2025, has has not played for them at all this season, therefore he "was not able to meet the stipulated requirements for dispensation and as such he has been ruled ineligible for SRP Finals 2024", the statement added.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a surprise loss to the Crusaders at the weekend, the Blues remain at the top of the Super Rugby ladder, equal on points with the second placed Hurricanes, but ahead on points differential.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues host the Chiefs in Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
