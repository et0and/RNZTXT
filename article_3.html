            <p>William "Billy" Te Kahika has been sentenced to 200 hours community work and ordered to pay fines totalling $14,000 for failing to declare political donations and keeping records.</p>
        
            <p>The failed politician was found not guilty of the more serious fraud charges but convicted of four charges relating to his Electoral Commission returns, following a trial in September at the Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Judge Kathryn Davenport reminded Te Kahika that he had been found guilty of "corrupt practice".</p>
        
            <p>"The courts have taken a dim view of those that seek to undermine our democratic process," Judge Davenport said.</p>
        
            <p>Security in the courtroom was tighter than usual, with guards posted in the public gallery and at the door of the courtroom. Judge Davenport suppressed the reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Joanne Lee said while Te Kahika was an inexperienced politician, it was incumbent on him to know what responsibilities he had in disclosing political donations and keeping records.</p>
        
            <p>She compared the case to that of former ACT MP and mayor of Auckland, John Banks. Banks was initially found guilty and sentenced for filing a false return before the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction and ordered there be no retrial.</p>
        
            <p>Lee said despite Banks' acquittal, the sentencing of Justice Edwin Wylie could still be used as a guide. Banks was sentenced to community detention and 100 hours community work, before he was acquitted on appeal.</p>
