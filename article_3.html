            <p>The founder of Te Pāti Māori Dame Tariana Turia will be laid to rest at her marae at Whangaehu today.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana died on Friday, aged 80, after earlier suffering a stroke.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands have arrived in the small settlement south of Whanganui over the last four days to pay their respects.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau spokesperson Che Wilson said Tuesday's proceedings would begin with karakia followed by a church service to send off the woman affectionately known among her iwi as Auntie Tari.</p>
        
            <p>The nehu, or burial, was expected to take place around 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said the whānau were encouraging people to stay behind after the nehu for the hākari, or feast, which usually signaled the end of a tangihanga.</p>
        
            <p>He said the village of Whangaehu may be small, but the entire Māori community on both sides of the Whanganui river had come together to farewell one of their own.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't be from one side of a river and not from the other side of a river, or connected to the many rivers along here, so ... as a wider rohe (region) we're supporting each other to ensure we can do the things we need to do to honour our Queen."</p>
