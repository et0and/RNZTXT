        <h2>Much-needed or 'yet another' fee? Charging for national parks</h2>
        <p>
Some argue conservation areas can no longer take the strain of tourists, but others say it's starting to look like the government is "triple dipping".

            <p>The government's proposal to charge people to enter Aotearoa's most popular natural attractions has received mixed reviews.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) is asking the public who should pay to enjoy our national parks and conservation areas and how that money should be used.</p>
        
            <p>Ruapehu mayor Weston Kirton welcomed the idea, if the money funded desperately needed infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said central plateau tourism hotspots like Mount Ruapehu were not coping with the number of tourists they had.</p>
        
            <p>"National parks can't continue on with the damage caused by visitors over the years and without the infrastructure needed to support up to 200,000 tourists a year.</p>
        
            <p>"We're tremendously stretched as a small community and can't take on the cost."</p>
        
            <p>But he said, it was important for locals to continue to have free access to Aoraki.</p>
        
            <p>"There should definitely be a price for New Zealanders from outside the district and for those who come from overseas."</p>
        
            <p>He said the district required more toilets and camping grounds to keep up with demand.</p>
        
            <p>"We welcome visitors to the area but we don't get the funding required to support them."</p>
        
            <p>Stewart Island Flights owner Bill Moffat strongly opposed the plan, arguing it already cost too much for tourists to visit.</p>
        
            <p>The island currently has a $10 visitor levy, but Moffat said this could increase to $15 in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Most people travelling to New Zealand must also pay a $100 dollar tourist levy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's yet another charge being incurred by the visitors," said Moffat.</p>
        
            <p>"The inbound arrival levy, 50% of that is supposed to contribute to DOC.</p>
        
            <p>"Adding another levy is like triple dipping."</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Industry Aotearoa chief executive Rebecca Ingram said decisions about the proposed charges needed to be made carefully.</p>
        
            <p>"Tourism businesses think it's important that DOC can invest in the future and deliver the amazing experiences they provide.</p>
        
            <p>"They also think it's important to consider the fees that are paid by visitors and in particular, take into consideration that the international visitor levy is now $100 and a portion of that goes toward conservation."</p>
        
            <p>The group will consult tourism operators before it makes suggestions to the government.</p>
        
            <p>Tourists spoken to by RNZ were understanding of the government's position, but some were concerned about added costs.</p>
        
            <p>Liyaan was returning to London after a 21 day tour of the North and South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"As a tourist, it would drive up my costs. But I also understand why it would be imposed.</p>
        
            <p>"For people on a budget, it might make them think twice about coming to New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Phaidra from Belgium said if the fees were in place now, she would have to consider how many activities would fit into her budget.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be quite a lot to pay every time."</p>
        
            <p>US traveller, Liam, was happy to pay for the sights.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have no problem as long as it's going towards preserving the natural places in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>He was used to paying an entry fee to access parks in the US and suggested New Zealand implement an annual pass for tourists.</p>
        
            <p>Some New Zealanders RNZ spoke to were worried about losing free access to treasured places.</p>
        
            <p>Jalal was sceptical about where the money would go.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems like another cash-grab from the government.</p>
        
            <p>"They should be encouraging people to explore our parks more. An additional fee would be detrimental to encouraging people to get outdoors."</p>
        
            <p>Amelia said she would not go to a conservation area if there was a fee.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't pay it. Not a single dime. New Zealand should be free for everyone to see."</p>
        
            <p>Other New Zealanders like Ben were on board with increased funding for conservation efforts.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably would be fair for the user to pay to maintain the places they visit."</p>
        
            <p>Neil was fine with paying as long as the money went back into the area.</p>
        
            <p>"That way we get nice things like walkways."</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the proposal, which would also make it easier for private businesses to operate on conservation land, closes at the end of February 2025.</p>
