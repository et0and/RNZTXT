            <p>Tegan Ariel Chen has been named as the 10-year-old girl who died after falling into Marian Creek in Fiordland.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called about 11.40am on 25 January after being alerted to the girl falling into the fast-flowing creek.</p>
        
            <p>She was found and taken out of the water a short time later and CPR was performed but she was unable to be revived.</p>
        
            <p>Tegan was on holiday with her family from New South Wales, Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Police said their thoughts were with Tegan's family at this "incredibly difficult time".</p>
        
            <p>Southland mayor Rob Scott earlier expressed his sadness over the incident, and said it was a huge tragedy for all involved.</p>
        
            <p>Scott described the river where the girl died as "unforgiving".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty harsh environment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in the middle of summer but it is very cold out there too and it's a strong flowing river.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a nice calm environment, but it is well frequented by visitors as well and is a beautiful part of the world.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very sad that we've had this kind of outcome."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the investigation into Tegan's death was ongoing.</p>
