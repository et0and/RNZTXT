        <h2>Live: England extends lead over Black Caps</h2>
        <p>
England pace bowler Gus Atkinson took a hat-trick as the Black Caps had a miserable morning on day two of the second cricket test at Wellington's Basin Reserve.

            <p>The New Zealanders were all out for 125, with Atkinson taking the last three wickets, giving his side a 155-run lead on the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>In their second innings, England were 82 for the loss of Zac Crawley at lunch, a lead of 237 with the promise of plenty more runs to come with the pitch flattening out, and the Black Caps striving for a breakthrough.</p>
        
            <p>After their rough finish to day one, New Zealand were hoping the middle to lower order could perform better than the top ranked batters as Tom Blundell and Will O'Rourke resumed the innings at 86 for five.</p>
        
            <p>But a double strike by Brydon Carse in the fourth over of the day saw both batters fall in the same over</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips struck a few boundaries, but was stranded on 16 when Atkinson removed Nate Smith, Matt Henry and Tim Southee in successive balls to bring a startling halt to the innings. Smith (14) played on, Henry speared a bouncer to Ben Duckett in the gully and Southee was trapped leg before.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters reported it was the 47th hat-trick in 147 years of test cricket, the first since 2021, and the first by an England bowler since spinner Moeen Ali achieved the feat against South Africa at the Oval in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Atkinson finished with four for 31, while Carse took four for 46.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps struck early in England's second innings, with Devon Conway catching Zac Crawley off Matt Henry for just 8, but Ben Duckett (39 not out) and Jacob Bethell (34 not out ) scored freely to take the side to a commanding position at lunch.</p>
