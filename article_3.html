            <p>Authorities have designated a knife attack at a Sydney church as a terrorist act.</p>
        
            <p>At least four people, including Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, were injured during a service at Christ the Good Shepherd Church in the suburb of Wakeley.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrested a 15-year-old boy at the scene and said they were forced to hold him at the church for his own safety after a crowd gathered outside, demanding the attacker be brought out.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second major stabbing in just three days after six people were killed at Westfield Bondi Junction on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to the ABC, NSW Premier Chris Minns said the church stabbing was a "terrorist act".</p>
        
            <p>"That decision was validated by the Minister for police at 1:44am with her contacting me at 2am this morning," he said.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb also referred to the incident a "terrorist act".</p>
        
            <p>"Strikeforce Katrina has been established to investigate that side of the events last night and a referral has been made and agreed to by the joint counterterrorism investigation team."</p>
        
            <p>She had spoken about the incident with the counterterrorism team for over an hour on Tuesday morning, she told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"The things that influenced my decision to declare this a terrorist incident was the actions of the individual who attended, we will allege attended that church ... armed with a knife and stabbed the bishop and priest.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe there are elements that are satisfied in terms of religious-motivated extremism."</p>
        
            <p>Webb said the church service's livestream informed her declaration of the event as a terrorist attack.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager made comments to the bishop "centred around religion" as he approached, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The 15-year-old was known to police, but not "well-known", she told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the important thing is here is ... he wasn't known to us from a terrorism point of view, he was not on any terror watchlist.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first time this individual has come to our attention in this manner."</p>
        
            <p>A livestream of the event, hosted on the church's social media page, showed the bishop being stabbed several times in the head and chest.</p>
        
            <p>A separate eyewitness video, which has been verified by Reuters, showed the suspect being pinned to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>A voice, speaking in Arabic, said: "If they didn't insult my prophet, I wouldn't have come here. If he didn't involve himself in my religion, I would not have come here."</p>
