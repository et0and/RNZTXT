            <p>The number of New Zealanders expecting house prices to rise has returned to 2020 confidence levels.</p>
        
            <p>ASB's latest Housing Confidence Survey for the three months that ended in December found a net 33 percent of respondents thought house prices would rise and a net 23 percent thought it was a good time to buy a house.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was a slight drop in the proportion of people expecting interest rates to fall to a net 51 percent from a net 57 percent, though the survey predated the Reserve Bank's (RBNZ) most recent cut to the official cash rate to 3.75 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley said the results aligned with expectations for a slower pace of OCR cuts for the rest of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Inflation is back under control, and the RBNZ has already cut the OCR considerably," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"For those considering buying a home, there is a bit of a sweet spot at the moment with interest rates continuing to fall, high levels of supply and subdued house prices."</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury's confidence rose the most with a net 38 percent thinking prices would rise, from 25 percent in the third quarter.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was less confidence when it came to buying.</p>
        
            <p>A net 23 percent of overall respondents thought it was a good time to buy, compared with 20 percent in the third quarter, though confidence wavered in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"There still seems to be a little bit of caution in reality, and we would expect to see that caution will start to get thrown over to the wind as the year progresses," Tuffley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Where we are now is pretty much on par with the optimism that we saw late 2020 early 2021, when we had the big boom in the housing market.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly we're back to feeling as optimistic about it being a good time to buy as we were when we came out of that first lockdown back in 2020."</p>
        
            <p>However, Tuffley said the glut of houses for sale could be a reason why would-be-buyers were taking their time, with the high number of homes for sale reflected in the latest data from Real Estate Institute, which showed a surge in new inventory of homes on the market, while sales continued to decline.</p>
        
            <p>"There may also be some concern about the inflationary impacts of Trump's re-election in the US," Tuffley said.</p>
