            <p>Crusaders coach Rob Penney is adamant they can still defend their Super Rugby crown.</p>
        
            <p>The reigning champions sit bottom of the standings following five straight defeats, their worst start to a season, and next face the second placed Chiefs in Christchurch on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Before the competition began Penney stated the Crusaders' goal was to win the tournament and he said that hasn't changed.</p>
        
            <p>"For us the goal posts haven't moved," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel as though we're competitive with everybody and on our day we can beat anybody. Obviously every week (so far) we've made it harder for ourselves, but we've just got to cement a place in the playoffs. If we can get there we know we'll be dangerous. We've just got to find a way to get there."</p>
        
            <p>Penney knows exactly what it will take to get to the playoffs.</p>
        
            <p>"Some wins. Simple as that.</p>
        
            <p>"We've talked a lot about performance and that's what we're focused on but we do need some outcomes obviously."</p>

            <p>Penney believed there were multiple reasons behind the team's recent struggles, but he was confident they were not far away from producing winning performances.</p>
        
            <p>He also insisted he was not feeling any more pressure than usual despite the Crusaders horror start the season.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm fine," Penney said.</p>
        
            <p>"Just coaching. Just trying to get the boys better and get the team functioning as well as we can and we've got another contest on Friday night which is really exciting."</p>

            <p>That contest was against the Chiefs, who beat the Crusaders in the season opening game in Hamilton and sit second in the standings behind the unbeaten Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Penney said a lot had happened since round one.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems not that long ago but it is a lifetime ago in terms of rugby. The Chiefs have progressed, they're a team brimming with confidence and we've probably gone the other way, so it's a real challenge for us."</p>
