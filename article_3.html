Analysis - It won't solve fan engagement issues overnight, but retro jerseys are a good start, Jamie Wall writes. Video

            <p>Analysis - The Blues, Chiefs, Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders have had their new jerseys revealed, and one has stolen the show.</p>
        
            <p>Really, it's not surprising as to why given the narrative around the competition and rugby in general right now.</p>
        
            <p>All the Super Rugby teams' jersey were rolled out by new gear provider Classic Sportswear. The Australian company has taken over from adidas, who had outfitted the apparel for the last 24 years, a tenure that could best be described as a mixed bag.</p>
        
            <p>The problem with the adidas range is that it got progressively blander over time, to the point where an entire range of away jerseys looked more or less the same. It got to its most ridiculous point three years ago when the Highlanders played the Bulls and the home side had to change their jerseys at halftime, due to an urgent request from the broadcasters who were fearing the audience couldn't tell the teams apart.</p>
        
            <p>That's not to say there weren't some very good adidas efforts, though. The Jonah Lomu era Hurricanes jersey is fondly remembered, while lately the Chiefs' one-off pink and black strip was really well received.</p>

            <p>The new Classic range for next season looks solid, but pretty familiar. The Blues are blue, the Highlanders another shade of blue, while the Chiefs haven't strayed too far from their previous designs although have included a striking training jersey. The Hurricanes have a nice black number as their away strip and the Crusaders have stuck with a Southern Alps motif because they can't really be knights in armour anymore.</p>
        
            <p>It all sort of screams 'play it safe' from the teams and designers. Except for one release, that quickly grabbed everyone's attention, because it was something that people had been asking for.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues stole the show with an image of Carlos Spencer looking as regal as ever in a throwback jersey. A throwback to 1997, when the King reigned supreme at Eden Park in an unbeaten campaign, his side scoring 435 points at an average of 39 a game on their way to a second successive Super 12 title.</p>
        
            <p>That design, with its red, white and blue shoulders, is fondly associated with the dream time of Blues rugby. When the terrace and Blue Zone still existed and the team was unbelievably stacked to the tune of a dozen All Blacks in the starting line up. The unanimous wave of approval, not just by Blues faithful but by fans of other teams said it all.</p>
        
            <p>Because this isn't just about jersey sales. Super Rugby desperately needs to reconnect with the fans who packed out the now completely rebuilt Eden Park, as well as the long-since-departed Athletic Park, Lancaster Park and Carisbrook. The kids who were there back in those days have grown up, a demographic that now has teenagers and kids of their own. Jerseys like this are conversation starters, that get the perfect marketing scenario happening: The arm tug of the kids wanting to be a part of something, and be there when it happens.</p>
        
            <p>It's not new. Just down the road the Warriors figured it out years ago, which is why they not only have throwback jerseys all over the place, to the point where they currently have their own fashion trends. Mid to late 90s is in right now, especially the original white Warriors DB Bitter jersey.</p>

            <p>But it's even bigger than that. Rugby isn't alone in having older fans boring others to death with tales of how much better the game was in 'their day', but right now it's hard not to agree. There was no TMO in 1997, lineout drive tries took second place to getting it wide to Joeli Vidiri, Tana Umaga or Jeff Wilson, and most importantly, the stands were full.</p>
        
            <p>Advertising is about making people feel good about their choices. It's also about making people know the brand is consumer-driven, something that adidas certainly couldn't do considering their line was designed on the other side of the world. The rest of the teams are due to launch their throwback jerseys in due course, and while they're not going to solve the inherent fan engagement issues that Super Rugby has, it's a good start.</p>
