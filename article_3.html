            <p>The All Blacks head into today's opening Bledisloe Cup encounter with a mission to get their season back on track. Scott Robertson's side has lost two tests in a row, albeit in extremely challenging circumstances in South Africa. So it's important to not only win these two tests against the Wallabies but win them well.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Wallabies are coming in off the back of a disaster against Argentina where they were beaten by a record margin. Coach Joe Schmidt is knowledgeable about the All Blacks, having been an assistant coach during Ian Foster's time in charge, but that'll count for little if his players can't get things working on the field.</p>

            <p>Here's a look at the teams:</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies: 1 Angus Bell 2 Matt Faessler 3 Taniela Tupou 4 Nick Frost 5 Jeremy Williams 6 Rob Valetini 7 Fraser McReight 8 Harry Wilson (c) 9 Nic White 10 Noah Lolesio 11 Marika Koroibete 12 Hunter Paisami 13 Len Ikitau 14 Andrew Kellaway 15 Tom Wright</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Brandon Paenga-Amosa 17 James Slipper 18 Allan Alaalatoa 19 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto 20 Langi Gleeson 21 Tate McDermott 22 Tom Lynagh 23 Dylan Pietsch</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks: 1 Ethan de Groot 2 Codie Taylor 3 Tyrel Lomax 4 Scott Barrett (c) 5 Tupou Vaa'i 6 Wallace Sititi 7 Sam Cane 8 Ardie Savea 9 Cortez Ratima 10 Damian McKenzie 11 Caleb Clarke 12 Jordie Barrett 13 Rieko Ioane 14 Will Jordan 15 Beauden Barrett</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Asafo Aumua 17 Tamaiti Williams 18 Pasilio Tosi 19 Sam Darry 20 Luke Jacobson 21 TJ Perenara 22 Anton Lienert-Brown 23 Sevu Reece</p>
        
            <p>Ethan de Groot unsurprisingly returns into the front row after missing the South Africa tour with injury, in the only change to the starting line up from their last test. That hands a big chance for Wallace Sititi on the blindside, after his impressive performance against the Springboks in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>In the backs, Cortez Ratima starts at halfback, but the big change is to the back three. Caleb Clarke is back on the left wing, while Beauden Barrett is at fullback and Will Jordan is on the right. Sevu Reece survives the chop and is on the bench in the utility role.</p>

            <p>Fraser McReight is a welcome addition back to the loose forwards after an injury layoff. Noah Lolesio returns to the side and will partner Nic White in the halves, while Hunter Paisami as well and Tom Wright are all also back in the run on team.</p>
        
            <p>It's a massive day for veteran James Slipper, with the prop set to become the most capped Wallaby of all time when he comes off the bench. He will earn his 140th cap, surpassing the legendary George Gregan. Slipper is already the highest capped prop in test history.</p>

            <p>"The Bledisloe is a massive trophy. It's something that I know the All Blacks treasure and the Wallabies would like to treasureâ€¦ but I think what we've been working on is really just trying to do elements of the game better rather than talking about anything that's outcome focused or result focused." - Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at the first Test each year, especially in Aussie, those games have been tight. They've come down to small margins, one score games for long parts of the match. He'll [Schmidt] come up with a couple of special third-phase plays you haven't seen for a while, or he's brought out of his bank. He's got a hell of a library of moves and he's got rugby intellect." - All Blacks coach Scott Robertson.</p>

            <p>All Blacks 23 - 20 Wallabies</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 38 - 7 Wallabies</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 40 - 14 Wallabies</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 39 - 37 Wallabies</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks haven't lost to the Wallabies since 2020, streak of nine tests. They've also held the Bledisloe Cup since 2003, meaning that streak is almost as old as some of the players.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks need a complete performance, as they've already dropped three tests this season. The last two were about as close as they can get to excusable as they were in South Africa, but Scott Robertson's team needs to get back to the attacking cohesion we saw against Argentina at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>This is a Wallaby team desperate to just compete, but as we saw last year in Dunedin, they do have the firepower to establish a lead if they get a chance. Much will hinge on Lolesio, who the All Blacks have generally contained well, but also the ball carrying ability of captain Harry Wilson.</p>
        
            <p>One thing is for sure: The sun will be shining. It's been a beautiful week of weather in Sydney and an afternoon kick-off will make the most of that.</p>
