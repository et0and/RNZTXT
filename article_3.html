            <p>A person has died in a house fire in Whitby, Porirua, and a second person was in hospital in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>A dog also died in the blaze, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour told RNZ the people who lived in the home were from a tight knit family who'd lived in the area for years.</p>
        
            <p>They were lovely, private people, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour said an elderly couple lived in the house.</p>
        
            <p>They said one of the couple had just retired and the other had a recent cancer battle.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter at the scene said the fire had been extinguished.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the Lanyon Place address about 2.20am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Eight crews fought the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Just before 8am, Fire and Emergency were still at the scene dampening down hot spots and investigating the house which was unstable.</p>
