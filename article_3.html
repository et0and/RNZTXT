            <p>Teenager middle-distance sensation Sam Ruthe is auctioning his world record running shoes to raise money to support his training partners and coach Craig Kirkwood.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Ruthe, 15, became the youngest person to break four minutes for the mile at rain-soaked Mt Smart Stadium, still 24 days short of his 16th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>The achievement sent shock waves around the athletics world - he took three seconds off his previous world best for a 15-year-old and was 274 days younger than Norwegian Jackob Ingebrigtsen, since a two-time Olympic champion, who ran 3m 58.07s in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the shoes that carried him to history have been posted on Trade Me.</p>
        
            <p>"One young owner," the ad said. "A little water exposure, but dry now. Hopefully good for another decade or so. Verified as being raced in for only 3m 58.35s.</p>

            <p>"Still has stickers in the heels. Can vouch for the faint whiff of achievement."</p>
        
            <p>The sleek Nike racers, size 10.5 US, are sure to become a collector's item and had already attracted a $1040 offer by 4pm Saturday. Bidding closes next Saturday, 29 March.</p>
        
            <p>This summer, Ruthe also set world age bests over 1500m (3m 41.25s) and 3000m (7m 56.18s), and became New Zealand's youngest-ever senior men's champion, winning the latter title and sharing the former with Olympian Sam Tanner.</p>
        
            <p>Kirkwood, a former Commonwealth Games marathoner, also coaches Tanner, who paced Ruthe to his sub-four performance, and previously guided Olympic triathlete Hayden Wilde.</p>
