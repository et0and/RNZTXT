            <p>The vote count is underway across the country but already the pundits have projected former president Donald Trump as winner in 25 states while Vice President Kamala Harris has earned the nod in 15, according to CNN.</p>
        
            <p>Just after 8pm (NZ time) CNN projected Trump would win the key battleground state of Pennsylvania which has 19 electoral votes. He is now very close to the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to move back into the White House.</p>
        
            <p>It follows CNN projecting he would also win North Carolina - another one of the seven key races as well as the swing state of Georgia.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Harris is the projected winner of California which adds 54 electoral votes to her tally.</p>
        
            <p>Harris was hoping to become the first woman elected president, while Trump is vying to become only the second former president to win a non-consecutive second term.</p>
        
            <p>The election had been expected to come down to a handful of battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
        
            <p>In the list below we have key race alongside each of those states. Here's how it stands by mid-evening on Wednesday.</p>
