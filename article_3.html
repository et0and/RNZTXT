        <h2>Closure of town's only bank leaves elderly residents 'very upset'</h2>
        <p>
The closure of the Kiwibank counter has left elderly residents without vital services and business owners facing long trips by car to do their banking.

            <p>The closure of a Far North town's only bank has left elderly residents without vital services and business owners facing long trips by car to do their banking, locals say.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwibank counter at the local Four Square was the only bank left in Mangōnui, about 45 minutes east of Kaitāia, when it shut down at the end of March.</p>
        
            <p>Mangōnui is the main service town for Doubtless Bay and a busy tourist destination, noted for its heritage buildings, fish and chips, and a waterfront festival at the end of summer.</p>
        
            <p>Fiona White, owner of Fresh and Tasty takeaways next to the Mangōnui pub, said it was not just businesses she was worried about.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm also thinking about the old people. Now they have to drive all the way to Kaitāia. They're very upset."</p>
        
            <p>That included her 88-year-old father who did not do internet banking or use a smartphone.</p>
        
            <p>White did not even let him take money out of the ATM by himself because she was worried he would be robbed.</p>
        
            <p>When the Kiwibank agent was still open, doing the banking for her business was a matter of walking across the road.</p>
        
            <p>Now she had to drive 45 minutes each way to Kaitāia and queue up in a branch with limited opening days and hours.</p>
        
            <p>The whole exercise took about three hours, twice a week.</p>
        
            <p>As the owner of the shop, White had to put someone else in charge each time she needed to deposit the takings and get change.</p>
        
            <p>She had investigated options such as getting a cash delivery firm to collect the takings, but that cost "an arm and a leg".</p>
        
            <p>Together with another resident she organised a petition calling for the retention of banking services in the town, and gathered 185 signatures in two days.</p>
        
            <p>White said her sister, who had a bakery in nearby Coopers Beach, also had to make regular trips to Kaitāia, while the local butcher was driving to Paihia to do his banking - a trip of well over an hour each way.</p>
        
            <p>A Kiwibank spokeswoman said the owner of Mangōnui's Four Square, which had provided banking services on behalf of Kiwibank, decided it was not possible to continue.</p>
        
            <p>She said Kiwibank was unique in that it partnered with retailers around the country to provide services in more locations.</p>
        
            <p>Partner agents were limited to over-the-counter transactions and simple account and card maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwibank works with local agents to provide coverage across Aotearoa, but if a retailer decides it's time to exit the relationship, we respect that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank was not considering replacing its Mangōnui agent, based on customer figures for the area and the way they were choosing to conduct their transactions.</p>
        
            <p>The plight of Far North residents and business owners who depend on physical banks was not just limited to Mangōnui.</p>
        
            <p>Russell lost its last bank, a Westpac branch, in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ pulled out of Paihia in 2016 followed by ASB in 2021, leaving only a Kiwibank agent at the local bookshop.</p>
        
            <p>Most major banks still have branches in Kerikeri, Kaitāia and Kaikohe, although many operate with limited hours.</p>
        
            <p>Kerikeri's Kiwibank agent closed down in 2021.</p>
