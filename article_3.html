            <p>A prisoner who escaped the custody of Corrections staff at Waikato Hospital in Hamilton was there for "medical oversight".</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified about 1.30pm that a prisoner had escaped from Corrections custody at the hospital on Pembroke Street.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said police officers were actively searching for the escapee.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections said the prisoner was on remand at Spring Hill Corrections Facility and escaped while on a visit to Waikato Hospital, details of which they were not able to release due to privacy.</p>
        
            <p>Springhill general manager Scott Walker said the prisoner was handcuffed and wearing a GPS monitor when he escaped.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said police were informed immediately and began a search.</p>
        
            <p>He said public safety was the prison's top priority and any escape was unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>An immediate review into how the incident occurred would be carried out, Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>A Corrections spokesperson would not say how many staff were escorting the prisoner when he escaped, but said none were injured.</p>
        
            <p>A Health NZ spokesperson would not say whether any hospital staff or patients were injured or threatened.</p>
        
            <p>Police said anyone in the immediate surrounding area who had seen anything suspicious should call them immediately on 111.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not say whether the prisoner was considered dangerous and said the man's name and photograph would only be released if police planned an appeal for sightings.</p>
        
            <p>They said the police Eagle Helicopter was not involved in the search.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time in a month that a prisoner has escaped from Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In the first incident in November, a prisoner escaped after allegedly assaulting two Corrections officers and carjacking a vehicle. He was later arrested.</p>
