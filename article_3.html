            <p>A thief who stole from dozens of shops, netting more than $37,000 worth of goods, said he gets a kick of out shoplifting, which he considers to be "like a job".</p>
        
            <p>Travis Archer had been out of prison eight days after serving time for dishonesty-type offences when was back to old habits - targeting 26 Auckland retail stores, including Smith and Caughey's.</p>
        
            <p>Now the 30-year-old is back behind bars, after being sentenced in April to three years in prison relating to 40 charges of theft and burglary.</p>
        
            <p>The charges were the result of two crime sprees - the first between May and August 2023 and the second in February. He didn't steal anything between those months as he was in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Archer has since appealed his three-year sentence, calling it "manifestly excessive".</p>
        
            <p>Archer has amassed more than 70 convictions for various offences, including dishonesty crimes, since 2013.</p>
        
            <p>He was released from jail on 3 May last year and was on parole at the time of the offending.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents reveal he stole on 26 separate occasions between 11 May and 20 August last year, taking mainly alcohol, food and tools.</p>
        
            <p>Each occasion led to a separate charge of theft, including five instances where the value of the stolen goods exceeded $1000.</p>
        
            <p>In July last year, he entered Smith and Caughey's department store twice, taking items valued at about $400 and $900. He was</p>
        
            <p>charged with burglary for each of those occasions as he had previously been trespassed from the store.</p>
        
            <p>He also failed to report to his probation officer multiple times and was charged with breaching parole conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Archer was charged with intentional damage after spray-painting the wall of a liquor store on 3 August.</p>
        
            <p>On 21 August, he was arrested and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>On 1 February this year, he was released from prison on bail for 24 hours on compassionate grounds. He absconded and went on another stealing spree.</p>
        
            <p>He stole perfumes worth $460 from another store from which he had earlier been trespassed, leading to a further charge of burglary.</p>
        
            <p>He committed another 11 shoplifting offences within eight days in February, stealing food, tools and a mobile phone.</p>
        
            <p>He was rearrested and pleaded guilty to 37 theft charges in total, the three burglaries and intentional damage.</p>
        
            <p>Archer was usually identified by CCTV cameras in the stores. He shoplifted in daylight and made no effort to disguise his identity.</p>
        
            <p>In sentencing Archer, District Court Judge Gus Andr√©e Wiltens said he was not prepared to give any discount for remorse.</p>
        
            <p>He noted something Archer told a pre-sentence report writer about his thieving: "It gives me a kick and they say love what you do. It's like a job".</p>
        
            <p>Archer admitted he had said that, but argued his words had been taken out of context in the report, to his detriment.</p>
        
            <p>Archer appealed his three-year sentence to the High Court, arguing an appropriate end sentence would have been two years and four months in prison.</p>
        
            <p>High Court Justice Tracey Walker turned down the appeal, saying the three-year jail term was not manifestly excessive.</p>
        
            <p>She also said that the "comparative scale and relentlessness" of Archer's offending was relevant.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Walker said the total value of the items stolen in 2023 was $20,560, and the 2024 offending came to $17,056.</p>
        
            <p>She noted Archer's crimes were probably driven by untreated drug and alcohol addiction, in turn linked to his untreated ADHD.</p>
        
            <p>"Unless there is therapeutic intervention, I fear that Mr Archer is trapped in an offending cycle," she said.</p>
