            <p>Lotto officials are still searching for two of the Powerball players who won $7.18 million on the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The $50 million jackpot was won by seven people, most were from Auckland, with one from Hamilton and another from Hastings.</p>

            <p>Lotto NZ's Lucy Fullerton said two people who purchased tickets in Auckland had yet to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>The tickets were bought at Woolworths Metro on Victoria Street and at Royal Oak Mall.</p>
        
            <p>She told First Up they had ways of tracking the winners down.</p>
        
            <p>"With a big prize like this, any Powerball prize, we'd give it two weeks and then we'd probably start taking steps to try and find the winner.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a whole range of ways and obviously we have to be careful about people's privacy and so we have a very strict well-defined process for how we can look for people, I can't share everything about it because...we don't want copycats."</p>
        
            <p>Lotto NZ knew the date and time the tickets were purchased and could gather information from CCTV or EFTPOS transactions.</p>
        
            <p>Fullerton said it was unusual that all the winners had not yet come forward, though it had been less than a week.</p>
        
            <p>People had 12 months to claim a prize, though most PowerBall winners claimed within three days, she said.</p>
        
            <p>A PowerBall prize had never gone unclaimed.</p>
