        <p>
The Postal Workers Union is concerned a new directive from NZ Post will mean less mail is getting where it needs to go.

            <p>The Postal Workers Union is concerned a new directive from NZ Post will mean less mail is getting where it needs to go.</p>
        
            <p>Letters addressed to a company's physical address when a PO box is available will be returned to sender, with workers no longer allowed to look up the box number and replace it on the envelope.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Post chief customer officer Bryan Dobson said that was "a hugely time intensive process", and has told workers to stop doing so.</p>
        
            <p>"Most big businesses, government agencies, shops etc have both a physical address (where the building is located; and not usually eligible for mail delivery) and a postal address (usually a PO box where their mail gets sent)," Dobson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"NZ Post will no longer be offering this free readdressing service, and will instead be asking New Zealanders to address their mail to an address that qualifies for mail delivery."</p>
        
            <p>This might mean people needed to look up a mailing address to make sure letters were safely received.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged this change might be inconvenient for customers, but it was part of a raft of changes "in response to New Zealanders choosing to communicate more online".</p>
        
            <p>But the union said it represented a "downgrade in services", with the focus no longer on getting mail where it needed to go.</p>
        
            <p>Co-national president John Maynard said: "This is government departments, hospitals, resthomes - and we've been getting a lot of feedback from the posties around the country, they are very unhappy about the loss of service to the people."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would also affect high-profile mail recipients like MPs - any mail to an elected official would now need to be addressed to Parliament's private bag, rather than "Parliament Buildings, Molesworth Street, Wellington" or "The Beehive".</p>
        
            <p>"There would be very few constituents writing to their MPs who would know that Parliament Buildings has a private bag," Maynard said.</p>
        
            <p>"We can see the point that, perhaps if a company's got a box number, make sure you advertise it, but there will always be somebody that's gone past, didn't realise there was a box number, and wanted to send mail to that place - I've done it myself."</p>
        
            <p>He was concerned it would result in double-handling, when those returned letters again came across NZ Post workers desks when the sender gave it another try.</p>
        
            <p>More changes were on the way.</p>
        
            <p>Late last year, NZ Post proposed fewer deliveries every week, a reduced number of postal outlets, and no longer having mail deliveries to letterboxes at front gates.</p>
        
            <p>Dobson said they would eventually begin combining mail delivery with the parcel delivery network, "moving from two urban delivery networks to just one".</p>
        
            <p>This would manage the high cost of delivering much less mail than in the past, allowing the service to remain commercially sustainable, he said.</p>
