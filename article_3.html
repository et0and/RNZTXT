Plans to put sports fields and housing on a Rotorua golf course have been shelved as council moves away from a $62m proposal with nearly $190,000 already spent.

            <p>Controversial plans to put sports fields and housing on a Rotorua golf course have been shelved as the council moves away from a $62 million proposal with nearly $190,000 already spent.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua Lakes Council says it is working on a "new programme" for sports fields and facilities that does not include changes to Springfield Golf Course.</p>
        
            <p>Supporters of the 18-hole course - which counts one of New Zealand's top golfers Danny Lee among its alumni - say they are relieved and the change in direction is a "big win for the Springfield community".</p>
        
            <p>In 2017, council suggested putting a future sports ground on the council-owned land leased by the club. It would be part of the Westbrook Sports and Recreation Precinct.</p>
        
            <p>A concept image was made public in 2020 and the following year, the council put the proposal into its draft Long-Term Plan with an estimated $62m price tag.</p>
        
            <p>The vision for the precinct incorporated Westbrook Reserve, Ray Boord Park, Smallbone Park, Rotorua International Stadium, Westbrook netball courts and the Springfield Golf Course into a sports hub, with the potential for housing to also be built on the golf course land.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal prompted community backlash. The Saving Springfield group collected 5017 signatures on a petition asking the council to declare the golf course a taonga and continue its lease when the current term expires in 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Saving Springfield president Robert Lee and fellow campaigner Don Paterson, who live near the course, were among six new councillors elected to the council last October.</p>
        
            <p>In a Long-Term Plan 2024-34 workshop in October, Paterson asked whether sportsfield network plans would be included in a future workshop.</p>
        
            <p>Interim council chief executive Gina Rangi acknowledged there had been concerns about the precinct proposal, and said it was not the current council's strategy.</p>
        
            <p>"That [precinct] proposal will not exist once this council adopts its proposal."</p>
        
            <p>Instead, she said the council was investing in sportsfields at Titoki Pl, land previously earmarked for KƒÅinga Ora housing, and reviewing Rotorua's sportsfield needs.</p>
        
            <p>Elected members were told in August Rotorua would need an estimated nine more sportsfields by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Lee said he felt a "huge sense of relief" the precinct was not included in the plan under development.</p>
        
            <p>The golf course was the heart of that part of the city, he told the workshop.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big win for the Springfield community."</p>
        
            <p>Paterson said after the meeting the proposal had caused "anguish and harm" to the community concerned about losing "precious greenspace", so the change was a positive outcome.</p>
        
            <p>The council confirmed to Local Democracy Reporting its new approach would have no effect on Springfield Golf Course.</p>

            <p>Council infrastructure and environmental solutions group manager Stavros Michael said the total spend on the Westbrook Sports and Recreation Precinct project was $189,591.</p>
        
            <p>Of this, $26,946 was related to scoping and forecasting the district's future sport facility and field needs to identify improvements required as part of the 2024-34 Long-Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if the precinct proposal had been scrapped completely or tabled, he said the proposal contained a range of work including existing field upgrades and improving the stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"The anticipated new programme will retain some components of this and more work is focused on improving fields and renewing facilities."</p>
        
            <p>This included adding some field lights and creating two new fields at Titoki Place.</p>
        
            <p>"The stadium upgrades and the creation of eight additional fields will not be pursued at this point in time."</p>
        
            <p>He said impacted sports clubs and codes were told mid-September the precinct would "likely look different" in this long-term plan, as it focused more on the short-term need.</p>
        
            <p>Springfield Golf Club president Paul Fox said the "next hurdle" for the club would be having its lease renewed.</p>
        
            <p>Fox was confident this would happen "in the very near future". The current lease covered 33 years.</p>
        
            <p>Having the green space in the city was a big asset, he said, and it could aspire to be a golfing holiday destination like Queenstown.</p>

There are on average 130 players in the Springfield Golf Club twilight series each week.

            <p>This month marks 75 years since the Springfield Golf Club was established, beginning years of work by volunteers to clear the swampy land and lay out the course.</p>
        
            <p>Lee gave Local Democracy Reporting a tour of the course during the twilight golf session last Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>He said the council's move away from its precinct plan was especially fitting given the club's anniversary.</p>
        
            <p>Fox said he believed the club's twilight summer series was one of the most well-attended in the country, averaging 130 players a week.</p>
        
            <p>Fox said the nine-hole team event was a social occasion and a big part of the club's income.</p>
        
            <p>About 120 people attended on that evening, many staying afterwards for a meal and a beer. The fairways and greens were busy with activity.</p>
