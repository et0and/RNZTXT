            <p>"We're in the kisses and cuddles game."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the way you'd expect a farmer to describe their livestock operation, but not every operation is built around what is often called the "world's cutest sheep".</p>
        
            <p>Tucked away in the rolling hills of the Jimboomba region of Queensland, Ray Norris and Rachael Moon's Valais blacknose sheep farm is capturing the hearts of animal lovers across Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"You meet them, and you'll fall in love," Ray said.</p>
        
            <p>Originating in the icy Swiss Alps, Valais blacknose sheep are renowned for their fluffy white coats, dark faces, spiral horns and dog-like personalities.</p>
        
            <p>The rare breed first arrived in Australia via Victoria in 2020, and had since spread to Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Norris and Moon were among only a handful of breeders in Queensland sharing these enchanting creatures with the public.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really humbling if we get to share the love," Ray said.</p>

            <p>For the husband-and-wife team, who had previously focused on merino and dorper sheep, it all started with a simple scroll through social media.</p>
        
            <p>An image of a Valais stood out.</p>
        
            <p>"Rachael said, 'They're beautiful, aren't they?' Ray recalled.</p>
        
            <p>It was love at first sight.</p>
        
            <p>That moment set the stage for a 3,500-kilometre round trip to Victoria, where they brought home Rosie and Adam.</p>
        
            <p>Two years later, their flock had grown to 60, and their social media following has expanded just as rapidly.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the couple sold the sheep as pets, and showcased them at petting zoos and events where people could interact with the friendly flock.</p>
        
            <p>While Valais blacknose sheep had historically been raised for their wool and meat, Norris and Moon viewed them as more than just livestock.</p>
        
            <p>The sheep's affectionate nature had made them perfect companions.</p>

            <p>Bringing the Valais blacknose sheep to Australia was no easy feat.</p>
        
            <p>Since 1952, Australia had banned the importation of live sheep from all countries except New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>With Switzerland's export restrictions, breeders turned to the UK, where embryos and semen were first imported into Australia in 2020 by Victorian farmers Belinda Cardinal and Tony Urek.</p>
        
            <p>Due to their rarity and the high establishment costs, quality breeding sheep once fetched upwards of A$25,000, but today, non-breeding pets were available for as little as $500.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the seemingly high prices for breeding stock, Cardinal - who was also president of breed society Valais Blacknose Australia Ltd - was seeing a strong increase in interest.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a wide base of genetics in Australia now and there is also interest internationally for our Australian genetics," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We think the future is very bright."</p>
        
            <p>She said the community was thriving, with nearly 50 members, and an active Australian Facebook group of more than 5,000 followers.</p>
        
            <p>Heading to Queensland's warmer climate, Norris and Moon's sheep had to make at least one change - regular haircuts!</p>
        
            <p>"We shear twice or sometimes three times a year depending on the weather just to keep them comfortable," Moon said.</p>
        
            <p>The wool was sent to local hand-spinning groups, where it was made into coats and rugs.</p>
        
            <p>"We also give them plenty of shade and fresh water and we find that they're doing really well."</p>
        
            <p>Rachael, a vet by profession, had advice for any potential owners.</p>
        
            <p>"They go a bit crazy in the afternoons and run around and prance and dance," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They definitely need a few acres to be sheep-slash-dogs."</p>
        
            <p>Norris reckoned their sheep were friendlier than another popular, and some say cute farm animal.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to start any alpaca wars, but … they kick, bite and spit. Our sheep don't do that," he laughed.</p>
        
            <p>Looking to the future, the farmer's dream of building a shed where visitors could witness lambs being born.</p>
        
            <p>Because if there's one thing cuter than a Valais, it's a Valais lamb.</p>
        
            <p>In a major coup for the breed, Cardinal announced this week the Valais blacknose would be the feature sheep breed at the Melbourne Royal Show this September.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really excited and proud of the announcement," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Internationally recognised as the cutest breed of sheep in the world … people just cannot help but love them."</p>
