        <h2>'We found a way' – Robertson reflects on Bledisloe battle</h2>
        <p>
The All Blacks failed to score any points at the business end of their test against the Wallabies, but Scott Robertson is proud of the effort.
</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he was happy or relieved after the All Blacks' 31-28 Bledisloe Cup victory, coach Scott Robertson admitted it was a bit of both. After shooting out to a 21-0 lead early in the game, the All Blacks could only muster one Damian McKenzie penalty goal in the entire second half.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just really proud of the effort," said Robertson post-match at Accor Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the efforts at the end there, that scramble. We had a couple of yellow cards and we found a way to win it."</p>
        
            <p>It was the fifth time as many Rugby Championship tests that the All Blacks have failed to score in the final 20 minutes, however Robertson paid tribute to their opposition.</p>

            <p>"Full respect to the Aussies. We just didn't finish those opportunities that we've been creating all year and there's big momentum swings. Whenever the score's like that there's always a bit of trepidation, that you've got to keep going and get those passes to stick… but they didn't and we found a way."</p>
        
            <p>There were an astonishing seven tries arguably bombed by the All Blacks, most glaringly a shockingly unnecessary flick pass from McKenzie that should have sent Tamaiti Williams in for his first test try. Instead, the ball went flying behind the prop and into the hands of the Wallaby defence.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said that while he will have a conversation with his first five regarding the matter, he wants his players to "trust their skillset".</p>
        
            <p>"You want D-Mac to be instinctive, that's his greatest gift isn't it? Find space, glide, but put it on someone's chest. Maybe give that a bit earlier, get a bit of pressure under him at training but keep trusting himself."</p>
        
            <p>The issue of discipline was something Robertson did concede he was "very disappointed" with, as the All Blacks made it very hard for themselves in the last 10 minutes after losing Caleb Clarke and Anton Lienert-Brown to the sin bin.</p>
        
            <p>"A big focus for us was our discipline, especially when you get on your own line… it's an area where they targeted us and we weren't good enough."</p>

            <p>Asked if the feeling after the victory was bittersweet, Robertson left no doubt about the way he was feeling.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got the cup," he said. "I'm really pleased. The last three test matches have come to a pass, a ref call, a moment's decision-making. So that's test footy. We're learning quick, we're getting a group experienced to win these tight games. So, it'll taste sweet, thank you."</p>
        
            <p>It'll also taste new. While Robertson had a four-year, 23-test career as an All Black, he never won the Bledisloe Cup as a player. He's now won it as a coach, although it was clear that his side has a few work-ons for the return match in Wellington next Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not shying away… there's areas with our bench, finishing and decision-making. But we're working hard, man. I think that's reflective in how that showed in our defence that there's a deep care for what we're all about. But we need to start finishing some games a bit better."</p>
