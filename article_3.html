        <h2>Aukus Pillar Two: Australia gets new quantum atomic clocks</h2>
        <p>
Quantum technology is one of eight technologies the US, Australia and UK are sharing more of under the controversial defence pact.

            <p>The Australian military is getting new quantum atomic clocks under the Aukus Pillar Two pact.</p>
        
            <p>Quantum technology is one of eight technologies that the US, Australia and UK are sharing more of under Aukus.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Defence Force said quantum clocks from an Adelaide company would be used in communication and navigation systems.</p>
        
            <p>They would give a "capability edge for the warfighter".</p>

            <p>The portable clocks are the result of initial work by the University of Adelaide, "in close partnership" with Defence.</p>
        
            <p>Atomic clocks are essential for determining positional accuracy because all GPS satellites must transmit their data signals at the exact same time - they keep time to within three-billionths of a second.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand officials had identified quantum tech as one of six areas where this country could contribute if it joined Pillar Two.</p>
        
            <p>Ministerial briefings also showed the country's interest in cooperating with Japan on quantum technologies.</p>
        
            <p>A briefing to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon for his trip to Japan in June said: "There is the opportunity to capitalise on our growing bilateral science relationship with Japan and cooperate more directly on priority fields for New Zealand such as advanced technology, where Japan is a world leader. Areas of interest are AI, biotechnology, energy, materials, and quantum technologies."</p>
        
            <p>AI was another focus technology for Pillar Two. Japan is at the forefront of moves to expand Aukus Pillar Two beyond the three founding states: the US, UK and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The atomic clocks deal was a prime example of collaborating to use commercial research in advanced ways in the military, the ADF said.</p>
