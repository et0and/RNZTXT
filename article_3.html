            <p>"Cameron is the biggest upgrade in modern political history."</p>
        
            <p>So texts a former cabinet minister, delighted to see the return of the now Lord Cameron as foreign secretary.</p>
        
            <p>Yes, you read that sentence right: Lord Cameron, foreign secretary.</p>
        
            <p>Politics, flippin' heck.</p>
        
            <p>The accidental instigator of the biggest single moment in British foreign policy in a generation - Brexit - is now the face of British foreign policy, under a Brexit-supporting prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Accidental, you'll recall, because he called the EU referendum hopeful his argument for Remain would triumph. It didn't, and he was a goner. Or at least he was until today.</p>
        
            <p>So what's going on here?</p>
        
            <p>This appointment allows the prime minister to argue he is bringing the Conservative family back together.</p>
        
            <p>David Cameron alluded to this, writing on X that he wants to "be part of the strongest possible team that serves the United Kingdom and that can be presented to the country when the general election is held."</p>
        
            <p>And what a twist.</p>
        
            <p>The young, ambitious, then-unknown backbencher who came out for Brexit and defied the then-prime minister is now the prime minister himself, and appoints David Cameron to his cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>Lord Cameron, as we will become used to calling him, is well-connected on the international stage, which comes in handy when you're an incoming foreign secretary.</p>
        
            <p>And he'll have useful words of advice about winning general elections too.</p>
        
            <p>But he comes with baggage: what he has been up to since leaving politics. Here's an article I wrote two and a half years ago about the Greensill affair, for a start.</p>
        
            <p>And what do those post-Brexit referendum Conservatives - many elected in 2019 - make of David Cameron's return?</p>
        
            <p>For a good number, not a lot. The Remain-campaigning, austerity-delivering former premier is a rather different Conservative from many of them.</p>
        
            <p>And Labour folk aren't impressed either.</p>
        
            <p>"Just because something is a marmalade dropper, doesn't make it a good idea," says one figure on today's big surprise.</p>
        
            <p>They argue it is a "big strategic blunder to kill off the change message they were trying to land by bringing back the Tory PM who started 13 years of failure."</p>
        
            <p>And yes, just a month or so ago, Rishi Sunak was portraying himself as the change candidate - and in so doing defining himself against people like ... David Cameron.</p>
        
            <p>And here's a question: what next for Suella Braverman, the now former home secretary?</p>
        
            <p>There are those loyal to her who say this is far from the last we will hear from her.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will announce whether the government's Rwanda migration plan can happen - sending some people who've arrived in the UK to east Africa.</p>
        
            <p>If, as many in government expect, ministers lose and the Supreme Court says no, expect to see Braverman argue that the UK should leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be like Brexit 2.0" is how one senior figure described it to me - with the same capacity to divide the Conservative Party.</p>
        
            <p>Braverman would love to lead the Tories one day.</p>
        
            <p>Oh, and allies of the former home secretary are gathering for a meeting in Parliament this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Remember, this is a reshuffle still under way. All the indications are that it has breadth as well as depth - with changes at every rank within government.</p>
        
            <p>A big day.</p>
