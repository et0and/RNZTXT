            <p>When George and Diana Turney's home caught fire in the middle of the night, little did they know the tragedy would set them on the path to growing asparagus.</p>
        
            <p>They lost everything in the blaze but the Taihape community rallied around with goods and funds which enabled the couple to start afresh and buy land in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>With four children to raise and difficulties farming the land, the family had its ups and downs. Meanwhile George had always dreamt of returning to the Rangitikei district.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd learnt this land can grow anything."</p>
        
            <p>The Turneys eventually bought a sheep and beef farm in the Kawhatau Valley, over the river from Mangaweka. Out went the livestock and in came asparagus. </p>

            <p>That was 25 years ago and Mangaweka Asparagus now produces up to 250 tonnes of asparagus a season, off 70 hectares.</p>
        
            <p>The Turneys brought in manager Sam Rainey nine years ago and workers from Vanuatu come every year for the harvest.</p>
        
            <p>When Country Life visits, the morning pick is over and the 60-strong team are in the packhouse, weighing and bundling up the spears, music pumping in the background.</p>
        
            <p>Glen Towbah, in his eleventh season, is at the front on quality control.</p>
        
            <p>He weighs the bundles after checking the spears are neatly taped up and of similar size, which ensures the bunch cooks evenly. </p>
        
            <p>"We try to sell the best," he said.</p>

            <p>The quality has to be spot on, Rainey says, because their crop comes to the market a little later in the season. They go on harvesting later too, feeding those who are still keen for asparagus after the Christmas splurge.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to be producing early or producing late to make any money in this industry," Rainey says.</p>
        
            <p>His workers can take back home as much as $15,000 after seven months harvesting asparagus and apples, allowing them to build a well-constructed house, pay school fees and perhaps in time set up a small business.</p>
        
            <p>Their remote workplace in the Kawhatau Valley means they're not tempted to spend too much of their earnings, Towbah said.</p>
        
            <p>The Turneys say it's great to have the team back after the tough Covid years when the men were not allowed in and there weren't enough hands to harvest.</p>
        
            <p>But this year has been tough too with lower demand and oversupply because of the various growing regions peaking at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>All parts of the farm have been mowed down at some stage this season in order not to flood the market and depress prices further.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been as bad as I've seen it in my nine seasons," Rainey said. </p>
        
            <p>The industry has promotions underway this year to encourage consumption and good displays in shops. </p>
        
            <p>"We're throwing the kitchen sink at it."</p>

            <p>"It breaks your heart to see a tractor out there mowing it off," George Turney said from his kitchen overlooking the paddocks.</p>
        
            <p>He and Diana are, unsurprisingly, avid eaters of asparagus, showing off their simple method of blanching the spears and then dragging them through garlicky butter.</p>

            <p>They may have an abundant supply of asparagus on the doorstep but employment for so many is what has given the Turneys the most satisfaction. </p>
        
            <p>"When you lose a house and all your material things in life and the community come to your aid, I'm very pleased to give back," George said.</p>
