            <p>A hunt is underway for a man who stole cash from security guards on Auckland's North Shore while they stocked up an ATM</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Simon Harrison said the cash in transit van was the target of an aggravated robbery in Birkenhead shortly before 2.30pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Security staff were carrying out a delivery to the ATM on Birkenhead Ave, he said, when a man approached them and stole a case of cash.</p>
        
            <p>The amount of money stolen has not yet been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Harrison said no one was injured and the man fled on foot, but it was believed he then left in a car.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation is still in the early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene examination is also being carried out, with additional inquiries to follow."</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked anyone in the area at the time and saw anyone heading towards a vehicle carrying a case to contact police on 105, using the reference number P061584274.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, ASB said: "We are aware of an incident at our Birkenhead ATM today. Our main concern is the personal safety and wellbeing of our people and our customers.</p>
        
            <p>"We can confirm no one was hurt and everyone is safe. We have a team of support staff assisting, and we are working with the police as they carry out their inquiries. The ATM lobby is now open to the public."</p>
        
            <p>It comes a week after a man was found on the same road critically injured, with stab wounds.</p>
        
            <p>Northcote MP Dan Bidois said news of the aggravated robbery was devastating news for the community, who were still frazzled from the stabbing.</p>
        
            <p>Bidois said he had "complete confidence" that police would catch the person involved with the ATM robbery.</p>
