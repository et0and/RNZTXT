            <p>A Christchurch high school was evacuated this afternoon when students deliberately lit two fires inside a school building.</p>
        
            <p>Fire alarms rang out at Avonside Girls' High School at 1.15pm today, after smoke from two fires set off the sprinkler system.</p>
        
            <p>"Two fires were lit in two waste paper bins in two different toilets, within about five minutes of each other," principal Catherine Law said.</p>

            <p>All students were evacuated safely, along with two co-located schools, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Classes were cancelled for Avonside students for the rest of the day, with pupils escorted back in small groups to retrieve their belongings.</p>
        
            <p>"Our school evacuated, along with [Shirley Boys' High School] and of course, Ferndale School who have special needs students. So the consequences are potentially very, very serious."</p>
        
            <p>Secondary consequences included the loss of learning time for students and water damage, she said.</p>
        
            <p>A very serious message needed to be sent to students that there was nothing funny about lighting fires, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst we all know that young people don't necessarily do these things with the intention of malice, of hurting people, they don't necessarily think that through.</p>
        
            <p>"I need every single student in our school to know that it's not fun, it's not a joke, that's not a funny thing to do - it put a lot of people's lives at risk."</p>
        
            <p>The school had identified those responsible and would be conducting a full investigation, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was particularly disappointing as Canterbury was under a complete fire ban and had experienced recent wildfires in Waikari and on the Port Hills, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a lot of talk about the dangers of fire in media, so it's really upsetting to think that some students would think that it's a funny thing to do, if that was indeed what they thought," Law said.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency said two fire crews attended, and found on arrival the sprinklers had put out the fires.</p>
        
            <p>The crews confirmed the fires were out and helped start mopping up excess water.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said they had since left the school.</p>
        
            <p>The school areas used for sport, Polyfest and an NCEA evening were all fine and those events were continuing as planned tonight, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"In one particular area of the school, the sprinklers caused a lot of water damage to carpets and classrooms," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The two bathrooms where the fires were lit, two to three classrooms and some corridors were closed, and the affected classes would be temporarily relocated for a couple of days, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>But the school would be open as usual tomorrow, she said.</p>
        
            <p>An assembly would be held later in the week to discuss the seriousness of the fires with students.</p>
