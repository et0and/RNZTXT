            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins says he is very concerned about the "rapidly deteriorating relationship" between the government and the Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown is in Beijing to sign an agreement with China - but the New Zealand government said he failed to consult with it on the proposed agreement.</p>
        
            <p>The Joint Centenary Declaration between the Cook Islands and New Zealand required the two to consult regularly on defence and security issues.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon, in his post-cabinet press conference on Monday called out his counterpart for not being transparent.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything that's of a defence or security nature is obviously of great importance to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's captured in our constitutional arrangements that we talk very openly and transparently about that, and that's what we need to see," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But Hipkins said the kind of "megaphone diplomacy" being used by the coalition was not helping.</p>

            <p>"Well if they think going public with this sort of spat is going to improve that situation I suspect they're going to be proven very wrong."</p>
        
            <p>A more diplomatic approach was needed, Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>He warned the government against responding to the Cook Islands with "muscular diplomacy", such as withholding aid money, as was done with Kiribati.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said there were points of difference between the governments - but they had a good relationship.</p>
        
            <p>He would not comment on any sanctions or response to the Cook Islands until the government knew more about what is in the agreement with China.</p>
