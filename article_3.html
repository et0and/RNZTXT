            <p>India secured their second Twenty20 World Cup title with a dramatic seven-run win over South Africa on Saturday, the result still in doubt at the start of the final over of an electrifying match.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa required 16 runs to win after Heinrich Klaasen had put them firmly on course in reply to India's 176 for seven by smashing 52 from 27 balls including five sixes.</p>
        
            <p>David Miller hit the first ball, a full toss from Hardik Pandya, high down the ground but Suryakumar Yadav raced around the long-off boundary, knocked the ball into the air, toppled over the ropes and stepped back to complete a stunning catch.</p>
        
            <p>Two boundaries from the final two balls would still have led to a Super Over with the scores tied but Kagiso Rabada was caught off the fifth and the match was over as jubilant Indian supporters swarmed on to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>After Rohit Sharma had won the toss and opted to bat, Virat Kohli finally recaptured his best form with 76 from 59 balls.</p>
        
            <p>After scoring only 75 runs in seven knocks at the tournament, Kohli first anchored the innings after India had lost their top three wickets cheaply before accelerating.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli signalled his intent by striking three boundaries in the opening over from paceman Marco Jansen but South Africa struck back immediately through left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.</p>
        
            <p>Maharaj dismissed Rohit for nine and had Rishabh Pant caught by Quinton de Kock for a duck off another mistimed sweep.</p>
        
            <p>Suryakumar (three) lofted paceman Rabada to the square leg boundary where Klaasen took a comfortable catch and after the powerplay India were reeling on 45 for three.</p>
        
            <p>Left-hander Axar Patel lofted the first six of the match over mid-wicket in the eighth over as India sought to accelerate, reaching 75 for three at the halfway stage.</p>
        
            <p>Axar was run out for 47 when De Kock threw down the stumps at the bowler's end with the batter centimetres short of his ground.</p>
        
            <p>Shivam Dube slapped a six and a four and Kohli brought up his half century from 44 deliveries.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli was now in full flow, smashing Jansen for six before being caught by Rabada trying another hit over the boundary.</p>

            <p>Jasprit Bumrah, India's strike bowler, almost inevitably struck in his opening over when he clean bowled Reeza Hendricks.</p>
        
            <p>De Kock, however, went on to the attack, taking a four and a six off Kuldeep Yadav and he kept South Africa up with the required run rate to reach 39 from 31 balls when he swung left-arm paceman Arshdeep Singh straight to Kuldeep at fine leg.</p>
        
            <p>Klaasen's pugnacious innings put his team within sight of victory with 22 runs required off 18 balls when Rohit turned to Bumrah to bowl his final overs.</p>
        
            <p>Bumrah responded by bowling Jansen for two while conceding just two runs to finish with two for 18 in another magnificent spell of bowling.</p>

            <p>"I tried to keep calm," said Bumrah, who was named player of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"We play sport for the big stages. On the big day you have to give more, throughout the tournament I felt very clear and calm."</p>
        
            <p>Man-of-the-match Kohli retired from T20 Internationals soon after the victory as India became the first side to win the trophy after going unbeaten through the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>If India players were in tears after winning their first global title since the 2013 Champions Trophy, their South African counterparts looked desolate after another heartbreak.</p>
        
            <p>"Gutted. It will take some time for us to reflect on this," South Africa skipper Aiden Markram said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a great campaign but for the time being, this hurts.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so proud of all my players and everyone involved in this team."</p>
        
            <p>Indian great Kohli later said he would quit T20 Internationals.</p>
        
            <p>"This was my last T20 game playing for India," an emotional Kohli, 35, said after collecting the player-of-the-match award.</p>
        
            <p>"Time for the next generation to take the T20 game forward."</p>
        
            <p>Kohli retires from the format with 4188 runs from 125 T20 Internationals with a strike rate of 137.</p>
        
            <p>Considered a modern batting great, Kohli has not been in the best of form in the tournament but saved his best for the final.</p>
        
            <p>India were in big trouble at 34-3 when he combined with Axar Patel to help his side post 176-7, the highest total in a T20 World Cup final.</p>

            <p>"This is exactly what we wanted to achieve," Kohli said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an amazing game. One day you feel like you can't get a run but one day, things just click.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so proud to get the runs for the team the day it mattered most. The occasion prompted that change for me, I felt like it was now-or-never.</p>
        
            <p>"We have wanted to lift a trophy for a long time. The occasion made me put my head down, respect the situation and play the innings that the team needed from me."</p>
        
            <p>This was India's first global title since winning the 2013 Champions Trophy.</p>
        
            <p>"It hasn't quite sunk in for me yet. It's an amazing day," Kohli added.</p>
