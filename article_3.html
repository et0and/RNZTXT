            <p>A fire has forced evacuations in the seaside community of Mahia, and anyone remaining in the township is being warned to be ready to leave and to alert others in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were attending and assisting with a small number of evacuations in the tiny Hawke's Bay community, and asked the public to stay away from the Maungawhio Drive area, as emergency services battle the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Remaining residents are being told to close all doors and windows and be prepared to leave if needed.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters from eight stations around Gisborne and Hawkes Bay are battling the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the scrub fire is an unknown size, and is located near the Maungawhio Lagoon near Mahia East Coast Road.</p>
        
            <p>Power has been shut off to the Mahia settlement as two helicopters fly in to work on containing the fire.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said crews were focused on protecting seven houses in the way of the blaze, and have managed to keep all buildings safe.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic is being directed away from the peninsula and residents are being told to shut doors and windows.</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked residents to get in touch with any vulnerable members in the community to let them know what is happening and to be alert and ready.</p>
