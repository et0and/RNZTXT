            <p>A wet Sunday looks likely for many as the school holidays come to an end around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday offers a brief break for those looking to head outdoors, with mostly dry weather expected across Aotearoa, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>However, Auckland is among the exceptions with a wet weekend on the cards. Showers will continue until Saturday afternoon and they will be back again and heavier on Sunday.</p>

            <p>Hamilton is also set for a period of wet weather with rain arriving on Sunday morning and expected to last through until Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Rain and showers are expected to sweep across the South Island on Sunday, especially in the east, as chilly southerlies push through.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch residents can look forward to a pleasant Saturday with a high of 20degC but it will make way for a chillier wetter Sunday and a high of just 12deg.</p>
        
            <p>It will be wet both both days in Dunedin also with a high of only 10deg on Sunday, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>The wet conditions persist into Monday for the North Island and eastern South Island. Eastern and central parts of the North Island could see particularly heavy rainfall.</p>
