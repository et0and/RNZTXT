            <p>Police blocked off a seaside road in Lower Hutt on Friday due to a seal pup rolling around.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said Police attended initial reports of a seal lying under a truck on Port Road in Seaview around 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic management was put in place in the area and the Department of Conservation (DOC) was contacted.</p>
        
            <p>DOC marine science adviser Dr Jody Weir said the period from June to September was commonly referred to as "seal silly season".</p>
        
            <p>That was because it was the time young seals and sea lions started to explore their environment, and often turned up in unexpected places.</p>
        
            <p>Despite being marine mammals, New Zealand fur seals, or kekeno, spent a lot of time on land, typically resting but occasionally exploring.</p>
        
            <p>Rocky shores are their preferred habitat but their natural curiosity can lead them kilometres inland.</p>
        
            <p>It was common to find them on roads, in backyards, or sometimes even on living room sofas, Weir said.</p>
        
            <p>In the Ten One magazine, police said a seal pup on a road trip stopped traffic on a Tasman highway.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Nathan Snell and Senior Constable Scott Johnson of Road Policing were called to the Richmond Deviation, where members of the public had captured the unruly juvenile - just a few months old - after it caused a significant tailback.</p>

            <p>After consulting DOC, they put the pup into a washing basket, wrapped in a blanket which was secured by plasti-cuffs, and put the basket on the back seat of the patrol car, with seatbelt in place. It seemed secure, but the pup had other ideas.</p>
        
            <p>"Arrangements were made to deliver the unruly seal into the custody of DOC for returning to a more suitable habitat," Senior Sergeant Nathan Snell said. "But while en route to the prisoner handover, the seal staged a daring escape attempt.</p>
        
            <p>"Wriggling his way free of the blanket and subsequently the washing basket, he escaped on to the back seat of the patrol car - and would have made a great sight to passing motorists as they saw a seal head pop over the windowsill looking out of the window."</p>

            <p>The escape attempts did not end there.</p>
        
            <p>When Snell stopped the car, the seal tried to climb into the front seat. Order was restored when he was handed into the custody of Department of Conservation staff to be returned to the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>"The seal was let go with a warning for 'Pedestrian failed to keep to edge of roadway' and escaping police custody," Snell said.</p>
