            <p>King Charles will no longer visit New Zealand this year as part of a planned tour, British media are reporting.</p>
        
            <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla are planning to tour Australia and Samoa, but a visit to New Zealand is likely to be shelved to keep the visit short, The Mirror newspaper is reporting.</p>
        
            <p>The King has been receiving treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer announced earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Naturally, it will be a bitter disappointment on both sides to not have the opportunity for the King and Queen to visit New Zealand, but of course all are aware of the King's ongoing health and the need for him to pace himself," The Mirror quoted a source as saying.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand visit was never officially announced, but has been rumoured to be on the King's agenda.</p>
        
            <p>It was to be part of two years of international travel - the royal family's biggest-ever series of tours, The Mirror earlier reported.</p>
        
            <p>Charles last visited Aotearoa with Camilla in 2019 when he was Prince of Wales.</p>
