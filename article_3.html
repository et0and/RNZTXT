            <p>The government has announced its new top-priority approach for families with children in emergency housing, while signalling a stricter approach for those accessing it.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop, Social Development Louise Upston and Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka announced the moves in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Priority One category will mean families with dependent children in emergency housing for longer than 12 weeks would automatically move to the top of the waitlist, from April. Bishop said the policy was expected to prioritise about 800 of the roughly 3000 families on the waitlist.</p>
        
            <p>It was set out as a policy in National's election campaign, and ticks off another of the items on the coalition's 100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>However, Upston signalled it would come alongside a stricter approach to allowing people into emergency housing in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time as introducing Priority One we'll also be strengthening the verification processes for those entering emergency housing, reviewing eligibility settings, and introducing new obligations," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said verification, eligibility, and limits to the ability for officials to use discretion for applicants for emergency housing would be done before August.</p>
        
            <p>"MSD staff assessing anyone applying for emergency housing will increase their scrutiny of whether they have unreasonably contributed to their immediate emergency housing need, whether they have taken reasonable efforts to access other housing options and whether they have previously paid their emergency housing contribution.</p>
        
            <p>"This will include escalating for further consideration by a manager on a case-by-case basis, and making a grant for one to four days - as opposed to the current options of seven to 21 days - to enable further scrutiny before a grant is approved for a longer period."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters at Parliament, she said obligations for emergency housing tenants were already in place, and the changes would encourage officials to ensure all other avenues had been explored first.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can move someone straight into private accommodation, a private rental, straightaway, then that's a way better outcome," she said. "I'm encouraging them to take greater consideration of the applications rather than just giving a grant straightaway and we see a family and children go into a motel - we want to slow that down."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if it would mean more people living on the streets, she said "the really important thing here is what's the end goal, so the end goal is we don't want children in motels".</p>
        
            <p>However, she said she would not be comfortable if more children ended up homeless under her watch.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not saying it is going to be perfect, what I am saying is that we will have fewer children in motels and that is what we are out to achieve."</p>
        
            <p>She said after those steps were taken, the government would be making further, more permanent changes around regulations, criteria, suitability, and steps people needed to take.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said these were the "first steps to end the blight that is emergency housing".</p>
        
            <p>It cost the government about $340 million a year, which he said was "paying for families to live largely in misery and squalor".</p>
        
            <p>He said other "bold and radical steps" were needed to solve the problem.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking at the whole system, so we're looking at innovative solutions like social bonds for example, working with private landlords, how we need to fix the system to end emergency housing or at least to reduce it to the level where a few people spend a small amount of time in motels."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was now an "institutionalised bureaucracy where now around 3000 families live in those motels. We're determined to fix that problem - the social cost and the economic cost to the country is enormous".</p>
        
            <p>Asked where they would go if not into motels, he said there were some vacancies in social houses. Despite the government's announcement being titled "first steps taken to end emergency housing," Bishop said it would always exist as a safety net.</p>
        
            <p>"The government is always going to provide a final blanket safety net for families who are really doing it rough - and no one wants families living in tents and things like that or sleeping rough on the streets."</p>
        
            <p>He and Upston said not all people who were in emergency housing were on the social housing register, and argued against conflating the problem of emergency housing with the need for a social home.</p>
        
            <p>"The system is a mess," Bishop said. "There are hundreds of families who are in emergency housing right now who are not on the register and a lot of those families exit from emergency housing not into social housing but into private rentals.</p>
        
            <p>He said housing supply was ultimately what mattered, and the government would also build "thousands upon thousands" of homes around the country.</p>
        
            <p>"The last National government I was a member of and I think it is true - and I've said this before - didn't do enough around housing. However, the last six years is on Labour."</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said the government was committed to ending large-scale use of emergency housing motels, and returning them to a rarely and briefly needed last resort.</p>
        
            <p>"Solving emergency housing won't be easy and it won't happen immediately. Bold and radical steps will be required. We'll be exploring a range of options including better support to prevent the need for emergency housing in the first place, as well as for those who exit.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be applying a social investment lens to this problem, targeting support where people need it and looking at innovative options like social bonds."</p>
