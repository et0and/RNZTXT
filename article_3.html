            <p>Climate Change Minister Simon Watts has revealed New Zealand's second emissions reduction target of between 51 and 55 percent compared to 2005 levels.</p>
        
            <p>Required under the Paris Agreement, it must be achieved by the end of 2035 and builds on the initial target of a 50 percent reduction by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Watts confirmed the target at 8pm Wednesday after markets closed, saying it was "both ambitious and achievable".</p>
        
            <p>"Meeting this target will mean we are doing our fair share towards reducing the impact of climate change, while enabling New Zealand to be stronger and thrive in the face of a changing climate," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are already laying the foundation for meaningful emissions reductions, with the potential to meet our net zero target as early as 2044."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would mean greater innovation in New Zealand for advancing low-emission technologies to grow the economy, empowering industries with "abundant and affordable clean energy", while attracting investment and boosting productivity.</p>
        
            <p>The official submission described the target as representing New Zealand's "highest possible ambition in light of our national circumstances and respective capabilities".</p>
        
            <p>It noted New Zealand would report climate finance obligations under the Paris Agreement separately, while the Biennial Transparency Reports would serve as the country's adaptation communications "unless otherwise specified".</p>
