The message was inappropriate, says Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden.

            <p>Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden says it was inappropriate for an official to tell popular British DJ Fred Again details of a New Zealander's passport application.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after Fred Again - real name Fredrick Gibson - pleaded online for help getting a passport for Kiwi DJ Tessa Hills so she could accompany him on his Australian tour.</p>
        
            <p>A screenshot on Instagram shows deputy chief executive KƒÅwai ki te Iwi - Service Delivery and Operations Maria Robertson privately messaged Fred Again saying the department was sorting it out.</p>
        
            <p>Every citizen should get the same treatment by the passport office and an applicant's details should remain private, van Velden said.</p>
        
            <p>Tessa Hills, known by her stage name MESSIE, has since had her passport application approved.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached the ministry for comment.</p>
