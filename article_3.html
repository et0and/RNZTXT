            <p>Rain may be on the horizon for many holidaymakers over the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecasts that most parts of the South Island should expect to see periods of rain throughout Thursday and Friday as a cold front moves north.</p>
        
            <p>Included in that is a rain watch that is in place in Fiordland until midnight.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Dom Barry said the rain watch was associated with a front arriving from the Tasman Sea.</p>
        
            <p>"Take care out there as rainfall amounts may approach warning criteria."</p>

            <p>The weather is expected to ease behind the front and fine up for the likes of Fiordland, Central Otago and the Mackenzie Country for Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, the weather is partly cloudy today with some isolated showers that are expected to become more frequent tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday the sun is expected to return to many parts of the South Island, while in the North Island showers - some thundery in the north-east of the island - are expected to remain.</p>
        
            <p>Barry said on Sunday the conditions were set to fine up for most of the country as another ridge of high pressure made itself at home through to Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The last weekend of the holiday season is shaping up to be a mixed bag; pick your poison for any travelling or tramping that you're doing."</p>
