        <h2>'I'm so scared': Crack down on roaming dogs as residents live in fear</h2>
        <p>
The Auckland council are cracking down on unregistered dogs, with infringement notices being issued in the coming days as a final warning.
</p>
        
            <p>
Councillor Josephine Bartley, chair of the Regulatory and Safety Committee, stresses that dog registration is mandatory, calling the infringement notices a final warning for non-compliant owners.

            <p>A crackdown on unregistered dogs is underway with Auckland Council issuing about 5500 infringement notices to owners, each carrying a $300 fine.</p>
        
            <p>The move aims to reduce the rising number of attacks, roaming dogs and aggressive behaviour reported across Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Residents gathered in South Auckland this week to discuss their concerns about roaming dogs, with one parent saying they were too scared to go to the playground after their child was attacked.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time, the council will issue infringement notices to dog owners who repeatedly fail to register their pets, despite multiple reminders and opportunities to comply.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Josephine Bartley, chair of the Regulatory and Safety Committee, stressed that dog registration was mandatory.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first time we've moved to last-resort measures and issued infringement notices," Bartley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Dog registration is a legal requirement designed to benefit both the community and pet owners."</p>
        
            <p>The decision to enforce stricter rules on dog owners - requiring them to register, de-sex, vaccinate and contain their pets - comes with growing concerns over roaming dogs and attacks across Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Infringement notices will be issued in the coming days as a final warning.</p>
        
            <p>Bartley said the council appreciates dog owners who had responded to the pre-infringement notices and did the right thing by registering their dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"For those who haven't, this is the final warning," Bartley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ratepayers should not have to bear the cost of irresponsible dog owners who refuse to register their animals.</p>
        
            <p>"This enforcement action highlights Auckland Council's commitment to reducing roaming dogs and dog attacks and ensuring dogs are registered across the region."</p>
        
            <p>Labour MP for Manurewa Arena Williams organised a public meeting at Manurewa Leisure Centre on Tuesday night, drawing residents who are concerned about roaming dog packs throughout South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a real concern across Manurewa and Papatoetoe," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our office delivered letters to 1300 households and received a hundred emails, phone calls and comments in return."</p>
        
            <p>Dinesh, a resident of Cambridge Road who attended the meeting, said his child was attacked by a dog.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so scared - we don't walk outside anymore, and I can't take my son to the playground," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen, another local dog owner, said he was frustrated having called Auckland Council so often to report roaming dogs, they now recognise his voice.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't take my dogs out for more than 15 minutes at a time anymore because I fear for their safety," he said.</p>
        
            <p>
Auckland Council has reported a 21 percent rise in aggressive dog behaviour, 14 percent more attacks on people, and a 19 percent increase in attacks on animals during 2023-2024.

            <p>In 2023-2024, Auckland Council's Animal Management team handled 15,146 reports of roaming dogs.</p>
        
            <p>During this period, incidents of aggressive behaviour rose by 21 percent, dog attacks on people increased by 14 percent, and attacks on other animals were up by 19 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Long-time Manurewa resident Sash attended the meeting after collecting petitions calling for repeat offenders to be banned from owning dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of passion, but nowhere for it to go," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"How can we as a community prioritise this so the government listens?"</p>
        
            <p>In 2024, Manurewa reported the highest number of roaming dogs among the top ten suburbs, with 1,157 requests for service (RFS).</p>
        
            <p>Overall, the Manurewa Local Board area saw 7,168 dog-related incidents, with roaming dogs accounting for 62 percent of cases (4,487).</p>
        
            <p>Other concerns included aggressive behaviour towards people (671 cases), barking complaints (665), dog attacks on animals (340) and dog attacks on people (238).</p>
        
            <p>The highest number of incidents occurred in July (757 reports), followed by June (723).</p>
        
            <p>Roaming dogs remained the most frequent issue throughout the year, peaking in winter and spring.</p>
        
            <p>The situation has sparked discussions about the need for more comprehensive policies to address both immediate and long-term solutions to roaming dogs and attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Local and national policymakers, including Boyack, are now pushing for better support and funding for local councils to manage animal control.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Council crackdown followed a series of other measures, including sending out 22,929 reminder notices in November, which led to a significant increase in registrations.</p>
        
            <p>The Council will issue infringement notices over the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's Animal Management manager Elly Waitoa acknowledged the positive response from dog owners but emphasised the need for full compliance.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of unregistered dogs has now reduced, which is a significant improvement," Waitoa said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, too many owners have still ignored their responsibilities. We have given them ample time and reminders, and now, as a last resort, we are issuing infringement notices. Our goal is for all dog owners to register their pets rather than face a fine."</p>
