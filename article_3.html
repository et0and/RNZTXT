            <p>Wellington Zoo is down to one capybara after the death of one of its huge - and hugely popular - rodents.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to customers, the zoo said its capybara, Luna, had been unwell for some time and despite the efforts of carers, had died.</p>
        
            <p>"The last few weeks the team have been doing all they could to care for her and help her get better but unfortunately, they were unsuccessful."</p>
        
            <p>It said due to this, its up-close-and-personal 'Capybara Encounter' would be cancelled for the month of January.</p>
        
            <p>The email provided alternative options for customers booked on the experience.</p>
        
            <p>According to its website, Wellington Zoo was home to two female capybaras.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to being the world's largest rodent, it is a species renowned for its swimming prowess due to its webbed feet.</p>
