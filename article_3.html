            <p>The Crown car of a former Prime Minister has been auctioned on Trade Me with a reserve of just 1 dollar.</p>
        
            <p>The 2005 Ford LTD Ba V8 limousine was being sold by Wholesale Motors in Christchurch and was the car that Helen Clark was driven in between 2005 and 2008.</p>
        
            <p>"Feel like a Prime Minister as you cruise in the back of this stunning limo," the auction description read, "with the NZ flags up front and a big block 5.4L V8 you will be cruising in real style."</p>
        
            <p>The flags however would need to be removed before the car was driven on the road.</p>
        
            <p>The seller said the car had only had four owners since the Crown and was in immaculate condition.</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing to spend on this car its in showroom condition."</p>
        
            <p>The seller said the vehicle had been traded in and was not the same car that that was involved in a high speed journey across the South Island so that the Prime Minister could get to a rugby match.</p>
        
            <p>The auction closes on Saturday 8 June with bids currently over $20,000.</p>
