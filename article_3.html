            <p>A Balclutha man who led police on a chaotic 230km chase up and down State Highway 1 has been jailed for 22 months.</p>
        
            <p>Gene-Kelly Antonio Wharekawa, 31, appeared in the Dunedin District Court this afternoon on a slew of charges and Judge Dominic Flatley highlighted a growing criminal history.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of your offending was absolutely appalling," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You might end up killing somebody."</p>
        
            <p>The court heard the defendant was on electronically monitored bail in Balclutha on 22 August before the mayhem unfolded.</p>
        
            <p>In breach of his bail conditions, Wharekawa got into a car with his friend - and her 2-year-old son in the back seat - and the prolonged fiasco began.</p>
        
            <p>There was nothing secretive about the impromptu road trip.</p>

            <p>Wharekawa broadcast the journey on a Facebook livestream, the camera showing the view through his front windscreen.</p>
        
            <p>The footage quickly attracted comments from friends and family, some voicing concern, others goading him, and police were ultimately able to track the silver Subaru.</p>
        
            <p>At 2.35pm, Wharekawa stopped at a service station in Andersons Bay Rd, put $153 of fuel into the car and left without paying.</p>
        
            <p>"A large box of beer was visible in the vehicle," a police summary said.</p>
        
            <p>As the day wore on, the ride became progressively wilder.</p>
        
            <p>Three hours after the petrol theft, Wharekawa was clocked by police travelling at 165kmh in State Highway 1 at Seacliff.</p>
        
            <p>Officers executed a u-turn and gave chase, but that was soon abandoned when the defendant swerved into the wrong lane.</p>
        
            <p>Wharekawa was next seen at 6.46pm in Oamaru.</p>
        
            <p>Police boxed in the vehicle with three cars but it was not enough to thwart the joyride.</p>
        
            <p>The defendant reversed into one of the units "causing extensive damage to the front grill" before speeding off.</p>
        
            <p>After reaching speeds of 130kmh, officers called off the pursuit again.</p>

            <p>They next caught up with Wharekawa 115km away in Dunedin, when he pulled over to urinate, but the tactic of blocking him in was again unsuccessful.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard the defendant rammed another patrol car and continued south on the motorway.</p>
        
            <p>Five minutes later he collided with a Suzuki Swift and could be heard on the livestream saying "I just hit a car".</p>
        
            <p>Wharekawa repeatedly crossed the centre line with his headlights turned off and told his passenger: "if I go faster than 180 the cops won't stop me".</p>
        
            <p>Finally, at 8.30pm - six hours after the petrol theft - police deployed road spikes near Waihola, bringing the drama to an abrupt halt.</p>
        
            <p>"F... they got us," the defendant said.</p>
        
            <p>Wharekawa was arrested and refused to provide a blood specimen.</p>
        
            <p>A member of the public later found his electronic-bail tracker in Oamaru.</p>
        
            <p>Counsel Andrew Dawson said his client wanted to use today's sentencing as "a line in the sand".</p>
        
            <p>"If he continues to come back, there's only going to be one sentence that's imposed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A psychological report suggested Wharekawa suffered from drug-induced psychosis.</p>
        
            <p>"Until you get those issues sorted out . . . you're going to put innocent members of the public at risk," the judge said.</p>
        
            <p>Wharekawa was banned from driving for 18 months and granted leave to apply to have his prison term converted to home detention.</p>
        
            <p>That would only be allowed, Judge Flatley said, if the defendant was going to a residential rehabilitation facility.</p>
