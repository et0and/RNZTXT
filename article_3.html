            <p>Steven Adams' name has been mentioned in a possible trade to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand basketball star is currently with the Houston Rockets, but following one of the biggest ever NBA trades earlier this week the fallout continue.</p>
        
            <p>The Lakers have been looking for a centre for some time and after they traded Anthony Davis in the huge deal for the Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic their search for a big man has intensified.</p>
        
            <p>The Athletic is reporting that the Lakers and Rockets have been in discussions about Adams, but that nothing is imminent.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-one-year-old Adams has returned to action this season after knee surgery and his numbers are increasing as he gets more time on court.</p>
        
            <p>The big Kiwi has a physical presence, is an exellent rebounder and screen-setter.</p>
        
            <p>He is averaging 3.8 points per game and 5.2 rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>Portland Trail Blazers Robert Williams is also understood to be a target for the Lakers.</p>
