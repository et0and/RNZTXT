        <h2>Grace Millane's mother wants to 'make the world a better place'</h2>
        <p>
Gillian Millane, whose daughter Grace was tragically murdered while travelling in New Zealand in 2018, has raised more than $60,000 for the UK's White Ribbon charity.

            <p>Grace Millane had dreamed of travelling the world since she was a little girl.</p>
        
            <p>"I found a school project she did about New Zealand and it said 'I'm going there one day'. And she did get there," her mother Gillian said, proudly.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up in Wickford in Essex, Grace was a livewire who made friends wherever she went.</p>
        
            <p>"She was my best friend, we would always disappear to the pub for a quick drink and we would go away on holiday together," Gillian said.</p>

            <p>Five years ago, after graduating from the University of Lincoln, Grace set out on a year-long solo backpacking adventure across the world.</p>
        
            <p>After a six-week tour of Peru, she arrived in New Zealand. Less than a fortnight later, on the eve of her 22nd birthday, she was strangled to death by a man she met on a dating app.</p>
        
            <p>Grace was constantly in touch with her family but had not responded to their birthday messages on 2 December, so they reported her missing to the police.</p>
        
            <p>Gillian was recovering from surgery for breast cancer and not able to join the search. Her husband, Grace's father David, flew out to New Zealand but a week later, their daughter's body was found in bushland on the outskirts of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>During a three-week trial, the family had to sit through her killer's attempts to pass the murder off as "rough sex" gone wrong and his claims that Grace asked to be strangled.</p>

            <p>"I felt like Grace was on trial and she couldn't defend herself. As a parent, I didn't want to listen to that. It was horrendous.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't ask for your own death. It is ludicrous this can be used as a defence."</p>
        
            <p>A jury unanimously convicted him of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
        
            <p>The family decided never to mention his name again. "We never say it. It's a waste of energy. I don't care about him, I don't think about him," Gillian said.</p>
        
            <p>Gillian has since campaigned against the rough sex defence, with the charity We Can't Consent To This, and has helped to change the law in England and Wales.</p>
        
            <p>Two years after Grace's murder, Gillian's husband David died from cancer, which left her in a "really dark place".</p>
        
            <p>Gillian credits her family and friends, long walks and "lots of counselling" for her still being here today.</p>
        
            <p>"I did contemplate suicide. That is a horrid place to be. But I couldn't bring any more sadness to the family. Grace had such a bright future and it was taken away from her and us.</p>
        
            <p>"I will never see Grace in a wedding dress or see her grandchildren. This is a life sentence I've got. This is me until the day I die. But there is a light and I found it. You have to find that inner strength."</p>
        
            <p>David died during Covid and they could not be together as a family but Gillian later threw a memorial party and it became a turning point.</p>
        
            <p>"A friend dragged me up to dance. I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do but I laughed and I looked around the room and everyone was smiling.</p>
        
            <p>"My toes stay in the darkness but the rest of me is facing the sun a bit. Sometimes it goes up to my waist and I do go into that black hole but I have people behind me who support me."</p>
        
            <p>Christmas is a very difficult time for Gillian, so last year she decided to spend it climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, which was "incredibly emotional".</p>
        
            <p>"I went from not wanting to leave the house to climbing a mountain on the other side of the world.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to train and be focused. I didn't realise the power it was giving me and how much it was helping me.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything was aching but I knew Grace and David would be pushing me up there. They wanted to still be here, they didn't want to go, so I thought 'right get up there'."</p>
        
            <p>Gillian left a stone for Grace and David at the top, in tribute to them.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever I go somewhere special, I put the stones there, so they are travelling. If someone picks a stone up and moves it, they go somewhere else."</p>
        
            <p>Her efforts raised Â£33,000 (NZ$66,000) for the White Ribbon charity, which aims to end male violence against women. Gillian received a thank you card from the charity, saying the money had been used to fund education programmes in 65 schools in the Hull area.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to raise awareness and get that message out there about violence against women so that no other family has to live this life I live," Gillian said.</p>
        
            <p>Four years ago, with her niece Hannah, Gillian started the charity initiative Love Grace. They collect donated handbags and fill them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims.</p>
        
            <p>So far, they have filled 15,600 bags for women in the UK and across the world and they received an award from the prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Grace loved handbags, Gillian said, and each bag has a tag on it with her handwriting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a simple idea but it has really taken off," Gillian said. "We were just doing it for our grief so that Grace would never just be a number.</p>
        
            <p>"They get this bag, they are not expecting it and they have gone through hell. We get hundreds of letters from people who have received the bags, it's heartbreaking."</p>
        
            <p>Next year, Gillian is applying for Love Grace to become an official charity and she will be training for a trek to Everest basecamp in September, with a plan to place two more stones there.</p>
        
            <p>One day she hopes to travel to New Zealand, a country which Gillian said has really taken Grace to their hearts.</p>
        
            <p>"I still get loads of messages of support from there. It wasn't New Zealand or travelling that killed Grace, or anything she did. It was that individual."</p>
        
            <p>Five years on from her daughter's death, living without Grace has not got any easier. But Gillian is still trying hard to face the sun.</p>
        
            <p>"I should never have buried my child and certainly she should never have died the way she did. People keep saying I'm really strong but I don't think so, I'm just a mum."</p>
        
            <p>She added: "I am more resilient than I ever thought I was. I do think David and Grace would be proud. I think Grace would laugh and say these treks are a mid-life crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"I will never get over it but I just know I've got to make the world a better place. I want to change things so that no other family has to go through what we go through. That has got to be a good thing."</p>
