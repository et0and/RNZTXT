            <p>Out-of-town visitors have only weeks left for free visits to the themed area of Hamilton Gardens.</p>
        
            <p>From 18 September anyone not a resident of Hamilton City will be charged a $20 entry fee, though Hamiltonians will still have free access.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City Council said the charges would help take the financial pressure from running the gardens off ratepayers and make the gardens more self-sustainable.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to charge an entry fee for visitors was confirmed by Hamilton city councillors during the 2023/24 Annual Plan, following public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate not everyone wanted to see the charge, but council has huge budget pressures, as do ratepayers. Council decided it cannot continue to lay the financial burden of the gardens solely on our ratepayers. That's not fair," council's deputy chief executive Sean Murray said.</p>
        
            <p>For the last two years Hamilton Gardens has been ranked in the top 1 percent of world attractions by online travel advice site Trip Advisor, and Murray said they were some of the best in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"The charge recognises their value," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The charge only relates to the themed Enclosed Gardens, which the council said makes up just 10 percent of the 50-hectare site. The other areas of the garden, including the rose gardens, Rhododendron Lawn, Camellia Garden, children's playground, Turtle Lake and parking, all remain free to all.</p>
        
            <p>Hamiltonians and Hamilton ratepayers will need to provide proof of address and photo ID for free entry, at least for the first visit. They can then apply for a MyGardens Pass, which will allow them unlimited visits or opt to show proof of address and ID each visit.</p>
        
            <p>Regular out-of-town visitors can purchase an annual pass and SuperGold, student ID and Community Services cardholders will receive a 10 percent discount on entry fees.</p>
