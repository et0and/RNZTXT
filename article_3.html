        <h2>Phew! Five things we learned from the Warriors’ runaway win over Sea Eagles</h2>
        <p>
The Auckland club got its NRL campaign back on track after a deflating season-opener in Vegas.

            <p>If NZ Warriors fans feared the worst after their team's deflating season-opening defeat in Las Vegas, they can breathe a collective sigh of relief, as they put things right on home soil against Manly Sea Eagles.</p>
        
            <p>The last six times they started seasons 0-2, the Auckland club failed to make the playoffs. Last time they overcame that early setback was 2011, when they went on to reach the Grand Final for just the second time.</p>
        
            <p>Manly arrived at Go Media Stadium off the back of a resounding win over North Queensland in their opener, but weren't allowed to impose themselves in the same way and left with worrying injuries to two of their studs.</p>
        
            <p>Here's some key takeaways from the 36-16 performance…</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors used their first home game to pay tribute to former captain Tohu Harris, who shocked everyone with his retirement during the off-season.</p>
        
            <p>Harris won a championship with Melbourne Storm in 2017, before logging 117 games on this side of the Tasman, but was just unable to shake the injuries that had hampered him in recent seasons.</p>
        
            <p>He featured twice in the runsheet, welcoming his old team onto the park before kickoff, when he literally and figuratively handed the leadership over to James Fisher-Harris and Mitch Barnett in a powerful ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Harris commented later that the team especially wanted to win this one for their fallen skipper.</p>
        
            <p>At halfway, Harris and his family were ushered back onto the field for a video highlight reel and fireworks display, which may have been a tad over the top for such a humble man. The heartfelt haka from the hospitality tents as he left the field was far more his style.</p>
        
            <p>No one was under as much pressure to turn around his performance from Vegas than halfback Luke Metcalf, who was handed the No.7 jersey made famous by Stacey Jones and Shaun Johnson, but struggled to impose himself against Canberra two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>What a difference two weeks can make.</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf had his fingerprints all over this game, kicking perfectly from the tee, scoring a try himself, and assisting on three others to Chanel Harris-Tavita, Taine Tuaupiki and Ali Leiataua.</p>

            <p>You couldn't have asked anything more from him and he's surely earned at least a week of grace, before inevitably having to prove himself again.</p>
        
            <p>Manly seemed to benefit from a couple of dubious decisions that gifted them tries to winger Jason Saab and captain Daly Cherry-Evans.</p>
        
            <p>Replays suggested Saab lost the ball, as he dove over by the corner flag just after halftime, while centre Reuben Garrick seemingly had his foot on the deadball line, as he flicked the ball back into the field of play for Cherry-Evans to touch down.</p>
        
            <p>Certainly the 21,212 crowd - and Warriors captains Barnett and Fisher-Harris - let referee Adam Gee hear about it at the ground, but he was not to be swayed and a second viewing confirmed he may have been right. Saab had his hand on the ball just long enough to retain possession, while one particular angle showed Garrick was probably clear of the chalk.</p>

            <p>Luckily, neither try changed the outcome, which is the ultimate solution, if you feel the calls going against you - take the officials out of the result.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors let themselves down in two particular areas in Vegas, allowing almost twice as many offloads (17-9) and missing almost twice as many tackles (40-21) as the Raiders.</p>
        
            <p>This week, they turned those two stats around, limiting their opponents to just three offloads and missing just 16 tackles, compared to Manly's 39.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors also completed 91 percent of their sets (43/47) and limited their rivals to just 72 percent (26/36).</p>

            <p>Hooker Wayde Egan led the team in tackles (41), with co-captain James Fisher-Harris (40) next, while fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad - another to redeem himself, after an indifferent showing at Vegas - chalked up 171 running metres.</p>
        
            <p>For the second time, Egan emerged as the top fantasy prospect with 73 points, thanks to his late try heroics, as he stole possession near halfway, dashed to within metres of the line and dove across a couple of tackles later.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Roger Tuivasa-Sheck ran for 167 metres, while lock Erin Clark finished with 150 metres, after leading his team at halftime with 95. On the other wing, Tuaupiki broke nine tackles, most of them in his jinking run to the tryline in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>For a team that looked like worldbeaters in their season-opener, the collapse of the Sea Eagles at Mt Smart was somewhat shocking.</p>
        
            <p>They looked dangerous whenever they moved the ball wide to pacey wings Saab and Lehi Hopoate, and when Saab laid on a try to Tommy Trbojevic in only the third minute, things looked ominous for the Warriors.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Saab continued to threaten throughout the contest and eventually scored one himself, but his team could not win the battle up the middle to provide those opportunities consistently.</p>
        
            <p>The departures of both Trbojevic and Cherry-Evans were worrying too. Trbojevic has proved one of the most fragile of NRL superstars and left early with what coach Anthony Seibold described as "tightness".</p>
        
            <p>Maybe that was just a precaution, but with 13 minutes remaining and only eight points down, Manly were still not out of contention.</p>
        
            <p>DCE visibly grabbed his back after making a tackle and was escorted off the park. At 36, he is the oldest player in the competition, so Sea Eagles fans will be anxious to see how quickly recovers from this niggle.</p>
