            <p>Almost 250,000 homes and businesses are without power in Queensland's south-east, even after Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred weakened to a tropical low.</p>
        
            <p>Many homes on the sunshine state mainland have been spared from gale-force wind damage, while fears about a massive storm surge from the sea have been alleviated.</p>
        
            <p>But authorities remain concerned about the impact of flooding and thunderstorms, which could bring more damaging wind and heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>The Bureau of Meteorology's Matthew Collopy said rainfall totals of up to 800 millimetres could occur in some areas over the next 48 hours.</p>
        
            <p>"The primary concern is about heavy rain," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Destruction from the cyclone - a rare event to hit the state's south-east corner - has so far included fallen trees, which have damaged powerlines, and cars and homes.</p>
        
            <p>"We're currently approaching a quarter of a million homes without power," Premier David Crisafulli said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was "the single biggest loss we have seen in over a decade" - since Cyclone Oswald hit Queensland in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Iconic Queensland beaches on the Gold Coast have been eaten away by coastal erosion, but no loss of life or missing persons have been recorded in the state.</p>
        
            <p>Like the Bureau of Meteorology, authorities are still concerned about the massive amounts of rain falling.</p>
        
            <p>"This could cause rapid flash-flooding which could catch our motorists unaware," Queensland Police Acting Commissioner Shane Chelepy said.</p>
        
            <p>"This flash-flooding could pose a significant risk to life today, particularly if you drive into floodwaters or play in those floodwaters."</p>
        
            <p>Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred was downgraded to a tropical low at 6am (local time) on Saturdaty morning.</p>
        
            <p>By about 7.30am the weather system was sitting near the coast of Bribie Island and moving in a north-north-westerly direction.</p>
        
            <p>It dropped from a category two system to a category one as it wobbled into Moreton Island just before midnight on Friday, before blowing through the island around 1am, weakening further as it went.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about whether schools in the south-east would return on Monday, Crisafulli said that would be announced on Sunday.</p>
