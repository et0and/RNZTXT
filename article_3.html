        <h2>Oranga Tamariki does U-turn on plan to cut record-keeping jobs</h2>
        <p>
Oranga Tamariki has amended the restructuring and will retain a "separate information management function".

            <p>Oranga Tamariki has pulled back from scrapping the jobs of people who look after masses of children's records going back decades.</p>
        
            <p>In May, RNZ revealed Oranga Tamariki's (OT) original proposal under the public sector cuts was in danger of stripping out all six of its dedicated record-keeping jobs.</p>
        
            <p>A staffer had warned in an internal channel: "OT has a legal and moral responsibility to take care of the information."</p>
        
            <p>This move by chief executive Chappie Te Kani was despite the ministry being castigated for poor record-keeping by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care, and despite record-keeping being set in law as a core duty.</p>

            <p>No one else keeps records of who was kept in care where, and what was done to them, such as electroshock therapy; the record keepers are best-placed to connect survivors with personal histories which do not exist anywhere else.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kani said he had now amended the restructuring.</p>
        
            <p>"I have made the decision to retain a separate information management function, responsible for the management of records," he told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>He finalised the cutbacks and restructuring this week, with 419 jobs going - 594 roles disestablished and 175 roles created.</p>
        
            <p>The U-turn on records followed RNZ reporting of staff flagging their alarm on the internal feedback channel.</p>
        
            <p>One wrote: "The proposal disestablishes and does not replace every role responsible for looking after the records of children in care, care [that] experienced adults, [of] people who have experienced abuse or harm in care.</p>
        
            <p>"If this is the intention of the proposal then it would be worth considering communicating that to the affected communities as well as other key agencies and organisations."</p>
        
            <p>At the time, the ministry did not answer RNZ's questions, saying only, "Oranga Tamariki will not be commenting on specific roles while formal consultation is underway."</p>
        
            <p>Record-keeping obligations are enshrined in the Public Records Act.</p>
        
            <p>"Oranga Tamariki has a responsibility to ensure quality access protection and preservation of information and data," Te Kani told RNZ on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>It appears the new-look team will be smaller than it was pre-cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"I have shifted the team reporting line, reinstated three positions and established the new position of lead advisor information management," he said.</p>
