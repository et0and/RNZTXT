            <p>A witness has described people laying on the road in the 'shocking' aftermath of a crash between a four-seater bicycle and a car near vineyards in Martinborough.</p>
        
            <p>One person is critically hurt and three others are seriously injured after the collision in the Wairarapa town on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to Puruatanga Road, between Regent Street and Todds Road, about 10.45am.</p>
        
            <p>The road is home to a number of the area's most popular vineyards and restaurants.</p>
        
            <p>At least one person was being flown to hospital and three others had serious injuries.</p>

            <p>Resident Phil McArthur was one of the first on the scene and described it as "shocking".</p>
        
            <p>"I was just heading down the road ... and then I saw a scene where there were four people lying on side of the road, with a pretty written off bike," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was about five or six people that got there before me, and basically we had to give first aid to a couple of, you know, pretty serious injuries, which was not very nice."</p>
        
            <p>The people seemed "severely concussed" and had "injuries you'd expect if a car hit a bike at a reasonable speed".</p>
        
            <p>McArthur grabbed a first aid kit from his car and said he and others who had stopped to help could not do much, but did what they could to keep those injured comfortable until emergency services arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Staff from Martinborough Medical Centre arrived quickly, followed by Fire and Emergency, then ambulances and helicopters, he said.</p>

            <p>"As soon as the emergency services got there, I think they figured out pretty quickly that they needed some some extra help, and by the time I'd left [about 20 minutes later] the helicopter was there."</p>
        
            <p>McArthur did not wish to speculate on how serious the crash could be or how it happened, but said "it wasn't nice to come across."</p>
        
            <p>He was a bit shaken.</p>
        
            <p>"You feel a little bit, sort of absent minded I suppose, and you sort of ... reflect on a few things," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not nice to ever come across anything like that, and you just really feel for the people lying on the ground that were injured."</p>
        
            <p>Owner of Indi Bike hire company, Wayde Mines said he is "devastated" to learn of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Mines said the bike was picked up by a couple who he understood may have been tourists from the UK before they met up with their companions.</p>
        
            <p>"I met the people. Hired the bike to them. Off they went happy.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm absolutely devastated. I'm worried for the people involved. It's a beautiful day in Martinborough. The bikes are easily seen. It's unbelievable that its happened," Mines said.</p>
        
            <p>Mines said he rushed to the scene of the crash after hearing from locals there had been an incident and Fire and Emergency staff were able to tell him enough for him to learn it was one of his.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tragedy. It's terrible. I've been hiring bikes for 10 years and nothing like this has ever happened before. Not even scuffs and bumps," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The driver - who was uninjured - was being spoken to by police.</p>
        
            <p>The road had been closed and members of the public are asked to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Carolyn McArthur, from Moy Hall vineyard, said emergency services had left the scene by about 1pm.</p>
