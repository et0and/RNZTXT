            <p>An open letter of solidarity to the students of Freyberg High School has been signed by thousands of people across the country.</p>
        
            <p>It follows the Palmerston North High School saying some of its students would go through a disciplinary process after performing a haka at ACT Party leader David Seymour on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Students performed Ka Mate whilst the associate education minister was leaving the school to show they strongly disagree with ACT's policies towards Te Tiriti o Waitangi. A video shared online showed that at the conclusion of the haka, a student holding a tino rangatiratanga flag approached Seymour and spat at the ground by his feet.</p>
        
            <p>The letter praises the students for showing leadership and honouring tikanga by standing with every hungry child and worried MƒÅori parent in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Your stand has come with a price, and we also want to say: that price is unjust. It is colonial, it is biased, and it is designed to keep you down."</p>
        
            <p>More than 7000 people have signed the live document including psychiatrist Hinemoa Elder and singer Ria Hall.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Regional Councillor Thomas Nash said lawyers got in touch with him to say they were keen to provide support to the students pro bono if needed.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Freyberg High School regarding what has been done as part of its disciplinary process.</p>
