            <p>Lydia Ko's brilliant golfing surge has continued with a stunning win in the LPGA Kroger Queen City Championship in Ohio.</p>
        
            <p>Ko, who started the day in second place, two shots behind Thailands Jeeno Thitkul, blitzed her rivals with a nine-under 63 to win by five strokes from Thitkul, with Haeran Ryu of South Korea a stroke back third.</p>
        
            <p>It was Ko's 22nd LPGA Tour win and follows her Paris Olympics golf medal and then her third major win, in the British Open, last month.</p>
        
            <p>Ko stunned the crowd with an eagle on the 11th hole to go ahead of Thitkul and never looked like surrendering from here.</p>
        
            <p>She hit seven birdies, including on the final hole, and didn't drop a shot.</p>
