            <p>A Netherlands publication is reporting that Kiwi driver Liam Lawson will be sacked by Red Bull Racing this week.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson, in his first full season in Formula 1, has struggled in the opening two rounds.</p>
        
            <p>He failed to finish in the Australian Grand Prix and then qualified last for both the sprint race and GP in Shanghai last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>In the sprint race, Lawson managed to pass the drivers he should have been in front of anyway and in the GP he was helped by three disqualifications and issues with a couple of other cars to finish 12th.</p>
        
            <p>De Telegraaf is reporting that Lawson has been sidelined after just two races and that he will be replaced by Yuki Tsunoda of Japan, who races in sister team Racing Bulls.</p>
        
            <p>Following the China GP Lawson admitted he was still trying to find the sweet spot or the correct "window" to get the best out of the car.</p>
        
            <p>"The window is really small, that is known, but honestly that is no excuse, I have to get a handle on it," Lawson told F1 TV.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is just time, unfortunately I don't really have time."</p>
        
            <p>At the same time Red Bull boss Christian Horner said they would be reviewing the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"(There was) always going to be speculation in the paddock. We'll take away the info and have a good look at it," Horner said.</p>
        
            <p>De Telegraaf is reporting that a Red Bull meeting has taken place with shareholders and engine supplier Honda.</p>
        
            <p>The publication said that Red Bull is expected to make an official announcement later this week with Lawson and Tsunoda to swap teams.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson replaced Mexican Sergio Perez in the team following the 2024 season.</p>
        
            <p>Tsunoda has picked up three points this season although he did finish behind Lawson in China on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The third round is in Japan next week.</p>
