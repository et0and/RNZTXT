            <p>A woman who died in a house fire on Boxing Day was remembered by her son as a woman with a passion for helping and for her community.</p>
        
            <p>Sandra Dunning, of Pukekohe, died after a fire tore through her home in Victoria St, South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-two firefighters were called to the blaze and managed to prevent it spreading to neighbouring properties.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze took half an hour to get under control and crews spent the rest of the night dampening down any hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Her son and Dunedin resident Scott Dunning described his mother as a woman with "no filter and all heart".</p>
        
            <p>"She very much lived by her values and her values were very much focused on people and caring for people."</p>
        
            <p>Dunning, 62, and her grandchildren had a trip booked for 24 January to see her son in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"We were really looking forward to having her down here.</p>
        
            <p>"She had been sending me TradeMe links of houses she likes ... the next minute, I would be receiving calls from Dunedin real estate agents who would be saying 'Oh, your mum's just called. When would you like to view the house?'"</p>
        
            <p>She was a big fan of op shops. Dunning and his partner had already mapped out a route of Dunedin city to take her so they could visit as many second-hand stores as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"She really wanted to hit every op shop in the city - she wanted to see the castle, the gardens, the sea lions and we were always hoping she would make the move down to be here with us."</p>
        
            <p>Dunning was involved with many causes around the city such as Students For Sensible Drug Policy Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>He said his mother was the inspiration behind all of his work.</p>
        
            <p>"I inherited my passion for the community from her - all the effort I put in for the Otago students, I learnt it from my mum."</p>
        
            <p>Dunning was a keen volunteer at the Pukekohe IHC for over a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Dunning set up a Givealittle page in honour of his mother as "a last good deed" to celebrate her lifetime commitment of caring for others.</p>
        
            <p>All the money raised would be going to IHC, Women's Refuge, and Sands NZ.</p>
