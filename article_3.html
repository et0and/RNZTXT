Christopher Luxon called for councils to "rein in the fantasies", manage spending, and focus on delivering their core services - but mayors say they already do this.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has called for councils to "rein in the fantasies", manage spending, and focus on delivering their core services - but mayors say they already do this.</p>
        
            <p>"Ratepayers expect local government to do the basics and to do the basics brilliantly," Luxon told a conference of local government representatives in Wellington on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Pick up the rubbish, fix the pipes, fill in potholes, and more generally, maintain local assets quickly, carefully, and cost effectively."</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced plans to remove four wellbeing provisions in the Local Government Act and putting a revenue cap on "non-core activities" to ensure councils get "back to the basics", and introducing performance benchmarks.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom said it should be left to communities to decide "what inspires them".</p>
        
            <p>"A government capping local government's ability to reflect what its communities are asking for is a slippery slope to mediocrity."</p>
        
            <p>The council has been lifting its performance across core infrastructure and found savings, such as a restructure which reduced operating costs by 6 percent, he said.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>But rates in New Plymouth climbed by 11.5 percent with just a few "nice-to-haves", like sporting and walkway infrastructure, remaining in its budget.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people would say they aren't core business, but actually, what's the definition? Is it libraries, museums, art galleries?" Holdom asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Because, actually, I believe that they are all core business of council."</p>
        
            <p>The average rates increase across New Zealand is 16 percent with few councils managing to avoid increases in the double digits.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government NZ president and Selwyn mayor Sam Broughton said councils have already gone through budgets to cut spending.</p>
        
            <p>"Councils go, line by line, through our budgets every three years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To suggest that we don't already do that - we do. It's very clear and taken very seriously."</p>

            <p>Rates in Selwyn jumped 14.9 percent, but Broughton said the cost of delivering council services has increased.</p>
        
            <p>Over the last three years, the cost of building water supply systems and bridges have climbed 27 and 38 percent respectively, while insurance premiums jumped 70 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua ratepayers got hit with a 17.5 percent increase this year.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Anita Baker said the council scrutinised its budgets to find savings, with staffing changes alone saving $2 million.</p>
        
            <p>"Porirua does stick to its knitting," she said. "We did lose some staff. We cut our village planning, so we got rid of that. We put projects on hold."</p>

            <p>Infrastructure spending was 65 percent of the council's budget, but there still needed to have "some kind of wellbeing", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We still need libraries and pools, because that's how we live."</p>
        
            <p>The removal of the wellbeing provisions was "a little bit of a concern" for Ashburton mayor Neil Brown, who recently lifted rates 11.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"We looked after the roads, the waters, the essential things we need for day to day, we cut or didn't increase the fluffy stuff," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And if there's any buildings to be done, it's on a needs basis."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson mayor Nick Smith said the four wellbeing provisions had "set councils up to fail" by making the scope of council work too wide in comparison with its revenue base.</p>
        
            <p>"It creates an expectation that council is going to do a whole lot of things that it's not funded for."</p>
        
            <p>He supported the prime minister's message to reduce spending and focus on core services which, Smith said, reflected public opinion.</p>

            <p>Rates in Nelson climbed just 8.2 percent. However, after a $300 annual charge for the next decade for the city's 2022 storm recovery is factored in, the increase becomes 15.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In the constrained economic times, the council had adjusted its ambitions accordingly, Smith said, giving the example of scrapping the proposed $46m riverside library.</p>
        
            <p>However, contained within the city's long-term plan, funding remains for several lower-cost projects, such as a $1.6m arts hub.</p>
        
            <p>"Doing some smaller, smart projects actually is in the community's interest."</p>
