            <p>Papua New Guinea police say 10 people have been tragically killed after a series of violent "revenge killings" along the Laiagam-Sirunki Highway in Enga Province.</p>
        
            <p>The attacks, which occured last Friday and Monday, are believed to be connected to an unresolved death that took place in March earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Police said that gunmen from the Mulapin tribe ambushed a vehicle packed with passengers from the Sakare clan near Tambitanis Health Centre in Sirunki on 11 October at 8am.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle, carrying a body, was fired upon in a surprise attack. A woman lost her life, several others sustained serious injuries, and the gunmen escaped.</p>
        
            <p>An hour later on the same day, the Sakare clan retaliated by shooting the driver and his passenger from close range. They reached a nearby hospital but succumbed to their injuries on arrival.</p>
        
            <p>The leadership of the Kunalin and Lyain tribes is urging restraint and for the clans not to resort to violence, police said.</p>
        
            <p>They have also called for the immediate surrender of suspects from both the Mulapin and Sakare tribes to law enforcement.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Police Commissioner Joseph Tondop, who is responsible for the state of emergency in Enga, is calling for an investigation into the root causes of the recent conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"This sort of revenge killing is unheard of in the history of tribal conflicts is Enga Province where innocent people unrelated to the conflicts where killed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"All tribal clans taking part in the conflicts (Sakars, Mulapian, Kunalins, Myom and people form Kulapi 4 in Porgera) are all under the scope and ordered to refrain from further escalating the situation."</p>
        
            <p>The investigative teams will start their work immediately, and individuals or groups found to be involved will be apprehended, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This task force is given strict orders to carry out a thorough investigation, leaving no stone unturned."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific's correspondent in PNG said word on the ground is that the public is frustrated police are yet to make arrests.</p>
        
            <p>He said police find it difficult to go and deal with the clans and arrest people that are armed.</p>
        
            <p>Waide said people are reluctant to give up weapons because it gives them a sense of security in tribal conflicts.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a difficult situation that both lawmakers, citizens and police are in. The longer this drags on and guns are in the hands of ordinary people, killing will continue."</p>
