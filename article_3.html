            <p>Pipers and drummers have descended on the capital this week for the Royal New Zealand Pipe Bands' Association annual summer school.</p>
        
            <p>People come from all over the country and the world to take part in the summer school at Scots College, director Courtney Williamson said.</p>
        
            <p>"This year we've got 120 odd people ranging in age from, I think our youngest is about 8 to 10 this year, through to people in their 70s.</p>
        
            <p>"From the bottom of the South Island, Southland, through the north of Auckland, we've got a contingent from Australia this year of about 10, and we've also got two Canadians that are joining us this year as well."</p>
        
            <p>But if you were expecting a cacophony of sounds you'd be wrong, head of the pipe band programme at Dollar Academy in Scotland and summer school tutor Matt Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the teaching that we do is on a practice chanter, which is a far quieter sound for those that are not used to it. So  far more pleasant sound."</p>
        
            <p>Sam Foote from St Andrews College in Christchurch is attending for the third time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good opportunity to get excited about pipe bands and have a couple tunes with your mates and learn a little bit along the way."</p>
        
            <p>It's a hobby that allowed him to travel and make new friends, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Through piping over the last six years, I've been fortunate enough to be able to go to Scotland and Canada on trips, and I've got a few more on the way hopefully."</p>
        
            <p>Among those travelling here for the programme are sisters Grace and Hope Barnes from Canada, who both got scholarships to attend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing. As soon as we heard about the scholarships, I was just over the moon.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh my goodness, get to see a whole new part of the world. And we're not even on the same hemisphere anymore - it's an amazing opportunity," said Grace.</p>
        
            <p>Pipe bands are having something of a renaissance in New Zealand, especially with young people, said Royal New Zealand Pipe Bands' Association president Liam Kernaghan.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is one of the hotspots right around the world per capita. We have the most top-level Grade 1 pipe bands outside of Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>"We've also got a large number of juvenile under 18 bands, right throughout New Zealand. So it's a really special time for new bagpiping and drumming."</p>
        
            <p>The summer school exposes young musicians to the best, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got Matt Wilson here from Scotland, who's one of the world's best pipers, and we've also got fantastic tutors from New Zealand, who can contribute to the success of those up-and-coming players and hopefully we can be a bit of a melting pot for New Zealand bagpiping."</p>
