            <p>The nominations for the 97th Academy Awards were announced Thursday and it was a big morning for Emilia Pérez, The Brutalist and Wicked.</p>
        
            <p>After acknowledgement of the impact of ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles by Academy leadership, Bowen Yang and Rachel Sennott revealed the nominees for the film industry's top prize, previewing the race that will play out in the weeks to come, culminating at the March ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Emilia Pérez led with 13 nominations, followed by The Brutalist and Wicked with 10 each.</p>
        
            <p>Musical Emilia Pérez has seen success in spite of some controversy. The movie's four Golden Globe wins did some to calm the criticism over many aspects of the film, including Selena Gomez's perceived struggles with her character's Spanish dialogue and various issues with the movie's representation of the transgender community. Despite all this, it topped non-English language films Roma and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</p>
        
            <p>The Brutalist, from director Brady Corbet, stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones as Hungarian refugees who come to the US after WWII. The film, which won big at the Golden Globes, was recently embroiled in controversy over its use of artificial intelligence in dialect, with Corbet giving an assertive defence of his performers amid the debate.</p>
        
            <p>Wicked, meanwhile, certainly had the blockbuster audience vote, and this time that also translated into awards recognition. The musical from director Jon M. Chu scored a nomination for best picture as well as individual honours for stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the latter of whom was a first-time nominee. Erivo was previously nominated for Harriet. (If she adds an Oscar to her awards collection, she will achieve EGOT status, joining fewer than 30 artists who have each won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards.)</p>
        
            <p>With Wicked and Emilia Pérez, this year marks the first time two musicals have been nominated in the best picture category since 1968 when Oliver! and Funny Girl both scored nominations, according to the Academy.</p>
        
            <p>The acting categories were largely dominated by first-time nominees, with 13 individuals scoring their first Oscar nods, including Kieran Culkin, Demi Moore, Isabella Rossellini and Zoe Saldaña.</p>
        
            <p>Conan O'Brien is set to host the ceremony, taking place on 2 March and airing on ABC.</p>
        
            <p>A list of nominees follows below.</p>
