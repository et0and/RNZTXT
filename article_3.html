            <p>Defending champion Jannik Sinner continued his sizzling Australian Open run with a 7-6(2) 6-2 6-2 victory over American 21st seed Ben Shelton on Friday to reach a second straight final at Melbourne Park and book a meeting with Alexander Zverev.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner's victory made the 23-year-old the youngest man to make multiple finals at the Australian Open since Jim Courier in 1992-93 and kept alive his dream of becoming the first Italian to lift three Grand Slam singles trophies.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy to be back in the final again," said Sinner, who had to overcome cramp in the third set.</p>
        
            <p>"Sundays are special days in tournaments and I'm hoping I can enjoy it."</p>
        
            <p>Sinner entered the match on Rod Laver Arena having won four of his five meetings with left-hander Shelton but found himself in trouble early on as a thunderous forehand winner handed the American a break, which he followed up with a tight hold.</p>
        
            <p>The top seed shrugged off a tentative start to draw level at 2-2 and attacked Shelton's powerful serve at every opportunity, but a lapse on his own delivery in the 11th game left him in a spot of bother again before he saved two set points.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton bounced his racket off the court after going behind 4-0 in the ensuing tiebreak as his accuracy cruelly deserted him and Sinner gleefully accepted the first set when his frustrated opponent sent a forehand wide.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very tough first set but crucial," said Sinner.</p>
        
            <p>"He wasn't serving at his best, not where he wanted to. We both returned better than we served. First sets can often give you confidence and it was tense. I'm happy how I handled it.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy to be back in the final here."</p>
        
            <p>After a breathless start to the second set, Sinner released the handbrake to win the opening four games without response and soon left a dejected Shelton in the rear view mirror to double his advantage in the match.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner felt a problem in his left leg during a tense third set and had it worked on by the trainer after breaking to go 3-2 up, before some huge winners took him to the finish line and back-to-back major finals after his triumphant U.S. Open run.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of tension today, I was slightly cramping. He was suffering on his legs too so I tried to move him around," added Sinner.</p>
        
            <p>"These matches can go long. Playing three sets for 2-1/2 hours is a long time, so I'm happy to finish it in three, I'm happy to be back in the final again."</p>
        
            <p>Second seed Zverev reached his first Australian Open final and third at the majors after 24-times Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic retired due to a left thigh injury after losing the opening set 7-6(5).</p>
        
            <p>"We've had some tough matches in the past," Sinner said of Zverev, who leads their head-to-head record 4-2.</p>
        
            <p>"So anything can happen. He's an incredible player looking for a first major."</p>
