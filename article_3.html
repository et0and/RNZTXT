            <p>Ryan Fox said he was chuffed to have recorded a rare feat in golf, hitting a hole in one.</p>
        
            <p>Fox aced the iconic 17th Island Green hole at the $40 million Players Championship in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old New Zealander etched his name into the history books as he became just the 14th player to record a hole-in-one at the 17th at the Players Championship.</p>
        
            <p>"When it landed and came back I thought this has got a chance," Fox told the media afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't go in very often so it was nice to have one go in and to have that many people there to witness it is pretty cool."</p>
        
            <p>Fox felt the hole was set-up well for him with the pin at the front of the green.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a nice gap wedge and you know you have a little bit of a backstop there and I was pretty chuffed to look up and see it going down the flag.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously a little bit of luck for it to come back down the slope and actually go in, but I'm certainly not complaining."</p>
        
            <p>In 2005 Bob Tway hit four balls into the water on the hole and finished with the highest score ever, a 12.</p>
        
            <p>Fox agreed that the 17th can be a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an intimidating shot, I don't care who you are you get up there and most of the crowd probably want you to make a one or hit it in the water, so I'm glad to be on the right side of it in that respect."</p>
        
            <p>He also became the first player ever to record back-to-back eagles on 16 and 17.</p>

            <p>He finished with a three under par 69 which currently has him tied for 13th.</p>
        
            <p>Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy are the club house leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Players Championship is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year with Scottie Scheffler the defending champion.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Craig Perks won the tournament in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>This year's winner will pocket $7.3 million.</p>
