            <p>Two men charged over the murder of dairy worker Janak Patel will be sentenced in the High Court in Auckland this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Frederick Hobson has pleaded guilty to the murder of Patel, while Shane Tane has pleaded guilty to an aggravated robbery charge.</p>
        
            <p>A third man - Henry Ford - was granted a stay of proceedings due to being terminally ill.</p>
        
            <p>Patel was stabbed to death while working on the evening of 23 November 2022, outside the Rose Cottage dairy in the central Auckland suburb of Sandringham.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents revealed Patel and his wife had only moved to Auckland a week prior to his death, to look after the Rose Cottage Superette while its owners were away in India.</p>

            <p>It was planned Hobson would enter the superette, armed with a knife, to take cash and any other items he could manage.</p>
        
            <p>At about 8pm, Hobson pulled a black bandana up, covering the bottom half of his face, and ran into the dairy, holding a knife and a brown paper bag.</p>
        
            <p>He confronted Patel with a knife, causing him to flee into a back room.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson took the cash register, as well as a box of butane lighters and vapes, before leaving the store.</p>
        
            <p>Patel ran after him, armed with a hockey stick from the back of the shop.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson put the cash register in a nearby recycling wheelie bin as Patel approached, and went towards him aggressively, as Patel retreated swinging the hockey stick.</p>

            <p>Court documents revealed Hobson lunged at Patel and knocked him to the ground, stabbing him at least three times.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson tried to wrestle the hockey stick from Patel's grasp, pulling him back to his feet, and stabbing him a further three times.</p>
        
            <p>"The final blow was to Mr Patel's neck, causing him to fall to the ground once again."</p>
        
            <p>Patel used the wheelie bin in an attempt to get away from Hobson, who tried to stab him once more.</p>
        
            <p>He collapsed after taking five steps back towards the dairy.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson collected the bin and left the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Patel's death sparked protests by dairy owners over the safety of small businesses, while more than $100,000 was raised for his family.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Dairy and Business Owner's Group said Patel's family faced a life sentence for the hole his murderer created in their hearts.</p>
