            <p>The man who killed Auckland student Tom Coombes in a "vicious and frenzied" knife attack will be detained in a psychiatric facility.</p>
        
            <p>Christian Eteuati, 24, stabbed Coombes 42 times near a Mt Albert walkway in May 2022, while in a psychotic state.</p>
        
            <p>He was later acquitted of any criminal responsibility for Coombes killing, on the grounds of insanity.</p>
        
            <p>In a judgement released by Justice Ian Gault on Thursday, he noted Eteuati had been staying at Auckland's Mason Clinic since then.</p>
        
            <p>On 24 May, 2022, Coombes was walking home listening to music, when he was confronted by Eteuati near the Roy Clements Treeway in Mt Albert.</p>

            <p>Justice Gault said this was when Eteuati unleashed a "vicious, frenzied and unprovoked attack" on Coombes with a knife.</p>
        
            <p>Coombes was stabbed 42 times, with one of the stabs penetrating his skull and entering his brain.</p>
        
            <p>He died at the scene, while Eteuati returned to his nearby home.</p>
        
            <p>At home, Eteuati showed his younger brother the knife and said the blood that he was covered in was "a person's blood, human blood".</p>
        
            <p>Police found Eteuati four days later, hiding in a wastewater tunnel nearby.</p>

            <p>Family and friends of Coombes earlier released a statement and stated he was known for his kindness, compassion and humour.</p>
        
            <p>A celebration of his life was held at Wainamu, Te Henga (Bethells Beach), where 700 people gathered to mourn him.</p>
        
            <p>"Tom was a young man who followed his dreams, and we want his life to inspire other young people to do the same," said Rowena Coombes, Tom's mother.</p>
        
            <p>His friends described him as being at his most happy in the last year he was alive, as he had met the love of his life.</p>
        
            <p>Psychiatrist evaluations of Eteuati, found he had treatment-resistant schizophrenia and a severe antisocial personality disorder along with substance abuse issues.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported he would be at high risk of committing further crimes if in the community if he did not get treatment for his mental illness.</p>
        
            <p>"Dr Pillai considered that your offending is of the most serious nature, and that you have a high propensity for violent offending based on mental illness, antisocial personality disorder, and deviant interests, that you need consistent and long-term specialist oversight," Justice Gault said.</p>
        
            <p>"You need to be under the long-term oversight of specialist mental health services with comprehensive attention to your care needs."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Gault ordered Eteuati be detained at Auckland's Mason Clinic as a special patient indefinitely.</p>
