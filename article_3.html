            <p>A sleepy sea lion using your clothes as a pillow is a problem few beachgoers face.</p>
        
            <p>But attendees at a regional surf lifesaving event found this was just the case when they went to fetch their bags in St Clair on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Carnival-goer Justin Stott said he had seen sea lions before while surfing, but never that close.</p>
        
            <p>"To me, it looked like they were just having a bit of a sleep and a rest in the tent.</p>
        
            <p>"They looked very comfortable and relaxed - [they] didn't seem fazed by people at all.</p>
        
            <p>"One of them looked like it was using the clothes and stuff as a pillow."</p>
        
            <p>The carnival is a monthly event that brings together all the surf lifesaving clubs around Otago. St Clair was taking its turn to host.</p>
        
            <p>St Clair Surf Life Saving Club junior co-ordinator Jon Richardson said the pair of sea lions decided they wanted to semi-participate in the carnival proceedings, before making themselves at home in the tent.</p>
        
            <p>Attendees chose to leave them to their nap.</p>
        
            <p>While sea lions were a regular sight at St Clair, it was not every day you saw them having a sleep among beachgoers' belongings.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's clothes would have been pretty smelly afterwards," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not particularly good in terms of smell, are they?"</p>
        
            <p>The sighting was a unique case where the sea lions acted incredibly docile, as they could otherwise get quite protective, Richardson said.</p>
        
            <p>He advised people to follow Department of Conservation guidelines: keep their distance, put their dogs on a lead and leave the sea lions alone.</p>
        
            <p>Coastal Biodiversity Otago ranger Jim Fyfe said the tent looked like a "very cool place to hang out on a hot day".</p>
