            <p>The mayor of a Philippine town where an Australian couple and their Filipina relative were murdered has issued an ultimatum to the chief of police: Solve the case soon or step down.</p>
        
            <p>Media interest has been growing sharply in what is being treated as a triple homicide, after the bodies of Australian couple David James Fisk and Lucita Barquin Cortez, as well as Lucita's daughter-in-law Mary Jane Cortez, were discovered earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>A hotel staff member found the victims bound and gagged after the trio failed to check out of their hotel room. It was understood the killer was in the room for hours.</p>
        
            <p>Police were keen to reassure locals and tourists alike that their usually peaceful town was still safe, despite the fact the killer remains on the loose.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor of Tagaytay City, Abraham Tolentino, is pushing for results, telling police he wants a speedy resolution.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a message up to the top officers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In one week, if there's no progress or result, then they have to relieve my chief of police."</p>
        
            <p>Security camera footage showed a man wearing a black hoodie entering their room just hours before the gruesome discovery.</p>
        
            <p>The eight seconds of footage showed him casually walking towards the door and seemingly enter without difficulty.</p>
        
            <p>Australian authorities were now working with local police to try to catch the suspected killer, but it has been several days since the bodies were discovered and he was still at large.</p>

            <p>"All our security forces are in full control of our area," Tagaytay police chief Charles Daven Capagcuan told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"There is not a reason for us to be alarmed about our security."</p>
        
            <p>The motive for the killing was unclear, as many of the expensive possessions in the hotel room were left untouched.</p>
        
            <p>But police are not ruling out a robbery gone bad after Fisk's wallet was taken and luggage had been rummaged through.</p>
        
            <p>"We are praying," Lieutenant Colonel Capagcuan said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are doing all our best to resolve this crime."</p>
        
            <p>Tolentino said it was still a safe place for locals and tourists but security measures would be reviewed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a wake-up call after how many decades of no incidents like this," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tagaytay City is a tourist-driven local economy.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a safe place, we are a peaceful place, and for the last 30 years there's no crime like this in the area."</p>
        
            <p>Fisk's daughters released a statement, saying they were living a "nightmare" and were praying for the homicide to be solved.</p>
        
            <p>They have launched an online crowdfunding campaign to support the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"These funds will go to support getting justice for all loved ones involved and be used to help ease the financial stress and burden that will arise from this incredibly difficult time," it reads.</p>
        
            <p>The Tagaytay mayor said the city would fund the repatriation of the two women to their home provinces.</p>
        
            <p>"I've sent my deepest sympathies and condolences to them," he said.</p>
