            <p>Two people have been injured in Central Auckland after debris fell from a building.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a building on Queen St on Monday morning after an object fell and shattered glass.</p>
        
            <p>Two pedestrians were moderately injured and were taken to a nearby medical centre, a police spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>Both of the injured were treated at the scene, St John said.</p>
        
            <p>Sunny Chung, a shopkeeper, who saw what she said looked like a big brick fall, said there was blood on the ground after people were hit, but they were quickly helped.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw it fall and suddenly I started thinking what happened, it hit an old Chinese lady," said the shop keeper.</p>
        
            <p>"She had blood close to her eye area and the blood dripped onto the floor but I was quite surprised police came quite quickly."</p>
        
            <p>"It was a big brick," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said members of the public immediately went to help, followed by police.</p>

            <p>Chung was among those who immediately rushed to the woman's aid.</p>
        
            <p>"I asked her, do you need someone to translate to help? We're just next door in the shop, if you need help come and see us.</p>
        
            <p>"She is alright though, in quite good condition and can talk there was just a lot of blood.</p>
        
            <p>Chung said she was concerned about the incident repeating around the shop she works in.</p>
        
            <p>"How did this happen? I have no idea, we should know how something like this can happen, it should never happen again.</p>
        
            <p>"In the future we could be walking past and be crushed, it doesn't make sense at all."</p>
