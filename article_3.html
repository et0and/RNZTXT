        <h2>Gloriavale inquest: Huffing paint can't be ruled out</h2>
        <p>
A toxicologist has told a court he cannot rule out the possibility that Sincere Standtrue may have been huffing paint and other chemical fumes before his death.

            <p>A toxicologist has told a court he cannot rule out the possibility that a Gloriavale man may have been huffing paint and other chemical fumes.</p>
        
            <p>Sincere Standtrue, who was 20, died in Christchurch Hospital following nine days in the intensive care unit in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>An inquest is underway in Greymouth this week to try to determine the cause and circumstances into his death.</p>
        
            <p>From age 15, Standtrue worked in the Christian community's paint shop, and it was here another Gloriavale member found him unresponsive 10 days before he died.</p>
        
            <p>Some of Standtrue's injuries and the paint splattered on his clothing may be consistent with huffing, toxicology expert Dr Leo Schep told the court.</p>
        
            <p>"I got paint on my own overalls [at home] and tried to compare that with what this gentleman had," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's possible that it was just poor workplace practice [that caused the paint marks], or, and I can't say for sure, it could have been due to huffing."</p>

            <p>Inadvertent exposure to paint fumes also could have produced these effects, Schep said.</p>
        
            <p>Former Gloriavale paint shop workers developing asthma was a "huge red flag" they were likely being exposed to dangerous substances in the paint shop, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Schep believed it was highly likely Standtrue was among those exposed to chemical and paint fumes without proper protection, but again, could not definitively say this was the case.</p>
        
            <p>Another expert witness, forensic pathologist Dr Leslie Anderson also gave evidence to the inquest on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>In her formal statement, she detailed concerns with "the inconsistencies between the medical findings and the reported circumstances" of Standtrue's death.</p>

            <p>One of the medical conclusions suggested for his death "relies entirely on eyewitness reports" when he was found, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>It was unable to be proven with any other evidence, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of Standtrue's medical imaging was also unusual and did not match typical results for that proposed cause of death, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>A defibrillator was brought to Standtrue shortly after he was found unresponsive in the Gloriavale paint shop, and carried outside.</p>
        
            <p>But it was unable to be used because the battery was flat.</p>
        
            <p>Use of the defibrillator possibly could have made a difference, but it was impossible to say if it could have saved Standtrue's life, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a complicated case with unclear physical findings," she told the court.</p>
        
            <p>"From a forensic pathology perspective, the manner of death is 'unascertained' in this case."</p>
        
            <p>The inquest resumes on Wednesday.</p>
