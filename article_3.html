            <p>Councils have until 6 September to decide whether to drop the wards. If they don't reach a decision, a binding referendum must be held alongside the election.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara Mayor Craig Jepson has been called to resign by iwi groups over his stance to remove the Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward, currently occupied by councillor Pera Paniora.</p>
        
            <p>If the ward was disestablished, it would be the first under the new rules.</p>
