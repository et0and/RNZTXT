            <p>A notable absentee is pole vaulter Eliza McCartney who won silver in Glasgow last year.</p>
        
            <p>McCartney's only recently returned to competition after the Paris Olympics, contesting the national track and field champs in Dunedin at the weekend but she failed to reach the qualifying mark.</p>
        
            <p>Paris Olympians Olivia McTaggart and Imogen Ayris did reach the qualifying standard however and will compete in China.</p>
        
            <p>Sprinters Zoe Hobbs and Tiaan Whelpton will contest the 100m, while middle distance runners Maia Ramsden and Laura Nagel will compete in the 1500m.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsden has been in good recent form setting a new New Zealand mile record in Boston to qualify for China.</p>
        
            <p>Rounding out the team is Canada based 800m runner Alison Andrews-Paul, who recently ran the fourth fastest time by a New Zealand woman over the distance.</p>
