            <p>Waikato police are still investigating the "credible sighting" of fugitive Marokopa father Tom Phillips and his children.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders said they were continuing to make enquiries after a sighting of Phillips and his children was reported on 3 October.</p>
        
            <p>The tip-off that Phillips had been seen in bush area west of Coutts Road in Marokopa with Jayda, Maverick and Ember came about 7pm on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Until Thursday, Phillips and his three children Jayda, now 11, Maverick, nine, and Ember, eight, had not been seen together since 12 December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"Our enquiries have established that this was a credible sighting, and police believe it was indeed Tom and his children," Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, a private investigator looking into the family's disappearance told RNZ they had been spotted by a group of pig hunters on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Budge said his local contact told him the tip-off came from a group of pig hunters but he did not state their age, or where they were from.</p>
        
            <p>"He'd heard through the local, I'll call it the rumour network, that Tom had been seen by some pig hunters on Thursday and the police were dealing with it on Friday."</p>
        
            <p>Police said officers were dispatched to the Marokopa area that night and searched for the next three days.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the search phase included air support from the Police Eagle helicopter and a Royal New Zealand Air Force NH90 helicopter, but "nothing of significance" was found, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday's sighting was the first time all three children had been seen in almost three years.</p>
        
            <p>"[This is] positive information, and we know it will be reassuring for the children's wider family.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continue to urge those in the Marokopa community to remain alert and report any suspicious activity, no matter how minor, to us."</p>
        
            <p>In June, police announced an $80,000 reward, along with potential immunity from prosecution for anyone who may have previously assisted Phillips, who now provided information that led to the safe return of the children.</p>
        
            <p>It expired at midnight on 25 June with no sign of the fugitive father or his kids.</p>
