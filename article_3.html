        <h2>India thrash South Africa by eight wickets in first ODI</h2>
        <p>
India were too strong for the Proteas in the first ODI in Johannesburg.

            <p>India's seamers Arshdeep Singh and Avesh Khan helped skittle South Africa out for 116 before Sai Sudharsan scored an unbeaten 55 on debut as India romped to an eight-wicket victory in the first One-Day International at The Wanderers on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa won the toss and elected to bat but the decision proved disastrous as they were bowled out for their lowest total on home soil in the 50-over format, narrowly underperforming the previous worst mark of 118 - also against India - in Pretoria in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Singh picked up five wickets for 37 runs in his 10 overs and Khan took 4-27 in eight as they bowled a wicket-to-wicket line that had seven of the South African batters either bowled or dismissed leg before wicket.</p>
        
            <p>All-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo offered some resistance for the hosts with 33 from 49 balls before he became Singh's fifth and final victim.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan was to keep it simple," Singh said after his first ODI in more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>"I hadn't opened my account in One-Day Internationals having played three games before this, so to get a five-for is really special.</p>
        
            <p>"The wicket was helping, so we tried to maintain the basics and use the right lengths.</p>
        
            <p>"Before the game we thought there wouldn't be much movement, so we were surprised, but there was a nice breeze and some purchase off the wicket, so the plan was to hit the wickets and look for lbw's."</p>
        
            <p>Khan removed the middle and lower order for his career-best bowling figures in ODIs.</p>
        
            <p>India were positive in their chase and reached their target in 16.4 overs with exactly 200 balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>Debutant left-handed opener Sudharsan scored an elegant 55 not out in 43 balls, including nine fours.</p>
        
            <p>He was supported by Shreyas Iyer, who was caught with victory in sight having scored 52 from 45 balls.</p>
        
            <p>The second game in the three-match series will be played in Gqeberha on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams are missing several of their regular players, who are either injured or rested for the two-match Test series that follows.</p>
