            <p>Breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn says she has resolved a dispute with a comedian after her lawyers shut down a parody musical based on her Olympic journey.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney comedian Steph Broadbridge cancelled her Raygun-inspired musical two weeks ago after receiving letters from the breakdancer's lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>Raygun's lawyers claimed her name and the silhouette of her iconic kangaroo pose from Paris 2024 were protected intellectual property.</p>
        
            <p>Hoping to put the online saga to rest, Gunn posted a video statement on Instagram on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>She said her legal team and Broadbridge's had come to an agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"Hi everyone, it's been a big couple of weeks," Gunn said in a video posted to Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to lie, it's been a wild ride but I'm really pleased to say we've resolved everything.</p>
        
            <p>"My team's been working with Steph's team and we've managed to come to an agreement."</p>
        
            <p>The legal stoush was documented in a string of social media posts by the pair.</p>
        
            <p>Broadbridge on Thursday announced she would go ahead with a different "completely legal parody musical."</p>
        
            <p>It came after Anthony Skinner, the owner of the club originally set to host the musical, said he had been invoiced $10,000 in legal fees by Gunn's lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>In legal letters from Gunn's lawyers seen by the ABC, Skinner was ordered to "reimburse our client with legal costs to date which we estimate to be $10,000."</p>
        
            <p>Skinner said he offered Gunn $500 made in ticket sales but said it was rejected by lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>Gunn addressed this in her video, claiming that $10,000 charge was in anticipation of legal fees should the matter go to court.</p>
        
            <p>"We have not sought any costs from all this. So there's a lot of talk around this $10,000 … that was from really early on, like, day one, my lawyers were acting on my behalf.</p>
        
            <p>"They sent out letters and, you know, they asked for a response … by a certain time, they didn't hear a response. And you know, we were worried that we might have to go to court.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, no one wants that, and so the $10k would just be my potential legal costs if we had to go to court. But fortunately, we didn't.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not seeking any costs, I've said before it's not about the money, and it is still not about the money. We've got no costs from them, not from Steph, not from the comedy club."</p>
        
            <p>Skinner has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>In her own Instagram statement published on Thursday evening, Broadbridge apologised and acknowledged she did not contact Raygun before she created the title and poster of the original show, Raygun the Musical.</p>

            <p>In a previous video, Gunn said she had been "blindsided" by the news of the musical.</p>
        
            <p>"It was never my intention to mislead people into thinking that she was involved in the production," Broadbridge wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I am deeply sorry to learn that Raygun has faced negative backlash as a result of the media attention around the cancellation of the preview for the musical.</p>
        
            <p>"The last thing I wanted was for anyone to experience hate or distress from this situation."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking with the Sydney Drive show, Broadbridge said she had originally intended to have the show completed after the preview and invite Raygun to opening night.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a totally new environment for me to be in and I just want to say, I am sorry for any hurt that was caused. I am certainly not doing that intentionally."</p>
        
            <p>Broadbridge's reworked musical, Breaking The Musical, will be a "fictional telling of a moment in Australian history".</p>
        
            <p>"It's about the sport, it's about the internet, it's about the entertainment industry," she told Sydney Drive.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about a young Australian with a dream.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm playing the lead so I've painted myself in a very good light."</p>
        
            <p>Gunn said it had been a stressful time for herself and Broadbridge.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been a stressful time for me, and it's been tough for me, but I know that I'm not the only one," she added.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that this has been tough for Steph, for you know, everyone in her show, and a lot of other people, and it's never been my intention to cause any hurt or distress."</p>
