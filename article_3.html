            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told attendees at the Local Government New Zealand conference in Wellington today that local councils need to "rein in the fantasies" on spending.</p>
        
            <p>"Ratepayers expect local government to do the basics and to do the basics brilliantly," he told the conference.</p>
        
            <p>"Pick up the rubbish. Fix the pipes. Fill in potholes. And more generally, maintain local assets quickly, carefully, and cost effectively."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon specifically mentioned the venue where he was speaking the recently completed TƒÅkina convention centre which has seen concerns raised about its costs.</p>
        
            <p>"The building we're in today is a classic example," he said, to some audible grumbling from the audience.</p>
        
            <p>Citing continuing water woes in Wellington including today's flooding, Luxon criticised how "Wellington City Council decided to spend $180m on a convention center that according to public reporting is now losing money."</p>
        
            <p>"It looks very nice, and it's very nice that politicians like us have another expensive room to deliver speeches in, but can anyone seriously say it was the right financial decision or the highest priority for Wellington given all of its challenges?</p>
        
            <p>"Ratepayers are sick of the white elephants and non-delivery. So, my challenge to all of you is to rein in the fantasies and to get back to delivering the basics brilliantly."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Local Government New Zealand commissioned a report from Infometrics which found homeowners faced on average rates rises of 15 percent.</p>
