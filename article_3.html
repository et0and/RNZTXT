        <h2>Thieves leave sour taste with raid on food bank's vege patch</h2>
        <p>
It's not a case of green thumbs - rather dishonest hands that will deprive others of fresh produce in their food parcels this week. Audio

            <p>It's not a case of green thumbs - rather dishonest hands that will deprive others of fresh produce in their food parcels this week.</p>
        
            <p>Someone's raided a south Taranaki garden that supplies Eltham's food bank with fresh vegetables.</p>
        
            <p>This week's harvest has gone missing from the Eltham E-Kai garden.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesdays the volunteers usually hand over their supplies to the local foodbank so they can pass them on in food parcels for those in need.</p>
        
            <p>However, this would not be the case tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers who work in the garden noticed on Monday that it had been stripped.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Kylie Fletcher said it was heartbreaking as volunteers had put a lot of work in to help their community.</p>
        
            <p>If the thieves had just asked, they would have been given some produce.</p>
        
            <p>"It's available for everybody. It would just be nice if people came in and asked."</p>
        
            <p>The rhubarb patch, cabbages and a large area with potatoes were among parts of the large section that had been stripped.</p>
        
            <p>Some plants might have been killed because parts were ripped out, Fletcher said.</p>
        
            <p>Among the most annoying losses was a large cauliflower which she estimated could have fed as many as four families.</p>
        
            <p>It was near the gate of the section so easily seen by passersby, some of whom took photos of it last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher, a stay-at-home mum, has received help from the foodbank in the past and she was pleased she could repay this by working in the community garden a couple of mornings a week.</p>
        
            <p>There were seven or eight different beds featuring many vegetables including pumpkins, brassicas, peas, tomatoes, capsicums, beans "and potatoes galore".</p>
        
            <p>"You do put a lot of effort into weeding the gardens, planting the plants and feeding the vegetables so that they thrive.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so great what they do, [I'm] more than happy to help."</p>
