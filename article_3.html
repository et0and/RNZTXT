            <p>Neighbours desperately tried to save an 11-year-old boy and his mother who died in a house fire in Southland's Manapouri, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Their bodies were found by specialist search teams combing through the ruins, after the blaze broke out in View Street at 3.40am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said other people remained unaccounted for, but they were now satisfied no-one else was at home at the time of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>A man who also lived at the rental property was away at work, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Mark McCloy said officers were speaking to neighbours who tried to rescue the woman and her son.</p>
        
            <p>"Neighbours at the property attempted valiantly to gain entry to the burning house, but they were unable to and contacted emergency services," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The house was destroyed, McCloy said.</p>
        
            <p>"We had to get a crane in yesterday to remove what was left of the roof to allow our scene team to get in," he said.</p>

            <p>Police were still treating the fire as unexplained and were working with fire investigators to establish the cause.</p>
        
            <p>McCloy said police and Fire and Emergency staff would continue examining the house over coming days.</p>
        
            <p>Support was being offered to North Island relatives and local iwi had blessed the property, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The thoughts of everyone involved are with the victims' whanau, who are being supported at this tragic time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fiordland councillor Sarah Greaney said people in Manapouri would be shocked and saddened by the deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a small-knit community, both in Manapouri and Te Anau, so when events like this happen they do send a ripple through the community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"These things do come out of the blue and they are unfortunately great reminders of how precious life is."</p>
