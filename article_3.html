            <p>One of Te Papa's floor levels is to be closed down for at least nine months for repairs, after rust was found in a sprinkler system.</p>
        
            <p>The national museum Te Papa Tongarewa plans to close down the upper level of its art gallery Toi Te Papa from 19 May.</p>
        
            <p>Listen to the full Culture 101 report here</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa communications leader Kate Camp said the corrosion on level 5 was found mid-2023 during an inspection, and the sprinkler system must be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>However it was not yet known exactly how long the repairs would take or how long the gallery would remain closed.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the future of Wellington City Gallery, one of the country's leading art galleries, faces uncertainty as nearby demolition and construction have led to operating hours of only a few evening hours each day and the future closure of its main entrance.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa houses the national art collection of more than 40,000 artworks, and level 5 is used to display them.</p>
        
            <p>No other parts of the museum are affected, and the art gallery space on level 4 will remain open throughout the level 5 closure.</p>
        
            <p>Toi Te Papa opened in 2018, costing $8.4 million dollars.</p>
