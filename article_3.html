        <p>
Analysis - Liam Lawson may not have made too many friends on Monday but he certainly kept his name in the conversations post-race.

            <p>Analysis - It may not have been the result he was wanting but New Zealand driver Liam Lawson has shown he's prepared to mix it with the big boys.</p>
        
            <p>In his second race back in the top league, Lawson finished 16th in the Mexican Grand Prix after starting 12th on the grid.</p>
        
            <p>In Texas last weekend he upset Spanish legend Fernando Alonso with his driving, this weekend it was local star Sergio Perez.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson showed he was prepared to get the elbows out to defend a position and it was the Mexican who was unable to pass and he was not happy about it.</p>
        
            <p>"What the (expletive) is this idiot doing? Is he OK?" Perez said on the team radio.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an incident that was totally avoidable."</p>
        
            <p>It was a personal battle of sorts as Lawson, Perez and a couple of others are contending for a drive in the top Red Bull team next year.</p>
        
            <p>The two then clash again near the end of the race as Lawson returned to the track after a late pit stop claiming Perez was blocking him and the kiwi gave him the finger.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old may not have made too many friends on Monday but he certainly kept his name in the conversations post race.</p>
        
            <p>"I think our pace was strong but we just spent the whole race behind another car.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately in traffic we weren't able to overtake and it just hurt our race. We had the pace to score points but just wrong track position."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson felt the race would not have helped his prospects of securing a full time drive next year with Red Bull which he is tipped to do.</p>
        
            <p>"A race like today is not ideal for that, so I am focused on the next few races to try and recover and score points for the team."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson also had battles with Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton in the later part of the race and did not step aside easily to let them pass.</p>

            <p>Red Bull principal Christian Horner did not get drawn into the Lawson-Perez incident.</p>
        
            <p>"That's racing, we saw a lot of tough racing out there."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was the lone RB driver in the race after team-mate Yuki Tsonoda crashed out at the start.</p>
        
            <p>With a long first stint strategy with hard tyres, Lawson did climb as high as fourth as others pitted, but a coming together with Williams' driver Franco Colapinto in the closing stages meant he needed an extra pit stop to change the front wing.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson is probably frustrated with a car that cannot match the speed of the top four teams but more time and racing should help.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson won't want to get a reputation for the driving style he showed in Mexico, but it did show that he was prepared to fight for results and perhaps his in future in the sport.</p>
        
            <p>It's not always going to go his way, but he can bank this race and use the experience in Brazil next weekend.</p>
