            <p>The union for workers who lost their jobs when labour hire group ELE went into liquidation is holding a meeting this afternoon, to update dozens of jobless migrants on their plight.</p>
        
            <p>About 500 people lost their jobs and up to 24 Filipino migrant workers were left sleeping in their cars because they had no income to pay for rent.</p>
        
            <p>Red Aguhar came to New Zealand hoping to make money to send back to his family in the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>But the sudden collapse of ELE has left him worried about providing for them in addition to his own expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Aguhar's words were translated with the help of the Union Network of Migrants within FIRST Union.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a big blow and the first thing that comes to his mind is the rent, the repayment for his car and the money he'll take back home," translator Mikee Santos said.</p>
        
            <p>Without any income, Aguhar had to sleep in his car that he parked at a friend's place.</p>
        
            <p>"He uses the lounge and the toilets, but at the end of the day, at night-time he will come here and sleep in the car, it's very dire."</p>
        
            <p>Desperate for work, Aguhar hopes that when he finds it, he will be able to get a new visa, as his previous one was tied to his employer.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully if finally he gets a job and lodges his visa, hopefully Immigration New Zealand will expedite extremely fast to approve his visa and he can go back to employment."</p>
        
            <p>FIRST Union general secretary Dennis Maga said several workers were in the same situation as Aguhar.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of them travelled from Hamilton to Auckland just to see their friends and ask their friends if they can park their cars and sleep in the car."</p>
        
            <p>The union was talking to ELE's liquidator, Deloitte, to ensure the workers got a fair deal, Maga said.</p>
        
            <p>"We can continue to appeal for their claim and other entitlements because they need that money to pay for their rent and to pay for their food."</p>
        
            <p>He had also asked the Philippines embassy for assistance.</p>
        
            <p>"The Filipino embassy responded positively and I think they are now in communication with those workers ... and I heard that some of them have already received some funding from the embassy."</p>
        
            <p>Maga hoped this afternoon's meeting in Auckland would provide answers for the migrants who just wanted to get back to work.</p>
