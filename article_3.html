            <p>A popular restaurant in Auckland's Ponsonby, SPQR, is in liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>According to the companies register, SPQR Limited was placed in liquidation on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The Ponsonby Road eatery opened in 1992 and has been serving up modern Italian cuisine since.</p>
        
            <p>Co-liquidator Stephen Lawrence confirmed SPQR had been placed in voluntary liquidation and there were now five days for the liquidators to make a report.</p>
        
            <p>"The hospitality industry is struggling and has been since the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it's hard out there for people and when the dollar is tight, this sector suffers."</p>
        
            <p>Lawrence said overheads had increased for hospitality businesses and they faced higher costs for supplies.</p>
        
            <p>There has been no official statement on the closure from SPQR's owners yet.</p>
        
            <p>It comes weeks after Chapel Bar & Bistro, on the same road, went into receivership.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
