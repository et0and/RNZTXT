            <p>US tech billionaire Elon Musk gave a video address to a campaign rally of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party Saturday, his latest show of support ahead of the country's election next month.</p>
        
            <p>Musk told a gathering of thousands of AfD supporters in the eastern city of Halle that their party was "the best hope for the future of Germany".</p>
        
            <p>Musk has raised concern from some mainstream leaders who have accused him of interfering in European politics with comments on his social platform X about politicians in countries including Germany and Britain.</p>
        
            <p>He also drew criticism this week for making a public hand gesture that was seen by some as resembling a straight-armed Nazi salute.</p>
        
            <p>"The German people are really an ancient nation which goes back thousands of years," he said in Saturday's address.</p>
        
            <p>"I even read Julius Caesar was very impressed [by] the German tribes," he said, urging the supporters to "fight, fight, fight" for their country's future.</p>
        
            <p>He said the AfD wanted "more self-determination for Germany and for the countries in Europe and less from Brussels", a reference to European Union authorities.</p>
        
            <p>Musk is a close associate of US President Donald Trump, who has appointed him to head a new department of "government efficiency" in his administration.</p>
        
            <p>Like Trump, the AfD opposes immigration, denies climate change, rails against gender politics and has declared war on a political establishment and mainstream media it condemns as censorious.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of Germany's 23 February elections, it is polling at around 20 percent, a new record for a party that has already shattered a decades-old taboo against the far right in post-war Germany.</p>
        
            <p>The mainstream conservative grouping CDU/CSU leads on about 30 percent.</p>
