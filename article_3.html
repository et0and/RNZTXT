        <h2>Fast Favourites: The Aussie Office’s Edith Poor</h2>
        <p>
Edith Poor plays the straight-laced, 'front desk executive' and productivity manager Lizzie Moyle in Australia's new The Office, and talks to Culture 101. Audio
</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>It's one of the most popular shows of the 21st century and now, another iteration is taking place downunder. The Office is set in Australia with the first female boss - Hannah Howard, at a Sydney-based packaging company, played by actor and comedian Felicity Ward. </p>
        
            <p>The British version which first aired in 2001 was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Four years later, Steve Carrell took on the US version which ran for nine seasons. </p>
        
            <p>The Australian version has a cast of both Aussies and Kiwis, including Josh Thomson, Edith Poor and Jonny Brugh, and it's also co-directed by our own Jackie Van Beek. </p>
        
            <p>Edith Poor plays the straight-laced, 'front desk executive' and productivity manager Lizzie Moyle. An original fan of the first series, she describes it as "an honour" to be part of this cast. Dressed in oversized grey suits with a slicked-back ponytail, similar to Gareth and Dwight before her, who has a real love and respect for authority, and a deeply loyal attitude towards her boss. </p>

            <p>Poor describes the joy of playing such a "delicious" character and picking the dull drab wardrobe to go with her.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just so excited to give her oversized suits, no makeup." </p>
        
            <p>"When I did my audition, I dressed in my partner's work clothes, I didn't wash my hair so it would be greasy."</p>
        
            <p>But she said without makeup her natural "super pale eggshell" complexion did cause a few technical difficulties.</p>
        
            <p>"My skin colour is the same colour as the paint they had on the walls."</p>
        
            <p>"The cinematographer said 'we have to do something about Edith's face because she's disappearing'."  </p>
        
            <p>To keep the Aussie version fresh and creative under the shadow of the beloved UK and US shows, Poor said the team were given two weeks of rehearsal to "just play".</p>
        
            <p>That shook off a lot of the nerves of this big beast ... we got into this real play space where we could try out things, have a lot of fun."</p>
        
            <p>"It felt like we were creating our own thing."</p>

            <p>Speaking to Perlina Lau of Culture 101 as our 'Fast Favourites guest' she recommends Daughters on Netflix, a "devastatingly beautiful" documentary exploring the bonds between father and daughter strained by the US prison system.</p>
        
            <p>"They have a no-touch policy You can't really hold your child." </p>
        
            <p>The film follows four young girls who are given a chance to reconnect through a one-day dance as part of a fatherhood program.</p>
        
            <p>"Highly recommended. If you need a good cry, feel good about the world; just how beautiful children are, and these men are." </p>
        
            <p>For podcasts, she been listening to What Went Wrong which explores the great disasters and triumphs of the film industry.</p>
        
            <p>"When this first started this just looked at disastrous movies and has just gone into movies in general and now it's looked at some amazing films."</p>
        
            <p>"Largely the podcast just explores filmmaking and how films get off the ground... under the most insane circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>As for books, Poor she recommends Cuddy, by Benjamin Myers. An epic retelling of the story of the hermit Saint Cuthbert, the unofficial patron saint of the North of England.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a story that explores what it means to be alive, to have an affinity with animals, with nature, believe in something bigger than yourself.</p>
        
            <p>The Office is now streaming on Amazon Prime.
