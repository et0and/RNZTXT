            <p>A resident living in Portes de Fer, an area in the centre of Noumea, says it has been a terrifying experience to witness the chaos unfold in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>Hari Simon told RNZ Pacific the burning of business houses, car companies and factories downhill from where most of the residential houses were situated was "a very frightening scene punctuated by the sound of gunshots that broke the silence of the night'.</p>
        
            <p>Simon told RNZ Pacific the unrest, which began on Monday, has created insecurity for people and "a threatening sense of danger looming in the air".</p>
        
            <p>"That feeling and wariness grew even bigger over the next days, as the situation had gotten out of proportion and the control of local security officers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The nights were very scary, especially with people roaming the streets with weapons and firearms, burning down buildings and exchanging fire with police officers.</p>
        
            <p>"It was total chaos, and it was sad to see how a peaceful and serene city had turned into a complete war zone overnight."</p>
        
            <p>However, Simon said since the arrival of the first batch of military police officers (gendarmes) on Wednesday night, the situation seems to have died down a bit and people are starting to feel a bit more secure, especially at night, even though, a few places in Noumea continued to be burnt down (as of Friday night).</p>
        
            <p>Simon said Noumea residents did not expect the situation to escalate well before the bill on the voting rights would even be tabled by Parliament on Wednesday morning (New Caledonia time) in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The violent unrest ignited on Monday night and had quickly escalated overnight into the early hours of Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"It spread like wildfire over the days, and is still continuing until present but to a lesser scale," Simon said.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses, houses and schools have been burnt down and reduced to ashes, and five deaths have so far been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Simon said residents were completely caught off guard.</p>
        
            <p>"When we became fully aware of the gravity of the situation that Monday night and more specifically in the early hours of Tuesday morning, road blocks had already been erected.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the sudden gravity of the turmoil, business houses, schools and shops were advised to close down, all residents in the Southern Province had to remain within closed doors."</p>
