        <h2>Watch: 'Joyful' start to day as Orcas arrive in harbour</h2>
        <p>
Three orca whales have been swimming close to shore at Wellington's Oriental Bay.
</p>
        
            <p>A woman who saw three orca whales in Wellington harbour this morning says it was a joyful way to start the day.</p>
        
            <p>Miriam Ross said she was out for a run and at first thought the shapes in the water was a swimmer before realising it was three whales.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was really special that they surfaced so close to shore and she could get a good look along with some other runners and people passing by.</p>
        
            <p>"I was feeling really tired this morning and almost didn't go for my run but seeing the orca completely made my day and gave it a really joyful start."</p>
        
            <p>Ross said she felt lucky to live in Wellington where these incredible creatures are on her door step.</p>
        
            <p>"I really hope we can look after our oceans properly so we can see more of these beautiful creatures."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation website orcas were the most "widely distributed mammal on earth with the exception of humans".</p>
        
            <p>The species has a population of 150-200 in New Zealand waters.</p>
