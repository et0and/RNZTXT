            <p>The leaders of all Greenland's political parties on Friday denounced US President Donald Trump's vow to take over the Danish autonomous island.</p>
        
            <p>"We - all party leaders - cannot accept the repeated statements about annexation and control of Greenland," the leaders of Greenland's five Parliamentary parties said in a joint statement posted on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"We as party leaders find this behaviour unacceptable towards friends and allies in a defence alliance," they said, following an emergency meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The party leaders added that they "must emphasise that Greenland continues the work for Greenland that is already underway through diplomatic channels in accordance with international laws and regulations".</p>
        
            <p>"We all stand behind these efforts and strongly reject attempts to create division," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked by reporters in the White House Thursday about taking over the island, Trump said: "I think it will happen."</p>
        
            <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte who was meeting him at the time refused to be drawn.</p>

            <p>Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede responded by saying "enough is enough".</p>
        
            <p>"This time we need to toughen our rejection of Trump. People cannot continue to disrespect us," Egede wrote on Facebook on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Egede continues to lead Greenland while awaiting the formation of a new government after his party's defeat in elections on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The American president has once again evoked the idea of annexing us. I absolutely cannot accept that," he wrote, adding that he would convene the leaders of the territory's parties.</p>
        
            <p>Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen also pushed back Friday on Trump's latest remarks, saying the Danish autonomous island could not be taken over by another country.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at the NATO treaty, the UN charter or international law, Greenland is not open to annexation," Lokke told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>The top diplomat said: "I see no indication in the Greenland elections that people want to leave the kingdom to become Americans."</p>
        
            <p>Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of Greenland's election winning centre-right Democrats and likely future Greenlandic prime minister, also criticised Trump's statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Trump's statement from the US is inappropriate and just shows once again that we must stand together in such situations," Nielsen said in a post to Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>In his first stint as US president, Trump had evoked the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark - an idea rejected by both Copenhagen and Greenlanders.</p>
        
            <p>Since returning to power this year, Trump has stepped up his quest to acquire the territory, but in much more bellicose terms.</p>
        
            <p>Trump claims the US needs to own Greenland for its own security.</p>
        
            <p>According to polls, most Greenlanders support independence from Denmark but not annexation by Washington.</p>
