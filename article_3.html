            <p>Waka Kotahi is taking steps to remove an anti co-governance sign from the Appleby Highway, near Nelson, with councils working to remove other roadside signs in nearby districts.</p>
        
            <p>The Stop Co-Governance movement is led by Julian Batchelor, who defines co-governance as "code for the takeover of New Zealand by tribal companies and their representatives".</p>
        
            <p>The billboards with slogans like "All cultures are treated equally in New Zealand" and "Co-Governance? There is nothing to fearâ€¦ yeah, right" have been erected on roadsides around the top of the South Island and in many other parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Batchelor also claims co-governance is "the end of democracy" and "the installation of apartheid and separatism into everyday life, leading eventually to full-blown government by tribal rule".</p>
        
            <p>Top of the South system manager Rob Service said Waka Kotahi recently received a complaint about one of the Stop Co-Governance signs, located along State Highway 60.</p>
        
            <p>He said signs placed on the state highway corridor without written approval from Waka Kotahi, and in breach of its signs bylaw, were removed by contractors - which is what would happen to the sign in Appleby.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, for signs on private land, district plan rules and local bylaws applied.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman District Council said it had received a complaint about two Stop Co-Governance signs on Main Road, Hope. The signs did not comply with Tasman Resource Management Plan and the landowner had been directed to remove them, which they agreed to do.</p>
        
            <p>Another sign on the same property advertising a business had resource consent, so was permitted to remain.</p>
        
            <p>In the Tasman District, signs were allowed without a resource consent if they were advertising a land or building sale or lease, or for temporary community event (including an election) or fundraising event.</p>
        
            <p>The council spokesperson said it had no jurisdiction over the perceived offensive or defamatory nature of the signs, and complaints about their content should be referred to the police.</p>
        
            <p>The council had been approached about other signs in the district, but without addresses or street names, it could not enforce compliance.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough District Council said it had received two complaints about Stop Co-Governance signs that breached either the council's signage rules and/or Waka Kotahi's, and the landowners would also be asked to remove them.</p>
        
            <p>If they were not removed, the landowner would be issued an abatement notice; non-compliance could result in a $300 fine, or prosecution.</p>
