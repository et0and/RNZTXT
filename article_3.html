            <p>Kiwi Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson has apologised publicly to Sergio Perez after gesturing at the Red Bull driver during the Mexican Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>TV replays showed Lawson holding up his middle finger as he overtook Perez. The incident occurred after a collision between the pair on lap 19, causing damage to Perez's car.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson, 22, said he should not have gestured at Perez.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously one of those in the moment things. He spent half the lap blocking me trying to ruin my race," Lawson told reporters after the race.</p>
        
            <p>"I was upset, but it's not an excuse, I shouldn't have done it and I apologise for that."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson said the incident occurred as a result from the earlier collision.</p>
        
            <p>"I left the space into (turn) four, he was coming in very, very late.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I tried to give him space, he drove me off the track and then he didn't give me space into turn five. It's unfortunate, it wasn't my intention, but I didn't know where to go."</p>
        
            <p>The two are seen as rivals for a Red Bull seat next year. Perez, who is under pressure to keep his position after a disappointing season so far, was critical after the race about Lawson's attitude.</p>
        
            <p>"He was outside the track and just came straight like there was no car, I think he could have avoided the incident. Luckily I saw him and I opened room. Otherwise it would have been a massive crash.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no need. We damaged both of our races.''</p>

            <p>He also referenced a similar incident with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso at last week's US Grand Prix and also with Williams' Franco Colapinto later in the Mexican race, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>"He did the same with Fernando, with Franco in the end and there are no penalties, so none of his fault as well.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the way he has come to Formula One, I don't think he has the right attitude for it. He needs to be a bit more humble," Perez said.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull motorsport advisor Helmut Marko wasn't happy with Lawson's actions.</p>
        
            <p>"[It was] an unnecessary collision, where I see Lawson as being more to blame," he told broadcaster ORF.</p>
        
            <p>Autosport reported that when asked if it was good that Lawson got his elbows out, Marko replied: "If it had been someone else, yes. But not the sister team."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson accepted the criticism.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think that's what Helmut likes," he said. "It's not my character, not something you should be doing."</p>
