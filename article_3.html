            <p>One of the people of interest in the Baby Ru case has posted on social media a year after his death saying "sorry I couldn't save you".</p>
        
            <p>Rosie Morunga is one of three people of interest in the homicide investigation, including her partner Dylan Ross, and the child's mother, Storm Wall.</p>
        
            <p>The three were housemates and the only people in the house at the time Baby Ru received a massive blunt force trauma to his head.</p>
        
            <p>'Baby Ru', officially named Nga Reo Te Huatahi Reremoana Ahipene-Wall, died in Hutt Hospital just two days short of his second birthday on 22 October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday evening, Morunga posted on Instagram: "Missed dearly aunty is so sorry boy I couldn't save you. Aunty and uncle will get justice."</p>
        
            <p>She went on to post an image of a baby holding a woman's hand with the caption "one year and it won't get any easier".</p>
        
            <p>The stories were posted just before 10pm and features the song 'Pretty Eyes' by Zehdi in the first story while the second includes 'Ocean' by Martin Garrix.</p>
        
            <p>There are yet to be any charges over the death of the toddler while six full-time investigators remain working on the case.</p>
        
            <p>He suffered violent injuries after his skull was fractured.</p>

            <p>At the time, police said the toddler died from blunt force trauma to the head either from a hard surface or object.</p>
        
            <p>In September, Morunga was sentenced to 18 months in prison on unrelated charges, including theft and assault.</p>
        
            <p>One assault was towards a journalist who was punched multiple times outside court during an earlier appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Weeks after Baby Ru's death, his mother and Morunga both posted on their social media accounts maintaining their innocence.</p>
        
            <p>Wall has since spoken to Stuff repeating that claim and she knows who did it.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, police are still on the hunt for a hard drive used to record CCTV footage from the house.</p>
        
            <p>They say vital evidence was removed from the house.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, police told RNZ the three persons of interest had all spoken to police and offered "varying degrees of cooperation".</p>
        
            <p>"Some things that have been said to police are inconsistent in terms of what the police have established in terms of evidence and facts," Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"So the door is still open. We would like whoever is responsible for this to come forward and tell us exactly what happened."</p>
