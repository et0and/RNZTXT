            <p>Police are laying a fourth charge against former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman, who had her first court appearance for alleged shoplifting delayed again.</p>
        
            <p>The former lawyer was due to appear in the Auckland District Court on Wednesday morning to face three shoplifting charges for nearly $10,000 worth of goods she allegedly took from two boutique stores.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the Auckland District Court registry confirmed Ghahraman's first appearance had been pushed back to 20 March, following an earlier adjournment in January after a third shoplifting charge emerged.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's lawyer Annabel Cresswell confirmed to the Herald police were laying a new charge against her client.</p>
        
            <p>Cresswell said it was a standard adjournment for when a new charge was laid.</p>
        
            <p>Police were considering diversion and other issues that were considered at this early stage in the court process, she explained.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald has yet to obtain details of a fourth charge.</p>
        
            <p>Details from court documents for the first three charges show the 43-year-old is accused of stealing $2060 of clothing from Scotties Boutique in Auckland's Ponsonby on 21 December, and $7223 worth of clothing from the same store two days later last year.</p>
        
            <p>Both of the Auckland charges carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman is also charged with stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx store on 22 October last year. That charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison.</p>

            <p>The total value of items she is alleged to have shoplifted is $9978.</p>
        
            <p>In an earlier statement, Ghahraman, who resigned from Parliament in January, apologised for her behaviour and said she did not excuse her actions.</p>
        
            <p>She cited "extreme stress" and linked it to previously unrecognised trauma. She said she was seeking help from mental health professionals.</p>
        
            <p>In her statement, Ghahraman said the stress had led her to act in ways that were "completely out of character.</p>
        
            <p>"I am not trying to excuse my actions, but I do want to explain them.</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma.</p>
        
            <p>"People should, rightly, expect the highest standards of behaviour from their elected representatives. I fell short. I'm sorry. It's not a behaviour I can explain because it's not rational in any way, and after medical evaluation, I understand I'm not well.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a great honour to serve as a Member of Parliament. I am proud of my advocacy work on human rights and foreign affairs, and particularly proud of campaigns that resulted in practical improvements to the electoral laws governing donations and overseas voting."</p>
