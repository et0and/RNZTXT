        <h2>Russia says dozens of drones fired at Moscow ahead of crucial talks between US and Ukraine</h2>
        <p>
Russia says dozens of drones were launched at Moscow in what it says are "enemy" attacks, using its preferred euphemism for Ukraine, hours ahead of critical talks between US and Ukrainian officials.

            <p>Russia says dozens of drones were launched at Moscow on Tuesday in what it says are "enemy" attacks, using its preferred euphemism for Ukraine, hours ahead of critical talks between US and Ukrainian officials.</p>
        
            <p>If confirmed, the attacks would represent one of the largest on Moscow since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Russian officials said one person was killed and three wounded in the Moscow region after at least 69 drones were destroyed while flying toward the city, according to state-run news agency TASS.</p>
        
            <p>Falling debris also damaged buildings, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin posted on Telegram, according to TASS,</p>
        
            <p>The reported attacks forced two Moscow airports to close for safety reasons, as well as two airports east of the city, Reuters reported, citing Russia's aviation watchdog.</p>
        
            <p>It comes ahead of talks scheduled between United States and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security adviser Mike Waltz are slated to meet the Ukrainian national security adviser, foreign minister and defence minister.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the meeting, Rubio said the US wanted to hear what concessions Ukraine would be willing to make in negotiations to end the war with Russia, and that the talks could determine whether Washington resumes providing military aid and full intelligence sharing with Kyiv.</p>
        
            <p>CNN previously reported that the US is still sharing intelligence with Ukraine that can help its troops defend themselves but has "scaled back" sharing details that could be used for offensive targeting of Russian forces, according to two US defence officials.</p>
        
            <p>Fighting on the ground has intensified in recent weeks as the US-Ukraine relationship has soured, following the shouting match between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.</p>
        
            <p>Russia launched a major aerial assault on Ukraine last Friday and Saturday that killed more than two dozen people, according to Ukrainian authorities; another series of attacks killed six more civilians from Sunday to Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine's presence in Russia's Kursk region is also shrinking sharply, with the Russian advance threatening Kyiv's sole territorial bargaining counter at a crucial time in the war.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine's reported attack on Moscow Tuesday appeared to be larger than its previous largest assault on the Russian capital last November.</p>
        
            <p>Russia said it downed 34 Ukrainian drones during that attack, which injured a woman, forced the temporary closure of airspace and caused two houses to catch fire.</p>
        
            <p>Last September, Russia said it destroyed at least 20 Ukrainian drones near Moscow in an attack that killed at least one person and forced airport closures in the capital.</p>
