            <p>The government is ramping up the transition to a new science system, with major shake-ups now due to happen this year, and an 11th-hour reprieve for parts of Callaghan Innovation.</p>
        
            <p>The changes are part of the government's overhaul of the science sector which will see Crown Research Institutes merge into new Public Research Organisations (PROs) and Crown-owned entity, Callaghan Innovation, disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>Callaghan scientists facing redundancy said they had been left in the lurch by the changes, highlighting the gap between losing funding mid-year and the original 12-18 months signalled for the PROs to be formed.</p>
        
            <p>But in an announcement on Wednesday, Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Shane Reti said he expected the new organisations to be up-and-running by October this year, with formal legislation to follow in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>"Moving quickly to establish these new organisations that align with Government's priorities of driving economic growth will make sure these organisations are better placed to deliver excellent science."</p>
        
            <p>Reti said funding would also temporarily be extended to parts of Callaghan Innovation signalled to be axed by 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>He said in addition to the functions already confirmed for transfer to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) or a PRO, funding for the applied technologies group would continue for another three months, and for the biotechnologies group until June 2027.</p>
        
            <p>"The temporary extension of funding is intended to make for a smoother transition for clients and greater certainty for Callaghan Innovation's scientists."</p>
        
            <p>The funding extension for Applied Technologies would allow contracted work to be delivered and a "more orderly wind down" over the coming months, he said.</p>
        
            <p>In response, the Public Service Association said it was "good news that Dr Shane Reti has seen the ridiculousness" of stopping funding to Callaghan's biotechnology teams.</p>
        
            <p>National secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said the move would keep expertise in New Zealand and save about 40 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said about 30 staff in applied technologies still had no home to go to when their funding ceased in September.</p>
        
            <p>Fitzsimons criticised the government's approach as "clumsy from the get-go" but said the announcement that PROs would be set up by October would give current Crown researchers some certainty about their futures.</p>
