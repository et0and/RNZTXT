            <p>Business leaders want to see quick changes from the new government, including scrapping fair pay agreements and allowing 90 day staff trials.</p>
        
            <p>Business NZ chief executive Kirk Hope said some fair pay agreements had not been put into place and should be ditched.</p>
        
            <p>"They're probably not going to help workers in any meaningful way," Hope said.</p>
        
            <p>"Why would you put that sort of rigidity in the labour market, when New Zealand needs to nimble and competitive - more so than ever before."</p>
        
            <p>However, Council of Trade Unions president Richard Wagstaff said it would be a "backward step" to remove the work standards included in the fair pay agreements.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is an easy place to do business, but it's so easy that we have workers being really undermined and not paid properly.</p>
        
            <p>"These fair pay agreements, that was about providing a minimum for the sorts of essential workers we all depend on - bus drivers, cleaners, supermarket workers - and making life harder for those people is not the answer to the challenges that we face," Wagstaff said.</p>
        
            <p>While those workers receive the minimum wage, the fair pay agreements included improvements to health and safety, hours of work and minimum staffing levels, Wagstaff said.</p>
        
            <p>Hope said 90 day trials for employees in businesses with more than 20 staff had not led to significant exploitation of workers and helped businesses hire more staff.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if unemployment rises to 5.5 percent, as it's anticipated doing, that's still an incredibly tight labour market," Hope said.</p>
        
            <p>"These 90 day trials enable businesses to take a risk with people who might not necessarily have the skills and give them a shot. And if they can't, the business doesn't have to go through an extremely expensive process."</p>
        
            <p>However, Wagstaff said 90 day trials increased insecurity for new workers, without making any difference to the unemployment rate.</p>
        
            <p>Hope supported the new government's plans to give the Reserve Bank a sole focus on inflation, but Wagstaff was scathing about the move.</p>
        
            <p>"Where do people fit into the priorities? It would seem cash in the economy is a higher priority than people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We think a balanced mandate, having both social and economic imperatives was very helpful. The Reserve Bank did work with those two mandates well.</p>
        
            <p>"Putting profit ahead of people is not the way to go when they're running the Reserve Bank."</p>
        
            <p>The new government did not seem to care about making people unemployed, which was "disappointing", Wagstaff said.</p>
        
            <p>"This government is excited about putting tens of thousands of public servants on the dole queue.</p>
        
            <p>"And they want to change the Reserve Bank Act to make unemployment a lesser issue - for them it's not an issue.</p>
        
            <p>"It reveals a lot about the character of the new government to do these kinds of things," he said.</p>
