            <p>KiwiRail is looking into whether it is possible to extend the life of the Interislander's Kaitaki ferry.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaitaki is the oldest ship in the Interislander fleet and has been the subject of several breakdowns.</p>
        
            <p>Its most notable incident was on 28 January when the ship was sailing into Wellington Harbour where it lost power with more than 880 people on board - resulting in it drifting to towards the South Coast.</p>
        
            <p>It regained limited power and made its way to port, allowing its passengers to safely come ashore.</p>
        
            <p>During post-hearing questions, following KiwiRail's annual review hearing, it was stated that international risk management company DNV (Det Norske Veritas) has been conducting a review of KiwiRail's fleet management practices.</p>
        
            <p>It also states that DNV has been requested to submit a proposal to carry out further work on a life extension of the Kaitaki.</p>
        
            <p>The KiwiRail Board will review this for approval.</p>
        
            <p>Decisions to complete life extension reports for the remaining two ships in the fleet will be made following an appraisal of the Kaitaki proposal.</p>
        
            <p>In December, the government pulled the plug on the Inter-Island Resilient Connection (iReX) project after KiwiRail requested an additional $1.47 billion in funding.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal would have seen two brand new ferries built, and new Interislander terminals constructed in Wellington and Picton.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail has been approached for further details.</p>
