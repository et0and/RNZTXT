            <p>Wellington City Council have decided to not go ahead with the $32 million Reading Cinemas deal.</p>
        
            <p>Senior council staff have not been able to reach "the best possible outcomes for Wellingtonians" in negotiations with the company.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau said the outcome was "disappointing, but the right one".</p>
        
            <p>A press release said Whanau and elected members voted last year in favour of council staff undertaking due-diligence and negotiating the $32m deal that would see a refurbishment of the building, including earthquake strengthening.</p>
        
            <p>The building has been closed since 2019 due to its quake risk.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Barbara McKerrow said staff had worked "extremely hard and endured great pressure in a bid to negotiate an arrangement with Reading".</p>
        
            <p>"We always signalled that we would halt negotiations if we were not able to reach a formal agreement in a timely manner. We've reached that stage."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said she hoped Reading would look at the cinema site as holding great potential for redevelopment.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be heartbreaking for the site to sit unused for too long so I urge Reading to continue to explore development deals."</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said she was elected with a mandate to create a vibrant city centre and revamping the Courtenay Precinct was part of that.</p>
        
            <p>"I've said many times that I supported officers to find a creative and innovative solution about what to do with the Reading building.</p>
        
            <p>"However, I want to be very clear that this was never a done deal."</p>
