        <h2>Calculated risk: Will the next Reserve Bank governor relax capital requirements for banks?</h2>
        <p>
Since 2022, banks have been required to hold enough equity to be able to survive a one-in-200-year event.

            <p>Adrian Orr has so far not spoken about the reasons for his recent and unexpected resignation as Reserve Bank governor, but the sudden departure caused understandable speculation.</p>
        
            <p>One suggestion has been that Orr was at odds with the government over his requirement that the Australian-owned New Zealand banks hold high levels of capital compared to other countries.</p>
        
            <p>Whether this was indeed a reason for Orr's resignation we can't say. But it does raise important questions about Reserve Bank - and government - policies.</p>
        
            <p>Set by the Reserve Bank, capital requirements specify the amount of equity banks need to have to cover future losses.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2022, banks have been required to hold enough equity to be able to survive a one-in-200-year event.</p>
        
            <p>But holding onto this much capital is expensive for banks. The higher requirements have led to higher interest rates - making it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow.</p>
        
            <p>The government has long criticised the current capital requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Last August, Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she was open to making the Reserve Bank ease its regulation of banks - if a strong enough case could be made that it would improve competition and efficiency without undermining the stability of the financial system.</p>

            <p>The 2022 capital requirements meant the "big four" banks (ANZ, Westpac, ASB and BNZ) had to increase equity from 10.5 percent to 18 percent of their risk-weighted assets over the next seven years. Smaller banks had to increase their equity to 16 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The new requirements were met with some resistance. This was due, in part, to concerns about how the move would affect bank customers.</p>
        
            <p>To meet higher capital requirements, banks focused on lending that generated higher returns. They also charged higher interest rates to compensate for the increased levels of capital required for the loans.</p>
        
            <p>Financial analytics company S&P Global described the rules as the toughest bank capital requirements in the world and noted the risk of reduced access to credit, particularly for smaller businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Even before Orr's resignation, members of the coalition government had called for changes to the capital requirements.</p>
        
            <p>In January, ACT leader David Seymour sought information from the Ministry for Regulation on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has said going back to the former levels of bank capital would support economic growth by enabling more lending to business at more affordable interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>In its study on the banking sector, the Commerce Commission also suggested revising bank capital requirements to address competition issues.</p>
        
            <p>The 2022 capital requirements have influenced the type of lending banks do and the interest rates they have applied.</p>
        
            <p>The more capital banks have to hold against a loan, the higher the interest rate required to cover that cost. This means home loans are more expensive under the current rules.</p>
        
            <p>If the requirements reduced (and nothing else changes) home loan interest rates would reduce.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, other types of lending - such as business loans - would become more attractive if capital requirements drop and banks have to have less equity on hand.</p>
        
            <p>With a limited pool of funds available to lend, this may mean banks make fewer home loans and more personal and business loans.</p>
        
            <p>In the end, there is no guarantee a new Reserve Bank governor will reduce the capital requirements. And, under the current rules, the governor is the one who gets to make that call.</p>
        
            <p>While the government has some say in the appointment process, the Reserve Bank board is responsible for recommending the next appointee.</p>
        
            <p>Whoever finally takes the post will have to weigh up the benefits of any rule changes with the potential risks - including what the uncertainty of frequent rule changes do to the wider economy.</p>
        
            <p>They will also need to take into account why Orr pushed for the higher capital requirements to begin with.</p>
        
            <p>He worried that in the event of a global financial disaster, the four major Australian-owned banks might abandon New Zealand customers.</p>
        
            <p>Having the higher levels of capital forced the banks to have a greater financial cushion against losses and reduced the risk of bank failure. And ultimately, no government wants a bank to fail, with the personal and economic costs that would entail.</p>
