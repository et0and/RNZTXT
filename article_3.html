            <p>All Blacks coach Scott Robertson said his side showed their most astute game management since he took charge at the start of this year in Friday's clinical 23-13 win over world number one side Ireland at the Aviva Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand travelled with plenty to prove in their November tour after a disappointing maiden Rugby Championship for Robertson, where the once notoriously strong finishers managed just one score in the last quarter in each of their six games.</p>
        
            <p>They put the Irish away in the final 20 minutes on Friday after trailing briefly in the second half and Robertson agreed when asked if the performance was the most astute the All Blacks had put together over 80 minutes this year.</p>
        
            <p>"As I've said before, every game we could have won this year. We can still be better too but there were a couple of key moments that swung the momentum back our way that has sometimes gone the other way," Robertson told media.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really pleased. I'm pleased because we showed so much courage and care on both sides of the ball and it was just a classic test match."</p>
        
            <p>The former New Zealand back row highlighted some "incredible defensive sets" and his side's ability to capitalise when Ireland's discipline let them down in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>He also praised Damian McKenzie, who kicked all except for five of New Zealand's points on his return to flyhalf after Beauden Barrett missed out due to a concussion.</p>
        
            <p>"DMac was mercurial as normal. You know, he trusted his instinct, and it was a hell of a night for him. Great off the boot and just really pleased," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>The victory ended Ireland's 19-game unbeaten streak at home and was New Zealand's second in a row over the back-to-back Six Nations champions since their series defeat to Andy Farrell's men on home soil in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>After narrowly beating England last week, captain Scott Barrett said improvements were needed at the breakdown ahead of another big clash in France next week.</p>
        
            <p>"They were really targeting us, particularly on our ball. At times our body height was a little bit high and they were able to disrupt so I guess it's on us and that's probably the first thing to address next week," he said.</p>
