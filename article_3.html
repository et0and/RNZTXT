            <p>England took charge of the first test against New Zealand on Saturday, riding Harry Brook's 171 to a first-innings lead of 151 before reducing the Black Caps to 62 for two at tea on day three in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand openers Tom Latham and Devon Conway departed cheaply, leaving Kane Williamson, who scored his 9,000th test run on his way to an unbeaten 26 at the break, and Rachin Ravindra (23 not out) at the crease still 89 runs in arrears.</p>
        
            <p>Five dropped catches helped Brook to his match-turning tally and skipper Ben Stokes also benefited from a few as he provided the glue for a series of partnerships that pushed the visitors to 499 in response to New Zealand's 348.</p>
