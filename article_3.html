            <p>Analysis - On YouTube there's a clip where popular football content creators Chris Dixon and Theo Baker take 100 pot-shots at goal. From the century of volleys and knuckleballs only six make it past the young goalkeeper - who flings himself around the goalmouth like a fevered feline, each save more impressive than the other.</p>
        
            <p>You should watch it, an astonishing 13 million other people have and it would be a timely reminder for Wellington Phoenix fans of the talent their current incumbent possesses:</p>
        
            <p>Josh Oluwayemi was on the books at Tottenham Hotspur when that video was uploaded in November 2021. Now, he is at the beginning of his Wellington Phoenix career, doing his utmost to suture the wound Alex Paulsen's departure and subsequent A-League return with new rivals Auckland FC created. This weekend he inadvertently poured salt into it.</p>
        
            <p>The London-raised Nigerian stopper's error deep into the weekend's historic first all-Kiwi A-League derby proved pivotal - as Jake Brimmer chipped home a woeful attempted pass - the first of a brace in a famous 2-0 win for the newbies.</p>
        
            <p>Based on the Phoenix philosophy under head coach Giancarlo Italiano, Oluwayemi was always going to make a mistake like this at some point this season. He has already had Yellow Fever hearts palpitating with his ice cool approach with the ball at his feet but the backfire came at the worst possible time. Not only did it cost his team a defeat, but it was against their upstart rivals with Paulsen maintaining a shut-out at the other end. If Oluwayemi was hoping fans would not be longing for their ex, this was the wrong stage for such a mishap.</p>

            <p>So what next? It's simple really, Wellington Phoenix need to back their 23-year-old goalie. Chiefy is clearly a fan and encourages playing out from the back. He's obviously seen enough to believe Oluwayemi is the best man for that job. The 'Nix are, after all, using a visa slot on him and only extended his contract by a year last week.</p>
        
            <p>He's still young and inexperienced at the professional level. A handful of games for English Football League side Portsmouth and Finnish outfit FC Lahti aside, this is Oluwayemi's first big chance to establish himself as a number one. But if the Phoenix believe playing out from the goalkeeper is the winning philosophy in minute one, that shouldn't change by minute 90. This time around the gamble did not pay off and the consequences were magnified by the occasion and opponent.</p>
        
            <p>So it was surprising to see club captain Alex Rufer be so publicly critical in the immediate post-match interview. By all means, once in the sheds, the captain can rage. But in front of the cameras? In front of the mic? Surely an error Rufer will realise in hindsight.</p>
        
            <p>Right now, Oluwayemi needs his team and staff to back him. If not, then the chasm created by his weekend opposite number will only become starker.</p>
        
            <p>In other football news:</p>
        
            <p>Amid the fervour of Kiwi-lasico it was easy to miss that Wellington Phoenix also got their A-League Women's campaign underway at the weekend. Unfortunately, keeper errors must be contagious in the capital, as Carolina Vilão chucked one in amid a 4-2 loss to Western United.</p>
        
            <p>What a start to the season it has been for New Zealand captain Chris Wood. He scored yet again this weekend, in a 3-0 triumph over West Ham United. That's eight league goals now for Wood and Forest are thriving - sitting third in the table.</p>

            <p>Liverpool have taken the early advantage in the Premier League title picture after Manchester City and Arsenal both lost at the weekend. For City, it was a first defeat in 32 league games. No signs of a post-Jurgen Klopp hangover at Anfield, as Liverpool go two points clear.</p>
        
            <p>Manchester United finally had mercy on the ailing Erik ten Hag and gave their struggling manager the boot last week. Quick-fast, they appointed the mercurially minded Ruben Amorim from Sporting in Portugal. Time will tell if he finally has the tonic to return glory to Old Trafford, which played host to an entertaining 1-1 draw with Chelsea.</p>
