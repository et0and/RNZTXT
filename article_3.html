            <p>White Ferns opening batter Georgia Plimmer is on the road to recovery following an injury that has kept her out of the game for the last six weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old Plimmer, who was one of the stars of the White Ferns World Cup success, has been sidelined with a stress fracture in her hip.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington player formed a solid opening partnership with Suzie Bates during the World Cup which played a big part in their historic victory.</p>
        
            <p>Her rehabilitation meant she needed to stay of her feet.</p>
        
            <p>"I now know how hard it is not being able to use your feet and going to the supermarket and that sort of stuff which was a bit annoying," Plimmer told RNZ .</p>
        
            <p>However she is now walking freely.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm into swimming and biking and trying to build back the strength in my legs which I lost during six weeks of doing nothing."</p>
        
            <p>Doing nothing and not playing domestic cricket did allow her to enjoy the festive season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit strange, every summer it's pretty much go-go-go with cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"A positive is that past summers I haven't been able to see friends and family as much or be able to enjoy the summer, so it has actually been nice to spend time with them."</p>
        
            <p>Of course Plimmer had hoped to continue to World Cup form into the New Zealand summer, but that was cut short by the injury.</p>

            <p>She missed the start of the domestic competition, the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield competition as well as the Rose Bowl series against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really excited getting into this home summer especially in the 50-over cricket because I still feel there is a lot for me to get better in that format.</p>
        
            <p>"But I can now empathize with those people I know who have had injuries and how frustrating it is.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully this is early in my career and if I can get it right then it won't come back. No surgery has meant it has only been weeks rather than months, which is good."</p>
        
            <p>Plimmer hasn't been completely removed from cricket. She helped carry the water bottles for the Wellington Blaze while she was on holiday in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>However training with them again is still some way off. She is expected to miss all of the Super Smash but is set to return to the HBJ competition in February with Sri Lanka and Australia touring New Zealand in March.</p>
        
            <p>Being sidelined has meant she has been on to the fore following their World Cup triumph.</p>
        
            <p>"We came off so much cricket and a lot of success so I guess I'm the only one that has really had enough time to sit back and reflect on how amazing that experience was.</p>
        
            <p>"Still being around the game I've had so many people come up to me and talk about how big that was...perhaps a silver lining to the injury.</p>
