            <p>A homicide investigation is under way after a man was found dead in a park in Massey West Auckland park overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called to Royal Reserve park in the suburb of Massey at 12.10am.</p>
        
            <p>They were responding to reports of a person found unresponsive, who was later pronounced dead at the scene by ambulance staff.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Aaron Proctor of Waitematā CIB said a 26-year-old man was arrested on Monday morning and would appear in Waitākere District Court later in the day charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this will have been a shock to the community, however we would like to reassure them this appears to be an isolated incident.</p>
        
            <p>"An increased police presence will remain in the area while we complete our scene examination, which will likely conclude tomorrow," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tragic incident and we are ensuring there is support in place for those closest to the victim."</p>
        
            <p>Police were not in a position to release details of the deceased at this stage, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to make enquiries, but also want to encourage anyone with information to get in contact with us. Even the smallest detail could bring justice for the deceased."</p>
        
            <p>Police would like to hear from anyone who was in Royal Reserve park or the wider area, including in and around Reverie Place.</p>
