            <p>Latrell Mitchell is facing a minimum of three weeks on the sidelines after being charged with dangerous contact in South Sydney's loss to the Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell appeared to extend his elbow into the head of Warriors star Shaun Johnson as the halfback attempted to tackle the Rabbitoh.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell was also cautioned for a lifting tackle on Tohu Harris.</p>
        
            <p>Penrith great Greg Alexander said in commentary that the act against Johnson was "blatant", later adding: "I don't know what goes through Latrell's mind at times in a game."</p>
        
            <p>South Sydney coach Jason Demetriou shared his displeasure after the match.</p>
        
            <p>"They're both just stupid things," Demetriou said in his post-match press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"He's just got to be better. Simple as that.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have conversations through the week. As a group we'll be honest, as we do every week."</p>
        
            <p>South Sydney currently sits on the bottom of the table with one win from five matches.</p>
