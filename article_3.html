            <p>The Manu World Championship finals are being held in Auckland today with organisers expecting thousands of spectators.</p>
        
            <p>The event where people dive bomb into the water is being held at Karanga Plaza and the Tidal Stairs at the Viaduct on Saturday from 9am until 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>Organiser Scott Rice told RNZ's Saturday Mornings he expected the crown to be taken out by a North Island bomber.</p>
        
            <p>"Whangārei and the Waikato are really good, we've certainly got some in Hastings, around Hastings, actually I need to give a nod to Nelson, they had some really good talent."</p>
        
            <p>There was a lot of technique involved in the perfect manu, Rice said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's getting the right jump off the platform...the nice flight on the way down to the water and then hitting the water with your rear-end first and your arms and legs raised in a V and then collapsing in the water to explode the water upwards."</p>
        
            <p>Ten qualifying events were held in eight cities around the country ahead of the finals today. A hundred finalists were expected to compete Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"There's plenty of stand outs it's going to be such a great day."</p>
        
            <p>Rice said there were different styles of dive bombs. The competition has a freestyle and traditional category.</p>
        
            <p>"On the water we've got a hundred finalists from around the country and the crowd should be pretty big, I'd say we have thousands and thousands and thousands of people here," Rice said.</p>
