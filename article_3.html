            <p>The bus stop where a teenager was fatally stabbed has seen trouble before, despite being near a police station.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been some incidents there, and I know that the regional council had upped its security presence, both on buses and around the bus hub," Dunedin MP Rachel Brooking told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>She had thought any violence there had decreased.</p>
        
            <p>Brooking said it was "unbelievable ... and totally unexpected" especially since the attack happened at a bus stop right across the road from the police station.</p>
        
            <p>The bus hub caters to students and youth from all over the city.</p>
        
            <p>A 16-year-old boy from Trinity Catholic College was attacked on Great King Street shortly after 3pm on Thursday. He was rushed to hospital but died later from his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Another teenager has been arrested and will appear in court on Friday.</p>

            <p>"We are devastated that a young life so full of energy and promise has ended in such a senseless and horrific way, and our hearts go out to his whƒÅnau," Trinity Catholic College principal Kate Nicholson said.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin mayor Jules Radich said the area had had "relatively minor trouble in the past", but after talking to students, councils had increased security patrols through a private company.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an absolute tragedy and my heart goes out to the family of this young man," Radich told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"I was certainly surprised that we've had an incident such as this."</p>
        
            <p>It was a busy street with a lot of buses and commuters, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very concerned about this bus hub," he said, despite a recent report saying the situation had improved.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin stabbing is just the latest in a run of violent incidents at bus and train stations in the past few months.</p>
        
            <p>In the West Auckland suburb of New Lynn, two 13-year-olds were set upon by a group of up to 20 other teens at a bus station.</p>
        
            <p>Similar attacks had been reported at the Henderson and Albany transport hubs, also in Auckland.</p>
