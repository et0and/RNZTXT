            <p>Wellington artisan ice cream business Wooden Spoon Freezery is the city's latest hospitality casualty.</p>
        
            <p>The award-winning boutique ice creamery, which has been operating out of premises in Miramar, announced on Wednesday that it had been "suddenly and unexpectedly" been asked to leave its premises.</p>
        
            <p>Co-founder Sharon Galeon told RNZ that the business' landlord didn't want to renew their lease.</p>
        
            <p>Since it was "incredibly challenging" to find a suitable and MPI-compliant place to run a dairy manufacturing business at short notice and without a costly fit-out, she and co-founder Midori Willoughby had made the tough decision to dramatically cut production.</p>
        
            <p>Wooden Spoon will stop producing the 500ml tubs and ice cream sandwiches currently sold nationwide, Galeon said. Instead, they are going to share a facility with another business and limit themselves to supplying 'scoop shops' at three Wellington New World supermarkets, as well as supplying custom flavours for trade and private functions.</p>
        
            <p>Galeon said rising costs had also influenced their decision.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost of everything to do with running this business has gone up so much. We've seen our costs rise 20-30 per cent for nearly everything from ingredients to transport to packaging and more."</p>
        
            <p>Wooden Spoon Freezery started out in 2011 as a craft ice cream "membership service" that Galeon and Willoughby initially hand-delivered to customers around Wellington. A year later, they were supplying high-end food stores like Wellington's Moore Wilsons and Auckland's Farro Fresh. In 2019, their Blackcurrant Crunch ice cream was named Supreme Champion at the 2019 Outstanding NZ Food Producer Awards.</p>
        
            <p>Galeon said their decision to limit production was influenced more by the lack of suitable premises than economic issues, but said that as a "hospitality-adjacent" business they were not immune to the troubles being suffered by others in the industry, particularly in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really sad, I really hope Wellington can come back from this. We've always been about supporting local, so it's really hard to watch.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish the government would do more to help."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, long-standing Wellington bakery Pandoro announced it was shutting its three city shops, along with restaurant Egmont St Eatery and florist Yvette Edwards. Last month, the owner of Wellington caf√© Sweet Release told RNZ the business had suffered its worst sales day ever in a decade.</p>
