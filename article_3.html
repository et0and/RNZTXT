            <p>A beach dig for clues into the disappearance of Gisborne father Joseph Ahuriri has failed to yield any clues, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The father of eight was attempting to head to Gisborne from Napier as Cyclone Gabrielle hit the region in February last year.</p>
        
            <p>He was last seen at the Waitomo fuel stop in Bay View, Napier, on 14 February 2023.</p>
        
            <p>This week police have been searching the Bay View area focusing on an area of beach at the mouth of Esk River, just off North Shore Road.</p>
        
            <p>Officers and specialist search teams used an excavator to move around 2000 cubic metres of sand.</p>

            <p>Detective Sergeant Alex Simister said the result of the search had been "disappointing".</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, we have not been able to locate Joseph or any items of interest in relation to his disappearance."</p>
        
            <p>He said police had been committed to finding Ahuriri since his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to acknowledge the resilience of his family throughout this operation.</p>
        
            <p>"They were present at the river throughout the search and were obviously hopeful for some form of resolution."</p>
        
            <p>Simister said police would continue to search for answers.</p>
