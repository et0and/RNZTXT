            <p>A Gloriavale leader has made a public apology to the community's many victims for the historic abuse they suffered.</p>
        
            <p>In July last year, the Royal Commission of Inquiry into historic Abuse in Care requested Gloriavale apologise to its members.</p>
        
            <p>Overseeing Shepherd Howard Temple delivered an apology to the community on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>He said the church acknowledged abuse happened within the church between 1950 and 1999.</p>
        
            <p>The church's members were entitled to a safe and supportive environment, and Howard Temple said it failed to provide that.</p>
        
            <p>He said Gloriavale would listen to victims and support them to heal and receive redress.</p>
