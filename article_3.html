            <p>Controversial religious leader Brian Tamaki and his Destiny Church are being sued for defamation by two drag performers in the High Court in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Event and entertainment company Haus of Flash are suing the group for just over $2 million, after numerous alleged attacks by the church on their Rainbow Storytime drag-queen events.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki has posted frequently on social media targeting drag performers, accusing them of child grooming.</p>
        
            <p>One of the performers behind Haus of Flash, Sunita Torrance, said she hope the legal action would encourage others feeling targeted to speak up.</p>
        
            <p>She goes by the stage name Coco Flash, and performs story reading session at public libraries and centres with her co-star Daniel Lockett, named Erika Flash.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking outside the High Court in Auckland on Thursday, with her lawyer Christopher Griggs, Torrance said she would be suing Tamaki, the church's trustees, and a number of pastors for inducing breach of contract, conspiracy to injure, unlawful means conspiracy, and defamation.</p>
        
            <p>"As performers, we dress up in colourful outfits, entertain, and read magical stories to children and their parents, and promote a message of kindness, anti-bullying, and inclusion to all people," Torrance said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were in great demand, and were always very popular with our audiences."</p>
        
            <p>Torrance said Tamaki and members of Destiny Church had launched a crusade against them and their act, leading them to cancel shows.</p>
        
            <p>"It's badly been impacting my business."</p>
        
            <p>She said Christianity and religion were not bad, but that people should be wary of who they followed.</p>
        
            <p>"In your heart of hearts, you know that Christianity does not believe in hating other people, and hoping that people don't exist," Torrance said.</p>
        
            <p>Torrance and Lockett allege that Tamaki referred to the pair as "an underground satanic movement to deconstruct civil society, to deliberately eliminate the whole foundations of Christianity", in a sermon delivered earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>"I, for a very long time, have been labelled with all sorts of things that aren't true," Torrance said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"The emotional toll has also been the threats, the publishing of my home address all over the internet and my own safety."</p>
        
            <p>Torrance said they will be crowd funding and fundraising for legal fees.</p>
        
            <p>They have had support both locally and from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Destiny Church has been before the courts already this year, with members charged for painting over rainbow crossings in Gisborne and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki also announced his plans to sue the councils of Auckland, Wellington, Gisborne, Rotorua and Hastings over what he calls a "misappropriation of ratepayers' money" for rainbow initiatives.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Destiny Church released a media statement on behalf of Tamaki, in which he said he and the church had not been formally served with any papers relating to the claim.</p>
        
            <p>"Without proper legal notification, it would be premature for us to comment on specific allegations or details surrounding this matter," Tamaki said, adding they were not afraid of a potential court case.</p>
        
            <p>He accused the New Zealand Herald of promoting crowdfunding for the drag queens to mount their legal case, exposing "the woke media bias we have in New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>He said the church would continue to advocate for the wellbeing of children.</p>
