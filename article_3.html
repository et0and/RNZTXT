            <p>The mighty workhorses of the Royal New Zealand Air Force are set to retire after 60 years in service.</p>
        
            <p>From Antarctic rescues to combat zones to crocodile relocations, the fleet had clocked up 155,000 hours of flight time and 100,000 landings since they came into service in 1965.</p>
        
            <p>The fleet of five C-130H Hercules will cease use on Friday.</p>

            <p>In a statement, the Defence Force said it had marked the occasion with flypasts over Northland and the central North Island, and more were planned over the South Island on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Four of the aircraft would then retire to RNZAF base in Woodbourne, and the fifth would go to the Air Force Museum at Wigram.</p>

            <p>Chief of Air Force, Air Vice-Marshal Darryn Webb, said it was the unique tasks that got talked about the most.</p>
        
            <p>There had been midwinter Antarctic rescues in -35°C temperatures, disaster response missions across the Indo-Pacific, short-notice evacuation tasks like Kabul in 2021, and operations in many combat zones.</p>

            <p>These planes carried out the recovery of victims from Mt Erebus aircraft disaster in Antarctica, and loaded 120 people out of Banda Aceh after the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami where one survivor brought his pet monkey.</p>
        
            <p>"There was air dropping a bulldozer to the remote Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific, moving crocodiles and an elephant to wildlife reserves, and my own personal experience of a live and very unhappy pig as a gift from Bougainville Islanders," Webb said.</p>

            <p>In 2020, the government announced the ageing fleet would be replaced by five new C-130J-30 Hercules. The last of the new aircraft arrived in December.</p>
        
            <p>Over the years, the aircraft received a number of upgrades, with the most recent being a Life Extension Programme in 2005 involving an extensive avionics upgrade of the flight deck and structural refurbishment, upon which the aircraft were re-designated the C-130H(NZ).</p>
