            <p>Invercargill councillors have not held back in their assessment of Mayor Nobby Clark's use of racially charged language, with one saying she was "absolutely disgusted".</p>
        
            <p>In March 2023, Clark made headlines for his use of the 'n-word' at an Art Foundation event.</p>
        
            <p>He defended himself at the time by saying he was using provocative language to "make people think".</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the incident was revisited in an episode of satirical news show New Zealand Today, which saw host Guy Williams travel to Invercargill to speak with Clark.</p>
        
            <p>An unrepentant Clark said he disliked the use of the word, while proceeding to repeat it.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Ria Bond said people should be feeling let down by the mayor's behaviour, which had left her feeling "absolutely disgusted".</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely shocking that someone in his position as a city leader should think that he has the power to get away with calling members of society such a foul word," Bond said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know in history what that word has done to people of colour, how it made them feel like they are not contributing members of society.</p>
        
            <p>"He has the personality type where he thinks he's quite within his rights to do that."</p>
        
            <p>Bond said Clark did not have her support.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Ian Pottinger described the interview as a "train wreck", and expected better from the mayor.</p>
        
            <p>"You just don't go there, you don't go there at all. There's no way out of it. You can have your own personal views, but you keep it very private.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a well known fact, you can't justify the use [of that word]."</p>
        
            <p>Mana whenua representative Pania Coote said she had not seen the show, but was disappointed by the mayor's use of the 'n-word'.</p>
        
            <p>Coote said she expected professionalism from someone holding the leadership position of mayor.</p>
        
            <p>"It sets us back 50 years if that type of behaviour continues."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Darren Ludlow said he had fielded a couple of phone calls on Thursday night from people upset about the the show.</p>
        
            <p>But he felt the mayor's television appearance was no different to how some might have felt watching previous mayor Sir Tim Shadbolt.</p>
        
            <p>Ludlow said there was a "context" to Clark's original use of the word, but he personally would not have "gone down that track".</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Tom Campbell said he was "surprised and disappointed" to hear the mayor repeat the words on the show.</p>
        
            <p>"The first time it was in a debate about artistic licence, but this time its use was frivolous."</p>
        
            <p>Others did not feel so strongly about the mayor's behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Peter Kett would not be drawn on the use of the language, saying it was a "rubbishy programme", while councillor Barry Stewart said he did not watch the programme and had no issue with the mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Steve Broad said he had not watched the programme but was aware of some of the content covered.</p>
        
            <p>He said he would watch it on the weekend with interest and an open mind.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was contacted for comment but did not respond.</p>
