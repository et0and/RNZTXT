        <h2>Kate's cancer the latest bombshell in royal family's year of woe</h2>
        <p>
Three cancer diagnoses and a shock death have rocked the Windsors in what some are describing as the darkest period for the family in years.

            <p>When the Princess of Wales announced she was undergoing treatment for cancer, it was just the latest bombshell to hit the royal family in the last few months.</p>
        
            <p>Two other royals - King Charles and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York - have been diagnosed with cancer since the beginning of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The family was also hit hard by the sudden death of a young member, Thomas Kingston, in February.</p>
        
            <p>In her video message disclosing her cancer, Kate described the last couple of months as being "incredibly tough" for the entire family.</p>
        
            <p>Royal commentators have described 2024 as the Windsors' darkest period since the late Queen's self-described "annus horribilus" of 1992. In that year, three of her four children either divorced or separated from their spouses and a fire badly damaged Windsor Castle.</p>
        
            <p>Here is a timeline that encapsulates the royals' year of woe so far.</p>
        
            <p>17 January: Princess Catherine is admitted to hospital for "planned abdominal surgery". In a statement, a spokesperson says she is expected to be in hospital for 10 to 14 days, before returning home to continue her recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter."</p>
        
            <p>The Princess apologises for postponing her upcoming engagements and says she looks forward to "reinstating as many as possible, as soon as possible".</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson says the surgery is not cancer-related.</p>
        
            <p>18 January: Buckingham Palace announces King Charles is to be treated for an enlarged prostate.</p>
        
            <p>The condition is benign but he will undergo a "corrective procedure", a spokesperson says.</p>
        
            <p>Prostate enlargement - which is non-cancerous - is common among men over 50 and is not usually a serious condition, according to the NHS.</p>
        
            <p>The palace says the 75-year-old's public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.</p>

            <p>22 January: Sarah, Duchess of York, announces she has been diagnosed with malignant melanoma.</p>
        
            <p>It was discovered during treatment for breast cancer, which in turn had been diagnosed in June 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Her dermatologist asked that several moles were removed and analysed at the same time as the duchess was undergoing reconstructive surgery following her mastectomy, and one of these has been identified as cancerous," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"She is undergoing further investigations to ensure that this has been caught in the early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"Clearly, another diagnosis so soon after treatment for breast cancer has been distressing but the duchess remains in good spirits."</p>
        
            <p>26 January: Charles is admitted to hospital for prostate treatment.</p>
        
            <p>30 January: Both Kate and Charles are discharged from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A statement posted on behalf of the Princess of Wales says she will continue her recovery from home.</p>

            <p>"She is making good progress."</p>
        
            <p>The statement thanks the hospital staff for their care, as well as the public for their well wishes.</p>
        
            <p>6 February: In a shock announcement, King Charles says he has been diagnosed with cancer.</p>

            <p>It was discovered during his prostate procedure, but is a "separate issue of concern", a statement says.</p>
        
            <p>Charles commences regular treatment that same day and will not be carrying out public-facing duties while that treatment is ongoing, the statement says.</p>
        
            <p>"His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.</p>
        
            <p>"He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible."</p>

            <p>25 February: Thomas Kingston, the son-in-law of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, is found dead at home in Gloucestershire.</p>
        
            <p>The death is being treated as a suspected suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Kingston, 45, was married to Lady Gabriella Windsor, who is Charles' second cousin.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Buckingham Palace says the King and Queen are mourning "a much-loved member of the family".</p>
        
            <p>27 February: Prince William misses a service of thanksgiving in Windsor for his late godfather King Constantine of Greece, citing "personal matters".</p>
        
            <p>William had been scheduled to do a reading at the service for Constantine, who died in 2023.</p>

            <p>It is later revealed that William pulled out of the service due to his wife's cancer diagnosis, which was issued around this time.</p>
        
            <p>12 March: William leads the royal mourners at the funeral of Thomas Kingston. He is farewelled in a private family service at the Chapel Royal, followed by a reception at St James's Palace.</p>
        
            <p>Charles is unable to attend the service due to his cancer treatment, but sends his "most heartfelt thoughts and prayers" to Kingston's family.</p>
        
            <p>23 March: Kate announces she has cancer and is undergoing preventative chemotherapy.</p>

            <p>She says when she underwent surgery, it was thought her condition was non-cancerous.</p>
        
            <p>"However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"This of course came as a huge shock."</p>
        
            <p>She says she and William had delayed announcing the news to give them time to explain the situation to their children and "reassure them that I am going to be OK".</p>
        
            <p>She asks for time, space and privacy to complete her treatment and "focus on making a full recovery".</p>
        
            <p>No new date is given for her expected return to work.</p>
