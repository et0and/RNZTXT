            <p>Auckland and Wellington commuters and long weekend visitors are being warned both city's trains will shut down because the tracks and stations are closing for maintenance and upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport is replacing all trains with buses from late Friday evening until Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>AT said its partners, including KiwiRail, will be carrying out essential work in preparation for the City Rail Link (CRL) underground metro which is due to open in early 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Buses will also be replacing trains in the Wellington region over Labour weekend.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail and Greater Wellington are midway through a major project aimed at providing faster and more frequent commuter train services into the city.</p>
        
            <p>The project is expected to significantly increase capacity, reliability, and give commuters more choice around travel times, along with new hybrid electric trains on the Wairarapa and Manawatu lines.</p>
        
            <p>The work scheduled for Labour weekend is a critical part of the project to replace 90-year-old signalling infrastructure at Wellington Station with a new computer-based system.</p>
        
            <p>The new system is expected to allow for more train movements in and out of the station by early 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Buses are replacing all services on the Johnsonville, Kapiti and Wairarapa lines, and on the Hutt Valley Line between Wellington and Petone.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland residents are no stranger to disrupted train services, after full and partial track closures earlier this year due to heat restrictions work replacing track foundations.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend, work includes upgrading Henderson Station, where a third platform and additional tracks will be built to enable more frequent and reliable train services ahead of CRL.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail's City Rail Link programme director Bevan Assink said the station upgrade would allow more trains through the station and enable some trains to turn around while keeping two tracks available for other trains travelling further west.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been carrying out a decade's worth of work in just three to four years - to prepare the network for the faster, more frequent trains that City Rail Link will bring to Aucklanders in 2026."</p>
        
            <p>AT's director of public transport and active modes Stacey van der Putten said weekday train services will typically run as normal while Henderson Station is being upgraded.</p>
        
            <p>"Major construction works are planned to take place while the rail network is closed during the Christmas period and long weekends in 2025. There'll be replacement buses running during these times, so Aucklanders still have reliable public transport options," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that disruption to services is frustrating. We know that Aucklanders want a frequent and reliable train service and we're working hard to bring new levels of service and reliability that Aucklanders can be proud of in 2026."</p>
        
            <p>Other modifications to Henderson Station include the construction of a new emergency exit bridge at the southern end of the station, upgrades to the track layout, overhead lines and signalling equipment, improving the track drainage system, and adding a new staff space.</p>
        
            <p>All of the lifts and escalators at Henderson Station will be replaced, as they have reached the end of their serviceable life.</p>
        
            <p>Construction upgrading the Henderson Station is expected to be complete early 2026.</p>
