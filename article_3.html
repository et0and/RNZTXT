            <p>Poor weather in parts of Aotearoa have caused delays to 12 Air New Zealand flights and three cancellations.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand flight operations head Captain Hugh Pearce said problems began this morning with flights cancelled due to low cloud and visibility in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>Customers whose flights were cancelled have been rebooked on extra flights which have been put on or the next available service, Pearce said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to thank customers for their patience and understanding while we work through this weather disruption."</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain has poured down on parts of the north and central North Island on Sunday.</p>
