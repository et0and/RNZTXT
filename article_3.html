            <p>Fundraising to get the body of a man killed on Wellington's Courtenay Place back to his home country has surpassed $22,000.</p>
        
            <p>The head of the Funeral Directors Association (FDA) says it was not just about money, though - the process was an administrative "minefield".</p>
        
            <p>While some government agencies do offer financial assistance for funeral-related costs, the criteria were narrow, and many in New Zealand turned to internet fundraisers for help.</p>
        
            <p>Luke Smith - a 21-year-old from South Africa - died after his life-support was withdrawn following an assault in Wellington's entertainment strip in the early hours of 6 October.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with RNZ, his mother Natasha Smith said her family had been sold a false dream about New Zealand and demanded the government pay for her son's, and her family's, return to South Africa for the funeral.</p>
        
            <p>She said the family could never have prepared for the emotional, nor the financial, burden of repatriating their son.</p>
        
            <p>FDA chief executive Gillian Boyes said she could not speak to the specific case, but the cost of repatriation - to or from New Zealand - could vary wildly. She said the starting point was about $10,000 and typically increased with distance.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest part of the cost is usually the airline cost - and this depends on the weight of the casket."</p>
        
            <p>She said countries such as South Africa had stringent requirements for transporting a casket.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from airfares, the remaining costs were for the funeral director's time, Boyes said, adding that funeral directors were helpful guides through what was a complicated process.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're in this unfortunate situation, talk to your funeral director because it is a minefield."</p>
        
            <p>There was also associated paperwork, including a certified copy of death, locally issued burial or transit permit, embalmer's affidavit, non-contagious disease letter and copies of identity documents.</p>
        
            <p>"Anecdotally, I've heard that [funeral directors] often end up spending a lot more time on it than what they charge for, just because this is such an awful and traumatic situation for a family. They do all the work for you, so at least the pain of that side of it is reduced."</p>
        
            <p>Boyes said the most common countries for repatriating a deceased loved-on, to or from New Zealand, were the Pacific Islands and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>According to the latest Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) figures, the estimated cost of repatriation from across the ditch ranged from about $7000 to $12,000 depending on the state.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, repatriation from Fiji was estimated at up to $10,000 and it could cost upwards of $12,000 from the Cook Islands, Samoa, or Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT said any assistance for a South African national would be provided by the South African High Commission. The commission confirmed it had been in contact with Smith's family to "offer its condolences and assistance with the administrative aspects" of repatriation.</p>
        
            <p>Boyes said with regard to South Africa, the airfares would be significant.</p>
        
            <p>"The airfares for just the transfer of a body are about $8500-$9000. But of course there will be airfares for family going back as well - an additional cost that we sometimes don't think about."</p>
        
            <p>While government assistance for funeral-related costs was available, the eligibility criteria were narrow.</p>
        
            <p>In cases where a death had resulted from injury, including an assault, Accident Compensation Corporation's (ACC) funeral grant - up to $7793 - could help the family with a broad range of expenses, from burial plots to preparation or transportation of a body.</p>
        
            <p>If the death were the result of a crime - murder or manslaughter - ACC said families could be eligible for a top-up to the funeral grant from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), taking the total available to $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>The Victim Assistance Scheme - administered by Victim Support on behalf of MOJ - also offered support to victims and families for a range of services, including grants of up to $7500 for funeral-related costs, 30 hours of counselling services and allowances to attend court.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understood applications to ACC and MOJ were made on behalf of Smith's family, with the family confirming they had received some financial support from the government.</p>
        
            <p>A friend of Smith's family said there had been an outpouring of support for his parents in the week since his death.</p>
        
            <p>The Blackhouse - an online space dedicated to the African diaspora - said people were still shaken from the recent events, but many turned out for the 21-year-old's memorial in Upper Hutt on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Flowers, candles, and messages of support, still remain outside Reading Cinema from a vigil that followed.</p>
        
            <p>"People are in shock, but they came to comfort his mum and dad. Everyone was just pulling together in support of them. They don't have any extended family here. They were alone, but now they know they're not alone any more."</p>
        
            <p>Parents Brian and Natasha Smith - who moved to Aotearoa less than a year ago - said they appreciated any contributions to help get their son back to Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>By Tuesday afternoon, a Givealittle page for the family had reached $22,681.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed this week that Smith's body had been released to his family, and their investigation was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now confident we have spoken to most people who would have information that could assist with our enquiries, including the specific two women we were hoping to locate."</p>
        
            <p>However, police asked that anyone with information who had not yet spoken to them get in touch, either online or by calling 105, using the reference number 241006/5414.</p>
        
            <p>A 29-year-old man has been charged with reckless disregard, with police indicating more charges could follow. He was due to reappear in court next week.</p>
