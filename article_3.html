            <p>Members of the rainbow community and supporters have gathered in Auckland's Albert Park this afternoon to stand in solidarity against Destiny Church demonstrations targeting pride events last week.</p>
        
            <p>Members of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church "Man Up" group disrupted pride events in Auckland last Saturday, which prompted a number of calls to have its charitable status revoked.</p>
