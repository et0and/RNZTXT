            <p>Police have seized "multiple" motorbikes from gang members who travelled to a tangi.</p>
        
            <p>The tangi, for a Waikato-based gang member, was held at a marae in the town of Paeroaon Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A contingent of gang members travelled there on Tuesday morning from across Waikato, Auckland and Bay of Plenty, Inspector Will Lougrin said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, police set up checkpoints and conducted "high-visibility patrols", with support from the police Eagle helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of motorbikes and vehicles were seized from gang members and infringements issued," Loughrin said.</p>

            <p>Police's expectations had been made very clear, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have zero tolerance for any anti-social, unlawful, or driving-related offending.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will continue to take enforcement action where offending is identified.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone in the community has the right to be safe and feel safe."</p>
        
            <p>Loughrin asked anyone who saw any unlawful behaviour to report it to police on 111 if it was happening or 105 after the fact.</p>
