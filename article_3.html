            <p>Sought after A-League defender Dan Hall has signed with Auckland FC after winning multiple titles with the only other professional side he has played for.</p>
        
            <p>The centre back joins from Central Coast Mariners where he was an integral part of the club's recent treble winning season.</p>
        
            <p>Melbourne-born Hall will become Auckland FC's defensive rock ahead of a debut A-League season that kicks off in October.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Steve Corica said the 25-year-old would "slot right into defence".</p>
        
            <p>"There were quite a few clubs vying for Dan's signature. He's an outstanding player, but he really brought into what we're aiming to achieve here and the future pathways the club can offer thanks to Bill Foley's multi-club network.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got a lot of experience and won a few trophies, so will likely act as a bit of a leader for some of the other lads at the club, particularly the younger scholarship players."</p>
        
            <p>Hall was with the Mariners since turning professional in 2020. In that time he played approximately 90 times for the club, 37 last season alone, including every minute of the triumphant three-game A-League Men's Finals Series.</p>
        
            <p>Hall said he was eager to join Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland FC has a huge amount to offer; the pathways, the potential, and the chance to be part of a debut season. It's too good to turn down to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm grateful to the team at Central Coast, they are a great club and I've been there my whole career. But it was time for a change, to test myself somewhere new and take the next step."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC start pre-season this week with more player announcements to come.</p>
