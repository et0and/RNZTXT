        <h2>Indian community gearing up for Diwali festivities</h2>
        <p>
Tens of thousands are poised to descend on the Auckland CBD to enjoy a 3D projection, sumptuous food stalls and artwork by local Indian artists at the country's largest celebration.
</p>
        
            <p>The nine-day Navratri Festival, in which worshippers celebrate the Hindu warrior goddess Durga, concluded over the weekend, marking the halfway point of an Indian festive season that spans nearly two months.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, Durga Puja celebrations commemorating the goddess' victory over the demon king Mahishasura were organized by the Probasee Bengalee Association of New Zealand and Dishari NZ, while, in Christchurch, the Bangaliana Multicultural group led festivities.</p>
        
            <p>The Gujarati community worshipped the mother goddess with traditional garba dancing at the Mahatma Gandhi Centre in Eden Terrace and the Swaminarayan Temple complex in Papatoetoe.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, one of the year's largest Garba Dandiya Nights was held on 4 and 5 October at Auckland's Eventfinda Stadium, hosted by the North Shore Indian Association. Similar festivities took place in Hamilton, Tauranga and Christchurch.</p>

            <p>The community also celebrated Dussehra, or Dashain in Nepal, on 11 October to mark the symbolic victory of the Hindu god Ram over the demon Ravan.</p>
        
            <p>Dashain celebrations were organized by the New Zealand Nepal Society on 5 October in Auckland, and by the Hare Krishna Society on 12 October, where a traditional effigy of Ravan was burned at the group's Kumeu premises to signify the triumph of good over evil.</p>
        
            <p>Similar celebrations have been held in Christchurch by the Telugu Association South Island and Canterbury Nepalese Society over the past two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian community across the country are now gearing up for Diwali festivities, with the biggest celebration - BNZ Auckland Diwali Festival - set to return to Aotea Square and Queen St on 19 and 20 October.</p>
        
            <p>This year's festivities will include a new 3D projection show, classic Bollywood movies and lightbox art exhibitions by local Indian artists.</p>
        
            <p>"It's full of highlights this year," said Duane Wichman-Evans, festival director at Tātaki Auckland Unlimited.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to do a 3D projection onto the iconic Town Hall starting Monday, October 14. It's Indian-inspired and will showcase beautiful rangoli patterns and scenery from India."</p>

            <p>The festival attracted more than 65,000 attendees last year.</p>
        
            <p>This year, organizers have expanded the festival's footprint to include Lorne St, the Central City Library and Event Cinemas.</p>
        
            <p>Since its inception in 2002, the Auckland festival in the CBD has been a vibrant showcase of traditional and contemporary music and dance, along with stalls offering food and crafts.</p>
        
            <p>Wichman-Evans said the Harbour Bridge would be lit up to mark the occasion.</p>
        
            <p>He said showcasing Indian culture was a priority when planning this year's festival.</p>
        
            <p>"Diversity was something important to us because we know that a samosa from the west is very different from the east, north and south, so we tried to be very inclusive this year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wichman-Evans said attendees would have an opportunity to see many regions of India represented both on stage and at food stalls.</p>
        
            <p>One of the festival's three stages will exclusively host classical Indian dance and music performances.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, two forums - Indian Cooking Made Easy and The Young Entrepreneurs of Auckland - will be held at the Aotea Centre in addition to an art exhibition titled Colour of Diwali.</p>
        
            <p>A lightbox art exhibition titled Om Namah Shivay will be held on Bledisloe Lane, featuring artists Tiffany Singh and Jessie Kanji.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a multidisciplinary sensorial experience," Kanji said.</p>
        
            <p>"With this series of works, we are trying to offer viewers an experience of India, especially Diwali, which is the festival of light, but also India's vibrant colours."</p>
        
            <p>Kanji believed community festivals such as Diwali should become platforms for Indian and South Asian artists to showcase their work.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it empowers artists, and I think it gives us space to grow," she said.</p>

            <p>Other regions across New Zealand are also preparing to celebrate Diwali, with events planned throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>In West Auckland, the Waitakere Indian Association will host its Diwali celebration at Trusts Arena in Henderson on 20 October.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's Diwali Festival will return to the capital on 27 October at TSB Arena and Shed 6, while Christchurch will mark the occasion with a celebration hosted by the Indian Social and Cultural Club at Hagley Park on 26 October.</p>
        
            <p>In the Waikato region, the Indian Cultural Society will hold its Diwali Mela at Innes Common, Hamilton Lake, on 2 November.</p>
        
            <p>That same day, Rotorua will host a Diwali event at Gandhi Hall.</p>
        
            <p>A week later, Selwyn's Indian community will come together for a Diwali celebration at Lincoln Domain on 9 November.</p>
        
            <p>Wichman-Evans said he was looking forward to the festival and hoped it would showcase Auckland's vibrant Indian community and culture.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be full of lights and fun with over 1800 performers, 250 performances, three stages and amazing Indian food. We've got yoga, 3D projections, workshops in the library, classic movies and exhibitions and more," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be fantastic."</p>
