        <h2>Record migration might expose economic 'cracks'</h2>
        <p>
The highest number of departures ever has been recorded and there's a warning from economists.

            <p>A record number of New Zealanders left the country in the year to April, which one economist says risks "exposing the cracks" in the economy.</p>
        
            <p>Data from Stats NZ shows while migrant arrivals rose 25 percent, 56,000 New Zealand citizens left in the year to April - the highest number on record, and well ahead of the previous record of 44,000 in February 2012.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ chief economist Mike Jones said it reflected the weakness in the economy and labour market relative to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been expecting those flows to pick up for a while. If you line up our labour market and job market against Australia, it's clear you're going to see more people leave."</p>
        
            <p>He said that increase in people leaving would drive down the rate of population growth that had been recorded due to record immigration in recent years.,</p>
        
            <p>"We know that when net migration and population growth was booming, it was papering over a number of cracks in the economy. We're now seeing those net inflows fall and there's a high chance those cracks are going to be exposed over the remainder of the year."</p>
        
            <p>He said that would put more pressure on the retail sector, where sales were already weak.</p>
        
            <p>And the pace of rent increases might slow, keeping energy out of the housing market.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a confronting thing to see in terms of outflows. It's simply a reflection of Australia's noticeably stronger labour market."</p>
        
            <p>Kelly Eckhold, chief economist at Westpac, said there was a narrative that New Zealand was losing skilled people and gaining unskilled migrants, but he was not convinced that was the case.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the people coming are coming on work visas where there is a skills requirement, they have to be paid a margin over the minimum wage. That in itself should mean the people coming in have a skillset and are ultimately adding something to the economy."</p>

            <p>He said there was a clear trend and forecasts of unemployment in New Zealand compared to Australia would not indicate a turnaround in that for the foreseeable future.</p>
        
            <p>Eric Crampton, chief economist at the NZ Initiative, said Australia usually had higher unemployment than New Zealand - but the reverse was currently true.</p>
        
            <p>"Wages and employment prospects will always partially drive migration decisions. Over the longer-term you might need to worry that Australia's Reserve Bank will have to do more to keep fighting inflation than New Zealand's will, which will soften the Australian labour market.</p>
        
            <p>"But you might also worry that Treasury expects low productivity growth for New Zealand, and that will have its own depressing effect on wages, over time."</p>
