            <p>Jai Opetaia has retained his IBF and The Ring cruiserweight world titles, knocking out David Nyika in the fourth round.</p>
        
            <p>Opetaia knocked the challenger Nyika down with a brutal uppercut then, moments later, backed it up with three thunderous shots with his challenger on the ropes to end the fight.</p>
        
            <p>It was a vicious knockout, as brutal as it gets, as Opetaia landed a right, then two staggering lefts as the challenger dangled precariously.</p>

            <p>Nyika was down for several, scary minutes as medical staff rushed to ringside and the Gold Coast held its breath.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika gradually got to his feet before being helped back to his dressing room by his team, having suffered his first career defeat.</p>
        
            <p>Opetaia, although hurt in the third round by a game and enthusiastic Nyika, looks almost unstoppable.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old instantly called out WBO and WBA champion Gilberto Ram√≠rez to unify the division.</p>
        
            <p>In the co-main event, Justis Huni won his 12th-straight fight with a second round KO victory over Shaun Potgieter to retain his IBF Pan-Pacific and WBO Global heavyweight titles.</p>
        
            <p>On the undercard, Australia's Paris Olympian Teremoana Teremoana earned a spectacular knockout victory, battering Osasu Otobo to the deck inside a minute in their heavyweight contest.</p>
        
            <p>Teremoana planted a powerful shot on the top of Otobo's head and the big German could not beat the count.</p>
        
            <p>The heavyweight prospect has plenty of people interested in his future prospects, not least Eddie Hearn who said it was "time to get excited" about the 26-year-old, praising him as a future world champion.</p>
        
            <p>There was also a win for Australian Ben Mahoney against Fan Zhang, who claimed a shut out to win the IBF Pan-Pacific super welterweight title by unanimous decision, a match punctuated by a brief power outage caused by a lightning strike.</p>
        
            <p>Brisbane prospect Max McIntyre then knocked out Abdulselam Saman to win the IBF youth super middleweight title.</p>
