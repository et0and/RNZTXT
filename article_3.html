            <p>Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka has denied the new-look Waitangi Tribunal is a 'whitewash' as suggested by Te Pāti Māori'.</p>
        
            <p>The minister appointed eight new members to the tribunal, removing some well-known Māori academics.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer criticised the removal as a "whitewash".</p>
        
            <p>Potaka told Morning Report, Te Pāti Māori's comments were "unhelpful" and undermined the knowledge and experience of the new appointees.</p>
        
            <p>The new appointees included Philip Crump, who is a board member of NZ On Air, author Rex Edward Hale, councillor Grant Hadfield, former minister of defence Ron Mark and former Labour minister and Act Party leader Richard Prebble.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the existing members of the tribunal were not reappointed, including Professor Rawinia Higgins, Professor Tom Roa, and Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer told Morning Report, Crump, Hadfield and Prebble were Pakeha men who were unfit for the role.</p>
        
            <p>Prebble was leader of the ACT party in 1996 and called for the Waitangi Tribunal to be immediately abolished which ended treaty claims being heard after the year 2000.</p>
        
            <p>"There are tangata tiriti who are absolutely fit for purpose who would be really great to be having on this, who have a balanced view, but what Tama has gone and allowed to happen is an imbalanced view from those who have no respect or regard to Te Tiriti, to the breaches, to what it is Iwi are enduring to try and bring peace into Aotearoa," Ngarewa-Packer said.</p>
        
            <p>When asked what expertise certain appointees, such as Crump, brought to the tribunal, Potaka noted he was a "seasoned" litigator and each appointee had a range of experiences, skills and knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>He said despite Prebble's past, he has become more informed and changed his views overtime.</p>
        
            <p>"We were looking for a refresh. We are very comfortable with the quality, calibre and experience of the appointees.</p>
        
            <p>Five members - Dr Ruakere Hond, Derek Fox, Kim Ngarimu, Dr Hana O'Regan and Professor Sir Pou Temara were reappointed.</p>

            <p>Potaka said those not reappointed had not done anything wrong and it was "nonsense" to think so, but some members had served for multiple terms and it was not a life-term appointment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to go through each person," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"We are bringing a diversity of knowledge and experience," Potaka said of the new appointees.</p>
        
            <p>"Whitewash is an unhelpful term and in my view it is deliberately unhelpful and radicalises opinion."</p>
