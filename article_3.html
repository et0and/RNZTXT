            <p>A New Zealand chocolate touted as being 'so good it doesn't taste vegan' has been crowned Supreme Champion at this year's Outstanding Food Producer Awards.</p>
        
            <p>Mind Your Temper's Black Forest Bonbon is a plant-based chocolate made with coconut milk. The flavour is among a range of vegan chocolates available, thanks to Christchurch chocolatier and pastry chef Nel Vincencio.</p>
        
            <p>Vincencio said people "become suspicious and expect it won't taste good" when they learn the chocolates are vegan or plant-based, but clearly the Outstanding Food Producer Award judges were not discouraged.</p>
        
            <p>
Nel Vincencio received a total of 13 medals including six golds at the awards.

            <p>The Black Forest Bonbon was said to have "perfect gloss and shine" and "outstanding developed flavour". Alongside the title of Supreme Champion, it was also deemed Bonbon Champion.</p>
        
            <p>The honours are among a haul of 13 medals for the dessert-maker, of which six are gold medals, and were chosen from more than 355 entries from food and drink producers across the motu.</p>
        
            <p>For Vincencio, they are relatively early successes, as the Filipino-born chocolatier only established his Christchurch business in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Awards Head Judge Lauraine Jacobs said it was exciting judging the range of entries.</p>
        
            <p>"After eight years ... producers have even more imagination and show more innovation in presentation and taste as they develop new food ideas.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always a danger that new ideas can be over the top - but this year there was plenty to stimulate the palate without making really good, natural food too over-spiced and processed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also pleasing to note there's still a place for both tiny operators alongside the major food producers to stock our pantries and stores."</p>
        
            <p>Additional winners include Charlie's Gelato, Matangi Angus Beef, Six Barrel Soda, Wild Child Ferments, Akaroa King Salmon, Opito Bay Salt and many more.</p>
