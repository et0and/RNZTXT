            <p>A 56-year-old man has been remanded in custody on Tuesday afternoon after a 15-hour stand off at a Nelson home that saw police and Defence Force resources deployed from across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The man is facing eight charges including kidnapping using a firearm, threatening to kill, unlawfully detaining two people, possessing a weapon, contravening a protection order and intent to intimidate.</p>
        
            <p>He did not seek bail or enter pleas on any of the charges.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Jo Rielly granted the man interim name suppression and remanded him in custody.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was an arguable case that naming he man could cause extreme hardship to a number of people closely connected to him.</p>
        
            <p>The man was arrested shortly before 2am on Tuesday at a house in Motueka Street, more than 15 hours after police were called to a family harm incident about 10.15am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman district commander Superintendent Tracey Thompson said four people were in the house at the time, and the surrounding streets were cordoned off while police negotiated with the man inside.</p>
        
            <p>Two left uninjured on Monday, though Thompson said one was transported to hospital to be examined.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said the other person inside the house was safe and uninjured following the man's arrest.</p>
        
            <p>Several schools and nearby Nelson Hospital were put into lockdown during the ongoing police operation. Armed police were visible at intersections surrounding the area, as police worked to negotiate with the man.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said "significant" police resource, including staff from Wellington and Canterbury and a negotiation team, were deployed in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal team was also on-site during the stand-off situation in Nelson, as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this was a distressing incident for those involved, and those victims are being offered ongoing support," Thompson said.</p>
        
            <p>Those inside the home were reported to be safe and uninjured and were being offered ongoing support.</p>
