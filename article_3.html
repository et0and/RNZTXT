            <p>Strong wind warnings and watches are in place for eastern parts of both the north and south islands, with severe gales possible.</p>
        
            <p>A thunderstorm watch has also been issued.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued wind warnings for Wellington and coastal Wairarapa, as well as the Kaikōura Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A strong wind watch is in place for Hawke's Bay, south of Hastings and the Tararua District.</p>
        
            <p>The watch for Hawke's Bay is in place until 7pm on Monday night with the possibility of westerly winds approaching severe gales in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington and Wairarapa's orange warning is in place from 3pm until 6pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said sever gales could gust to 120km/h in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>There would be damage to trees, powerlines and unsecured structures. Driving could be difficult, especially for high-sided vehicles and motorbikes.</p>
        
            <p>"Prepare your property by securing items that can be picked up by strong winds. Drive cautiously."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Kaikōura Coast's warning was in place from 1pm until 4pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Mōrena, Happy Monday!️☔️Most of us are in line for a shower today (and maybe more than just a shower for some!)⚡️But if you're along the coast from Dunedin to Wellington to the Wairarapa, be prepared for possible blustery thunderstorms later today pic.twitter.com/dDQTp1LswL</p>
        
            <p>MetService said severe southerly winds could gust up to 130 km/h in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>It said the damage could be the same as in Wellington and people should prepare their property.</p>
        
            <p>A thunderstorm watch has also been issued for Tararua, Wairarapa, Wellington, Marlborough, Canterbury Plains and Canterbury High Country.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said a "squall line" with embedded thunderstorms would be moving up the country until 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the fast moving nature of this line and the embedded storms, there is a risk of severe thunderstorms with damaging wind gusts of around 130km/h. Wind gusts of this strength can cause some structural damage, including trees and power lines, and may make driving hazardous."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, MetService said the changing winds would bring fluctuating temperatures this week.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Clare O'Connor said: "A 'southerly buster' is a particularly strong cold front, characterised by blustery wind changes and a large drop in temperatures. A drop of 10C in a matter of minutes and winds suddenly gusting 90km/h is not unusual with the passage of these fronts."</p>
        
            <p>There was also a risk of thunderstorms and hail for eastern areas on Monday afternoon and into the evening.</p>
        
            <p>The windy weather was expected to create heavy swell, up to six metres, off the east coast of the North Island and the Chatham Islands, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"Elsewhere it will be the beginning of the calm after the storm as high pressure builds over the country. Wednesday wakes to a cold morning, especially about the central North Island where forecast minimum temperatures are sub-zero, below the average for this time of year.</p>
        
            <p>"The cold snap is short lived with above average temperatures expected from Wednesday afternoon as milder westerly winds develop about the lower half of the South Island, then spread northwards over Thursday. Another swing to the lower end of the temperature scale, and a burst of heavy rain could be seen over the weekend."</p>
