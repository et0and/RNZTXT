            <p>Auckland University is seeking legal advice after a bogus online "miracle-cure" scam used fake quotes from former director-general of health Sir Ashley Bloomfield to sell sham health products.</p>
        
            <p>The ad for "Blood Balance" capsules by a company using the name "Guardian Botanicals" led to a mock article, featuring an alleged "exclusive" interview with Bloomfield in which he calls hypertension "doctors' fairy tales" for which people "pay with money and health".</p>
        
            <p>Quotes attributed to Bloomfield - who is a professor in the School of Population Health at the University of Auckland - claimed the pill will "clean up and tone blood vessels, causing almost all chronic and incurable diseases to go away".</p>
        
            <p>Those promised results have been rubbished by General Practice New Zealand chair Dr Bryan Betty, who dubbed it a "total fabrication".</p>
        
            <p>"I think someone like Ashley has a high public profile. He's a trusted name in the media and trusted over what happened with Covid, therefore scammers are looking to take those public personas and attach them to fake products," Betty said.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland said in a statement it was concerned such an obviously fake advert ran on the website of a major media channel.</p>
        
            <p>"Dr Ashley Bloomfield has no connection to the product or company advertised and did not take part in an interview as claimed in the advertisement."</p>
        
            <p>The statement said Bloomfield's name and image have been used without his knowledge or approval.</p>
        
            <p>"We are referring this matter to our legal office for advice on what the university can do when an academic's reputation is misrepresented by the use of fake images and quotes."</p>
        
            <p>The ad ran on Stuff, but after being alerted to its presence by Newstalk ZB, the news site said the fake ad, masquerading as an article, has been removed.</p>
        
            <p>"Stuff works with third-party advertising networks that buy and sell advertising using automated methods. This enables advertisers to book and place ads across a variety of sites at any one time," Stuff said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Director of digital revenue and strategy John Buckley said it appears "bad actors" used a sophisticated method to bypass Stuff's website rules, similar to how an email may bypass a spam filter.</p>
        
            <p>"As technology evolves, so too do the tactics used by these sorts of advertisers to bypass publishers' rules," Buckley said.</p>
        
            <p>He said Stuff does not approve of the advertisement and is working with Google to get it blocked at the source, to stop the advertisement from appearing across other websites.</p>
        
            <p>It was not the first time a notable figure has been impersonated in a dubious advert.</p>
        
            <p>Just last week, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was targeted by digital creators depicting him announcing his "favourite" pornography sites online.</p>
        
            <p>The banner, which imitated the customary National Party blue and used a photograph of Luxon, appeared on popular pornographic website Pornhub.</p>
        
            <p>The university said the interview and advertisement which used Bloomfield's likeness is an obvious fake and full of basic errors.</p>
        
            <p>"The product has been identified as a known scam and people should not purchase products through the link."</p>
        
            <p>The litany of errors include calling Bloomfield New Zealand's "chief medical officer" and director of the "Public Health Communication Centre" - positions he has never held.</p>
        
            <p>GPNZ's Betty said health professionals are seeing an increase in scams which feature prominent doctors.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gravely concerning," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has happened to me personally. Patients are more likely to give validity to the [products'] claims, because you are well known.</p>
        
            <p>"I would not be going for one of these products unless you've spoken with your doctor. They are potentially dangerous."</p>
