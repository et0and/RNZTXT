            <p>The Met Gala 2024 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion' is kicking off in New York City, 10am NZST.</p>
        
            <p>The Met Gala, run by major international fashion magazine Vogue, is a fundraising dinner for the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (better known as the MET) in New York City and it also coincides with the opening of a new exhibition in the gallery.</p>
        
            <p>But it is arguably the largest fashion event of the calendar year where celebrities (invites only) dress up in elaborate outfits relating to a theme.</p>
        
            <p>This year's theme, has nothing to do with fairy tales and The Brother's Grimm, as one might interpret.</p>
        
            <p>Vogue said it was actually about celebrating clothing and fashion so delicate it could never be worn again and so they were "sleeping beauties" in the archives of the Costume Institute.</p>
        
            <p>The official dress code is The Garden of Time.</p>
        
            <p>The magazine said the dress code was inspired by a short story by J G Ballard - which was called The Garden of Time.</p>
        
            <p>It is about a count and countess who live in a grand villa, which is being threatened by an encroaching mob.</p>
