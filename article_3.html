            <p>Christchurch man John Truman, known to many as "Radio Ron", is being remembered as beloved community icon, with an infectious smile and a love of music.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes are being made online after Truman died earlier this week. He was a regular fixture in the city, at Riccarton Mall and at community events for many decades, always with his transistor radio in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger said as a child, he remembered seeing Truman with his radio walking around in Cathedral Square while on the bus to school.</p>
        
            <p>"Wouldn't hurt a fly, an absolute icon of Christchurch, like The Wizard, he was just a lovely bloke so it is very sad to see him pass on."</p>
        
            <p>He had two fan pages, Christchurch's " Radio Ron" Appreciation Fan Club and Radio Ron from Christchurch, which had close to 20,000 followers between them.</p>
        
            <p>The pages described him as a "cult icon" and one said "he wasn't always in tune - but he has been bringing a smile on Christchurch since way back - even though you can hear him a mile away".</p>
        
            <p>Radio Host Lana Searle said on Facebook that Truman had passed away after an illness.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're from Christchurch you probably don't need it explained - Ron was an institution on the streets and malls of Christchurch and has been for decades."</p>
        
            <p>When Searle first moved to Christchurch, Truman had made his way to the studio on Victoria St to introduce himself to her.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a pleasure having you on the other end of the radio Ron, may you rest easy in a land with plenty of batteries and your favourite requests."</p>
        
            <p>A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money for a Radio Ron plaque or memorial.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch East MP Reuben Davidson said in a Facebook post that the city had lost a local legend.</p>
        
            <p>Truman had been a familiar sight around Christchurch since Davidson was a kid, always with his portable radio in hand.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury Regional Councillor Deon Swiggs said he had a number of interactions with Truman over the years, particularly when he was the central city councillor for the Christchurch City Council.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just one of those characters that was always about, always had a smile, everybody knew of him and had nothing but love and affection towards him."</p>
        
            <p>Swiggs said it was sad to hear of Truman's death, but he had had a wonderful life and had made an impact on many people. His passion for radios, batteries and coffee, and his enthusiasm for those simple pleasures reflected his vibrant spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"You could see him dancing away sometimes when he had music on... you always knew when Radio Ron was coming along because you would actually hear him before you'd hear the radio, you'd turn around and there would be Radio Ron with that big grin.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a real honour to have had people like him in our city."</p>
