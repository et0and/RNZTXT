            <p>RNZ National is changing the pips - the beeps that mark the start of each hour which play immediately before the news bulletin broadcast.</p>
        
            <p>The pips were last changed in 2013 when a lightning strike damaged the clock which sent signals from the Measurement Standards Laboratory's atomic clock.</p>
        
            <p>The replacement sound was a little higher.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2018, RNZ has been in change of their generation from a master clock in Wellington. Now a new piece of equipment means another change.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's Broadcast and IT Technologist Wayne Jarvis told Morning Report the pips were tradition.</p>
        
            <p>"As you're listening up to the hour, you're not paying too much attention, you hear the pips and 'oh here's the news, I'll pay a bit more attention'."</p>
        
            <p>The new pips don't sound significantly different to the old ones.</p>
        
            <p>But Jarvis said the first five pips were now 50 milliseconds longer (a millisecond being one thousandth of a second).</p>
        
            <p>"So that they sound the same as they did in 2013, we've left the last pip, the same as the BBC, 500 milliseconds cause it just sounds about right."</p>
        
            <p>The pips were also now advanced from the studio so they arrived to FM listeners at the right time rather than 175 milliseconds late, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The new technology would allow the pips to synchronise through GPS if internet connection was lost.</p>
