            <p>Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand is investigating a staff member accused of spreading Covid-19 misinformation using its data.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the man was interviewed on a New Zealand conspiracy theory site yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>He said he developed a database for the vaccine rollout and quoted data from that work.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora chief executive Margie Apa issued a statement today saying a staff member, with no clinical background or expertise, had been spreading misinformation.</p>
        
            <p>"What he is claiming is completely wrong and ill-informed and his comments demonstrate this," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Apa said the man had used the health agency's data and his access to any IT systems has been blocked.</p>
        
            <p>Apa said the man was an administrator with no clinical experience or expertise and was using the data wrongly.</p>
        
            <p>"It is extremely disappointing to see a staff member trying to misuse our data to spread misinformation. He is no longer at work and an employment investigation is under way," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We take the security of the information we hold extremely seriously, and this is a significant breach of trust. We are considering the privacy implications related to the staff member's actions."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whata Ora is looking into whether there has been a privacy breach and Apa said the organisation will be working with the police on the matter.</p>
