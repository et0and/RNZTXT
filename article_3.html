        <h2>Why winter makes us SAD and how light can help</h2>
        <p>
Apart from nutrition and exercise, getting more light in your eyes is the best treatment for seasonal mood challenges, researcher says. Audio

            <p>If you're feeling sadder as the days get shorter, you're not alone. Around half the population report feeling less happy in winter and 5 percent fall into serious depression.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from nutrition and exercise, getting more light in your eyes is the best treatment we know for seasonal mood challenges, says NZ-born neurobiology researcher Anna Wirz-Justice, who is based in Basel, Switzerland, where she is emeritus professor of psychiatric neurobiology at the Centre for Chronobiology.</p>
        
            <p>"The clinical studies that have used light as therapy have shown this is a very powerful treatment," she tells Susie Ferguson on Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>We don't yet know why some people are more vulnerable to seasonal mood challenges, Wirz-Justice says, but it may relate to serotonin levels and depression vulnerability in general.</p>
        
            <p>The psychological condition known as Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD is found all over the world but the latitude of where you live can add to your risk.</p>
        
            <p>As New Zealand is a "long and thin" country, the amount of winter daylight on offer varies a lot, Wirz-Justice says.</p>
        
            <p>Those living in the "middle latitudes" - including in Wellington and Christchurch - are particularly vulnerable to getting down as daylight diminishes.</p>
        
            <p>For the large number of people prone to falling into the "winter blues", more exposure to sunlight can be all that's needed to keep depression at bay, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"Light - and in particular daylight, which we don't often get out into as much as we should - is so important for our basic health, for our psychological health, for our physical health."</p>

            <p>For the 5 percent of those who experience a "major depressive disorder" every autumn and winter that spontaneously lifts in spring and summer, the therapeutic use of bright artificial light is the best treatment we currently have, Wirz-Justice says.</p>
        
            <p>Sitting in front of intense light from a special light box for half an hour a day, preferably in the morning, can be effective in lifting the mood of these people, she says. </p>
        
            <p>These light boxes have an intensity of about 5,000 to 10,000 LUX (a measurement of light on a surface), Wirz-Justice says, which is equivalent to the light on "a bright, sunny day in the early morning".</p>
        
            <p>Indoors, the light intensity we are exposed to - usually around 50 to 500 LUX - is not strong enough to stabilise our biological clocks, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Outdoors - even on a grey, rainy day - the light is much more intense.</p>
        
            <p>To keep the winter blues at bay, Wirz-Justice recommends people get outside for half an hour every day, preferably in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>In the open air, you will get at least 3,000 LUX, she says, which is enough to synchronise your body clock for the day.</p>
        
            <p>As the positive effects of light on our biological rhythms occur through eye contact, it's best not to wear sunglasses during this morning light fix.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not talking about light on the skin. We're talking about light hitting the retina and going straight to the brain to affect cognition and mood and rhythms and sleep - and that's all through the eyes."</p>
        
            <p>Exploring the vast potential of sunlight for human and planetary well-being is the focus of Daylight Academy - a group of researchers, scientists and designers of which Wirz-Justice is part.</p>
        
            <p>Increasingly, hospitals are being designed with indoor light in mind, she says, and dementia care facilities with lighting systems that artificially signal dawn and dusk.  </p>
        
            <p>"The ramifications of what we know about how light affects human behaviour and physiology and psychology is growing and is enormous."</p>
