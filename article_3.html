            <p>Blood cancer patients in Australia have access to 36 treatment options not funded in New Zealand - of which nine significantly improve survival rates and quality of life, according to a report.</p>
        
            <p>The Cancer Control Agency, which produced the 126-page report, said it was the first time it been able to assess the "magnitude" of blood cancer medicines' clinical benefit.</p>
        
            <p>Its chief executive, Rami Rahal, said there had been "concern" for several years that New Zealand was lagging behind in Australia in terms of access to blood cancer medicines.</p>
        
            <p>A 2022 report - Understanding the Gap: an analysis of the availability of cancer medicines in Aotearoa - had revealed the extent of medication gaps and the "potential" impact on patients.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, the agency committed to assessing the magnitude of clinical benefit for blood cancer medicines as soon as the "relevant tool" became available.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very pleased to now deliver on that commitment and complete this work with the release of Understanding Blood Cancer Medicine Availability in Aotearoa New Zealand," Rahal said.</p>
        
            <p>"While a number of medicines available in New Zealand are also available in Australia, the report shows there are some gaps.</p>
        
            <p>"We now understand what those gaps are, how many there are and what these gaps might mean for patients."</p>
        
            <p>The situation improved earlier this year with Pharmac's decision to fund medicines for six types of blood cancer, but that left a shortfall of 36 treatment options, Rahal said.</p>
        
            <p>Of the nine showing "substantial magnitude of clinical benefit", Pharmac was considering funding six of them.</p>
        
            <p>There were no current applications for the other three.</p>
        
            <p>However, the analysis should not be treated as a shopping list for Pharmac, Rahal stressed.</p>
        
            <p>It was the "exclusive domain" of Pharmac to decide which medicines to fund based on consideration of a wide number of factors.</p>
        
            <p>"The funding of cancer medications is complex, and this report is not a list of medications that should necessarily be prioritised for funding by Pharmac. Medicine funding should also be considered in the wider context of cancer control.</p>
        
            <p>"Medicines play an important part, but we must also continue to think about ways to strengthen prevention measures, improve early diagnosis, encourage participation in screening programmes and ensure high-quality care is available to all."</p>
        
            <p>Every year, in Aotearoa, about 2800 people are diagnosed with a blood cancer.</p>
        
            <p>There are no known prevention or screening interventions for blood cancers. Cancer medicines (along with stem cell transplant) are the major treatment options.</p>
        
            <p>The analysis showed that:</p>
