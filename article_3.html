        <h2>Dame Maggie Smith's death a 'huge loss', NZ actor says</h2>
        <p>
The 89-year-old Englishwoman had a career that straddled "the old world of acting and the new".

            <p>New Zealand actors are among those paying tribute to Dame Maggie Smith, who died on Friday aged 89.</p>
        
            <p>Jennifer Ward-Lealand, an actor and the president of the professional performers' union Equity New Zealand, said Dame Maggie was a rare breed of actor.</p>

            <p>Her death was "a huge loss to the acting community", both in her native United Kingdom and around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"There are not many performers left like her who were part of a really venerable legacy. She straddled live performance and screen works, but also the old world of acting and the new.</p>
        
            <p>"When she started in the early '50s and the '60s, there was a real considerable change of style and material being written and produced, and she was right in the middle of that, and then in some really landmark productions."</p>
        
            <p>Ward-Lealand said Dame Maggie famously had a professional rivalry with Laurence Olivier: "He sort of met his match when he met Maggie Smith."</p>

            <p>The 89-year-old English actor's six-decade career continued right up until 2023, Ward-Lealand said.</p>
        
            <p>"To think that in her 70s she was doing Downton Abbey, still working, still a really hard-working actor ... and then of course being able to garner a whole new audience with the Harry Potter films.</p>
        
            <p>"She was someone who obviously loved to work, loved her craft and loved working with actors, and I bet she was an absolute hoot."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, local glaucoma advocates said Dame Maggie did a huge amount to raise awareness of the eye condition, which is also known as the silent disease.</p>
        
            <p>The actor was vocal about having glaucoma, which can cause blindness, and in 2012 she became patron of Britain's International Glaucoma Association, which was later renamed Glaucoma UK.</p>

            <p>Jenna Tuuta said Dame Maggie's wide-ranging acting CV made her the ideal spokesperson for the disease, which could affect all ages.</p>
        
            <p>"She acted for 70 years or so, and she had a huge reach. Glaucoma is known as something suffered by people in their older years. But you can have glaucoma at any age including childhood.</p>
        
            <p>"So if you look at Maggie and think of her [Harry Potter character] Professor McGonagall, you'll be attracted to what she has to say and ... it might lead you to think, 'yes, I should go get checked for glaucoma.'"</p>
        
            <p>Tuuta said half of sufferers did not know they could have glaucoma, and they might not realise anything was wrong with their vision until it was too late.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, Dame Maggie's work was "incredibly important" at highlighting this "insidious disease".</p>
