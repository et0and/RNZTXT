            <p>One of the rarest types of pounamu is being sold legally for the first time, marking a "momentous moment" for West Coast hapū Ngāti Māhaki.</p>
        
            <p>Tahutai, the pounamu some refer to as "snowflake", is known for its vibrant green hue with white flecks and can only be found on the Cascade Plateau, south of Haast.</p>
        
            <p>The rarity and beauty of Tahutai pounamu has made it a desired taonga, though it has never been legally available for purchase.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rūnanga o Makaawhio chairperson Paul Madgwick said the public sale was a "momentous moment" for both Ngāti Māhaki and Ngāi Tahu.</p>
        
            <p>"Tahutahi is a special taonga for our people, and we're looking forward to sharing it authentically for the first time through our Westland Greenstone store in Hokitika."</p>
        
            <p>The rare taonga has been gifted during significant events this year, including Te Arikinui Nga Wai hono i te po's first official visit to Te Wai Pounamu.</p>

            <p>"Earlier this year, Tahutahi pendants were gifted by Ngāi Tahu to New Zealand's Olympic and Paralympic athletes, and a custom set was presented to Kuini Nga Wai hono i te po during her first official visit to the South Island," Madgwick said.</p>
        
            <p>Pounamu, often referred to as 'greenstone' has a rich history in Te Tai Poutini (The West Coast).</p>
        
            <p>Found only in the South Island, its importance to local iwi and hapū is reflected in some of the regions traditional Māori names, Te Wai Pounamu (the greenstone waters) and Te Wāhi Pounamu (the place of greenstone).</p>
        
            <p>Ownership of pounamu was officially restored to Ngāi Tahu takiwā in 1997 through the Ngāi Tahu (Pounamu Vesting) Act.</p>

            <p>However, the scarcity of Tahutai has also made it a target for illegal trade. Large-scale thefts of the taonga led to prosecutions in the early 2000s, during which stolen raw pounamu and carved pieces were recovered and repatriated to Ngāi Tahu.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the pieces now available for sale are some of the mana restored taonga, recovered and returned to its rightful kaitiaki during those prosecutions.</p>
        
            <p>Madgwick said the decision to sell the taonga publicly represents a new chapter for Ngāti Māhaki, who have carried the mamae (pain) of these thefts for decades.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a big step for us to finally honour the mana of our pounamu taonga in an authentic way."</p>
        
            <p>Madgwick said it is important people buy pounamu through legitimate channels, and he encouraged buyers to use the Ngāi Tahu Pounamu authentication scheme.</p>
        
            <p>"All taonga sold by Ngāi Tahu Pounamu carries a mark of authenticity and a unique traceability code."</p>
        
            <p>Madgwick said tahutahi is currently only available in-store at Westland Greenstone in Hokitika, but there are plans to expand its availability to other Ngāi Tahu businesses on the West Coast next year.</p>
