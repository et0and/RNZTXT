            <p>Police officers investigating the violent death of an elderly Wellington woman, nearly two weeks ago, are focusing on a key five-hour period on the night she died.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Gregory, 79, was found dead at her Khandallah home on 24 January.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch said an iwi leader performed a moving karakia with Gregory's family on Saturday morning to mark the end of the police presence at the property.</p>
        
            <p>"We wish to thank the residents of the street, and wider Khandallah community for their patience and understanding throughout this time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We also acknowledge the feelings of anxiety from this tragic event and the subsequent investigations."</p>
        
            <p>The lengthy scene investigation had provided "significant information" that would help police reconstruct the events leading up to Gregory's death, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The focus is now on a key period of time, between 6pm and 11pm on Wednesday 24 January.</p>
        
            <p>"We are confident a successful resolution to this homicide is nearing, and the person or persons responsible for the death of Helen will be held accountable.</p>
        
            <p>"The Khandallah community are being reassured that there is no ongoing risk to public safety following this event."</p>
        
            <p>"The people that knew and were close to Helen have provided us with significant information, and if anyone else has further information we would like to speak to them."</p>
        
            <p>Police also wanted to speak to anyone in and around Baroda Street on 24 January who had yet to speak to police.</p>
        
            <p>"Police can be contacted by calling 105, or making an online report by clicking "Update Report" and referencing file number 240125/1641."</p>
