            <p>Today marks the 115th day since Green MP Darleen Tana was suspended from caucus amid allegations she is linked to migrant exploitation at her husband's company.</p>
        
            <p>The grim milestone means Tana has been suspended on full pay for more than half her entire career as an MP. In that time, MPs were given a sizeable, backdated pay rise taking, taking her base salary to $168,600.</p>
        
            <p>This means she will have earned over $40,000 during the more than three months of her suspension.</p>
        
            <p>Tana was suspended following allegations of migrant exploitation involving her husband Christian Hoff-Nielsen's bicycle company. Hoff-Nielsen denied all the exploitation allegations at the time and told the Herald: "This is not a news story, there is no news."</p>
        
            <p>The Greens hired barrister Rachel Burt to look into the allegations. The status of that investigation, including whether it has concluded, is unclear.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens say that in the interest of preserving natural justice, they are not giving updates on the status of the report until the party has reached a conclusion.</p>
        
            <p>For some time, the Green Party has been saying that the investigation has been close to wrapping up.</p>
        
            <p>On 9 April, Green co-leader Marama Davidson told The Hui the party was "coming towards the end of that independent investigation".</p>
        
            <p>In May, Green co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick suggested in an interview with Newstalk ZB the issue was close to being resolved.</p>
        
            <p>She wouldn't give a specific date on when Burt would report back but said the matter had "progressed quite substantially".</p>
        
            <p>Asked why the investigation hadn't yet concluded, Swarbrick noted how its terms of reference had been expanded following fresh allegations becoming public through media reporting.</p>
        
            <p>That month, the Herald reported that an investigation into the allegations cost $43,000, paid for out of the publicly-funded bulk allowance the Greens receive through Parliament, as do all other parties in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Things went from bad to worse in May when Tana was referred to the police due to an alleged issue with a paid article in Verve Magazine. That issue relates to the alleged failure to include a promoter statement in an election advertisement published last May.</p>
