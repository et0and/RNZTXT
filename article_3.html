            <p>After a difficult week of poor weather and a crisis over its electricity supply downpours may pile more misery onto the Northland region over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Northland has already experienced a particularly wet week, with over 120mm of rain falling in northern and eastern parts within a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Its reprieve today has been short-lived.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a heavy rain watch for areas north of Whangārei from around 8pm on Saturday night and lasting through until 2pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>While it will be very wet MetService believes there's a low chance of it being upgraded to a warning.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki is in for something similar and the rain may be accompanied by thunderstorms. The bad weather is forecast from 6pm on Saturday until noon on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A similar watch is in place for Coromandel Peninsula, and Bay of Plenty about and west of Kawerau.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms are forecast from around 3am on Sunday through until 6pm that day.</p>
        
            <p>It's a similar story for those living east of Kawerau and in Gisborne / Tai Rāwhiti north of Ruatoria with the rain falling between 9am and midnight on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island the Tasman area around Motueka may bear the brunt of the worst weather this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>MetService says there's a high chance its heavy rain watch - due to last from 9am on Saturday to 8pm on Sunday - will be upgraded to a warning.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy Rain Watches are in place as wet weather this weekend brings the chance of heavy rain for some areasKeep an eye out for a potential upgrade to an Orange Warning, especially for TasmanFull details are available at https://t.co/qHyE5zzql5 pic.twitter.com/JUzoRjBPq8</p>
        
            <p>Thunderstorms will also be in the mix. The rainfall may cause streams and rivers to rise rapidly resulting in surface flooding and slips.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said while unsettled weather was likely to last into next week, the outlook was good for the Super Rugby Pacific final between the Blues and the Chiefs at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"Rugby fans will be pleased to know chances are looking good for a dry game in Auckland on Saturday evening. Things are a bit more touch-and-go for those partaking in the Wellington Marathon on Sunday, where it will likely remain dry with light winds but don't rule out the chance of a shower."</p>
