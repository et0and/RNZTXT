            <p>New British Open champion Lydia Ko has jumped nine places up to number three in the latest world golf rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Ko's triumph at St Andrews on Monday was her second big victory of the month after winning gold at the Paris.</p>
        
            <p>She has also claimed two other top ten finishes which has resulted in a dramatic climb from the start of the month when she was number 22 in the rankings.</p>
        
            <p>American's Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu, who both finished second to Ko in Scotland, remain number one and two.</p>
        
            <p>Ko's Olympic victory made her eligible for golf's Hall of Fame and at 27 she is the youngest to earn such as accolade.</p>
        
            <p>A decade ago she became golf's youngest world number one and in 2015 she fired a record 63 to grab her first major at the Evian Championship. She added the ANA Inspiration title in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>The British Open was her third major title.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a whirlwind of a past three weeks. It's been crazy to get into the Hall of Fame by winning the gold. These are things that I could have never imagined because they were just too good to be true."</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday's victory has enhanced Ko's claim for the Halberg Supreme Sports Award.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage the top contenders are all Olympic champions.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington is in line for a fourth supreme award after claiming three gold medals in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>High jumper Hamish Kerr and cycling champion Ellesse Andrews are also in line for nomination.</p>
        
            <p>Ko won the supreme award in 2013 and was named sportswoman of the year from 2013 to 2015, Carrington has dominated the award since.</p>
