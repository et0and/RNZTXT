            <p>Sports enthusiasts will once more be welcomed into Christchurch's famed Lancaster Park through the historic Memorial Gates.</p>
        
            <p>The gates were damaged in the 2010/ 2011 Canterbury earthquakes and have been refurbished as part of a wider project to redevelop the sports ground.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Phil Mauger will formally rededicate the gates at a community ceremony on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch City Council's head of parks Andrew Rutledge said having the gates restored was a big milestone.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very significant in a sporting context, but also because Lancaster Park is obviously a special place for Cantabrians," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rutledge said the refurbishment started in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"Like many of the earthquake heritage rebuilds we've had, a lot of the structural integrity was at risk and we have to bring that up to the current standards, so a lot of work went into that.</p>
        
            <p>"But they look now like they I guess would've looked when they were first built. They look amazing."</p>
        
            <p>The Memorial Gates were built in 1924 to commemorate the sacrifice of Canterbury athletes during World War I.</p>
        
            <p>At today's ceremony, the council is also set to unveil the Arc of History; a series of panels showing Lancaster Park's history.</p>
        
            <p>"The images shown on the Arc of History have been sourced from various collections from across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"From Peter Snell's 800 metre record to U2 playing to a crowd of 60,000, the arc captures a range of sporting and cultural moments from the past 130 years," Rutledge said.</p>
        
            <p>He said guests set to be part of the unveiling included former cricketer Sir Richard Hadlee and All Black Sam Whitelock.</p>
        
            <p>The ceremony begins at 12.30pm at the Memorial Gates on Stevens Street.</p>
        
            <p>
The Memorial Gates will be among the few structures to survive the Canterbury earthquakes that have led to most buildings being demolished.
