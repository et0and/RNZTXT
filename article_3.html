        <h2>SailGP to return to Christchurch in March</h2>
        <p>
The decision comes after Auckland announced last month they couldn't host it on Waitematā Harbour, as they were unable to lock in Wynyard Point as a vantage point for spectators.

            <p>The New Zealand round of Sail GP will return to Christchurch in March.</p>
        
            <p>Lyttelton and Auckland were scheduled to alternate hosting the event, but last month Auckland announced they couldn't host it on the Waitematā Harbour, as they were unable to lock in Wynyard Point as a vantage point for spectators.</p>
        
            <p>Lyttelton hosted last season's event in March this year.</p>
        
            <p>The dates for 2024 stay with March 23-24.</p>
        
            <p>Welcoming the news, SailGP global cheif executive Sir Russell Coutts said, "Christchurch has proven to be one of our very best events to date - with fantastic racing, thousands of fans and spectacular scenery in a natural amphitheatre."</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger said, "It's fantastic to welcome SailGP back to the city in 2024 for this bonus season.</p>
        
            <p>"This year's event was brilliant, and it was great that Whakaraupō Lyttelton Harbour was seen around the world in all its glory," said the Mayor.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure people will get right behind this event once again. I really want to thank Te Hapū o Ngāti Wheke Rāpaki, SailGP and ChristchurchNZ for making this happen - this partnership is why we will see SailGP return in 2024."</p>
