            <p>Sir Ian McKellen will not be returning to his starring role for the final three West End performances of Player Kings, after falling from the stage on 17 June.</p>
        
            <p>It is hoped the veteran actor will return to the cast when the play moves to Bristol on 3 July.</p>
        
            <p>The role of Sir John Falstaff will be played instead by David Semark, who plays Sir Richard Vernon, but is also Sir Ian's understudy, the play's production team said.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Ian, 85, has been unavailable to perform since his fall during a live performance of the play at the Noel Coward Theatre.</p>
        
            <p>The actor said he is having "physiotherapy, light exercise and a lot of essential rest at home" after three nights in hospital.</p>

            <p>The Player Kings X account posted the show would continue with Semark "while Ian McKellen recuperates following his fall", adding: "We look forward to Ian returning to the production."</p>
        
            <p>Semark's theatre credits include The Mousetrap and Richard III for the RSC, while his TV appearances include Hustle and Law and Order UK.</p>
        
            <p>Adapted by award-winning writer and director Robert Icke, Player Kings brings together two of Shakespeare's great history plays, Henry IV Parts 1 & 2, in a new interpretation.</p>
        
            <p>The play began preview showings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London on 1 April and closes on 22 June, before travelling to Bristol, Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.</p>
        
            <p>The actor had been performing in a fight scene when he lost his footing.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported that he cried out in pain, calling for help, and a staff member rushed to assist him. He was taken to hospital and the play was cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>A theatre spokesperson later said Sir Ian had undergone a scan and medics said he would "make a speedy and full recovery".</p>
        
            <p>I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support. Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, ofâ€¦</p>
        
            <p>In a message on X, the day after his fall, Sir Ian said "I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support".</p>
        
            <p>"My injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, of course, I am hugely indebted.</p>
        
            <p>"They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work."</p>
        
            <p>Five years ago, the Olivier Award winning actor was forced to cancel a showing of King Lear at London's Duke of York theatre, after sustaining a leg injury while running to catch a train.</p>
        
            <p>He ensured the audience was in for a good time, by sitting on stage and answering questions.</p>
        
            <p>Player Kings started its 12-week West End run in April, and the actor told the BBC at the time that he was "finally playing the role he always said no to".</p>
        
            <p>He explained that he almost turned down the the opportunity again, but was "intrigued and eventually persuaded" by Icke, who has "turned Falstaff into a believable character rather than an exaggeration".</p>
