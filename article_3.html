            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon expects Associate Education Minister David Seymour to give problems with the new school lunches programme his "full attention".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has reported concerns raised by multiple schools about the lunches being late, inedible, repetitive, or failing to meet dietary restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters in Vietnam, Christopher Luxon described them as teething problems.</p>
        
            <p>"David Seymour will work his way through those issues and he's minister responsible for it and I expect he will and I know that he's well aware of the challenges and working his way through what have been some teething issues up front but he will work his way through that."</p>
        
            <p>He said Seymour was "accountable for delivering" and Luxon had no doubt he would be able to.</p>
        
            <p>The two had discussed the problems, Luxon said. "I think he knows exactly what needs to happen."</p>
        
            <p>While parts of the programme were being delivered well there had been problems with being on time and meeting the contract, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"David will be giving it his full court and full attention and I expect him to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Compass Group boss Paul Harvey told Checkpoint it was "mission critical" to meet their key performance indicators.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour told RNZ the collective providing the lunches would not be sacked.</p>
        
            <p>"These are free meals being paid by the tax payer, they are very good according to many of the people receiving them.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been some challenges - which we have a track record of overcoming - and at some point, you've got to have reference to the other 75 percent of parents paying for their kids lunches," he said.</p>
