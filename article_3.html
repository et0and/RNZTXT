        <h2>Police offer $100,000 reward, immunity in Arthur Easton murder case</h2>
        <p>
The offer comes after police apologised to Alan Hall's family over his wrongful conviction in the case.
</p>
        
            <p>Police have offered a $100,000 reward and possible immunity from prosecution in an appeal for information into the murder of Arthur Easton in Auckland's Papakura 39 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Warrick Adkin announced the reward at Counties Manukau Police Station on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The reward would be in place until 24 January, 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Easton, 52, was stabbed to death by an intruder who broke into his home in October 1985.</p>
        
            <p>The appeal comes just weeks after Police Commissioner Andrew Coster announced he had met with Alan Hall and his family to apologise for his wrongful conviction for the murder.</p>

            <p>Police in August said two former staff members who were involved in the original homicide investigation and a former prosecutor involved in the subsequent trial have been charged over the miscarriage of justice.</p>
        
            <p>All three have pleaded not guilty.</p>

            <p>Adkin said immunity would also be considered for any accomplice, who was not the principle offender, and gave information or evidence that lead to a successful conviction.</p>
        
            <p>"On Sunday the 13th of October 1985, 39 years ago this month, a male intruder entered the Easton family home on Grove Road, Papakura, at about 8pm," he said, describing the killing.</p>
        
            <p>"One of Arthur's sons disturbed the intruder and alerted the household. This offender was wearing a brown, woollen hat, pulled down over his face. He was also armed with a bayonet.</p>
        
            <p>"Arthur and his two teenage sons confronted this intruder in the hallway, leading to a violent altercation. Arthur, who was 52 at the time, was stabbed multiple times and later succumbed to these injuries at his home."</p>
        
            <p>Adkin said the offender then fled the home, leaving the hat and bayonet behind.</p>
        
            <p>"To this day, Arthur's killer remains at large and this investigation will work to bring this person before the court.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there will still be people within our community today who know who is responsible for Arthur's death. I encourage them to do the right thing now and come forward."</p>
        
            <p>Adkin said the Easton family was aware of the reward and supported the approach. They were being kept up to date with the investigation monthly.</p>
        
            <p>Adkin said police needed the public's help in solving the case, so the Easton family could finally have the answers they deserved.</p>
        
            <p>Adkin said police had launched an 0800 number for information to be given directly to the investigation team, along with a dedicated email address.</p>
