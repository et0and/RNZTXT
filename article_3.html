            <p>Police have arrested a 19-year-old after a fire at a mosque in Auckland's New Lynn.</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in Waitakere District Court on Wednesday on two charges of arson and one of burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were still working to establish why the mosque on Astley Avenue was targetted.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continue to provide support to the Muslim community and wish to reassure all in our community that this appears to have been an isolated incident," Detective Inspector Callum McNeill of Waitematā CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>Security footage showed a fire was lit after a break-in about 1am on Monday, police said. It smouldered until just after 9am when it became visible and emergency services were called.</p>
