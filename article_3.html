            <p>Describing this Warriors season as a rollercoaster would be nothing short of an understatement, as the team looks to bounce back from what was possibly the worst performance in the club's entire history.</p>
        
            <p>With the Broncos coming in fresh of a bye round, it won't make things any easier for the Warriors, with the only silver lining being the visitors missing their State of Origin stars.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Webster is adamant the Warriors can still make a push towards the finals but says they desperately need to find their pride again.</p>
        
            <p>But without star playmaker Shaun Johnson, who's facing a month on the sideline, it's not going to be easy. This is a do or die game for the club.</p>

            <p>Chanel Harris-Tavita pairs up with Te Maire Martin in the halves, a combination that's proved more than worthy in the past.</p>
        
            <p>Kurt Capewell and Mitch Barnett also return from State of Origin duties to give the Warriors' forward pack a much-needed boost.</p>

            <p>It's hard to get a good read on the Broncos line-up, with the likes of former Warriors Reece Walsh and key forwards Payne Hass and Patrick Carrigan being called up for Origin.</p>
        
            <p>A lot will rest on Ezra Mam's shoulders, while Selwyn Cobbo has moved into centre.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 22 - 26 Broncos</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 12 - 42 Broncos (prelim final)</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors came so close to mounting a last-minute comeback against the Broncos early last season in Napier, being denied a try at the end of the game that would have given them an opportunity at a conversion to win the game.</p>
        
            <p>But the one we all remember from last year is the fateful preliminary final match that ended the most triumphant season in the Warriors' modern-day history, falling short in the big dance as the Broncos streaked away to win 42 - 12.</p>
        
            <p>Bizarrely enough, this season the Warriors have done extremely well against top-tier opponents after being under pressure off the back of tough losses - and they've also done extremely well without Shaun Johnson in the line-up.</p>
        
            <p>With the Broncos potentially suffering the loss of a few key players off the back of State of Origin on Wednesday night, the game really does have the potential to swing either way.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors will be looking to restore some pride to a club that's clearly hurting at this point, and, with their season hanging in the balance once again. anything short of a win will start to ring some serious alarm bells at Mt Smart, with the future of some key players hanging in the balance.</p>
