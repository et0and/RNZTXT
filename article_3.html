        <h2>Sheafs, cabers and tartan on show at Turakina Highland Games</h2>
        <p>
Tartan, bagpipes, sheafs and cabers were out in force at New Zealand's oldest continuously running Highland Games. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Tartan, bagpipes, sheafs and cabers were out in force at the Turakina Highland Games, billed as New Zealand's oldest continuously running highland games. </p>
        
            <p>Dressed in six yards of Scottish tartan "to try and keep the wind away", Callum Carn cuts a dash as he waits his turn in the A Grade piping competition.</p>
        
            <p>The tradie from Wellington first played here as a boy in 2008 and hasn't missed a year since. </p>
        
            <p>The event, billed as New Zealand's oldest continuously running Highland games, was held this year on a cool, windy day in January.</p>
        
            <p>Now in its 160th year, it is a not-to-be-missed mark on the calendar for many - including Bruce Cawood, who's been coming since 1955.</p>
        
            <p>"It's home for me," he told Country Life.</p>

            <p>Cawood is a descendant of one of the district's Scottish pioneering families, who bought their land sight unseen while they were still in Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the oldest continuous Highland gathering in New Zealand. It's not the first one that started but it's always gone on." </p>
        
            <p>Tartan embellishes the welcome sign to Turakina, a small settlement of historic weatherboard buildings at a crossroads south of Whanganui.</p>
        
            <p>Up behind the main street, at the Domain, you can see a kiltmaker at work and learn about the different tartans from clan representatives like Ian Dickson of clan Keith, who is serving up kedgeree in a marquee.</p>
        
            <p>He's there to answer questions about genealogy, clan history and tell stories - "some of which may be true".</p>

            <p>Three of his grandparents were Keiths, "so I was kind of born into it."</p>
        
            <p>"I was kind of curious about grasping for the 'Y' chromosome - where have I come from - and took on this role as the convenor for the clan in 2012."</p>
        
            <p>Back in the day, there used to be an event like this on every provincial anniversary - "huge and filled with bicycle races and waka races, a lot of drinking, a lot of story telling", he says.</p>

            <p>Over at the Women's Institute tent, Gillian Butcher and other local members are selling freshly baked scones and homemade jams.</p>
        
            <p>The games are a chance to boost the group's profile and pick up a few members.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher has also been coming since she was a child, and feels interest in the games is growing as people want to understand more about their heritage.</p>
        
            <p>And "you can't beat strong men in skirts," she says with a chuckle.</p>
        
            <p>The "strongman" events are not just for men. Whole families from the district turn out and keep alive long-running competition between clans.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd builds for the final round of the sheaf toss, which involves pitchforking a sack of chaff as high as possible</p>
        
            <p>Competitors in Highland dress are ready for the showdown as the crowd gasps and cheers.</p>
        
            <p>Techniques vary, according to "Haynesy", a well-seasoned sheaf tosser. His is a straightforward approach: "Biff it over the pole." </p>
        
            <p>
Tossing the sheaf is one of the closely fought field events at the Games

            <p>Among the spectators is Ceilidh Johnston, who recently migrated from Scotland with her children.</p>
        
            <p>She said they had come to New Zealand mainly for sporting opportunities for their children and had fallen in love with the place.</p>

            <p>As for the games, it was great to see different faces, different accents, and people with a bit of a connection to Scotland, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was incredible to fly around the world, taking four planes to get to New Zealand "and now we've come to a place where everyone has a connection".</p>
        
            <p>"There's stories about Scotland, there's masses and masses of bagpipes, so, yep, thoroughly enjoying it."</p>
