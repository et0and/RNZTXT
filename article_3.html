            <p>Three people have been arrested after counters at a jewellery store in St Lukes shopping centre were smashed during a robbery, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police were told that two men entered the Michael Hill store in Mt Albert shortly before 3.30pm on Tuesday, where they "smashed counters with tools, stealing items of jewellery," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The men then reportedly handed items to people in a Mazda, then drove away themselves in a Subaru, which was soon spotted on nearby Lyon Avenue with two men seen running from it.</p>
