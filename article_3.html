        <h2>New scheme aims to keep leftover building materials out of landfill</h2>
        <p>
The timber, mesh and bricks would usually be sent to the dump, but is now being made available for home DIY jobs.

            <p>A Christchurch environmental group is working with local construction firms to try to keep leftover building materials out of the landfill.</p>
        
            <p>The Trash 2 Treasure scheme has been set up as part of the Climate Action Campus at the former site of Avonside Girls High in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Vicki Buck said the aim was to make it as easy as possible for builders to allow their leftover construction waste to be reused, rather than going to the dump or to waste.</p>
        
            <p>She said it had only been operating a week, but had already had a sizeable delivery from Naylor Love.</p>
        
            <p>"They brought around a big pile of timber of all sizes, bricks, pavers, reinforcing mesh, which goes inside concrete but is apparently really good for growing plants."</p>
        
            <p>She said Green Dog Insulation had also brought around off-cuts, which would be useful for small insulation jobs.</p>
        
            <p>All of the items were free.</p>
        
            <p>Buck said the idea sprang from a conversation with people in the construction industry who said much of their leftover material could be useful to someone, but it was difficult to allow people on sites at the end of a build due to health and safety requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Pick-ups are currently available on Thursdays from 1-3pm.</p>
        
            <p>Buck said people could drop off things at other times, but were asked to get in touch or talk to someone on site about what was being dropped off.</p>
