            <p>Marco Rojas' second stint at the Wellington Phoenix has been cut short, after a season which has been limited to seven appearances, of which only two were starts.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix said Rojas and the club have agreed to cut his time short, with the remaining three months of his one-year contract terminated "by mutual consent".</p>
        
            <p>The All White forward, who started his professional career in Wellington in 2009, went on to play 21 A-League matches for the Phoenix before heading to Melbourne in 2011, for the first of three successful spells at the Victory.</p>
        
            <p>Rojas was looking forward to rejoining the club after 13 years away when he signed for the 2024/25 season but has not enjoyed the return he would have liked.</p>

            <p>Rojas still showed his talent and he is second only to Hideki Ishige on the team's assists tally this campaign.</p>
        
            <p>An ankle injury sidelined him for nine matches from late December to mid-February and he has featured in just three games since.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix director of football Shaun Gill has thanked Rojas for his contribution to the club, on and off the pitch.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all disappointed we didn't get to see the best of Marco in a Phoenix shirt ...Injuries are an unfortunate part of football and they curtailed his involvement this season," Gill said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though it's been brief, it's been great to see Marco back in Wellington where his football career began and we wish him all the best for the future."</p>
