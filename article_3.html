            <p>A Kiwi couple based in Costa Rica are raffling off what they say is a "life less ordinary".</p>
        
            <p>Eco-tourism operators Jane and Fraser Tyrell are offering up the business they have run for 16 years in the Central American country - along with equipment and a chunk of cash to keep it running.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of a ticket is $81.</p>
        
            <p>Jane and Fraser Tyrell said they bought the adventure tour company Cost Rica Rios, which has been operating since 1995, in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>"We have two pieces of land in the town of Turrialba in Costa Rica, one of them is a central piece of land that essentially has a small house for what we use as our offices, and the other piece is a piece of rain forest where we have our warehouse," Jane said.</p>
        
            <p>The warehouse includes all the gear needed to run the trips such as whitewater rafts, canoes, kayaks, mountain bikes and climbing gear, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It also includes a four-wheel drive truck because it is necessary to drive in and out of the jungle, as well as any forward bookings for trips, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Fraser said they had not determined exactly how many tickets they would have to sell before drawing the raffle, but it would likely be thousands.</p>
        
            <p>"The way it works, it's quite clever - if we don't hit a number that we feel the company's worth, the platform we're using as a raffle will still draw a name out of the hat," Fraser said.</p>

            <p>The winner would then get whatever the ticket sales were worth rather than the business, Jane added.</p>
        
            <p>"So say we sell I don't know, $500,000 worth of tickets, the winner will get 75 percent of that and the hosting platform will get 25 percent - and we'll actually get nothing but we still retain our company," Jane said.</p>
        
            <p>The third-party website guarantees and holds the funds and does the random selection, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really hoping that the tickets will be bought by people who are dreaming of a life less ordinary, a life somewhere different, they want to go to Costa Rica and try living there," Jane said.</p>

            <p>Jane said they were looking to leave Costa Rica now because their children were getting older and wanted other opportunities. The couple were also looking towards their next plan and their next adventure.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel like we've got one last big adventure in us and we hope to maybe sail around the world," Fraser said.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the raffle would help finance that.</p>
