            <p>The remains of missing woman Kellie Ann Carmichael have been found 23 years after she went missing in the Blue Mountains.</p>
        
            <p>The Victorian woman, who was 24 years old at the time of her disappearance, went missing after leaving a hostel at Katoomba on 29 April 2001.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police said human remains were found in bushland near Katoomba in an unrelated police operation on 30 April, with further remains found at the same location on 27 May.</p>
        
            <p>Police said Carmichael's remains were formally identified and her family has been notified.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation is underway, and evidence will be prepared for the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>Carmichael had travelled from Geelong to seek help from friends for her schizophrenia.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police said she was last seen alive when Carmichael left the hostel and told staff she would be back later that day to collect her belongings.</p>
        
            <p>Days later, Carmichael's parents contacted the hostel staff and discovered that her belongings - including her personal ID, wallet, phone, camera, toiletries and cards - were still unclaimed at reception.</p>
        
            <p>They reported their daughter missing to Katoomba Police Station on 5 May.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police initially suggested she took her own life, but her parents said they never believed it.</p>
        
            <p>Years later, officers got a tip off that Carmichael had been murdered.</p>
        
            <p>In 2011, police offered a $200,000 reward to try to solve her disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Margaret Carmichael pleaded for new information on the disappearance of her daughter, with police unable to arrest any person they believed responsible for the crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything at all, you know, we will be thankful because our life is never going to be the same," Carmichael said at the time.</p>
