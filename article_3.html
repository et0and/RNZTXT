            <p>A group of women narrowly escaped with their lives after their car stalled in the middle of a level crossing in Hamilton moments before a train passed through.</p>
        
            <p>Footage posted on TikTok, showed the four women quickly abandoning their car which broke down on the Grey St level crossing on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The car was struck by a freight train seconds later.</p>

            <p>Police commended the women "for doing the right thing by exiting the vehicle and going to a safe area when they could".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a KiwiRail spokesperson said the driver of the train had tried to brake but was unable to stop before hitting the car.</p>
        
            <p>"KiwiRail reminds the public that the rail corridor is an unforgiving environment and although in this case no-one was injured, the consequences of a collision can be catastrophic," the spokesperson said.</p>
