            <p>Horizons, the regional council of the ManawatÅ«-Whanganui region, is inviting people to share if they enjoy the sound of music or silence on Connect public transport services.</p>
        
            <p>Horizons transport manager Mark Read said the need to create an informed approach for music played on buses had come out of conversations with users and operators.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people love hearing the driver's pick of music when they get on board, while other people believe those wanting music should use headphones," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This can create difficult situations for drivers. We know some want to play music on board, but are unsure what genres are appropriate."</p>
        
            <p>The survey aimed to answer three key questions:</p>
        
            <p>"We hope by involving the public in the process we can get a policy which truly reflects what people want," Read said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also working directly with operators to ensure drivers' opinions are captured and used to inform our approach."</p>
