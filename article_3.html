        <h2>SailGP cancellation 'totally predictable', dolphin expert says</h2>
        <p>
Officials are being slammed for their decision to hold the event in Lyttelton Harbour after a dolphin sighting cancelled the first day of racing.

            <p>The cancellation of the first day of the SailGP event is a good thing because the races are being run in a poor location, says a marine biologist.</p>
        
            <p>SailGP is being run in Lyttelton for the second time after Auckland pulled out of hosting the event.</p>
        
            <p>But the first day of racing was abandoned entirely on Saturday after a dolphin was sighted on the course, delaying the start for two hours.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, two other dolphins were seen within 300 metres of boats.</p>
        
            <p>The second day of racing was due to get under way at 3pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University zoology professor emeritus Liz Slooten said it was normal for Hector's dolphins to be around the harbour at this time of year.</p>

            <p>"This was totally predictable."</p>
        
            <p>Two of her colleagues from Otago University were on an expert panel discussing the issue ahead of last year's race.</p>
        
            <p>"They already said, 'look, if you absolutely must do it in Lyttelton Harbour then you should do it in the middle of winter'."</p>
        
            <p>Slooten said she was pleased to hear Sir Russell Coutts wanted to move the event to Wellington or Queenstown next year.</p>
        
            <p>It was a poor decision from Christchurch officials to host the races, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This just seems to be a really bad bet, especially because these dolphins are actually very important economically to the Canterbury region.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of dolphin tourism on Akaroa Harbour. Really you don't want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg."</p>
        
            <p>There was huge public interest behind the mammals because they were native to Aotearoa and endangered, she said.</p>
        
            <p>SailGP has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>SailGP managing director Andy Thompson earlier said the event had a "robust" marine mammal management plan.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday was a "tough day" but conditions were looking "really top end" for Sunday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully the F50s will be out there ripping around and we can send the fans home super happy."</p>
