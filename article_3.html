            <p>Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has vowed to bring change to Britain as its next prime minister after storming to a landslide victory and ending 14 years of Conservative government.</p>
        
            <p>"Change begins now," Starmer said in a victory speech.</p>
        
            <p>"We said we would end the chaos, and we will, we said we would turn the page, and we have. Today, we start the next chapter, begin the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our country."</p>
        
            <p>Sunak had earlier conceded defeat and said he had called Starmer to congratulate him on his victory.</p>
        
            <p>"Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides," Sunak said after regaining his seat. "There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates ... I am sorry."</p>
        
            <p>The Labour Party has already won the 326 seats it needed to secure victory, but results from all electorates were still unfolding.</p>
