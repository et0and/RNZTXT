            <p>The artist behind a well-loved Dunedin mural says she has no idea why it has suddenly vanished.</p>
        
            <p>Polish artist Natalia Rak painted 'Love is in the Air' on the side of a Bond Street building in 2015, depicting two people sitting on a bench.</p>
        
            <p>It was recently replaced by a blank blue wall.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, I haven't received any information about the decision to cover my mural. This news has left me feeling a bit sad," Rak said.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand that murals in public spaces have a limited lifespan, and the paint fades over time. It's a part of the natural cycle of life and art.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite this, I hold onto the wonderful memories from Dunedin and the warm reception my mural received."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on social media, Dunedin Street Art Charitable Trust said the building's owners made them aware the mural would need to be removed as part of repairs to the wall.</p>
        
            <p>"They indicated they would be keen to host another mural and the [trust] will work with them to do this now the wall has been completed," it said. "We're working together now to come up with options for a new mural on that wall."</p>
        
            <p>Rak said she enjoyed her time in the city and would be interested in returning.</p>
        
            <p>"If the opportunity arises, I will be more than happy to paint another new mural in Dunedin."</p>
        
            <p>The work was part of a wider network of street art throughout the city centre, which the Trust had turned into a street art trail.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin City Council said the mural was not one of its projects.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to note murals like 'Love is in the Air' are only ever intended to be temporary artworks," a spokesperson said. "Ownership of them sits with building owners and they can remove them whenever they wish."</p>
