            <p>Century-maker Harry Brook has been dismissed for 171 this morning in the first test between New Zealand and England at Hagley Oval, in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Henry took the wicket.</p>
        
            <p>At the start of play on day three, England pair Brook and Ben Stokes returned to the crease at 319/5 as their side closed in on the Black Caps' first innings total of 348.</p>
        
            <p>Wickets are desperately needed, otherwise it may well be an uphill battle at New Zealand's next turn at bat.</p>
