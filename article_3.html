            <p>The board of trustees of Whangārei Boys' High School has been charged for health and safety failures over the death of a student on a caving trip.</p>
        
            <p>Karnin Petera, 15, died on a school trip to Abbey Caves on 9 May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Fourteen students and two adults were rescued from the cave in heavy rain. Karnin's body was later found.</p>
        
            <p>The school had a risk assessment done for the trip that stated Abbey Caves were "prone to flooding" in heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>It recommended to postpone the trip if water levels were too high.</p>
        
            <p>The trip went ahead, despite Northland being under a MetService orange rain warning.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said the charges had been filed against the legal entity of the Board of Trustees, not individual members of the board.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe's head of inspectorate Rob Pope said it acknowledged the "profound impact" Karnin's death had on whānau, friends, and the wider community.</p>
        
            <p>"A year on, our sympathy and thoughts are with all of those who knew and loved Karnin."</p>

            <p>An "extensive" investigation had now pieced together the circumstances of the tragedy and charges had been filed in the Whangārei District Court.</p>
        
            <p>"We encourage school boards of trustees across the country to reflect on their own systems and processes to ensure they are meeting legal requirements for education outside the classroom," Pope said.</p>
        
            <p>"Students should be able to participate safely, and parents must have confidence their rangatahi will be kept safe."</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe has charged the board under sections 36(2), 36(1)(a), 48(1) and 2(c) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Charges include:</p>
