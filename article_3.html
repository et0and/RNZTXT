            <p>Australian authorities are urging Queenslanders on the state's south-east coast to make their evacuation plans now, as the state's premier warns Tropical Cyclone Alfred could hit in the "middle of the night", late on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Premier David Crisafulli said emergency alerts were sent to people in at-risk areas on Wednesday morning, such as Moreton Island, the Gold Coast and the Redlands.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a chance this cyclone will cross in the middle of the night with a high tide," Crisafulli said.</p>
        
            <p>"That is not the time to be making your evacuation plan, now is the time."</p>
        
            <p>There is a risk that the category two cyclone could intensify after it makes landfall, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) modelling.</p>
        
            <p>BOM Senior Meteorologist Miriam Bradbury said Alfred's gale radius is now "very close to Cape Byron and Coolangatta".</p>
        
            <p>"We anticipate coastal gales beginning later today," she said.</p>

            <p>He said his cafe flooded in 2022 and now he wants to remain vigilant as Cyclone Alfred approaches.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely went under, like water did flow through the cafe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, some 200 years ago, this area was, was essentially an estuary. It's normal for water to [pool] in these areas."</p>

            <p>He said council has done some infrastructure work since.</p>
        
            <p>"But we are at risk of a storm surge through here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, the state's premier also confirmed more than 660 public schools in southern Queensland will be closed on Thursday and Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Gold Coast Acting Mayor Donna Gates is telling people not to leave their homes from 6pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>She urged residents to use common sense as the city braced for up to 800mm of rainfall in the coming days, with latest meteorological data on Wednesday saying the cyclone could cross the coastline between Tweed Heads and Caboolture early on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"The news today is that the system is intensifying," she said. </p>
        
            <p>"This looks like the most significant event in our city in terms of destructive winds and heavy rain that we've seen since 1954."</p>

            <p>Local government disaster assistance support has been activated for some local government areas.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management Minister Jenny McAllister said the package assured councils they would receive help for counter-disaster operations.</p>
        
            <p>Brisbane City Council announced it would suspend its bus fleet after last service on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Trains will also be suspended from Thursday until further notice.</p>
