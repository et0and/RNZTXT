        <h2>Why one atheist thinks the government should keep tax exemptions for churches</h2>
        <p>
Critics say that churches' exemption from paying income tax gives them an unfair competitive advantage. But one atheist says these tax laws are essential for a thriving society.

            <p>If the thousands of churches in New Zealand paid income tax, the government's coffers would be much richer.</p>
        
            <p>They don't, because most of them are registered religious charities, giving them tax-free status.</p>
        
            <p>That is under review by the government with submissions closing today. But one expert says they should be left alone, including the controversial ones such as Destiny Church and Gloriavale.</p>
        
            <p>Without churches, says Dr Juliet Chevalier-Watts, New Zealand would plunge into poverty and chaos.</p>
        
            <p>"Our societies would be horribly poor and would never recover from that," she says.</p>
        
            <p>And our taxes would rise as the government would have to pick up the work done by the churches' thousands of volunteers, says Chevalier-Watts, associate professor, Te Piringa - Faculty of Law at Waikato University.</p>
        
            <p>She started researching religion and charity law, including the economic impact and value of religious charities more than 10 years ago, with the belief that churches should pay tax.</p>
        
            <p>But she changed her mind and is defending churches as they face losing their tax-free status in a government review, with an announcement expected in the May budget.</p>
        
            <p>Chevalier-Watts and her research colleague Professor Frank Scrimgeour of Waikato University's School of Accounting, Finance and Economics based their research on the hypothesis that churches should not be exempt from paying tax income.</p>
        
            <p>They calculated that the country's 3000 churches that are registered as religious charities and their 65,000-odd volunteers were worth $6.1 billion to the New Zealand economy in 2018 alone.</p>
        
            <p>That excludes indirect benefits and flow-on effects across health and well-being, life-expectancy, employment, finances, education, social cohesion and pro-social behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Chevalier-Watts says the next phase of research will aim to put a value on that by looking at how the many churches provide food and accommodation, financial and job advice, as well as care for poor and elderly people.</p>
        
            <p>She points out that churches already pay taxes such as PAYE on salaries, and in some cases GST and when it comes to the government's review of the tax-free status of charities, she says churches should be left alone, including Destiny.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a very easy target and I think it takes away from what it actually is that Destiny Church does.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not to say that I condone the actions that took place the other week with some members of Destiny Church, certainly not. But also I should make it clear as well that some of those that carried out those acts were not part of Destiny Church.</p>
        
            <p>"For people to leap up and down and say Destiny Church must be stripped immediately of its [charity] registration status, well I think what they really need to be doing is actually looking overall at the real benefits of Destiny Church and what they have contributed to society."</p>
        
            <p>Under scrutiny in the government review are more than 29,000 charities, including churches, which raise funds through their business activities, RNZ money editor Susan Edmunds says.</p>
        
            <p>"They're looking at any loopholes that are being exploited that could mean that charities are avoiding tax that they probably should pay," she says.</p>
        
            <p>For example, questions have been raised over charitable businesses, such as Sanitarium, owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and Best Start childcare centres owned by charity Wright Family Foundation, that are competing with non-charitable businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a concern that [because] they don't pay tax they've got a bit of an advantage, or that they might set their prices unsustainably low," Edmunds says.</p>
        
            <p>She says New Zealand has become an international outlier for its charities' tax exemption which has been in place since 1940.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there's an easy answer. It will be interesting to see what the government comes up with."</p>
