            <p>The New Zealand U17 men's team have become the first New Zealand team to make it to the semi-finals of a FIBA age group World Cup, after stunning basketball heavyweights Lithuania.</p>
        
            <p>Despite being down 30-37 at half-time, the squad rallied in the second spell to beat Lithuania 73-65 in the quarter-finals of the FIBA U17 World Cup in Turkey.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand shook off a rough shooting performance with an improved defensive intensity - holding Lithuania to just 6-17 shooting in the pivotal fourth period.</p>
        
            <p>Oscar Goodman led the way with his 19-point, 10-rebound double-double. Jackson Kiss added 17 points - including eight points in the fourth - and eight rebounds.</p>
        
            <p>The highest New Zealand had achieved in its previous two FIBA U17 World Cups were 14th and 12th place respectively, and head coach Leyton Haddleton said confidence within the team was high.</p>
        
            <p>"There is an internal belief around this group that we can weather any storm, we can compete with anybody and we have proved it.</p>
        
            <p>"We're grateful to get anything more than we had, but we had a belief that we could be top four. Now it's just the 'cream on top' stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"What it shows is that even for a little country like New Zealand, we can compete with anyone. We've got some talented coaches from around the country that are working with many, many, many of our kids and this will be inspirational for them."</p>
        
            <p>The team also has ties to another New Zealand squad that reached the semi-finals at World Cup level 22 years ago - the Tall Blacks senior men's group that finished fourth overall at the FIBA World Championships at Indianapolis.</p>
        
            <p>One of the leaders of that squad was Phill Jones, and his son Hayden Jones plays a key role on this U17 men's national team. The latter said it was surreal to be heading to the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>"Amazing - this group of boys right here, I love them all. I couldn't have done it with anybody else.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is a small country, but we're coming up through the age groups and getting better and better every year. Our basketball is just getting amazing."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will next face tournament favourite the United States in the semi-finals - the toughest test yet for the team.</p>
