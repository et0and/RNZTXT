        <h2>Police search for driver after house falls off truck</h2>
        <p>
Speculation in the Far North as to what happened ranges from an amateur house-moving attempt gone horribly wrong to an extraordinarily brazen theft attempt.

            <p>Police are appealing for information about a bizarre incident involving a house falling off a truck, a blocked road, and a vanishing truckie.</p>
        
            <p>Speculation in the Far North as to what happened ranges from an amateur house-moving attempt gone horribly wrong to an extraordinarily brazen theft attempt.</p>
        
            <p>What is known for certain - as confirmed by the police and the Far North District Council - is that a house fell off the back of a truck on Orakau Road, in the Punakitere Valley south of Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesman said the incident came to light at 7.40am on Tuesday when a motorist reported coming across a house blocking the road.</p>
        
            <p>The truck was reported to have jack-knifed and crashed into a ditch some distance from the severely damaged house.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The spokesman said the truck driver was not at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Follow-up enquiries were underway to locate and speak to the driver.</p>
        
            <p>As to the background to the house-moving blunder, police were still in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have no immediate information to confirm speculation of a stolen house. If anyone in the community does have information regarding any criminal offending taking place, we would always advise people to report this."</p>
        
            <p>Information could be relayed to police by calling 105 or Crime Stoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Far North District Council spokesman said the house suffered extensive damage in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>It appeared the home had struck trees before coming off the trailer about 3.5km from Pokapu Road.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic management was put in place while a contractor widened the road by cutting into the bank.</p>
        
            <p>By mid-afternoon on Tuesday, the road was wide enough to allow trucks to pass, though the house was still on the road and traffic management remained in place.</p>
