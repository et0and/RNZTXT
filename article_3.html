            <p>Just one to two percent of the population are redheads - and those with ginger locks often find themselves alone in a crowd.</p>
        
            <p>But on Thursday night, a gathering of more than 100 people turned a Hastings bar into a sea of red.</p>
        
            <p>"For more than 30 years I've had this dream of walking into a cafe that was solely filled with redheads," said organiser Reverend Jill McDonald.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow ginger Neill Gordon got wind of the dream and together they made it happen.</p>

            <p>On St Brigids Day - the patron saint of redheads - a wave of ginger hair rippled through the Common Room bar in Hastings for 'Gingas in the Stings'.</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful, nothing short of beautiful," said Gordon.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got people of all ages, I've seen some tiny gingers come in, just babies, a lot of older gingers who once were gingers with their photos of their younger selves when they were in their ginger glory."</p>
        
            <p>The event was about joy, connection and solidarity - and being proud of the names that, for many, were thrown as slurs around the playground.</p>
        
            <p>"We're reclaiming tonight, all those names, so say it once, say it loud, I'm a ginga and I'm proud," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rangas rock."</p>
        
            <p>Red beer flowed from the tap behind the bar, the place was decked out with orange decorations, and allies, not blessed with fiery locks, donned wigs for the occasion.</p>

            <p>After a short prayer from the Reverend ("God, we thank you for gingers... amen,") and a singalong of 'Sweet Ginger Hair', to the tune of Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline, the competition began.</p>
        
            <p>A seven month old took out the ginger gem prize for the youngest ginger, and a teenage boy with a thick curly 'fro won the St Brigid prize for the most praiseworthy locks.</p>

            <p>Also celebrated were the most fanta-tastic beard, the longest red hair, revolutionary eyebrows, and a freckled few won spot prizes - including SPF50 sunscreen donated from local redhead-run businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Driving all the way from WhakatƒÅne for the occasion, Autumn Kempe - a strong contender for the longest locks - said she'd always wanted to be part of a gathering of ginger-haired friends.</p>
        
            <p>"Just to feel you fit in. Growing up in the eighties there was a lot of teasing and stuff going on there, and now I love having red hair."</p>
        
            <p>Some attended out of curiosity, while others wanted to band together for redhead pride.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really cool to see so many redheads in one spot. Normally, you get on a plane of 400 people and you're the only redhead on the plane. Here, you're just one of the crowd," said Dee Laidlaw from Havelock North.</p>

            <p>"My mum is a redhead too, so we just thought this was an amazing opportunity to show everyone that redheads are awesome," teenager Eleanor Grady said.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing all the redheads here all together, it just like, makes you feel special."</p>
        
            <p>And while the event was a bit of light hearted fun - it was indeed special for some.</p>
        
            <p>During the evening, Neill Gordon was approached by an emotional 13-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>"Amazing, beautiful head of red hair, and she was in tears ... she'd never felt so affirmed as a redhead in her life."</p>
        
            <p>That, he said, is what it was all about.</p>
