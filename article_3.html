            <p>Police abandoned 572,037 of the cases reported to them last year - that's almost 60 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In total, it received 962,521 emergency calls and reports in 2023, up 50 percent from 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The numbers were supplied to RNZ through the Official Information Act.</p>
        
            <p>Of the cases reported to police last year, 179,957 were closed without any investigation at all.</p>
        
            <p>Each case reported to police is assigned a numerical score to determine whether it can be solved in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
        
            <p>If a victim or witness can name a suspect, the case is given 10 points. If they have some evidence of a suspect but don't know who they are, the case is given just 2 points.</p>
        
            <p>Further descriptions of a suspect or their vehicle are worth between 2 and 7 points each, depending on the level of detail.</p>
        
            <p>Those points are added together and if the result is below 7 the case may be closed without any further investigation.</p>
        
            <p>A further 244,312 cases were abandoned after all "reasonable" avenues of enquiry were exhausted, meaning police had done everything they could but had not identified a suspect.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining 147,768 cases were abandoned at police discretion, meaning there were still avenues to pursue but police decided not to.</p>
        
            <p>The number of cases closed at police discretion saw the biggest increase, doubling from 7.5 percent of cases in 2019 to 15 percent of cases in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>During this same period the Police Association repeatedly expressed concerns that the force was under-resourced and struggling to retain staff.</p>
        
            <p>But NZ Police said it could not say whether a lack of resources had impacted the data.</p>
        
            <p>It said its records didn't keep track of which cases had been closed due to a lack of available staff or resources.</p>
