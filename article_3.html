            <p>The death of Carmen Walker in Waikato Hospital after a cancer procedure was caused by an adverse reaction to a "dirty" drug as well as blood loss, a coroner has found.</p>
        
            <p>However, the blood loss was not due to excess blood being drained from Walker's body during the procedure, but more likely a combination of other bleeding, Coroner Alexander Ho said.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Ho, who released his findings into the 2010 death on Friday, found 78-year-old Walker died from complications of the isolated limb infusion procedure (ILI) to treat a melanoma in her leg.</p>
        
            <p>These were blood loss, and an adverse reaction to protamine - a drug used at the end of a procedure to reverse anti-blood clotting medication.</p>
        
            <p>The source of the blood loss was unknown but could have included any combination of gastrointestinal bleeding, internal haemorrhage, the anticipated blood loss as part of the ILI, and external bleeding, Coroner Ho said.</p>
        
            <p>The ILI procedure involves cutting off the circulation to the diseased leg with tourniquets, injecting chemotherapy drug melphalan into the leg to "bathe" the cancerous cells, washing out the limb to remove the drug and tainted blood, then releasing the tourniquets.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Ho said the "unlikely coincidence of two relatively uncommon events" both occurring had to be assessed against three things:</p>
        
            <p>At that point, a second arterial blood gas test showed Walker had a severely low haemoglobin of 28, later deemed by a pathologist to be incompatible with life.</p>
        
            <p>An earlier image of her heart showed the left ventricle "very empty", indicating hypovolaemia - when the body loses fluid such as blood and water.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner ruled out the tourniquets not working properly.</p>
        
            <p>An unrecognised tourniquet leak could have allowed Walker's entire circulating blood to seep into the leg and drain out of her body during the limb washout without anyone realising.</p>
        
            <p>But the bucket used to collect the washout did not provide measurements, and the lead surgeon - who has name suppression - told the inquest measured buckets were previously used but resourcing constraints led to their disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Ho said resourcing constraints were outside the scope of the inquest and that ILI procedures were no longer performed in New Zealand so he could not make specific recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>"Nonetheless, I observe that, for procedures involving some element of blood drainage, it would be prudent to drain it into a measurable container."</p>
        
            <p>The coroner accepted evidence from the anaesthetist - whose name is also suppressed - that it was sensible for adverse reaction to be treated as the probable cause of Walker's crash.</p>
        
            <p>He said her age and physical condition - though fit and active she had hardened arteries and was on beta blockers for high blood pressure - inhibited her ability to tolerate and recover from the complications.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner found the surgeon and anaesthetist did nothing wrong, including during the marathon 90-minute resuscitation.</p>
        
            <p>"Mrs Walker's death occurred in spite of, not because of, the decisions that were made regarding her resuscitation."</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Ho also noted the decision of the on-call intensive care specialist, Dr John Torrance, to provide end-of-life care instead of administering the rest of the protamine to stop Walker bleeding out was correct.</p>
        
            <p>However, the pathologist who changed his finding for Walker's cause of death, prompting the Solicitor-General to reopen the inquiry, was criticised in the 47-page report.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Ian Beer conducted the post-mortem on Walker without her medical notes which the inquest heard was not acceptable medical practice, and the coroner preferred the evidence of a former ICU first-year doctor about a potential gastrointestional haemorrhage than Beer's testimony that he found none.</p>
        
            <p>Walker's family told RNZ they were shocked and disappointed with the finding.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Waikato acknowledged the findings and said it recognised the huge loss of Walker.</p>
