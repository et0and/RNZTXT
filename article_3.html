            <p>This week we've had our snouts in the good old-fashioned Griffins biscuit sampler box that one of our producers bought, and boy, has it brought back the memories.</p>
        
            <p>And it's proved controversial. There used to be a broader selection in the box, and some of you don't agree with the designated survivors. What happened to the Swiss Creme? And didn't the pink wafer used to be a wafer finger?</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint asked people about their Christmas biscuit habits, starting with which one they reach for first.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't have that one - hundreds and thousands, not really my thing," one person said.</p>
        
            <p>"Chocolate Wheaten," said another. "I wouldn't do a pink wafer or a chocolate chip," said a third.</p>
        
            <p>Some asked what happened to the Cameo Creme.</p>
        
            <p>Griffin's NZ marketing director Hannah McKee said the origin of the sampler box was lost to history, but she had seen a "snippet from a Nelson newspaper which celebrates the sampler with 19 different biscuits in 1931".</p>
        
            <p>She said the decisions on which biscuits go in go "all the way to the boardroom". There are presently nine flavours in the sampler.</p>
        
            <p>"Nine's pretty good and it's 86 biscuits in total, so there's plenty in there for friends and family, for sure."</p>

            <p>She said there had been backlash about which flavours make the cut.</p>
        
            <p>"We get people dialling in to our customer services team all the time asking for their favourites to be included… it comes down to ones that won't impact on others.</p>
        
            <p>"So something like a Griffin's Gingernut wouldn't be safe in a sampler box because it would make your little pink wafers or your choc fins taste a bit gingery, so we need to make sure they are bikkies that stand on their own. So it's a very careful compilation of flavours in there."</p>
        
            <p>Peppermints were also "not friends of the sampler family."</p>
        
            <p>"We try not to mix it up too much, so that particular box has stayed the same for many years. We make it once a year, we sell it from about October through to February. So we do review it annually, but we don't look to make changes lightly."</p>
        
            <p>As for the Cameo Creme, McKee said to "keep an eye out for Christmas 2025".</p>
