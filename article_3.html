        <h2>Principal dismayed over 'completely inappropriate' redesign</h2>
        <p>
A college principal says she is horrified at what has happened to her school's building project - even though it is supposedly a top priority.

The additions to Rolleston College were due to start later this year but have been delayed until 2026, the school says.

            <p>A college principal says she is horrified at what has happened to her school's building project - even though it is supposedly a top priority.</p>
        
            <p>Rolleston College agreed in December to new classrooms, a tech block and gym at its senior campus west of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>But tumuaki Rachel Skelton said that was now being cut back, even though officials told her the school was the number one priority.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm horrified - if that is what the top priority school is given, I'm really concerned about what other schools are being offered," she said on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Darren Sudlow said his son, in year 11, "won't make it to that new build at all, from what I can see."</p>
        
            <p>A two-year delay already to expanding the main campus - the expansion opens in July - had already caused overcrowding, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not an ideal environment going forward at all."</p>
        
            <p>The main campus was originally a public-private partnership, "an exciting build", but now space was under threat.</p>
        
            <p>"The government has lots of rhetoric around improving educational outcomes. How can you do that if the learning environments, the physical environments, are not fit for purpose?</p>
        
            <p>"You can't just cut it back from what was planned, although this seems to be happening all over the place."</p>
        
            <p>The ministry is reviewing 350 new school builds and renovations after the government slammed it for under-delivering amid cost over-runs.</p>
        
            <p>Skelton said the ministry told her last Thursday this review would not impact her college's big build.</p>
        
            <p>However, she also learned it had "chosen to strip back, redesign, and delay the new campus", with a two-year delay till 2026 to even start a build meant to start in mid-2024, and drastic plan changes, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Instead of classrooms, the new plan was for "makeshift portacom buildings indefinitely", with no purpose-built fit-outs, a school statement said.</p>
        
            <p>The science and tech block would undergo minimal alterations, but a gym redesign eliminated all classroom space, and space for nurses and counsellors and a staffroom.</p>
        
            <p>"The presented plan means the campus cannot function as a school and is completely inappropriate."</p>

            <p>The ministry had costed the stripped-back plan at $52 million - and told her they would need to find further savings on top of that, Skelton said.</p>
        
            <p>The school was not consulted on the revised plan - it was presented as a done deal, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just absolutely baffled, we're devastated."</p>
        
            <p>The plan agreed in December was to cater for years 11-13 in a senior campus 2.5km from the main campus, envisaging roll growth to 2100 senior students, in the fast-growing Selwyn district, which was about to add a tenth primary as a feeder for Rolleston College.</p>
        
            <p>The site works were already done, and billboards had gone up promoting what had been a three-stage build.</p>
        
            <p>"They said categorically there was no appetite or commitment to continuing with stages two and three."</p>
        
            <p>But the ministry said growth in the area was high and "additional capacity... further stages of development will continue to grow the campus over time as the college roll grows".</p>
        
            <p>For now, though it had reduced the scope of the first stage of the build to "reflect what is needed when the campus opens".</p>
        
            <p>Stage one would include a 24-classroom science-and-tech block, a single-court gymnasium and 12 temporary classrooms.</p>
        
            <p>The college had raised issues and they were continuing to work with it, said head of property Sam Fowler in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The second senior campus was a priority under the National Education Growth Plan, but ensuring investments met the needs countrywide "can mean the staging of new schools with a plan to expand over time, or the opening of schools in temporary facilities while permanent facilities are planned and delivered".</p>
        
            <p>The school is asking senior government ministers to visit to hear their plea.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, Auckland Girls' Grammar School had believed it was poised to get a new gym, but now worries it will not.</p>
        
            <p>Its gym has been described as "sliding" down a slope since incurring storm damage.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a cohort of Year 13 students who have never accessed their PE/Health curriculum through a gymnasium facility as the gym has been closed because it has been unsafe all of their time," principal Ngaire Ashmore said.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought we were just about over the line with with progress and money to fund the remediation process but the funds have come up short.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hoping (fingers crossed) that the MOE will approve the extra funding needed to reinstate the gymnasium."</p>
