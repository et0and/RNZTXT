            <p>Wellington faces mass disruption today, as tens of thousands of people converge on the city for the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>People on foot and in cars began making their way into central Wellington from the early hours of this morning.</p>
        
            <p>One group on foot left McEwan Park in Petone at 4am - with the walking route stretching along the Petone Esplanade, then State Highway 2, Old Hutt Road, and Thorndon Quay - with a planned arrival time at the Wellington Train Station of 8.30am.</p>
        
            <p>A second group, mostly in cars or on public transport, were leaving Porirua at 6am, heading down Ngauranga Gorge and converging with the other group at Old Hutt Road.</p>
        
            <p>The combined group would then head for the Railway Station by 8.30am, and then to Waitangi Park, before heading back through the city to Parliament along the Golden Mile (Courtenay Place, Manners Street, Willis Street and Lambton Quay) by midday.</p>
        
            <p>By 4pm, people would return to Waitangi Park for a concert, karakia, and farewell.</p>
        
            <p>According to the council, Wellington Station bus hub would be closed, with buses diverted to nearby locations.</p>
        
            <p>There would be extra train capacity outside of peak time (9am-3pm) to facilitate extra people coming to the city.</p>
        
            <p>Buses around the city were likely to be re-routed, and people should check the Metlink app or website and expect delays to scheduled timetables.</p>
        
            <p>Some parking around the city would be reserved for vehicles travelling with the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>Parking enforcement would remain throughout the city, the council said, and illegally parked vehicles would be ticketed and potentially towed.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Health NZ warned those with appointments booked at Wellington Hospital on Tuesday to allow extra travel time.</p>
        
            <p>"With the national Hīkoi arriving in Wellington on Tuesday, 19 November, Health NZ anticipates there may be significant congestion on the region's roads."</p>
        
            <p>But it said staff would try to accommodate people on the day.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Willacy from the Backbencher pub and Cellar-vate cafe said he was not expecting any problems, but he did not think business would be booming.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots of the locals will be probably staying away, because they can't get round here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Lots of our visitors will be coming just for the hīkoi, hopefully they come and see us at the pub, or come and get a coffee off us on the way back to the party down the other end of town."</p>
        
            <p>A pamphlet given out to businesses, written by Together for Te Tiriti, says the atmosphere will be energetic and welcoming, focused on unity.</p>
        
            <p>Welly Collective worker Lorenzo Vichi said he was expecting many people to be on the road, but he was confident the protest would remain calm.</p>
        
            <p>"From what I've seen in New Zealand, protests are pretty calm, so I'm not worried."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped some of those passers-by might convert into customers.</p>
        
            <p>Police say there have been "no significant issues" as the hīkoi prepared to move into Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>But they asked motorists travelling around the wider Wellington region to plan ahead and take extra caution on the roads.</p>
