        <h2>Call for councillor Martin Bosley to step down from community board</h2>
        <p>
It follows a council committee meeting at which Bosley said the thought of giving community boards more power "terrifies" him.

            <p>A concerned citizens group in South Wairarapa has called for one of the district's councillors to step down from the Greytown Community Board.</p>
        
            <p>It follows a council committee meeting at which Martin Bosley said the thought of giving community boards more power "terrifies" him.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the idea of a community board is fundamentally a good one but I think the mechanics of it and who ends up there is problematic at best," the councillor said.</p>
        
            <p>The comments were made during representation review discussions after which the council voted to progress a consultation proposal to disestablish the district's three community boards.</p>
        
            <p>The Citizens for Democratic Quality Community Governance said it appeared to them that Bosley had "lost confidence in the role of the Greytown Community Board".</p>
        
            <p>"With this in mind, and considering the [Terms of Reference of the board], councillor Bosley may be only too happy to relinquish his role as a councillor representative on the Community Board," they said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the members of the citizens group was Greytown Community Board member Warren Woodgyer.</p>
        
            <p>But Bosley said the statements made by the group had misrepresented his views and intentions regarding the Greytown Community Board [GCB].</p>
        
            <p>"I wish to clarify that I have not lost confidence in the role of the GCB, and I have no intention of resigning from my position as a councillor representative on the GCB," Bosley said.</p>
        
            <p>"While the council undertakes a representation review, including the role of community boards, I have questioned if they are still fit for purpose.</p>
        
            <p>"The GCB itself only has one elected member, with the rest appointed due to a lack of candidates standing for election.</p>
        
            <p>"I fully support the work the GCB is currently doing, am an active board member, and I have committed to keeping an open mind as to the overall future of community boards."</p>
        
            <p>He said any suggestion that he had lost confidence in the GCB was "completely unfounded and do not reflect my views or statements".</p>
        
            <p>"On the contrary, I remain committed to working collaboratively with the GCB and supporting its initiatives to benefit our community."</p>

            <p>The Citizens for Quality Community Governance group asked South Wairarapa District Council's chief executive Janice Smith to place the issue on a council agenda for discussion and a determination by councillors.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that ... councillor Bosley has crossed the line in his public statements about Community Board representation."</p>
        
            <p>They noted the Terms of Reference for South Wairarapa District Council community boards state a person should raise their concerns about the community board's performance with the community board first.</p>
        
            <p>"If they feel their concerns have not been addressed, they should raise the matter with the chief executive if it is a management matter or the Mayor if it is a governance matter," the document states.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel that the above issues are of sufficient importance to be placed on a South Wairarapa District Council committee agenda for discussion and a determination by councillors," the citizens group said</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson told Local Democracy Reporting that the group's request would not be taken further or discussed at council.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the group are: Warren Woodgyer, Mike Gray, Perry Cameron, Claire Bleakley, Mary Tipoki, and Jim Hedley.</p>
