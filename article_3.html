            <p>A number of Australian tourists are in critical condition in hospital in Fiji after what authorities say is a suspected case of alcohol poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>Local health officials say seven guests staying at the Warwick Resort on Fiji's Coral Coast fell ill after consuming a cocktail at the resort's bar on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>They were taken to the nearby Sigatoka Hospital with "nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms".</p>
        
            <p>Two of the group were later taken to the Lautoka Hospital, north of Fiji's tourist hotspot of Nadi, because of the severity of their conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC understands one, a 56-year-old Australian woman, is under constant surveillance in hospital. Another, a 19-year-old woman, is also experiencing serious medical episodes from the suspected poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood two other Australian women, a 49-year-old and an 18-year-old, are still critical but their conditions are currently not as serious.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known what the group consumed to cause the medical episodes.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood four of the group of seven who fell ill are Australians. The nationalities of the other three are not yet known.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji Police confirmed they are investigating the incident and along with local health inspectors.</p>
        
            <p>A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said consular assistance was being provided to two Australian families in Fiji.</p>
