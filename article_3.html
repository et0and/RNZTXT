            <p>Black Ferns co-captain Ruahei Demant will shift back to the No 10 jersey when the side plays Ireland in their opening WXV 1 test in Canada on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns selectors experimented with Demant at No 12 for their one-off test against England, which they lost 24-12 at Twickenham earlier this month, with youngster Hannah King at No 10.</p>
        
            <p>While they were happy enough with King's performance, she drops to the reserves, as attacking midfielders Amy du Plessis and Logo-i-Pulotu Lemapu-Atai'i (Sylvia) Brunt return to the line-up in Vancouver.</p>
        
            <p>Ruby Tui, who started off the bench at Twickenham, will start on the right wing.</p>
        
            <p>In the forwards, hooker Atlanta Lolohea will have her first test start in just her third appearance, while Marcelle Parkes will have her first start at prop, after having a previous test start at loose forward.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns director of rugby Alan Bunting said both players were deserving of their selections.</p>
        
            <p>"Marcelle's place in the starting side is testament to her perseverance and dedication to transition into the front row. Atlanta's drive and commitment to grow is outstanding and we are looking forward to seeing both of them enjoy this opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>In other changes to the playing 23, tighthead prop Amy Rule will start alongside Parkes and Lolohea, while Layla Sae will start at No 6, with co-captain Kennedy Tukuafu (nee Simon) at openside and Liana Mikaele-Tu'u shifting to No 8.</p>
        
            <p>On the bench, hooker Luka Connor joins fellow front rowers Chryss Viliko and Tanya Kalounivale, while loose forward Lucy Jenkins and utility back Mererangi Paul are named for the first time on this tour.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns have only ever played Ireland three times, with the last match being in Dublin in 2016, with New Zealand winning by 30 points.</p>
        
            <p>"With the changes we have made to our 23, it offers an opportunity to grow different combinations as we build into the tournament,'' Bunting said.</p>
        
            <p>England and USA kick off the WXV 1 tournament on Sunday, followed by Canada and France, and then New Zealand and Ireland close out the round.</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns: 1 Marcelle Parkes, 2 Atlanta Lolohea, 3 Amy Rule, 4 Chelsea Bremner, 5 Maiakawanakaulani Roos, 6 Layla Sae, 7 Kennedy Tukuafu (co-captain), 8 Liana Mikaele-Tu'u, 9 Maia Joseph, 10 Ruahei Demant (co-captain), 11 Katelyn Vahaakolo, 12 Amy du Plessis, 13 Logo-i-Pulotu Lemapu-Atai'i (Sylvia) Brunt, 14 Ruby Tui , 15 Renee Holmes.</p>
        
            <p>Reserves: 16 Luka Connor, 17 Chryss Viliko, 18 Tanya Kalounivale, 19 Alana Bremner, 20 Lucy Jenkins, 21 Iritana Hohaia, 22 Hannah King, 23 Mererangi Paul.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 3pm Monday, 30 September NZT</p>
