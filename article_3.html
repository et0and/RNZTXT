            <p>Refugee athlete Manizha Talash has been disqualified for displaying the words "free Afghan women" on her outfit during her Olympic breaking battle in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The Afghan, who was competing for the Refugee Olympic Team as B-girl Talash, had the message emblazoned in large letters on a cape she wore in her pre-qualifying battle against India of the Netherlands as the dance sport made its Games debut.</p>
        
            <p>Talash lost but was later also disqualified because political statements and slogans are banned on the field of play at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to show people what is possible," she told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>Talash, originally from Kabul, lives in Spain and is one of 37 athletes competing for the refugee team.</p>
        
            <p>She fled Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power in 2021 and effectively banned music and dancing, and barred females from classrooms and gyms.</p>
        
            <p>The Taliban says they respect women's rights in line with Sharia law.</p>
        
            <p>Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter states "no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas".</p>
        
            <p>It says if there is a breach, each incident will be evaluated by their respective National Olympic Committee, International Federation and the International Olympic Committee, and disciplinary action will be taken on a case-by-case basis as necessary.</p>
        
            <p>Talash was eliminated from the competition before the round-robin stage but her message will have been seen on the biggest stage her sport has ever been on.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympics' newest sport will not be at Los Angeles 2028 although it will be hoping to show enough potential to be considered for Brisbane 2032.</p>
