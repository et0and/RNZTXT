            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko is well in the hunt for a maiden Women's British Open title after a third round 71 to sit three shots off the leader - South Korea's Shin Ji-yai.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic gold medalist, who was tied for fifth with another five players after two rounds, is now four-under for the tournament, tied for fourth alongside South Korean Jenny Shin.</p>
        
            <p>Shin Ji-yai is one step closer to a third women's British Open title after carding a five-under-par 67 to claim a one-stroke lead heading into the final round at the Open at St Andrews, in Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>Shin collected seven birdies against two bogeys in breezy conditions. The 36-year-old has a three-round total of seven-under 209 and is bidding for her 12th victory on the LPGA Tour.</p>
        
            <p>She sits one shot ahead of defending champion Lilia Vu (71). Second-round leader Nelly Korda (75) dropped into third place at five-under after carding five bogeys and a double-bogey on the 16th hole.</p>
        
            <p>The winds are expected to be challenging for the final round and possible rain is also forecast.</p>
