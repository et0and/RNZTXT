            <p>China's top spy agency has accused New Zealand of harassing and intimidating Chinese citizens in this country.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of State Security made an online post, following up on the Chinese embassy complaining about the same thing a few days ago.</p>
        
            <p>The SIS earlier confirmed it had engaged with individuals connected with certain "front" organisations to dissuade them from activities that impacted national security.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said in a WeChat post that the SIS recent annual threat assessment made unfounded claims of a Chinese intelligence threat.</p>
        
            <p>Investigations here of Chinese nationals were "deeply malicious and unacceptable" and motivated by ideological bias, the South China Morning Post quoted the ministry.</p>
        
            <p>The embassy had protested that the SIS report was unfair and had sparked harassment of several Chinese nationals.</p>
        
            <p>The SIS confirmed it had engaged with individuals connected with certain front organisations to "dissuade them from engaging in activities that were not in accordance with New Zealand's national security".</p>
        
            <p>"This is an example of NZSIS doing its job," it said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Chinese Association's Richard Leung in a meeting with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, called on New Zealand to consider registering foreign agents, as the likes of Australia does, because foreign interference was impacting democracy.</p>
