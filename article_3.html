            <p>A pensioner's battle for new windows, raw sewage overflowing in backyards, a rates bill blunder and devastating floods across the motu. Editor Marika Hill looks back at the big stories from Local Democracy Reporting in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>In a big win for local democracy, the ombudsman rebuked councils for holding secret meetings.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier launched a review of eight councils after complaints they were "undermining local democracy" by shutting the public out from some meetings.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation found some councils used closed-door workshops as a "safe space" to ask "silly questions" - an excuse Boshier did not accept. He recommended workshops only be closed when it was "reasonable".</p>
        
            <p>"Elected members should be resilient enough to withstand reasonable public scrutiny. It is the job they are elected to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The findings and subsequent media attention forced councils to be more transparent.</p>
        
            <p>It's an example of Local Democracy reporters shining a light on an important issue. However, it is not just the big national wins that matter.</p>
        
            <p>In Rotorua, reporter Laura Smith spoke with pensioner Mary Smith, who had been waiting two years for her council landlord to fix chipped and flaky single-glazed windows. Within a week of the news story being published, she had her new windows and a big smile on her face.</p>
        
            <p>In December, Local Democracy Rotorua also delved into a controversial sewerage scheme through a series of stories, and reported on 20 people forced to move out of a dangerous lodge.</p>
        
            <p>Further South, Wairarapa reporters Sue Teodoro and Emily Ireland had another win for residents.</p>
        
            <p>For years raw sewage spilled into the backyards of properties on a Masterton road during heavy rain. "I'm so f***ing tired of fighting for our rights to human decency," a tearful Jaimee Charters told the council in April.</p>
        
            <p>After a series of news stories, a fix finally came for 21 properties just in time for Christmas 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Teodoro also covered a legal stoush between Te Whatu Ora and Masterton District Council over an earthquake-prone hospital, and the support package for flood-damaged Tinui homes.</p>
        
            <p>Destructive weather systems was a common theme throughout the year.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne-based reporter Matthew Rosenberg was on the ground after Cyclone Gabrielle tore through the region in February. He spoke with a couple tasked with an eye-watering clean-up.</p>
        
            <p>Rosenberg also looked at how slash and whole trees from the council's joint-venture forest appeared to play a significant role in damaging the city's main water supply.</p>
        
            <p>In Northland, a couple clung to the outside of a fire engine as they were rescued in the dark from their Awakino Point home on 14 February amid rising floodwaters.</p>
        
            <p>"It was life and death," Ash Nayyar told Local Democracy reporter Susan Botting at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Flash floods also swept through Waihi amid "the most violent of weather" in May. Reporter Alisha Evans spoke to pensioners who lost their homes, while also raising the question of whether the warnings were heeded.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson was also in the firing line of stormy weather, including trees that "became missiles" during a tornado in April.</p>
        
            <p>Reporter Max Frethey spoke to displaced Nelson residents who felt it was not fair they were not offered the accommodation support given to storm-affected residents up north. A month after the story was published, the government rolled out support for Nelson too.</p>
        
            <p>In a Marlborough Sounds bay, neighbours were shocked to notice native trees being cleared for a council-consented zigzagging driveway. They knew it was a risky design. Two severe weather events followed, and the driveway slipped, Maia Hart reported.</p>
        
            <p>Political showdowns also made for some heated council meetings.</p>
        
            <p>Tears and accusations flew as right-leaning majority took over the Northland Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>In South Wairarapa, councillors passed a vote of no confidence in mayor Martin Connelly in October.</p>
        
            <p>Māori wards also sparked emotional debates across the country. Applause and waiata rang out when the Western Bay of Plenty District Council voted for the establishment of Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>In Whanganui, reporter Moana Evans took a detailed look at the questions around Māori wards for her region. While in Kaikōura, reporter David Hill reported on the council voting against creating a Māori ward after feedback from the local rūnanga.</p>
        
            <p>Reporters also covered the mistakes, conflicts and controversy in their regions.</p>
        
            <p>On the West Coast, Brendon McMahon reported on a rates blunder that left thousands overcharged. Just before Christmas, the corrected invoices were finally mailed out to ratepayers after a string of stories by McMahon.</p>
        
            <p>He also reported on the problem-plagued Taylorville landfill site, where two workers were overcome by noxious gas while working there in August.</p>
        
            <p>The plight of Franz Josef and Waiho Flat residents - who live by "most dangerous flood plain in the country" - also made national headlines.</p>

            <p>In Gisborne, reporter Matthew Rosenberg wrote about Sarge, the family pet euthanised by a Gisborne District Council staff member in September.</p>
        
            <p>It sparked an investigation, which found a 'tired' animal control officer mistakenly killed the wrong dog.</p>
        
            <p>Alisha Evans covered a court battle over rottweiler Chopper, who bit a vet in Tauranga. The attack left the vet requiring two surgeries.</p>
        
            <p>In an emotionally-charged court appearance, the dog's owner was convicted of owning a dog causing injury and Chopper was ordered to be put down.</p>
        
            <p>Reporter Jonathan Leask wrote a series of stories on the blow out and delays of the new library and civic centre in Ashburton. Just before Christmas, he reported on the latest delay for the move.</p>
        
            <p>In Nelson, a 182-year-old spelling mistake caused a stir with many in the community pushing for the street's name to change change.</p>
        
            <p>Whakatāne's mayor was not happy with a national initiative to lower speeds. Victor Luca described a plan to lower speeds in local towns to 30km/h as fanatical, Diane McCarthy reported. The new government is now looking at reversing the speed reduction policy.</p>
        
            <p>A move to install cameras and sensors in toilet corridors at Rangiora High School to combat vaping also sparked nationwide debate on the issue. Also in North Canterbury, reporter David Hill has been following a bid to gain dark sky park status for the 11,350ha Oxford Forest Conservation Area.</p>

            <p>It's not always about the hard news stories that capture readers' attention.</p>
        
            <p>In one of our favourite good news stories, Sue Teodoro spoke with famed author Joy Cowley after having the Featherston playground named after her.</p>
        
            <p>"There is something about me that has never grown up and I fit a playground beautifully.</p>
        
            <p>"The child in me will never die," she told Teodoro.</p>
