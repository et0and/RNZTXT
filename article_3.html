            <p>We have reached the final of UEFA's flagship men's international tournament, with two of Europe's biggest footballing nations, Spain and England, awaiting each other in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Spain have been the outstanding team of the tournament and dispatched France in the semis, with a little help from the prodigious talents of 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.</p>
        
            <p>England, meanwhile, left it late, with substitute Ollie Watkins rifling home in the final minute against the Netherlands after manager Gareth Southgate's gamble off the bench paid dividends.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off is at 7am NZT.</p>
