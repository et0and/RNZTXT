            <p>A teenager who killed her boyfriend's 2-year-old daughter has been sentenced to 5 years and 7 months in jail for manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>Jessica Lee Rose Mulford, now 20, was found guilty at a trial last year in Hamilton of killing Harlee-Rose Niven in April 2022.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, in the High Court at Hamilton, Justice Campbell sentenced Mulford to jail for causing the violent death of the child.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard from distraught members of Harlee-Rose's wider family, including her mother Paige Niven, who says Mulford stole the light of her life.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
