            <p>Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain could be on the way for many areas of the North Island, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>The warnings and watches cover many regions, including Wellington, Auckland, Northland, Great Barrier Island, Coromandel, the Bay of Plenty and Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the Wellington and Wairarapa had been warned to stay inside and away from windows, with heavy thunderstorms set to batter the region.</p>
        
            <p>MetService issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Wellington City, Hutt City and South Wairarapa, after detecting severe storms near offshore Mana Island and near Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The bad weather was expected to rest near Wellington, Porirua, Wellington's south coast, Palliser Bay and Baring Head, moving later to the southern Remutaka Ranges.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain and hail had also been forecast, and residents are being encouraged to keep indoors and check that drains are cleared.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, MetService meteorologist Ngaire Wotherspoon said Northland, Auckland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty down to north of Gisborne should be prepared for downpours.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasters issued a watch notice for the period from 6pm Sunday to midnight, due to an unstable northwest airflow.</p>
        
            <p>Downfalls between 25 and 40 millimetres per hour were forecast, with a risk of hail and a low risk of tornadoes, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Rainfall of this intensity could cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and might also lead to slips, the MetService notice said.</p>
        
            <p>It urged people to plan ahead, and be vigilant for changing or threatening conditions; and to stay updated on weather warnings.</p>
        
            <p>"Driving conditions will also be hazardous, with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain."</p>
        
            <p>The weather was expected to ease after 10pm for areas in the north.</p>
