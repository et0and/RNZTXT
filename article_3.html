        <h2>How the world reacted to the Treaty bill debate</h2>
        <p>
The suspension of Parliament over a haka and the national hīkoi by thousands of people are garnering international headlines.
</p>
        
            <p>The suspension of Parliament following a haka during debate on the Treaty Principles Bill on Thursday has garnered international attention.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke was suspended from Parliament and "named" after leading the haka.</p>
        
            <p>Labour MP Willie Jackson was also ejected from Parliament during the debate.</p>
        
            <p>BBC said the Treaty values had been "woven" into New Zealand laws "in an effort to redress the wrong done to Māori during colonisation".</p>
        
            <p>"The country is often considered a leader in indigenous rights, but opponents of the bill fear those same rights are being put at risk by this bill."</p>

            <p>The Guardian said there had been "significant public backlash to the bill" and also covered the national hīkoi that is making its way to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand's parliament has erupted into fiery debate, personal attacks and a haka over a controversial bill that proposes to radically alter the way New Zealand's treaty between Māori and the crown is interpreted," it reported.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's ABC News called it a " landmark vote" on the Treaty Principles Bill on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>International news agency Reuters said Parliament was "briefly suspended as people in the gallery joined in, and shouting drowned out others in the chamber".</p>
        
            <p>"The controversial legislation, however, is seen by many Māori and their supporters as undermining the rights of the country's Indigenous people, who make up around 20 per cent of the population of 5.3 million."</p>
        
            <p>The Sydney Morning Herald's story was headlined: "Haka interrupts NZ parliament, MPs kicked out, as treaty bill arrives".</p>
