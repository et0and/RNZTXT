            <p>Pope Francis has shown the onset of bilaterial pneumonia and his respiratory infection "continues to present a complex picture", the Vatican says.</p>
        
            <p>The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on 14 February.</p>
        
            <p>Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed, and in recent times has been prone to lung infections.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier the Vatican said doctors had changed treatment for Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection to tackle a "complex clinical situation" and that he would will remain in hospital for as long as necessary.</p>
