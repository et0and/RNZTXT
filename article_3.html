            <p>I have just read your answer about the superannuation not being means tested... but my dad got a phone call from Inland Revenue to say that his tax bracket was wrong because he started to earn too much. Isn't that 'means tested'?</p>
        
            <p>A couple of people pointed out that I may have been a little simplistic when I told someone last week that their pension won't be affected by either their KiwiSaver or continuing to work.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's pension is not means- or income-tested. That means, in general, you are entitled to the same amount whether you're in full time work earning $300,000 a year or completely reliant on the pension, and it doesn't matter how much money you have in the bank</p>
        
            <p>(There are some foreign pensions that offset New Zealand Super, but that's probably a topic for another column.)</p>
        
            <p>But, as you point out, if you are working and getting the pension, you could find that you are pushed into a higher tax bracket.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has a marginal tax system, where you are taxed more as you earn more.</p>

            <p>The first $15,600 you earn each year is taxed at 10.5 percent. Then, income between $15,601 and $53,500 is taxed at 17.5 percent. Income between $53,501 and $78,100 is taxed at 30 percent and between $78,101 and $180.000 is taxed at 33 percent. Anything you earn over $180,000 is taxed at 39 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That means you could end up with part of your income taxed at a higher rate if the combination of your salary and the pension pushes you into a higher bracket.</p>
        
            <p>You may also find that things like KiwiSaver can affect your accommodation supplement - you can only qualify for this if you have assets as a single person of $8100, and $16,200 for a couple.</p>
        
            <p>But the base level of the pension remains the same.</p>
        
            <p>I am a sole trader. If I pay into my KiwiSaver from my work account, is it drawings or 'employer contribution'? </p>
        
            <p>Robyn Walker, a partner at Deloitte, says because all contributions into KiwiSaver accounts are fully subject to tax, the label you put on the payment is slightly irrelevant from a tax perspective.</p>
        
            <p>"That said, a sole trader is not an employee and does not employ themselves, and therefore a payment can't technically be made as an 'employer contribution'; as such the contribution should be treated as drawings and tax paid accordingly."</p>
