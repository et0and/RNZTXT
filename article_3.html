        <h2>'Hope they all rip into him': Warriors prepare frosty reception for former fan favourite Tevaga</h2>
        <p>
The forward utility played 138 games for the Auckland club over nine seasons, but his contract was not renewed last year.

            <p>Former NZ Warriors stalwart Jazz Tevaga probably shouldn't expect a warm greeting from everyone at Mt Smart this week, when he returns for the first time with his new Manly Sea Eagles outfit.</p>
        
            <p>After nine seasons with the Auckland NRL club, the forward utility - one of the game's best - learned his contract would not be extended to a 10th after last season and departed across the Tasman to continue his career elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>With 138 games for the club, the Warriors fan favourite was also a popular teammate and enjoyed his finest season in 2018, when he was named Dally M Interchange Player of the Year, but he may have a freezing reception in store, when he runs out onto Go Media Stadium on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope they all boo him and rip into him, and put him off his game, ha ha," offered Warriors co-captain Mitch Barnett.</p>
        
            <p>"Jazz obviously had a long stint at this club - a local boy, although he's from Christchurch he tells me, and self-made he reckons.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully, they give it to him and put him off his game."</p>
        
            <p>Unlike some sports, where departed heroes are often warmly received back with tributes and fond memories, the Warriors will likely be all business, as they chase two much-needed competition points in their first home appearance of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope it's a good [reception] for Jazz," mused coach Andrew Webster. "I hope he plays really well, but he gets flogged, that's all I want.</p>
        
            <p>"Love Jazz, the team loves Jazz and he had a big impact on this club, but the moment we step onto the field, he'll be an opponent.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope he enjoys coming home, I hope the fans give him a good reception, but I hope he's on the wrong end of the score this week."</p>
        
            <p>Tevaga, 29, has begun his season better than his old team, starting at hooker, as the Sea Eagles overwhelmed North Queensland Cowboys 42-12, scoring all their points, before the visitors grabbed a couple of consolation tries in the dying moments.</p>
        
            <p>Manly appeared in mid-season form and will present a daunting challenge for a Warriors side still smarting from their 30-8 loss to Canberra Raiders at Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>One player especially looking forward to the contest is utility Dylan Walker, whose one-two punch with Tevaga off the interchange bench saw the pair dubbed as 'Bald Brothers'.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm close with Jazz and keep in contact with him all the time," said Walker. "He's got a new self-proclaimed nickname - he calls himself the Bald Eagle now.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure people will come to cheer him on, he's been a fan favourite here for the last 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>"I messaged him to congratulate him on a good game on the weekend, I thought he played alright. I'm going to pump his tyres up and then slowly release them, when it comes to the game."</p>
        
            <p>When the Sea Eagles visited Auckland last April, the result was a pulsating 22-22 Golden Point draw, with Warriors veteran Shaun Johnson cleaned out, while attempting a two-point field goal in the final seconds, then slotting the penalty to force extra time.</p>
        
            <p>Ironically, Tevaga scored his last try for the Warriors that day.</p>
        
            <p>They also lost to Manly in Sydney last August, as part of a four-game slump that finally eliminated them from playoff contention.</p>
