            <p>Three people have been taken to hospital, one with critical injuries, after a crash between a bus and a vehicle on the West Coast of the South Island on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to State Highway 6, near the Kakapotahi River, south of Hokitika, around 6.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>St John says two people were taken to Greymouth Hospital, one in a moderate condition and one with serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A third person was flown by helicopter to Christchurch Hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says crews freed a person who was trapped inside a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA says State Highway 6 is blocked north of Waitaha Road.</p>
        
            <p>It is warning motorists of delays and appealing to them to follow the directions of emergency services who are at the site.</p>
        
            <p>It's the second crash involving a bus today.</p>
        
            <p>Police said five people were injured and about 700 homes lost power after a Wellington Metlink bus ran across a roundabout before hitting and partially knocking down a pole in Wainuiomata, a suburb of Lower Hutt just before midday.</p>
        
            <p>Power was restored by 2.30pm.</p>
