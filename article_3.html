            <p>A Canterbury swimming pool is using artificial intelligence technology to reduce the risk of drownings.</p>
        
            <p>The new drowning prevention system at Selwyn Aquatic Centre will use 27 cameras to track and analyse swimmer movements, alerting lifeguards to possible signs of a swimmer in trouble.</p>
        
            <p>Selwyn District Council said lifeguards would be alerted via waterproof smartwatch technology and dashboards in the lifeguard office, with the notifications showing which pool the incident was happening in and the location of the person.</p>
        
            <p>Installation started with one pool in December 2024, with the full complex to be completed by end of June.</p>
        
            <p>The council's executive director of community services and facilities, Denise Kidd, said the centre was one of the first users of this technology in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Swimming pools have more than their fair share of people who are dealing with recovery and health issues and so it's to be expected that there are health and safety incidents from time to time in swimming pools such as this. This is just another tool for our arsenal for the lifeguards to be prepared," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kidd said the trial of the technology and the initial implementation had gone well.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been really thrilled by what it's alerting us to in that regard.</p>
        
            <p>"From time to time there have been incidents where a lack of movement has been picked up and alerted and it only takes a moment for the lifeguard to look up and check it out... in one instance I recall it was someone involved with practising scuba diving moves that involved sitting still at the bottom of the pool. So it was an alert that was sent that was unnecessary but better safe than sorry... we were really pleased at that result."</p>
        
            <p>The council began investigating the possibility of introducing the technology after a person had a medical incident while swimming at the centre in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the person was successfully assisted by staff, but they noted it was challenging to see the person due to reflection and glare on the water. A subsequent investigation recommended looking into technology that could help reduce that risk.</p>
        
            <p>Selwyn District Council chief digital officer Matt McGrath said while the system used cameras and AI software, privacy was also top of mind for the council.</p>
        
            <p>"The system complies with international laws and privacy regulations. The AI recordings are only used to identify body behaviours, not record details that could identify people. Recordings are stored on-site and are automatically deleted after seven days. No staff members will have access to the recordings," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Recreation Aotearoa chief executive Sarah Murray said it was exciting to see these advancements in drowning detection and prevention technology.</p>
        
            <p>"Technology has the potential to help lifeguards save lives, but we remind parents and caregivers that active supervision is critical to ensure our kids are safe in and around the water," she said.</p>
