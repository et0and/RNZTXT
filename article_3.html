            <p>A doctor who wrote thousands of prescriptions for ADHD medication without the necessary approvals has been suspended for a year.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland GP Dr John Anthony Hanne, who goes by Tony, appeared before the Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal in December.</p>
        
            <p>Family doctors are allowed to prescribe ADHD medication, but patients must get separate approval from a paediatrician or psychiatrist every two years.</p>
        
            <p>Hanne, now in his 80s, was successfully prosecuted last year after he was found to be working with a psychiatrist who rubber stamped the approvals without seeing or speaking to the patients.</p>
        
            <p>Hanne said at the time it was because many of his patients could not access specialist care due to cost, and a shortage of doctors.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the tribunal has ordered a year's suspension, with conditions imposed on his practising certificate when he returns, and costs and a fine totalling more than $175,000 to be paid.</p>
        
            <p>"The tribunal considered that although the doctor had made a significant contribution to the study and diagnoses of ADHD that had at times been life-changing for his patients, he was doing so without the required qualification or supervision," it reads.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite multiple warnings, the doctor stubbornly refused to accept any suggestion that he might be acting improperly."</p>
