            <p>A New Zealand woman has died after consuming a drink at a wellness retreat in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Rachael Dixon, who lived in Melbourne but hailed from Riverton in Southland, fell ill at Soul Barn in the Victorian town of Clunes last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Her son Matthew Mountain described the 53-year-old as the "most loving, most caring person I've ever known" in a post on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"Can't thank you enough for everything you ever did for me and all the support you gave me," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Words can't begin to describe how much I will miss you.</p>
        
            <p>"Love you infinity."</p>
        
            <p>Dixon's sister, Penny Muller-Dixon, posted that she was heartbroken at the loss and reminded her family and friends that life was short.</p>
        
            <p>"Please hug and love those around you," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Paramedics told the ABC they were called to the centre about 11.50pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon, who police said lived in the suburb of Ringwood North, died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Paramedics took two other people by ambulance to Ballarat Base Hospital. They had since been discharged.</p>
        
            <p>Australian media reported the trio were suspected to have been poisoned by mushrooms in the drink.</p>
        
            <p>Soul Barn advertises itself as providing sound healing, ceremonies, skincare, reiki and homestays.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, it posted on its business Facebook page cancelling a sound healing workshop originally scheduled for that afternoon.</p>
