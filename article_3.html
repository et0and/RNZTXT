            <p>English actor, comedian, singer and TV presenter Bradley Walsh is back on set at ITV filming new episodes of The Chase - the beloved and wildly popular quiz show he helped devise.</p>
        
            <p>Kim catches up with the former professional footballer to talk about family, work, and of course, the beautiful game.</p>
        
            <p>Running since 2009, The Chase has become one of New Zealand’s favourite shows. With three episodes filmed every day, you’d think host Bradley Walsh might be a bit tired of it by now - but think again. </p>
        
            <p>“Well there’s a secret to that,” Bradley says. “If I was doing, I shan’t mention them, but if I was doing other shows, I would be bored out of my brains. But the thing is, two shows are never the same on The Chase.”</p>
        
            <p>He’s been involved in the show since its inception - and over time, it’s become the focus of his work.</p>
        
            <p>“We’ve been running like a smooth operation now for probably eight years. There’s hardly any glitches at all and it’s funny, we have a laugh.</p>
        
            <p>“When I say I haven’t done a standup gig in 17 years, I do a lot of standup on the show, because it’s a bit of improv.”</p>
        
            <p>And while the British quiz show is wildly popular in New Zealand, it seems New Zealand is also popular with the show’s contestants.</p>
        
            <p>“We’ve had a lot of people come on the show wanting to win money to spread their wings, one of the bucket list experiences they want to do is either take a campervan or whatever it may be to New Zealand,” he says.</p>
        
            <p>“Even our executive producer Martin Scott, he went to New Zealand in a campervan and loved it.”</p>
        
            <p>Bradley says he can shoot an entire series of the Chase in 50 days - so what does he do when he’s not in the studio? He hits the road with his son Barney, for their show Breaking Dad, a travel show that’s taken the pair off the beaten track - with Bradley being forced to face his fear of heights at times.</p>
        
            <p>In one episode, the father and son take on a terrifying James Bond-style bungee jump off the Contra Dam in Switzerland - with Bradley pulling out at the last minute. </p>
        
            <p>“The mad thing is Kim, listen to this, back in the day when my father was still alive, before he became a cabbie in London, I used to go to work with my dad and my uncle Louis, who were roofers,” he says.</p>
        
            <p>“So I used to be up ladders on roofs when I was younger, so there was no problem at all. </p>
        
            <p>“I think what happens is, as you get older, your mortality sort of hits you and you think ‘oh I’m not too sure about this’. Like I don’t ride my motorbike anymore, I’ve got a Harley Davidson, I don’t ride it anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Like the contestants on The Chase, it seems Bradley Walsh also longs for our shores.</p>
        
            <p>“On my bucket list is New Zealand and the Cook Islands, that’s a place I’ve never been so I need to come.</p>
        
            <p>“The problem is, at the moment I actually can’t devote five weeks, because if I go for any less than that, I don’t think it’s doing it justice.”</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps a future episode of Breaking Dad then.
