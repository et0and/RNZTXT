            <p>A 17-year-old male has been arrested after breaching a security fence at Avalon Airport and entering a Jetstar plane with a loaded shotgun.</p>
        
            <p>Police say they responded to reports a man attempted to board a commercial flight at the state's second-biggest airport at Geelong near Melbourne at about 2:20pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The young man from Victoria, who was dressed in high-vis similar to airport ground crew, was tackled to the ground by passengers on flight JQ610 bound for Sydney and held down until police arrived.</p>
        
            <p>The boy has been charged with a number of offences including unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, endangering the safety of an aircraft, carrying out a bomb hoax and possessing a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded in custody and will face a children's court at a later date.</p>

            <p>Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters on Thursday evening the teenager, acting alone, had entered Avalon Airport via a hole in a security fence.</p>
        
            <p>He said the teen made his way to the plane and walked up the stairs but once he was just inside the plane he was overpowered by several passengers.</p>
        
            <p>"No doubt this would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers of that plane and Victoria police really commend the bravery of the passengers who were able to overpower that male," Superintendent Reid said.</p>
        
            <p>He confirmed the youth was carrying a loaded shotgun.</p>
        
            <p>He said police were talking to Counter Terrorism Command but the incident was not yet being treated as terrorism.</p>
        
            <p>"It's too early to establish that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the significance of the security breach, Superintendent Reid said it was "very concerning that a person can approach an aircraft and make his way, potentially close to being inside an aircraft, with a firearm".</p>
        
            <p>He said the teenager was not previously known to police.</p>
        
            <p>Police later found two bags and a vehicle belonging to the boy.</p>
        
            <p>The Victoria Police Bomb Respone Unit was called to remove the bags as a safety precaution.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the flight named Woodrow credited his fellow passenger sitting at the front of the plane, "Barry Clark in 1C", for tackling the young man to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"We were all boarded, I was last on, sat in my chair, heard a kerfuffle and saw the pilot and this other guy tackling this young boy in a high-vis vest which, from a distance, looked like he was ground crew," he told ABC Radio Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"He [was] dressed up with a tool belt and cargo pants and a high-vis yellow vest.</p>
        
            <p>"In a split second, the gentleman Barry Clarke in 1C saw him and jumped him, tackled him and got him in a choke lock, disarmed him, pilot jumped in too, myself and another gentleman come up to support and hold him down."</p>
        
            <p>Barry Clark, a shearer from Echuca, told ABC Radio Melbourne he first noticed the young man when he realised a female flight attendant was questioning him.</p>
        
            <p>"He was dressed up as a worker and he got agitated and before we knew it there was a gun - shotgun appeared - and I was worried about there being shots so all I could do was get the gun out of the way, threw it down the stairs - try to - and then put him in a hold and throw him to the ground til the police come," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He had other apparatus on him so I didn't know what his full intention was."</p>
        
            <p>Asked what was going through his mind when he tackled the young man, Clark said: "You don't think, you act."</p>
        
            <p>"I've been taught from a boy to be responsible and look after others and we're a sporting family so I was quietly confident I could handle him but I didn't want to see that poor girl get shot so you've just got to do what you've got to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Clark said the young man with the gun was dressed up to avoid attention.</p>
        
            <p>"He looked like a technician and the lady that stopped him was the lady checking all the tickets and he couldn't come up with the credentials so then he got agitated."</p>
        
            <p>Clark said he spoke to the boy for about 10 minutes until police arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar issued a statement shortly after the incident saying it was aware of a security incident at Avalon Aiport and was working with police to "urgently understand what has occurred".</p>
        
            <p>"The safety of our passengers and crew is our number one priority and we can confirm there are no reported injuries," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Late on Thursday evening, Avalon Airport chief executive Ari Suss said the airport had re-opened.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to reassure the public that the safety of our passengers, staff, and community remains our highest priority," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we have implemented further measures across the airport, including within the terminal and surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to work closely with authorities to ensure a safe and secure environment for all travellers."</p>
