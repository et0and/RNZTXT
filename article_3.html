            <p>Tropical Cyclone Alfred's centre is expected to hit Australia on Friday night or Saturday morning, with impacts already being felt across south-east Queensland and northern NSW.</p>
        
            <p>The category two system was expected to remain of similar intensity until the centre started to interact with the coast and islands.</p>
        
            <p>Energex, the electricity supplier for Queensland, was reporting widespread disruption to its power network on the Gold Coast.</p>
        
            <p>More than 20,000 customers were without power as of 1:45am, of which more than 17,500 were on the Gold Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The Energex outage finder said damage from the cyclone was the cause of many of the unplanned outages, affecting large parts of the Gold Coast hinterland, parts of Tweed Heads and Burleigh Waters.</p>
        
            <p>A further 2000 properties were without power in the Redlands area, on Brisbane's bayside.</p>
        
            <p>The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), said warnings remained in place for heavy rainfall, locally intense rain fall leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding, a dangerous storm tide, abnormally high tides, damaging surf, damaging wind gusts and destructive wind gusts.</p>
        
            <p>According to BOM weather stations, at Cape Byron, a wind gust of 111kph was recorded at 3.17am AEDT.</p>
        
            <p>The 10-minute average was 83kph there.</p>
        
            <p>Just north of the border, a 100kph gust was recorded at Coolangatta at 1.43am AEST today.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, closer to Brisbane a wind gust of 85kph was recorded at Cape Moreton just after midnight.</p>
