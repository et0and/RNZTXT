        <h2>Fiery debate in Parliament over Oranga Tamariki changes</h2>

            <p>The government's decision to repeal Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act has triggered tense debate in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The bill, which removes the obligation for Oranga Tamariki to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi, passed its first reading on Tuesday and has now moved to the Social Services Select Committee.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's spokesperson for children Willow-Jean Prime said the lack of evidence supporting the government's reasoning for the repeal was disturbing.</p>
        
            <p>"From my perspective, and the evidence supports my perspective, the minister cannot demonstrate that an actual problem exists with 7AA. Every example she gives is not connected to 7AA."</p>
        
            <p>Prime told RNZ the level of frustration was building and concern was mounting over what the government will set its sights on next.</p>
        
            <p>"The view that whakapapa, culture, connection to whānau, and whanaungatanga are not in the best interests of the child. We believe that it is, they believe that it isn't. They think it should be colour blind. I'm worried about how far they will go with their colour blind agenda."</p>

            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour defended the repeal, claiming Section 7AA was having a negative impact on children's safety and decision-making within Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>"During my time in opposition and before coming to Parliament, I heard devastating stories about how some Oranga Tamariki staff prioritised cultural considerations and the desires of a child's family over the individual need of the child. This sometimes led to unsafe care decisions and disruption for both the children and the caregivers."</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said the commitment to building strategic partnerships with iwi would not be affected by the repeal and collaboration with iwi would remain a priority.</p>
        
            <p>However, Prime dismissed the minister's assurance, claiming her words and actions were inconsistent.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very hard to have any confidence in the minister when she, on the one hand, says she wants to work with Māori, yet on the other hand, she is repealing Section 7AA which is all about working with Māori and honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Mariameno Kapa-Kingi reiterated her vehement opposition to the repeal, labelling it a form of "extermination."</p>
        
            <p>"The repeal of Section 7AA is a targeted extermination of our babies - exterminating any ounce of culture, identity, and any sense of their Māori selves."</p>
        
            <p>Prime said the government was causing irreparable damage to current and future partnerships with iwi.</p>
        
            <p>"This is shattering Māori crown relationships; I think the fact that we have a record number of urgent applications to the Waitangi Tribunal demonstrates Māori are not happy with what the government is doing and how they're doing it and what we are seeing form government is a refusal to even participate in the process."</p>
        
            <p>The National Iwi Chairs Forum and the Pou Tangata Iwi Leaders Group also expressed their opposition to the minister.</p>
        
            <p>Lead advisor Robyn Rauna highlighted the level of disappointment over the government's approach.</p>
        
            <p>"The request to remove 7AA didn't come from us. It only came from one party and one party alone - and I'm speaking specifically about the ACT Party."</p>
        
            <p>The bill's referral to the Social Services Select Committee opens a six-week period for public submissions.</p>
        
            <p>Prime urged the public to participate and ensure their views were heard.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important that people take this opportunity to share their views with the select committee. What I would say finally is that there was no consultation with Māori on the repeal of 7AA and the minister said Māori could submit their views through the select committee. That was offensive."</p>
        
            <p>Prime said the outcome of this bill will be a defining moment for the future of child welfare and Māori-Crown relations in New Zealand.</p>
