            <p>Far-right activist and former neo-Nazi leader Kyle Chapman has avoided jail on gun charges, telling the court he is leaving his life of activism.</p>
        
            <p>The 52-year-old was sentenced to six months' community detention and six months' supervision when he appeared in the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Chapman earlier pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a Norinco semi-automatic rifle, which was banned in the wake of the Christchurch terror attacks - as well as further firearms charges relating to parts and ammunition for the rifle and a .22-calibre rifle.</p>
        
            <p>In September last year, police raided Chapman's Phillipstown address.</p>
        
            <p>"The defendant had in his possession a Norinco 7.62mm rifle, which was stored in the wardrobe of his bedroom," a summary of facts said.</p>
        
            <p>"The defendant also had possession of a 7.62mm magazine which was kept in a camo-print bag under his bed. The magazine fits the Norinco rifle.</p>
        
            <p>"Three 7.62mm rifle rounds, 46 .22-calibre rounds, three 12-gauge shotgun shells and two .22 magazines were also in the camo-print bag.</p>
        
            <p>"In the garage of the address was a ziplock bag containing 82 .22 rounds of ammunition and one 7.62mm round of ammunition."</p>
        
            <p>Chapman claimed to police the rifle was an Airsoft rifle given to him to hold by a now-deceased friend.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard this morning Chapman's home resembled that of a hoarder's by the time of the police raid.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Chapman had got himself into the position of hoarding many possessions accumulated over the years," his lawyer Joshua Grainger said.</p>
        
            <p>Since being charged he had taken steps to clear out his home and put his responsibilities as a father first.</p>
        
            <p>"That's shown by his sentiments of wanting to pull back from his activism and that's in recognition of the need to be a father first and an activist second," Grainger said.</p>
        
            <p>Chapman had previously been convicted of firebombing a marae.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Tom Gilbert acknowledged his criminal past, but noted any previous appearances before the court were about three decades ago.</p>
        
            <p>The judge also noted Chapman had been an "activist for many years for various causes including, at times, for alt-right groups".</p>
        
            <p>Judge Gilbert said a pre-sentencing report noted Chapman had said he wished to give such activism away and focus on his family.</p>
        
            <p>"Normally I would be sceptical of such claims, but the material does support that," the judge said.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown also sought the imposition of a firearms prohibition order on Chapman.</p>
        
            <p>However, Judge Gilbert was not convinced the test for such an order had been met.</p>
        
            <p>Chapman was also convicted and discharged for breaching a Covid-19 lockdown in August 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The firearms, accessories and ammunition would be destroyed.</p>
