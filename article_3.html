            <p>Canterbury University has confirmed more than 100 students have become unwell with a gastro illness.</p>
        
            <p>It affects those in the University Hall and Ilam Student Accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Executive director of people, culture and campus life Paul O'Flaherty said the university became aware overnight of the scale of the problem and was working with the National Public Health Service to investigate the cause of the illness.</p>
        
            <p>He said while students appeared to be recovering well on Monday, they have been directed to the university's accommodation providers UniLodge if they needed free electrolyte mixes for dehydration, bottled water and packaged meals.</p>
        
            <p>Students unable to sit exams can apply for special consideration and may be offered a resit of their exams in the next couple of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>More to come </p>
