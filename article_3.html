            <p>Former Black Caps captain Kane Williamson is among several Black Caps who will play in Pakistan T20 Super League having missed out on the Indian Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson will play for the Karachi Kings having been signed in the top platinum category - a contract worth $360,000, a far cry from the amounts some players have received in the IPL.</p>

            <p>Daryl Mitchell, Mark Chapman, Finn Allen, Michael Bracewell, Kyle Jamieson and Adam Milne have also been signed by Pakistan franchises.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee and Jimmy Neesham failed to pick up contracts.</p>
        
            <p>The PSL runs from 10 April to 25 May, over the same period as the Indian Premier League.</p>
        
            <p>All up nine New Zealanders will play in the PSL, with Colin Munro at Islamabad United and Tim Seifert at the Karachi Kings having both retained by their franchises.</p>
        
            <p>There are seven New Zealand players in the IPL - pace bowlers Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson, batters Devon Conway, Bevon Jacobs and Rachin Ravindra and all-rounders Glenn Phillips and Mitchell Santner.</p>
