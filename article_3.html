            <p>The Minister of Finance and Economic Growth says the government will make the case for continuing trade access to the US.</p>
        
            <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China have sparked retaliation from all three countries.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis told First Up that while Aotearoa is not directly affected, she is aware that some exporters are worried about the impact the move could have on them.</p>
        
            <p>She says the government will protect free trade and engage respectfully with the US.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis says the government is confident it can pursue New Zealand's best interests with the US administration.</p>
        
            <p>Sense Partners economist John Ballingall told Morning Report's Corin Dann on Monday the move could spark a potential retaliatory trade war between the nations, spelling bad news for New Zealand exports.</p>
        
            <p>"The larger concern for New Zealand is that Trump's actions here lead to retaliation, which we're already seeing from Canada, Mexico and China, and that that blows up into a full-blown trade war.</p>
        
            <p>"When that happens, you'll see global GDP growth go down, and that means lower demand for all of the things that New Zealand exports."</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged there are possible upsides in the short term. As dairy products going into Canada become more expensive. This could potentially open up new opportunities for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to paint this as something which is great for New Zealand. The medium-term and longer-term consequences are pretty worrying."</p>
        
            <p>Especially, he said, if the scope of Trump's tariff tactics widens to include Europe.</p>
        
            <p>"Europe's already talking about how it might retaliate. We know the EU does this pretty effectively. It's got a list of products that it would counter-punch with.</p>
        
            <p>"So again, it's not hard to see this skill heading relatively quickly into something much more concerning to New Zealand."</p>

            <p>However, on Tuesday morning (NZT) Trump said he had agreed to "immediately pause" tariffs on Mexico for a month after a "very friendly" conversation with the country's president Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>
        
            <p>"I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States," Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
        
            <p>"These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a "deal" between our two Countries," the president went on.</p>
        
            <p>The 25 percent tariffs on Mexico had been set to take effect at midnight.</p>
