            <p>A series of late mistakes cost the Crusaders dearly as they crashed to a 43-40 loss to the Waratahs in Sydney - their sixth defeat of the Super Rugby Pacific season.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement Waratahs first five-eighth Will Harrison delivered the dagger to the visitors, landing a penalty after the hooter had sounded in normal time to level the scores 40-40 before his drop goal sealed victory in the fourth minute of extra time.</p>
        
            <p>It leaves the defending champion Crusaders languishing in second-last place on the standings, having lost their first five matches before seemingly turning the corner by upsetting the Chiefs in their last start.</p>
        
            <p>However, another defeat mounts more pressure on coach Rob Penney and provides some relief for the team he previously coached - the Waratahs - who also went into the match with just one win to their name.</p>

            <p>The lead changed 13 times in the nine-try contest but the Crusaders only have themselves to blame they didn't emerge on top.</p>
        
            <p>Reserve flanker Christian Lio-Willie looked to have sealed victory when he crashed over off the blindside of a scrum with 90 seconds remaining to put his side a point in front.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement first-five Rivez Reihana could have wasted the remainder of the clock in taking his sideline conversion, which would have left no time to restart play.</p>
        
            <p>However, he took his successful kick just before the 80th minute mark ticked over, giving the Waratahs one last chance.</p>
        
            <p>From that play, Crusaders winger Johnny McNicholl was ruled to have deliberately knocked on during a Waratahs attack and was shown a yellow card.</p>
        
            <p>Harrison duly slotted the equalising penalty kick and was the hero again in extra time as the Waratahs made it two-from-two in matches against the Crusaders this season.</p>

            <p>Penney said his players had learned a harsh lesson about finishing off games.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah there's some things you can only learn by going through them," he told Stan Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"People have to learn by being exposed and it was a different situation tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"You have your discussions around what it looks like when you're in situations like extra time but it's really living that moment when reality hits."</p>
        
            <p>The early signs had been promising for the Crusaders, with winger Sevu Reece crossing twice in the first 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>The second try saw Reece equal Caleb Ralph's record of 52 competition tries for the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Waratahs worked their way back into the contest, having the edge on the Crusaders at the set pieces and scoring two of their four tries from lineout drives.</p>

            <p>Earlier, Moana Pasifika ensured they will have their best-ever season after beating the ill-disciplined Reds 17-14 in Whangārei.</p>

            <p>The visitors had two players shown red cards in the second half, which proved costly as Moana crossed for the match-winning try to first five-eighth William Havili with a minute remaining.</p>
        
            <p>Moana's third win of the campaign means they will eclipse their only two previous campaigns - having won twice on debut in 2022 and just once last year, securing the wooden spoon on both occasions.</p>
        
            <p>They dominated the first half, with Julian Savea's try helping build a 10-0 lead at the interval.</p>
        
            <p>The Reds were vastly improved after the break but paid heavily for the red cards to two of their most experienced players - firstly to halfback Tate McDermott for a swinging arm tackle in the 46th minute and then to flanker Fraser McReight for high contact with seven minutes remaining.</p>
