            <p>President Joe Biden has authorised the use of powerful American long-range weapons for Ukraine to fire inside Russia, according to a senior US official familiar with the decision, as the US watches with concern as North Korean troops deploy in support of Russia.</p>
        
            <p>The decision comes as Russia has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, the southern Russian region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive in the summer, to prepare to take back territory.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of North Korean troops have deployed to Kursk as part of the offensive. Biden and his advisers are concerned the entry of North Korea troops into the conflict could lead to a dangerous new phase in the war.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to allow use of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, had been under consideration for months. American officials had been divided on the wisdom of allowing the new capability. Some voiced concern about escalating the war, while others worried about dwindling stockpiles of the weapons.</p>
        
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky had been pressing Washington to allow use of the weapons inside Russia, arguing he needed the capability to gain momentum in his war effort.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
