            <p>One of the biggest events on the Māori school calendar is on now in Ōtautahi/Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1500 students from 44 kura kaupapa across the country are taking part in Te Wiki Hākinakina o ngā Kura Kaupapa Māori or 'Wiki Hā' a biennial sports event which signals the end of the school year.</p>
        
            <p>Merita Waitoa-Paki, who is tumuaki (principal) of host kura TKKM o Whakapūmau i te Reo Tūturu ki Waitaha, said the most important part of Wiki Hā was to hear te reo spoken as far and wide as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"Kia rongo it te reo Māori e horapa haere ana, e whiu ana ki ngā tōpito katoa, ko te noho kia mau tonu i ngā mātāpono o Te Aho Matua, ko te whakatairanga i tō tātau kaupapa ātaahua ki te katoa."</p>
        
            <p>"To hear the language being disseminated, being used in all situations, to hold on to the principles of Te Aho Matua, to raise up our kaupapa for all to see [those are most important things]."</p>

            <p>This year is the first time the Wiki Hā has been held in Te Waipounamu since its establishment in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>Waitoa-Paki thanked all the kura who made the long journey down to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"Ahakoa tokoiti o mātau he iwi noho tahi, titiro ki ngā rau ringa i kōnei kia oti pai te mahi, ana ko te mahi te manaaki i ngā manuhiri tūarangi kua tae mai."</p>
        
            <p>"Even though we are a small community here in Christchurch we stick together, look at all the people who have turned out to make sure everything gets done and to look after all the visitors."</p>
        
            <p>Te Tai Tonga MP Tākuta Ferris was in attendance on Wednesday, he said hosting Wiki Hā was huge for Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"Te hapori kāre anō pea kia tino kite pēnei rawa te nui o te iwi Māori taiohi nei e hui tahi ana, ka kite atu i tōna ātaahua me te mea anō hoki ka whai wāhi nui to ohanga o te hapori nei i te taetae mai o te iwi katoa."</p>
        
            <p>"This community might not have not have ever seen this many young Māori in the same place, they'll see how beautiful it is and the local economy will get a boost from all these people."</p>

            <p>This year rangatahi are competing in six different sports, including mainstays like netball, volleyball and touch rugby.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday the name of the game was Ki ō Rahi, a fast-paced ball in hand game where teams take turns as the kia oma (attack) and taniwha (defence).</p>
        
            <p>As Wiki Hā is conducted totally in te reo - students can be docked points if they are caught speaking in English.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kaea was one of the team of referees keeping everyone in line on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Ko tā mātau hāmene he tuku piro ki tērā atu tīma engari ki te kaha rongo i taua reo Pākehā e rere haere ana ka tukua i ā rātau ki te taha ka whai i tētahi kaitākoro hou."</p>
        
            <p>"If they speak English we give a point over to the other team, but if we keep hearing it we send them to the sidelines and they have to bring in a new player."</p>
        
            <p>It was a difficult job but they had a good team of volunteers doing the mahi, she said.</p>

            <p>Another traditional sport played during Wiki Hā is Hopu i te Ariki, two teams face off in a game based on the use of traditional Māori weaponry.</p>
        
            <p>A new addition to the sporting line-up this year is Parakiore a crossfit based competition which takes its name from a toa (warrior) of local hapū Ngāi Tūāhuriri.</p>
        
            <p>Wiki hā extends beyond the sporting field and a big part of that is whakawhanaungatanga, the process of establishing and building relationships.</p>
        
            <p>It is a chance for tauira to come together and foster relationships on and off the field and between different schools.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday there is also a hīkoi - Toitū Te Aho Matua - planned through central Christchurch, following on from the mass hīkoi last month.</p>
        
            <p>Te Wiki Hākinakina o ngā Kura Kaupapa Māori 2024 officially comes to an end on Thursday night with a Pō Kanikani or dance night.</p>
