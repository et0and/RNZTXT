            <p>A student used a pair of scissors to assault two teachers at a Christchurch school this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating the incident, after they were called to Haeata Community Campus in the suburb of Aranui just before 2pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Peggy Burrows said the attack happened in the primary section of the school, and involved a student under the age of 16.</p>
        
            <p>She said one teacher was cut on the palm of their hand and another received head injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Burrows said the assault was witnessed by a number of staff and students.</p>
        
            <p>The teachers were treated for their injuries, and were on leave for the rest of the week.</p>
        
            <p>Burrows said the pair were now home with their whānau and did not require hospitalisation.</p>
        
            <p>"Please check with your ākonga/student if you observe any evidence of distress or anxiety and contact the kura/school if they are having difficulty processing what they may have witnessed during this assault."</p>
        
            <p>Burrows said there was plenty of support at Haeta for students who felt upset about what they witnessed.</p>
        
            <p>Haeta Community Campus was also investigating the attack.</p>
        
            <p>School was still planned to go ahead as usual on Thursday.</p>
