            <p>Another shoplifting allegation has been made against former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>The incident is alleged to have occurred at a Pak'nSave supermarket late last year.</p>
        
            <p>An appeal by Ghahraman to have earlier shoplifting convictions wiped, was dismissed by the Auckland High Court in October.</p>
        
            <p>In June, Ghahraman was convicted on four counts of shoplifting, and fined $1600 and an additional $260 in court costs.</p>
        
            <p>Her request to be discharged without conviction was at the time dismissed by Judge June Jelas.</p>
        
            <p>In reponse to questions, police said "a shoplifting complaint is under investigation from late 2024" but did not name Ghahraman.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs North Island said it could not comment on individual cases.</p>
