        <h2>Doubling of prison room on fast-track project list</h2>
        <p>
The proposal is for a maximum inmate number of 1200 - but Corrections says it has no immediate expansion plans.

            <p>Corrections says it has no immediate plans to expand Auckland Prison, but being listed on the Fast-Track Approvals Bill will future-proof the facility at Paremoremo.</p>
        
            <p>The prison service's proposal is to amend the facility's designation conditions, so that it can increase the maximum number of prisoners from the current 681 to 1200.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections spokesperson Alastair Turrell said it was part of ensuring there was capacity in future for the increasing prison population.</p>
        
            <p>"If approval is granted to increase this designation, Corrections would still need to complete construction work to increase the level of physical fit-for-purpose bed capacity at the site.</p>
        
            <p>"However, amending the designation now means we can respond quicker to any future increases in demand for prison capacity," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The project will also support the long-term resilience of our prison network.</p>
        
            <p>"This is particularly important in Auckland, which is a region of high demand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was also the country's only maximum-security facility.</p>
        
            <p>Since there were no immediate expansion plans Corrections was unable to provide information on costs or timeframes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 149 projects have been selected for fast tracking through the government's new Fast-track Approvals Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Among the housing projects are developments at Plimmerton Farm in Porirua and Silverstream Forest in Upper Hutt, which have previously been controversial.</p>
        
            <p>The scrapped Hawke's Bay dam, the Tukituki Water Security Project may be revived.</p>
