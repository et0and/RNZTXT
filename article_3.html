        <h2>NZ missing out on growing market by not targeting rainbow tourists</h2>
        <p>

            <p>When Martin King is considering his next holiday, he has already ruled out 70 countries due to homophobic criminal laws.</p>
        
            <p>The Pride Pledge founder said safety was a key concern for many LGBTQIA+ travellers and it made New Zealand an attractive destination.</p>
        
            <p>But King said Aotearoa was missing out on the growing visitor market by not actively rolling out the welcome mat.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, Tourism New Zealand was not targeting rainbow tourists, but chief executive René de Monchy said that did not mean we were missing out.</p>
        
            <p>King said he started planning a trip with lots of questions, including whether the country was one of the 36 which recognised same sex marriage.</p>
        
            <p>"Regardless of legislation, will I be safe? If I happen to put my hand on my husband's knee in an airport, how would that be treated? Could I even walk down the street holding my husband's hand? How would that be received or would it be unsafe?"</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa was in a prime position to welcome rainbow travellers to our shores and should promote its inclusiveness more, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The rainbow tourism market globally is bigger than the Chinese market alone, and the other thing is that our rainbow identities are growing ... they're looking for safe, inclusive destinations," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He wanted a clear plan, investment and for rainbow communities to be authentically represented in marketing.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe it's one of the single biggest strategic, economic and tourism opportunities that New Zealand has sitting right before us that we need to act on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He would like to see more businesses do the Pride Pledge, training, using gender-friendly language, and being visible in their support.</p>
        
            <p>Ziptrek Ecotours owner Trent Yeo said a recent talk by Pride Pledge was eye-opening.</p>
        
            <p>"When you realise the scale of a whole section of the community that's available for you and that these people are looking for ways in which to get involved in tourism, you start thinking 'I better have a welcome mat out'," Yeo said.</p>
        
            <p>There was still work to do, but he wanted to be proactive to see how they could better serve the community, he said.</p>
        
            <p>De Monchy questioned whether New Zealand was losing out on rainbow travellers because the agency's marketing strategy sought to welcome all travellers.</p>
        
            <p>It showcased manaakitanga and hospitality, but the rainbow marketing tended to be connected to events or occasions like the legalisation of same sex marriage in 2013 when they rebranded to 100% Pure Choice, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure if we are missing out on that audience to be honest. I totally take the point that it's a huge audience and probably is an above average propensity to travel and international travel and interest in travel. I don't dispute that, but I'm not that as a destination we are missing a share of that audience," de Monchy said.</p>
        
            <p>The 100% Pure New Zealand website included a welcome to the rainbow community as part of its safety information page.</p>
        
            <p>But some businesses have suggested Tourism New Zealand should have a specific page for LGBTQIA+ traveller information.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure whether a specific page to have that all encompassing versus actually making sure if you search on the site you'll find the information that you need. Yeah, I'll look into that actually," he said.</p>

            <p>Tourism and Hospitality Minister Matt Doocey acknowledged the concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a fair challenge. I think it's important that when we look at growing markets, that we do look at the available markets for New Zealand's tourism, and I think it's actually something that we could support to make sure that we are seen as an inclusive country to travel," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was fantastic that New Zealand was viewed as welcoming and safe, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We shouldn't be complacent about that. I think our rainbow community can still face a lot of discrimination and I think that we should quite rightly work as a country to make sure that we continue to be on the right track to promote New Zealand as much as an inclusive country to visit as possible," Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland hosted its inaugural Rainbow Games this year with hopes it might become a biennial event - subject to funding.</p>
        
            <p>Tātaki Auckland Unlimited head of major events Michelle Hooper said it provided a safe, welcoming and fun space.</p>
        
            <p>She was keen to explore more opportunities for rainbow community events.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually elevating a whole community of people to feel empowered and part of something bigger than themselves, and it's not just an impact at a local level. This is globally recognised and globally important and that people will travel to Aotearoa and Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland specifically seeking out these experiences," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She would love the rainbow community to become a key market.</p>
        
            <p>"How much can we open our arms for them to come and have safe experiences and the best time of their life here in Aotearoa? What great events can we host where they feel inclined to jump on a plane or a boat ... however they want to get here, and come on over to New Zealand and have those experiences," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland has been shortlisted to host the Gay Games in 2030.</p>
