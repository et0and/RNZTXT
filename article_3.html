            <p>Sunday will be soggy and blustery across swathes of New Zealand, with rain, wind and thunderstorms all in the mix.</p>
        
            <p>Flooding and slips closed roads in and around the northern Wairarapa town of Pahiatua on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The town's stormwater system reached capacity about 5am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Tararua District Council said Huxley Street, Tiraumea Road and Halls Road were closed and people were being asked to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Pahiatua Track - the road linking the town west, to Palmerston North - had also been closed due to slips and fallen trees.</p>
        
            <p>Tararua mayor Tracey Collis asked people to avoid travel in or near Pahiatua.</p>
        
            <p>"The Pahiatua-Pongaroa Road [to the east] being closed off limits people getting to town from Pongaroa, from Makuri, where we understand Makuri's got a lot of water around it.</p>
        
            <p>"But the Pahiatua Track is also closed, so the only road available for use is the Saddle Road."</p>
        
            <p>MetService said an orange heavy rain warning remained for the Tararua Range, with possible thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>It was predicting 60-90mm of rain until 10pm Sunday, on top of what had already fallen.</p>
        
            <p>Rain would be widespread across the Wellington region until 9pm Sunday, and could approach warning level; thunderstorms were also possible.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the east coast from north of Masterton to Gisborne/Tai RƒÅwhiti were in for a blustery Sunday, with north-west winds approaching severe gale in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, NIWA said temperature differences between the North and South islands could be as high as 20C on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Warm air from the northwest is bringing heavy rain and unusually mild temperatures, with Napier forecast for a high of 22C.</p>
        
            <p>It was a different story in the South Island, however, with snow predicted across the alpine passes, falling to low levels on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said a strong cold southwesterly flow was expected to bring snow down to low levels.</p>
        
            <p>There are road snowfall warnings on Sunday for:</p>
        
            <p>The South Island also has heavy snow watches in place for:</p>
