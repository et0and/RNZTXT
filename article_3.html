            <p>Black Caps legend Kane Williamson will limit his international involvement to test matches this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson and pace bowler Lockie Ferguson have turned down New Zealand Cricket central contracts, to further concentrate on overseas T20 franchise leagues.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson will relinquish the captaincy of the Black Caps' white-ball sides.</p>
        
            <p>Players offered NZC central contracts must commit to being available for both the Black Caps and the domestic Super Smash competition.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson said his decision should not be interpreted as a sign he was losing interest in international cricket and said he remained open to potentially accepting a central contract offer in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Helping push the team forward across the formats is something I'm very passionate about and something I want to keep contributing towards," he said</p>
        
            <p>"However, pursuing an overseas opportunity during the New Zealand summer means I'm unable to accept a central contract offer.</p>
        
            <p>"Playing for New Zealand is something I treasure, and my desire to give back to the team remains undiminished.</p>
        
            <p>"My life outside cricket has changed however - spending more time with my family and enjoying experiences with them at home or abroad is something that's even more important to me."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Cricket chief executive, Scott Weenink, said Williamson was a great New Zealand player who had earned the right to take some time off to pursue other goals, including family-oriented priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a good way to help keep Kane in the international game so that he continues to play a major role for the Black Caps - both now and in the years to come," Weenink said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have very little international cricket in New Zealand through January and outside that period he's still available for the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>"NZC has a strong preference to select centrally contracted players for the Black Caps, however we're happy to make an exception for our greatest ever batter - especially as he remains so committed to the team.</p>
        
            <p>"I know it sounds a bit counterintuitive, but I'm very encouraged by this development."</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowler Ferguson has also indicated he won't accept a central contract offer when the contracting process opens.</p>
        
            <p>An announcement covering the final list of contract offers is likely next month.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson, 33, captained New Zealand in all three formats of the game until he gave up the test captaincy to Tim Southee in late 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Pace bowler Trent Boult announced at the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the USA that it would be his last.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was coy about his future in the shortest version of the game when he was asked following New Zealand's early exit from the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know," Williamson said when asked if he would be seen in action in the 2026 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>After making his debut for New Zealand Williamson has played 100 tests, 165 ODI's and 93 T20 internationals.</p>
        
            <p>He has played in most leagues around the world but only had limited playing time with the Gujurat Titans in the recent Indian Premier League.</p>
