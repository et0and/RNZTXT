        <h2>Where Indian parents are turning for cheaper baby essentials</h2>
        <p>
To ease financial strain, many Indian parents have found an alternative: sourcing baby essentials from India.

            <p>For many new parents in New Zealand, the cost of baby products can be overwhelming.</p>
        
            <p>From diapers and strollers to clothing, the expenses quickly add up, especially for recent migrants who are still finding their footing in a new country.</p>
        
            <p>To ease the financial strain, many Indian parents have found an alternative: sourcing baby essentials from India.</p>
        
            <p>"We only bought a few things from here, like a baby capsule and some winter clothes," said Archie Mohanlal, a quantity surveyor in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Mohanlal moved to New Zealand in 2017 as a student.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old welcomed a baby with his wife in January.</p>
        
            <p>"All baby products are pretty expensive here, so we brought clothes and essentials like a breast pump, baby bottles, swaddle clothes and pregnancy clothes for my partner [from India]," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Price comparisons highlight the significant cost differences.</p>
        
            <p>As of Thursday, the cheapest available electric double breast pump in New Zealand was priced at $382.49 from Baby Bunting, whereas the same model was available on Amazon India for 11,890 rupees (about $240).</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, the cheapest twin-pack baby feeding bottle that sells in Chemist Warehouse was $36.99, while the same item from the same brand was selling for 995 rupees (about $20) in India.</p>
        
            <p>According to Whānau Āwhina Plunket, the cost of raising a baby can reach up to $16,000 per year.</p>
        
            <p>The organization estimates that parents would need approximately $304 per week, or $15,834 annually, for a medium-spend budget.</p>
        
            <p>For a high-spend budget, the weekly cost would rise to $405.</p>
        
            <p>Mohanlal said he purchased as much as he could from India because of the affordability.</p>
        
            <p>His parents, who were visiting, brought the products over.</p>
        
            <p>"My wife ordered most of the products from Amazon, and it was so much cheaper," he said. "It made us realize how expensive some products are here in Auckland."</p>

            <p>Hamilton resident Aravind Narayan Suresh, 29, shared a similar experience.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike Mohanlal, he opted to ship a package from India.</p>
        
            <p>An IT analyst, Narayan Suresh moved to New Zealand in 2019 as an international student and became a father in April last year.</p>
        
            <p>"It only cost me about $200 to send the package, but I saved more than $1000 in baby products," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Babies are expensive and [the package] was such a big relief for our family."</p>
        
            <p>According to childcare comparison website Care For Kids, the average cost of childcare in New Zealand is $60.23 per child per day.</p>
        
            <p>His shipment included a variety of baby clothes, particularly frocks and summer outfits.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel like most of the dresses available for girls here are generic and not really vibrant," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Other items in his package included bathing essentials, towels, blankets and toys.</p>
        
            <p>Narayan Suresh also noted that the quality of products from India is often superior to what is available in New Zealand - and at a fraction of the price.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a no-brainer," he said.</p>

            <p>He said the lack of competition in New Zealand's baby product market, coupled with the absence of major online retailers such as Amazon, had driven up costs.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's just the products, if you put other costs into the mix, then this makes much more sense," he said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has some of the highest costs for childcare in this part of the world. A 2021 UNICEF survey titled Where do rich countries stand on childcare? ranked New Zealand at 33 out of 44 in the report.</p>
        
            <p>According to a 2023 childcare cost indicator from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a typical couple, both earning the average wage and with two kids spends 41 percent of their income on childcare.</p>
        
            <p>While Narayan Suresh purchased larger items such as strollers, car seats and some baby toiletries locally, he was considering bringing more from India in future.</p>
        
            <p>He also turned to Chinese online retailer AliExpress for toys and was generally pleased with the quality.</p>
        
            <p>He said that he was not worried about the safety of the products.</p>
        
            <p>"You'd normally think Chinese and Indian products are cheaper because they're low quality, but I can confidently say that is a thing of the past," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"These are big countries that have moved on from that stereotype," he said. "Now, it's a different story when it comes to quality."</p>
