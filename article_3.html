            <p>Name suppression has lapsed for former Warriors player turned television celebrity Wairangi Koopu.</p>
        
            <p>Koopu is facing charges of cocaine possession and supply of a class A drug.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday afternoon, his name suppression lapsed with immediate effect.</p>
        
            <p>Koopu, who also appears on television in the Crowd Goes Wild and The Road to Te Matatini, was charged with major drugs charges in October.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>Koopu made over 150 appearances for the Warriors between 1999 and 2008.</p>
        
            <p>He also represented the New Zealand Kiwis on three occasions and played four times for the New Zealand Māori rugby league team.</p>
        
            <p>The second rower was on the interchange bench in the Warriors' 2002 NRL Grand Final loss to the Sydney Roosters.</p>
        
            <p>Koopu was released by the Warriors in 2009 and signed a one-year contract with the Melbourne Storm and was part of the team that won the 2009 NRL Grand Final, although that title was subsequently stripped because of salary cap breaches.</p>
        
            <p>He joined the television show The Crowd Goes Wild as a presenter and reporter in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In February, TVNZ launched season two of The Road to Te Matatini, hosted by Koopu.</p>
        
            <p>He also appeared on reality show Celebrity Treasure Island in 2024.</p>
