            <p>Wild Thang, an eight-year-old Pekingese, has been crowned as the winner of this year's World's Ugliest Dog competition.</p>
        
            <p>Held during the 2024 Sonoma-Marin Fair in Petaluma, California, this year's contest included eight contenders - the majority rescues who came from shelters before finding their forever families.</p>
        
            <p>Wild Thang, from Coos Bay, Oregon, has competed five times in previous World's Ugliest Dog competitions, but this is his first win.</p>
        
            <p>Wild Thang's unique looks are due to a case of canine distemper when he was a 10-week-old puppy.</p>
        
            <p>The disease prevented the growth of his teeth, hence the dangling tongue, and muscular disorder in one of his legs.</p>
        
            <p>The World's Ugliest Dog competition has been held for nearly 50 years and "celebrates the imperfections that make all dogs special and unique", according to its website.</p>
        
            <p>Wild Thang, and his owner Ann Lewis, will receive US$5000 (NZ$8172) and appear on NBC's The Today Show.</p>

            <p>A wheelchair-using 14-year-old pug named Rome came in second place and receives a prize of US$3000 (NZ$4903). It was Rome's first entry into the contest.</p>
        
            <p>"I love that (the competition) represents dogs that are imperfect - imperfectly perfect," Rome's owner Michelle Grady said.</p>
        
            <p>Another first-time entrant, a 14-year-old white coated and mixed breed rescue dog named Daisy May, won the third place title and will receive US$2000 (NZ$3269).</p>
        
            <p>She was rescued from the streets at two years old. She has lost her hair, teeth and vision.</p>
        
            <p>Daisy May's owner, Elizabeth Whitehouse, said it was a surprise to take a podium position.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought that she would be the most beautiful ugly dog, but as it turns out, other people don't see the beauty in her that I do," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Voting was also open online for fans to select one special dog to receive the People's Choice Award, which went to Rome, the judges' runner-up.</p>

            <p>The annual contest emphasises the importance of adopting all animals.</p>
        
            <p>It's not about making fun of "ugly" dogs, according to the contest, but instead "having fun with some wonderful characters and showing the world that these dogs are really beautiful".</p>
        
            <p>This year's judges included NBC News correspondent Gadi Schwartz, human rights advocate Linda Witong Abrahm and California 34th Treasurer Fiona Ma.</p>
        
            <p>Entries this year included chihuahua mixes, Chinese crested mixes and pug mixes.</p>
        
            <p>One contestant who missed out on a prize, Freddie Mercury, is a rescue who made his debut in the contest this year.</p>
        
            <p>Fred, who is described as having "a face like a fork-lift", spends his days as a mascot for Petaluma's local ice cream truck.</p>
        
            <p>He also attends youth football games and is a special request at birthday parties.</p>
