            <p>ACT leader David Seymour has met with New Zealand First leader Winston Peters for another 10-minute meeting at NZ First's temporary offices.</p>
        
            <p>Emerging from the meeting, he told reporters not to read too much into the short timeframe, saying he had achieved what he wanted to.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Peters had gone to ACT's headquarters at Parliament for a 10-minute meeting.</p>
        
            <p>As he arrived at his own party's offices on Friday he said nothing to waiting reporters, but NZ First second-in-command Shane Jones said he personally was "not involved in any three-way assignations today".</p>
        
            <p>"Have patience, it's all in the Bible," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Policy discussions were all under a cone of silence, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll soon be revealed, I know people may be anxious. Yesterday I said Shakespeare, today it's in the Bible."</p>
