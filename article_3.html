            <p>An apology to a school from the Secretary of Education says the ministry was too slow to flag rising costs.</p>
        
            <p>A copy of the apology letter last December from Iona Holsted to the board of Kaipara College has been released under the OIA to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The school was promised a tech and arts centre would begin to be built this year after nine years of planning.</p>
        
            <p>"I apologise to you, your board and the Kaipara College community for the handling of this decision," Holsted wrote on 4 December.</p>
        
            <p>This was only after the college protested to the Education Ministry, Minister Erica Stanford and local MPs about the project being put on hold.</p>
        
            <p>The letter shows officials kept the school in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>"The high costs of the innovation centre project relative to other builds have been known about since early this year, and should have been raised with your board as a potential risk to the project at that point," Holsted wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, the right level of scrutiny of these costs was not applied until late in the process, when the contract was about to be let.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we did not engage with you on the issue earlier, as we should have, the decision to pause the innovation centre has understandably come as a surprise and a significant disappointment for your board and community."</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara still needed investment in tech facilities, and the ministry and school were working on a revised project for the end of March.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara is one of 350 projects now in limbo, caught up in an overall review of school builds announced by Stanford on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford has blamed the previous government for a school property system "bordering on crisis" and castigated officials for a pattern of over-promising and under-delivering.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry guidelines state that the availability of funding for a project should be confirmed in the very first phase of a five-phase procurement process.</p>
