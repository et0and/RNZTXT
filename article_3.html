Pig racing with contestants named after politicians is expected to be one of the highlights of the Kaikohe A&P Show.

            <p>Pig racing is expected to be one of the highlights of the Kaikohe A&P Show in the Far North on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Association president Richard Dampney said the show would feature seven rings of horses, shearing competitions, the Northland Gumboot Throwing Championships, a petting zoo, food and trade stalls, and "heaps" of activities for children.</p>
        
            <p>However, the pig races, being held for just the second year, would likely be the star attraction, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a little team of eight piggies that we're training up. They'll have three races over the day, with the third one, at 2 o'clock, the politicians' race. Everyone likes to bet on their favourite politician, no doubt."</p>
        
            <p>Dampney said each pig would be named after a politician, some of whom - such as Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, whose brother Jim Peters was one of the show organisers - had close ties to the area.</p>
        
            <p>"The Jones Boy is another one. Shane is actually opening the show for us this year. Shane Reti is a pig that's ready to run, and Willow Jean Prime, she was prime last year, she'll still be prime this year. There's a few others, like David - he sees more - and a new piggy this year, Christopher Luxon. He's the one that hasn't got any hair."</p>
        
            <p>Dampney said entry to the showgrounds, and all bouncy castles and other children's activities, would be free for kids aged 14 and under.</p>
        
            <p>"Kaikohe isn't a wealthy town. We've just gone through Christmas and New Year, there's not a lot of money left around. It actually costs us to put the show on, but we do it this way to try and give the local kids a good day out where it doesn't cost the families an awful lot of money."</p>
        
            <p>Kids' competitions would include three-legged races, tug of war, egg-and-spoon races, and haybale stacking.</p>
        
            <p>Another attraction unique to the Kaikohe show was free bus tours put on by power company Top Energy to the nearby Ngāwhā geothermal power station.</p>
        
            <p>The plant now provided the bulk of Northland's electricity.</p>
        
            <p>Dampney said cattle numbers at the show continued to be well down due to Mycoplasma bovis and, with State Highway 1 still closed at Mangamuka Gorge, the added difficulty of bringing animals to the show from further north.</p>
        
            <p>However, he expected a good turnout of dairy goats this year.</p>
        
            <p>The showgrounds are at the corner of State Highway 12 and Ngāwhā Springs Road, about 4km east of Kaikohe. Free parking is available on Ngāwhā Springs Road.</p>
        
            <p>The gates open early for competitors with the horse events starting between 8 and 9am. Most other activities will get underway around 10am.</p>
