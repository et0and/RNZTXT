            <p>A new report has found greater protection is needed for soil in urban areas, highlighting the important role it plays in natural drainage during heavy rain and providing green spaces in cities.</p>
        
            <p>Urban ground truths, the latest report from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, includes recommendations for clearer guidance for territorial authorities from the government to preserve the quantity and quality of soil in urban areas.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Simon Upton said his main goal was to put soil on the radar, and draw attention to its benefits and the things which threaten it.</p>
        
            <p>With the National government's housing growth plan aiming to fast-track developments on new land, requiring councils to zone enough land for 30 years of demand, increasing areas of untouched soil will be under threat.</p>

            <p>Soil acts as a drainage mechanism, slowing the movement of water and filtering contaminants. With more severe weather events predicted due to climate change, this would only increase in importance, the report found.</p>
        
            <p>"When we get extreme [weather] events, if everything's been hardened over and you're having to use concrete pipes for everything, there's a lot of cost," Upton said.</p>
        
            <p>"Soil, to the extent that we can leave it in place, can absorb a lot of moisture."</p>
        
            <p>It also supported vegetation, with deeper soil allowing for larger, more shady trees, with greater capacity for carbon sequestration and mitigating the "urban heat island effect".</p>
        
            <p>The report said shade from trees could provide measurable air temperature cooling of between 0.4 and 4.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
        
            <p>The country needed to make the most of the green space it had, he said, meaning allowing trees to get as big as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to be living in a much hotter world, and if our cities are concrete, asphalt and built structures with very little green because there isn't the soil to support trees, we're going to be living in a very hot place."</p>
        
            <p>Currently, the report found, housing developments tend to remove more soil than necessary in the name of efficiency and keeping costs low.</p>
        
            <p>Geotechnical engineers did not tend to focus on soil health, rather on providing a solid base for new homes.</p>
        
            <p>The report found the most common foundation type, concrete slab, required a flat section on "good ground", often led to over-excavation.</p>
        
            <p>Without a thick enough layer of soil or subsoil, tree growth was stunted and drainage was compromised.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, excavated soil was often discarded. According to the Ministry for the Environment, 800,000 tonnes of soil was dumped each year, often in landfills.</p>
        
            <p>The report said: "To summarise, regulation and geotechnical requirements require some soil to be excavated. But there are additional drivers that relate more to the current market".</p>
        
            <p>These included, maximising dwellings and efficiency of site clearing, and therefore, profit.</p>
