            <p>The 2025 Screen Actors Guild Awards have wrapped at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium and Exposition Hall, making way for the biggest award show of the year, next week's Oscars.</p>
        
            <p>But let's back up to Sunday's event, which was hosted by "Nobody Wants This" star and SAG nominee Kristen Bell and streamed on Netflix.</p>
        
            <p>In the television categories, "Shōgun," which entered the night with five nominations, had a big night. In addition to the individual honors won by Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai, the FX series picked up the best performance by an ensemble in a drama series honor. Heavy statues for all!</p>
        
            <p>"Only Murders In The Building" also had a good night, winning the best comedy ensemble award and an individual honor for Martin Short, who was absent from the ceremony, presumable due to his Covid.</p>
        
            <p>Among the film nominees, no one project swept the night, with Timothée Chalamet and Demi Moore winning the top lead actor and actress honors, respectively, and "Conclave" winning best film ensemble.</p>
