            <p>A shop owner near Auckland's Sky Tower says the area needs more police to keep his customers and employees safe.</p>
        
            <p>Several businesses, including government agency Stats NZ, have expressed concerns about recent criminal activity in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>One shop owner on Victoria Street, who asked to stay anonymous so he would not be targeted, said he had been robbed multiple times.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm worried about doing business in the CBD. [I was robbed] two or three times ... somebody tried to attack me. I've called police many times," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a lot of people sitting in front of shops drinking alcohol, I have to call security several times a day."</p>

            <p>He said people would loiter outside his shop and ask customers for money as they entered and exited the store.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unsafe for us to be doing business around [here]," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tourist area in front of the Sky Tower, police should be around all the time and [look] after these people."</p>
        
            <p>He urged police to set up more patrols in the area to protect tourists visiting the city.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, deputy mayor Desley Simpson said she had written to the ministers of police and mental health to find a solution together to address antisocial behaviour and crime in the central city.</p>
        
            <p>"We're doing quite a lot from our perspective. We have added more money into the city centre in April for a safety coordinator with safety hubs, community patrols, New Zealand MƒÅori and Pacific wardens," she said.</p>

            <p>"And then again in May we've put some more funding in there for compliance wardens, but those compliance wardens really can only address low-level antisocial behaviour such as enforcing liquor bans and obstruction and general nuisance.</p>
        
            <p>"But criminal behaviour has to be dealt with by police and we need the resources for that."</p>
        
            <p>There needed to be a bigger police presence in the city, she said.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, police area commander Grant Tetzlaff said crime in Auckland CBD had been growing over recent years, but had plateaued in the past six months.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Tetzlaff said police were working to help prevent alcohol-related disorder and crime.</p>
        
            <p>"The issues causing crime in the CBD can be complex in nature and involve a number of agencies and community partners.</p>
        
            <p>"For that reason, police cannot solve these issues alone."</p>
