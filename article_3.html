            <p>Family of the man who was shot in the Wairarapa over the weekend have been removed from the courtroom after creating a disturbance as one of the men charged with his death appeared on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>23-year-old Doreion Peri Ropata Hard died on Saturday after he was found in a vehicle with a gunshot wound.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery came following a report of a shot or shots fired at a vehicle as it was driven out of the Fresh Choice supermarket in nearby Featherston, sending emergency services rushing to the site, about 4pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, aged 23 and 25, were arrested and charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>The first of the two defendants appeared before the court this morning.</p>

            <p>Two family members of Hard, who were in the gallery, stood up yelling profanities at the defendant.</p>
        
            <p>"You killed our family member," one yelled.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be waiting for you," the other threatened.</p>
        
            <p>Both were quickly escorted from the courtroom.</p>
        
            <p>The defendant has been granted interim name suppression and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>He will next appear at the High Court in Wellington on 11 April.</p>
