            <p>Leaders from around the world have been paying tribute to the Māori king, Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who has passed away at the aged of 69.</p>
        
            <p>King Charles sent a message of condolence on Friday morning (NZT), saying he and his wife Queen Camilla were "profoundly saddened" to learn of Kiingi Tuheitia's death.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the greatest pleasure of knowing Kiingi Tuheitia for decades. He was deeply committed to forging a strong future for Māori and Aotearoa New Zealand founded upon culture, traditions and healing, which he carried out with wisdom and compassion.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember with immense fondness meeting Kiingi Tuheitia many times, including when Her Majesty and I were hosted so warmly and graciously at the Tuurangawaewae Marae in 2015, and then again during our meeting at Buckingham Palace last year.</p>
        
            <p>"His death is a particular shock in view of the fact that I had only very recently spoken to Kiingi on the telephone at the beginning of August.</p>
        
            <p>"Kua hinga te tōtara i Te Waonui a Tāne. (A mighty tōtara tree has fallen.)</p>
        
            <p>"My wife and I extend our deepest condolences to Kiingi Tuheitia's whaanau and friends and all those who will mourn his loss. Our special thoughts and prayers will be with you at this most difficult and heartbreaking of times."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Pacific Islands Forum secretary-general Baron Waqa said it was "devastating" to receive the news as the meeting was finishing in Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole of the Pacific will mourn his passing."</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown said his country would be mourning the Māori king and remembering the great things he had done.</p>
        
            <p>"Haera ra e te ariki.</p>
        
            <p>"Memories that stick out of the Māori king is a person with such strong belief in his people, his humbleness, his humility that he carried, but also his very strong mana that he carried with him as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Iona Thomas, the British High Commissioner to New Zealand, said she had been "saddened" to hear of the "sudden passing" of the king - "a man of great kindness and dedicated to peace".</p>
        
            <p>"I express my greatest sympathies to his whānau and all who are mourning the Māori King."</p>
        
            <p>Ard van der Vorst, The Netherlands' ambassador to New Zealand, posted on X about the "sad news".</p>
        
            <p>"At this difficult moment my thoughts are with the Kingitanga family and Tainui people. May his legacy inspire to continue to build a future as he envisioned. Rest in Peace."</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
