            <p>A Tauranga woman is locked in a row with council over unpaid rates because she believes the city was "denied democracy" when the commission was reappointed.</p>
        
            <p>Jan Gyenge has taken the stance "no democracy, no rates", so hasn't paid them since March 2022 when the commission's reappointment was announced.</p>
        
            <p>She didn't want to reveal the unpaid amount, but the council's website shows her rates for March 2022 to June 2024 as $8770. Unpaid rates can incur a 10 percent penalty so the amount owed could be $9647.</p>
        
            <p>The four-person commission led by Anne Tolley took over running Tauranga City Council in February 2021 after the previous dysfunctional council was sacked.</p>
        
            <p>In March 2022, former Local government Minister Nanaia Mahuta reappointed the commission until July 2024 and cancelled the election set for October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Gyenge said the community should have been consulted about the reappointment.</p>
        
            <p>"Every resident's rights matter collectively."</p>
        
            <p>The commission's 2021 exit plan recommended their term be extended so they could complete their work, including restoring trust in the council and creating a robust long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Mahuta said their reappointment would provide stability as the council still faced substantial infrastructure and funding challenges.</p>

            <p>Gyenge said by withholding rates, she wanted to change the behaviour of the commissioners and Tauranga City Council.</p>
        
            <p>"An election is one aspect of the democratic process. Democracy is to be observed on a daily basis by the council. It's about how decisions are made and how information is garnered.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about us all - not just a few people."</p>
        
            <p>The Bethlehem resident is asking the council to "put it right" and write the unpaid amounts off and stop the court action against her.</p>
        
            <p>The council has begun legal action to recover the unpaid rates, Gyenge said. If the rates remain unpaid the council can sell the property to recover the debt.</p>
        
            <p>The Local government Act required rates were paid but councils must also deliver democracy.</p>
        
            <p>Gyenge said she would challenge the council on this point.</p>
        
            <p>"What happened was not right. If no one takes a stand and feels some pain about it, then other peopleâ€¦ feel disenfranchised."</p>
        
            <p>Now the council has elected members, Gyenge said she would pay her rates from now on.</p>
        
            <p>Activist Penny Bright took a similar stance, refusing to pay rates on her Auckland property for 11 years due to a perceived lack of transparency in council spending.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, before her death, Bright paid Auckland Council her outstanding bill to stop the property being sold.</p>

            <p>A Department of Internal Affairs spokesperson said the law required property owners to pay their rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Attempts to avoid paying rates that fund essential services for our cities and towns can take precious time and resources and is something we would strongly discourage, especially at a time when ratepayers are facing rising cost pressures."</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga's commission performed the same functions and powers as elected representatives, they said.</p>
        
            <p>The commission was accountable to the community and were required to follow local government processes, including consultation, the spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>Tauranga City Council rating policy and revenue manager Jim Taylor didn't comment on Gyenge's case specifically.</p>
        
            <p>Rates provided around half of council's income and were used to fund council activities and services, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was important everyone paid their share, but the council understood some ratepayers might not be able to pay their rates by the due date, Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>The rates collection team worked with many ratepayers each year to help them catch up on their rates, he said.</p>
        
            <p>If payments are overdue, the council contacts the property owner to organise a payment arrangement.</p>
        
            <p>If payment is not received by the end of the year and there's a mortgage on the property, the council contacted the bank. If the outstanding amount wasn't received within 90 days the bank pays the rates, which is added to the mortgage.</p>
        
            <p>If there isn't a mortgage on the property the council uses Baycorp, its collection agency, to pursue the debt.</p>
        
            <p>If Baycorp was unsuccessful, council can begin legal action.</p>
        
            <p>If the debt remained unpaid, the property can be sold through a rating sale.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said council preferred to reach an arrangement with the ratepayer rather than sell the property.</p>
        
            <p>"Paying all outstanding rates and penalties, and any costs, interest or disbursements, would immediately stop all proceedings."</p>
