            <p>A Department of Conservation (DOC) briefing paper on options for repairing the Tongariro Chateau warns the government it will lose money on any investment it makes such a project.</p>
        
            <p>The August briefing obtained via the Official Information Act says a significant Crown investment would be required to bring the Chateau up to standard for re-leasing.</p>
        
            <p>Actual costs were blacked out wherever they appeared in the heavily redacted document.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said it had engaged property agents with expertise in the hotel industry to advise on whether it would be commercially feasible for a private operator to once again run the Chateau as a hotel.</p>
        
            <p>It considered a short-term occupational lease typical of the industry and a long-term lease.</p>
        
            <p>Both options came with significant costs for seismic strengthening - the highest cost - and significant repairs before an investor or operator could take on the business.</p>
        
            <p>"This would cover costs for repairs, refurbishment of some staff accommodation, hotel room and hotel facilities renovation, other related construction and project management costs and contingencies," the paper said.</p>
        
            <p>Under the headline "Return on Crown Investment" the paper said these costs could be partially offset by lease revenue for both options.</p>
        
            <p>"However, under both options, investment in the chateau results in negative net value to the Crown."</p>
        
            <p>It also warned the risk of climate change to ski operations could affect the commercial viability of the chateau.</p>
        
            <p>The briefing recommended not taking an expressions of interest process forward and sought direction from Minister of Conservation Tama Potaka on next steps.</p>
        
            <p>As background, DOC reminded the minister it was costing the department $1.8 million to maintain the abandoned building to a basic level in 2023/2024 and it had budgeted $2.1 million in 2024/2025 for the same purpose.</p>
        
            <p>It had also provided advice on the cost of decommissioning the building.</p>
        
            <p>The briefing did not consider the wider economic benefits for the region of a Crown investment in the chateau or its heritage value to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we know that the hotel previously employed 73 staff at peak operations and accounted for 30 percent hotel room stock in the district," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"The permanent or long-term closure of the chateau alongside uncertainty over the ski fields is likely to negatively impact the local economy."</p>
        
            <p>DOC said it intended to engage with iwi, the local community, Heritage New Zealand, and the Ministry of Culture and Heritage to inform Cabinet on decisions about the long-term future of the building.</p>
        
            <p>The briefing paper signed off by saying if the minister agreed DOC not proceed with the expressions of interest process it would prepare a Cabinet paper by October 2024.</p>
        
            <p>If not, it would proceed and complete the process by September and report back on its outcome in early October.</p>
