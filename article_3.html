            <p>A large Wellington apartment building was evacuated on Sunday and the area cordoned off due to concerns about structural damage following an earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>The magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Wellington in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday evening, the Victoria Lane Apartments in Victoria Street were cordoned off and residences evacuated "as a safety precaution", police said.</p>
        
            <p>That was over "concerns there may be structural damage".</p>
        
            <p>Cordons were in place at the intersections of Victoria/Dixon Street, Victoria/Ghuznee Street, and Dixon/Taranaki Street.</p>
        
            <p>"Residents and members of the public will not be permitted to enter the area until assessment of the building is complete and the area deemed safe to return to," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Just after midnight, the spokesperson said the building had been assessed by Fire and Emergency New Zealand as safe to re-enter.</p>
        
            <p>"Residents are able to return and cordons in the area will be removed."</p>
        
            <p>The 16-storey building has 123 apartments, as well as retail and commercial offices on the lower four floors.</p>
        
            <p>A resident of a neighbouring apartment building earlier told RNZ that the building was evacuated because it had been swaying since the morning's earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency staff member at the cordon told him that engineers were being sent in, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The man noted that the vendors "charged through the nose" for the Victoria Lane Apartments because they were supposed to be so safe.</p>
        
            <p>Completed in March 2023, the apartments were marketed as setting "a new standard in apartment seismic safety as Wellington's first base-isolated apartment development".</p>
