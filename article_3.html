            <p>The Electricity Authority could be in for a shake up with the Government assessing who is best placed to lead the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition has announced a multi-pronged plan to deal with what it's calling an energy security crisis, including a review of the electricity market.</p>
        
            <p>Energy Minister Simeon Brown said he had asked for advice on the right skills mix to fill the vacancies coming up on the Authority's board in October.</p>
        
            <p>The Authority is under pressure to fix the problems that have led to skyrocketing wholesale power prices.</p>
        
            <p>The government also announced plans to pass legislation by the end of the year to reverse the oil and gas exploration ban and remove regulatory barriers to the construction of facilities to import Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).</p>
