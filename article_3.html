            <p>The weekend saw Wrestlemania, a two-night professional wrestling extravaganza, held in Philadelphia in front of 145,000 fans and watched by millions around the world. Meanwhile, a much smaller audience tuned in to the Wellington Phoenix's own pinnacle event, albeit with the same intrinsic importance.</p>
        
            <p>But despite the difference in spectacle, the two bore similarities in what could still prove to be a fruitful weekend for the 'Nix.</p>
        
            <p>Sure, they lost, but so did Cody Rhodes, the headline act from WWE's flagship pay-per-view. Much like the 'Nix, the 'American Nightmare' was himself hunting a long-elusive championship. However, on night one, he was pinned by The Rock - AKA Dwayne Johnson, probably pushed back into the wrestling ring after the rotten tomato that was Black Adam. In the semi-scripted world of professional wrestling, that meant Cody's task the next night against Roman Reigns, the Rock's cousin and the 1316-day champ was even harder with a set of stipulations in favour of Reigns.</p>
        
            <p>But against all odds Cody won on Sunday - with a little help from legends John Cena and The Undertaker.</p>
        
            <p>This wrestling chat might be over the heads of many so let's put it in football language. This weekend, Central Coast Mariners snatched a late 2-1 win over the 'Nix and in doing so went top of the table. The reigning A-League champions now have a favourable run-in and the 'Nix look set to miss out on a table-topping campaign.</p>

            <p>However, in the grand scheme of things, who cares?</p>
        
            <p>Cody Rhodes lost the match which set up his title clash and was still paraded around Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field the following night as the champion. In wrestling's code of honour world of kayfabe, I doubt he cared about that previous loss.</p>
        
            <p>Which is how the 'Nix will feel if they go on to win the A-League, regardless of their status as Premier champions or not.</p>
        
            <p>Just ask their main rivals the Mariners. It's doubtful they think much about falling short of Melbourne City in the league last season, considering they pasted them 6-1 in the subsequent Grand Final.</p>
        
            <p>Much like Rhodes, the 'Nix also had the benefit of some babyfaces running interference over the weekend. Instead of The Undertaker they had the Brisbane Roar, Newcastle Jets and Western United who all defeated close rivals in the play-off hunt. Those results leave the 'Nix with a golden chance to effectively secure a top-two spot against Melbourne Victory next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>They will then have another chance to get the better of their own 'Final Boss', the Mariners, much like Rhodes did at Wrestlemania over the weekend. Cody's dad, the 'American Dream' Dusty Rhodes once famously spoke of 'hard times' and the Phoenix have experienced plenty of those in their barren quest for silverware.</p>
        
            <p>If missing out on the Premiership is followed by a Grand Final triumph, those hard times will have been worth it.</p>
