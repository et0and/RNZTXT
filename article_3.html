        <h2>Live: Helium balloon takes out power to 900 homes in Petone</h2>
        <p>
More than 400 properties have now had their power restored, in a day that has seen parts of the lower North Island inundated with water.
</p>
        
            <p>More than 900 homes were left without power on Monday evening after a helium balloon hit power lines in Petone, Lower Hutt, as the wider region tries to mop up after heavy rain and flooding.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson at Wellington Electricity is reminding people not to release or have the helium balloons near a power line, as it can be dangerous and cause outages.</p>
        
            <p>About 480 homes remain without power but electricity is expected to be restored by 8:30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua has had a "one in 20 year" amount of rainfall on Monday, with other areas across the Wellington Region facing a "one in five year" event, Wellington Region Emergency Management Office regional manager Jeremy Holmes said.</p>
        
            <p>There have been reports of flooding across KƒÅpiti, Hutt City, Featherston, Silverstream, Trentham, Porirua, Waiwhetu, Whitby, Stokes Valley and Naenae on Monday.</p>
