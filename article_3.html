            <p>Movie star Tom Cruise rappelled from the roof of France's national stadium and received the Olympic flag, bringing a heavy dose of Hollywood to the closing ceremony of the Paris Games as the French capital handed over to the next host Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>Grammy winner H.E.R teased the Mission Impossible soundtrack as Cruise made his leap, drawing gasps from spectators as he dropped 50 metres to the floor of the Stade de France, in a finale to the ceremony that blended the traditional, the obscure and the razzle dazzle of Tinseltown.</p>
        
            <p>While Paris used landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles to win the hearts of Olympians and spectators alike, LA was swift to turn to its star draw: A-list celebrities.</p>
        
            <p>A large number of the New Zealand team attended, drawing a close to a stunning Games for the Kiwis who are bringing home 20 medals.</p>
