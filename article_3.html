            <p>One of the core beliefs at Tuurangawaewae Marae is that 'no one should go home hungry', and the people of Tainui have epitomised the Māori value of Manaakitanga - or hospitality - during the tangihanga of Kiingi Tuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>The death of Kiingi Tuheitia has been a shock, but once it was announced, they flocked to the marae.</p>
        
            <p>They might be in the kitchen making sandwiches, outside directing traffic or operating the livestream.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Rangi Mātāmua - who arrived with his iwi Tūhoe - said Tainui were made to host events of this scale.</p>
        
            <p>"I know my own people would struggle to do what they do. They don't just do it for just one event, they do this kind of national massive gatherings to continue to unite us year after year. How many events like this occur here, and they do it on the aroha and hard work of the people of Tainui."</p>
        
            <p>It showed their love for the kaupapa and for the other iwi who attended, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are breaking their backs to manaaki te ao Māori, I do take my hat off to them.</p>
        
            <p>"I fail to have words really to bestow upon them just what they've done not just today, but since the establishment of the Kiingitanga."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiingitanga has been a burden on the people of Tainui in many ways, but they continued to carry it with such humility, Mātāmua said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour MP Cushla Tangaere-Manuel arrived representing her iwi Ngāti Porou and the wider Tairawhiti.</p>
        
            <p>"I think what you observe when you come here is that people are born into manaaki here.</p>
        
            <p>"Intergenerational jobs, people have their role from generations and they are just a well oiled machine," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Another iwi, Rangitāne, travelled up to Waikato from Wairarapa on Monday, and instead of having to return home straight after paying their respects they were hosted at Te Kauri Marae in Rāhui Pōkeka, Huntly.</p>
        
            <p>Rangitāne kaumātua Manahi Paewai said being welcomed onto a marae by their hosts beat traveling through the night in a bus by a wide margin.</p>
        
            <p>"Miharo, kātahi te miharo nā rātau i tūwhera mai ō rātau kuwaha kia noho mai mātau Rangitāne o te Wairarapa, Rangitāne o Tamaki nui-a-rua. (The level of hospitality was amazing, they opened their doors to us of Rangitāne o te Wairarapa and Rangitāne o Tamaki nui-a-rua.)"</p>
