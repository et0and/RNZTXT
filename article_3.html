            <p>The Vatican said on Saturday that Pope Francis' health had deteriorated over the past 24 hours and for the first time described his condition as "critical", reporting he had needed supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Vatican said the 88-year-old Francis, who has double pneumonia, had suffered a "prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis". "The Holy Father's condition remains critical," the statement said. "The Pope is not out of danger."</p>
        
            <p>"The Holy Father remains alert and has spent the day in a chair, though he is more unwell than yesterday. At the moment, the prognosis remains guarded," the Vatican said.</p>
        
            <p>The Pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on 14 February after experiencing difficulty breathing for several days.</p>
        
            <p>The Vatican said on Saturday that doctors had to administer a "high flow" of oxygen because of his breathing crisis. It added that the blood transfusions were necessary because tests showed he had a low platelet count, associated with anaemia.</p>
        
            <p>The Vatican announced earlier in the day that he would not appear in public on Sunday to lead prayer with pilgrims, the second consecutive week he will have missed the event.</p>
        
            <p>Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican has described the pope's infection as "complex," saying it is being caused by two or more micro-organisms.</p>
        
            <p>In a briefing on Friday, two of his doctors said the Pope was highly vulnerable due to his age and frailty.</p>
        
            <p>Dr. Sergio Alfieri, a senior member of the Gemelli staff, said there was a risk the lung infection could spread to his bloodstream and develop into sepsis, which "could be very difficult to overcome".</p>
        
            <p>Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered bouts of ill health in the past two years. He is particularly prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.</p>
        
            <p>Concerns over his health have led at least one cardinal to suggest that Francis might resign if he felt unable to carry on.</p>
        
            <p>However, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state who is sometimes referred to as the deputy pope, dismissed such talk as "useless speculation."</p>
        
            <p>"Now we are thinking about the Holy Father's health, his recovery, and his return to the Vatican. These are the only things that matter," Parolin told the Corriere della Sera daily in comments published on Saturday.</p>
