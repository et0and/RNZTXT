            <p>Police were wanting any information from the public about activity in the Liberton and Pine Hill areas, especially around 10pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"Residents living in the area with road facing CCTV that may have captured footage of the night are urged to contact police," Croudis said.</p>
