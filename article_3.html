            <p>Police searching for a woman who went missing on Monday while driving from Dunedin to Queenstown have found her alive in her crashed car.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff reported Colleen, also known as Rhonda, was making her way to pick up her grandson from Queenstown Airport but never arrived.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday morning, police said they were worried about her safety. She was last known to be in Cromwell, an area she was unfamiliar with.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before midday, police issued another statement saying she had been found safe and well.</p>
        
            <p>It was then revealed that Colleen was located in her car which had crashed on Gibbston Highway - along the route to Queenstown Airport.</p>
        
            <p>"She is in a moderate condition and is being transported to Lakes Hospital."</p>
        
            <p>Colleen was being transported via a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank those who provided information to assist in locating her."</p>
        
            <p>The road where the crash occurred was closed but it was expected it would reopen early this afternoon.</p>
