            <p>The retired Archbishop of Wellington says evidence provided to a police investigation shows allegations against him could never have happened.</p>
        
            <p>The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal against Cardinal John Dew, who was seeking an injunction against Warner Brothers-discovery to prevent a Newshub story being broadcast.</p>
        
            <p>The court judgement says the story alleges the abuse of two children at St Joseph's Orphanage in Upper Hutt in 1977.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Cardinal Dew said the police investigation had been closed and no charges had been laid.</p>
        
            <p>Cardinal Dew said sworn affidavits to the police proved the allegations could never have happened and the police investigated and were not laying charges.</p>
        
            <p>"From the moment, I was told of this alleged behaviour I have strenuously denied that the events described ever happened," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not know the person making the allegation against him and it was false.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not know the person making the allegations and have never met him. The allegation against me is false, it may come from a well of anguish and grief arising from other reasons."</p>
        
            <p>He said the accusation dated back to when he was an Assistant Priest in Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>"I stated immediately, and state again now, that there have never been any instances of improper or abusive behaviour in my 48 years of priesthood."</p>
        
            <p>Cardinal Dew said when he learned of the complaint he followed church protocols and stepped aside from any ministry while the police investigated.</p>
        
            <p>He said the matter had now been thoroughly investigated by police.</p>
        
            <p>"The Police have informed me that this investigation has now been concluded, their file has been closed and no charges will be laid against me."</p>
        
            <p>"I am acutely aware of how distressing this is for many; survivors who have put their trust in me, our church community and my family and friends," Cardinal Dew's statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"I state once again that all incidents of abuse are wrong. I hope and pray that all abuse victims will find peace and healing.</p>
        
            <p>"I restate that these alleged events never happened."</p>
        
            <p>The church is also investigating but said all complaints were sent to Rome as a matter of course.</p>
