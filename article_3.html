        <h2>NZ Merino Company supplier's have farmers suspended after animal welfare investigation</h2>
        <p>
Two farmers have been suspended after video footage shows them standing on a sheep's neck, dragging them across the floor and sewing up a wound without pain relief.

            <p>Two farmers have been temporarily suspended as part of a New Zealand Merino Company investigation into animal welfare at some of its supplier's farms.</p>
        
            <p>In late 2024, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released an exposé into 11 sheep farms and shearing sheds across Aotearoa, raising animal welfare concerns for the sheep being shorn.</p>

PETA says video footage captured on New Zealand farms exposes the cruelty involved in sheep shearing.

            <p>The merino company has found industry breaches in the process, but said much of the footage released by PETA has been wrongly attributed to their programme.</p>
        
            <p>Video footage PETA said was taken at Hunter Valley in Otago showed what it called atrocities, including workers standing on a sheep's neck, dragging them across the floor and sewing up a bloody wound without pain relief.</p>
        
            <p>PETA said all farms targeted in its investigation supplied ZQ-certified wool, which is described as the "world's leading ethical wool brand" - but the New Zealand Merino Company disputes this.</p>

            <p>The company employed independent investigator Auditor Control Union to look into the two farms identified in the videos, and found breaches of Z-Q and the Responsible Wool Standard.</p>
        
            <p>Breaches related to inadequate training and supervision of staff and contractors, minimising animal stress and best practice animal handling, leading to two farmers being temporarily stood down.</p>
        
            <p>However New Zealand Merino Company chief executive Angus Street said it was found the farms were well maintained, sheep were in good condition and there was no evidence of mistreatment.</p>
        
            <p>The investigator did a further 50 full site inspections at other ZQ-supplier sites as part of a wider investigation.</p>
        
            <p>It issued 35 corrective actions, mostly on documentation and record keeping.</p>
        
            <p>There are a further nine corrective actions pending from the investigator to be resolved within 30 days.</p>
        
            <p>The merino company said it's focussed on enhancing its ZQ programme.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in a statement, PETA vice president Jason Baker said it was unsurprising that New Zealand Merino Company was trying to defend, deflect and deny the claims, rather than addressing them.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said despite the claim the farms were not a ZQ facility, they refused to explain why ZQ-branded boxes were being used on site.</p>
