            <p>Hosts of Newshub's AM Show have thanked viewers for their support as it airs its final show on Newshub's last day.</p>
        
            <p>Owner Warner Bros Discovery confirmed the closure of Newshub in April, with its last day of broadcast on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Despite it being the end of an era, AM show hosts Melissa Chan-Green and Lloyd Burr, donned bright colours for their final show, which focused on celebrating their colleagues at Newshub.</p>
        
            <p>AM was launched in 2017 and has had an array of familiar hosts over the years including Ryan Bridge, Duncan Garner and Amanda Gillies.</p>
        
            <p>The last broadcast began with Burr and Chan-Green thanking viewers for tuning in over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"Your support is what makes this show," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are celebrating all of the good things that happened over the last few years here," Chan-Green said.</p>
        
            <p>During the final broadcast, three Newshub journalists spoke about their most memorable moments at the broadcaster and discussed where they would be going next.</p>
        
            <p>It's not yet known where Chan-Green will be heading next, but Burr will be joining Stuff as their new explainer editor.</p>
        
            <p>Viewers have sent in their thoughts and feelings on the AM show and the final broadcast.</p>
        
            <p>One said: "I live by myself and it's like having a buddy there as I start my day".</p>
        
            <p>The broadcast had a live cross with journalist Mitch Redman, who was standing outside the Auckland studio.</p>
        
            <p>He said today was "the end of a 35-year era", but it was business as usual for most Newshub staff as they worked away on preparing the final news bulletin to run on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The last-ever Newshub 6pm bulletin will air on Three tonight.</p>
