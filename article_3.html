            <p>At least 25 people have been killed in a shelling attack in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, the Moscow-installed leader of the region says.</p>
        
            <p>Denis Pushilin said a Ukrainian strike, which also injured 20 people, had hit a busy market and that the casualty figures might change.</p>
        
            <p>Russia's foreign ministry denounced the strike as a "barbaric terrorist attack" against civilians.</p>
        
            <p>There has so far been no comment from Ukraine on the incident.</p>
        
            <p>BBC News was not able to immediately verify the circumstances around the strike.</p>
        
            <p>Pushilin said the "horrendous" strike took place when the market was at its busiest.</p>
        
            <p>Photographs published by Reuters news agency appeared to show destroyed shop fronts, as well as bodies lying in the street.</p>
        
            <p>According to AFP, a local resident named Tatiana told local media she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying," she was quoted as saying.</p>
        
            <p>Donetsk city and parts of the wider region in eastern Ukraine were first seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014, and the area has been partially controlled by Moscow ever since.</p>
        
            <p>The city is around 20km from the frontline. Areas near Donetsk city - including Mariinka and Avdiivka - have seen some of the fiercest fighting of late.</p>
        
            <p>It has been almost two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it has made little progress in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday it claimed to have captured the village of Krokhmalne in north-eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region. A Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed its forces had withdrawn from the area, but said the territory was of little military importance.</p>
        
            <p>Days earlier Moscow also claimed to have taken control of a settlement named Vesele in Donetsk. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
