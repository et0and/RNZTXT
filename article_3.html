            <p>It might feel like the grinch stole Christmas for some this year, with a number of charities reporting the cost of living is hitting their communities hard.</p>
        
            <p>But for those who want to help fill some stockings, we have some tips on what you can donate to help someone have a Merry Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Not sure whether you could donate a whole Christmas ham? The Salvation Army recommends donating non-perishable food items.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland area officer Captain David Daly said currently tinned corned beef was particularly popular, "but any kind of canned goods is always appreciated".</p>
        
            <p>Daly said nappies and personal toiletries were also needed. Christmas-themed treats would also bring festive joy.</p>
        
            <p>The Salvation Army partnered with Countdown, accepting non-perishable food and household donations in its stores.</p>
        
            <p>Daly said people could also donate money online, which enabled the charity to purchase food needed at their food bank centres.</p>
        
            <p>For those wanting to donate a gift, brand new and unwrapped were the main requirements from the Salvation Army.</p>
        
            <p>Nationally, Daly said people could drop a gift off at Kmart's Wishing Tree appeal. Gifts could also be taken into the Salvation Army or delivered through another local appeal.</p>
        
            <p>Daly said they usually got plenty of gifts for younger children, but he encouraged people to remember the teenagers too when they were gift-shopping.</p>
        
            <p>The Catalytic Foundation meanwhile was looking to add some sporty cheer to the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Ninety-eight percent of the 208 charities in its annual Community Needs Survey were seeing their communities greatly affected by the current cost-of-living crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"Many children are living in households where parents are needing to make the heartbreaking choice between food or a gift at Christmas time", chief executive Teresa Moore said.</p>
        
            <p>The foundation's Christmas Shoebox Project collected donated gifts, sport gear and essentials, which it gift wrapped and delivered to families in need for Christmas</p>
        
            <p>It requested the items be brand new and "something to love, to play with, to wear, something for school and essential items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap etc".</p>
        
            <p>One of its community partners, ÅŒtara Health Centre, said they were big on encouraging rangatahi to stay active year-round.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the barrier for our community's tamariki to get involved in sports is often not having the gear/equipment in the first place," said operations manager Maddi Schmidt.</p>
        
            <p>
Some ideal items people could donate ahead of Christmas were books, toys, games and stationary, Free For All manager Dee Glentworth said.

            <p>Porirua based store Free For All offered people the chance to pick their own gifts from donated items.</p>
        
            <p>General manager Dee Glentworth said with the cost-of-living crisis and greater awareness of the environment, more people were becoming receptive to giving and receiving pre-loved items.</p>
        
            <p>She said some ideal items people could donate ahead of Christmas were books, toys, games and stationary.</p>
        
            <p>She said people coming into her shop were "wanting things to make their kids smile on Christmas Day".</p>
        
            <p>But it was not just toys for the kids. Dee said socks and underwear - both new and secondhand - were also incredibly popular.</p>
        
            <p>Treat items like cosmetics, candles and moisturisers were also on her list of recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything really that's in good, usable, clean condition, I'm pretty sure we can find a home for it for Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>Dee said Free For All also had a website where people could list items across the country.</p>
