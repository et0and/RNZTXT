            <p>Chris Bishop, the new minister for infrastructure, is promising the new Provincial Growth Fund - now dubbed the Regional Infrastructure Fund - will not be a "slush fund" for New Zealand First pet projects.</p>
        
            <p>The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) was a $3 billion project to invest in the regions. It was created in 2018 as part of Labour's coalition deal with New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop, then in opposition, called it "Labour's reward to NZ First for supporting the coalition", a "a slush fund that lacks transparency", and accused NZ First of using it as a "campaign chest" for the 2020 election.</p>
        
            <p>He also called it a "giant waste of money", accused the minister responsible Shane Jones of "spending cash without making sure business cases stack up", and implied it was better at creating roles for well-paid bureaucrats in Wellington than jobs in the regions.</p>
        
            <p>National's deal with NZ First to form the new government included the Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF), worth $1.2 billion, which Bishop will work on with Jones.</p>
        
            <p>"There were definitely issues with the former Provincial Growth Fund and I think minister Jones would accept that as well," Bishop told Morning Report on Thursday. "I don't want to speak for him, but I think he would accept that as well."</p>
        
            <p>The PGF was useful in that it spent "capital money in the regions on projects that would otherwise have missed out on funding", Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the RIF would "be different" however, set up "up in a way that is ministered well and diligently".</p>
        
            <p>Just how - such as whether Jones will be part of the decision-making - remains to be seen.</p>
        
            <p>"We're taking advice on that and minister Jones and I will be making announcements about that, but yet to be determined exactly how it will workâ€¦ But we're going to make that different. It's going to be great fun and I'm looking forward to working with Shane Jones on it."</p>
