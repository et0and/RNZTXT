        <p>
The show began with a nod to an iconic moment. Here are the highlights from the 2024 show.

            <p>It was déjà vu when Eminem opened the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) with a bunch of look-alikes in blonde wigs, Eminem wearing one too before switching to a baseball cap.</p>
        
            <p>It was a call back to his performance at the 2000 VMAs when he walked in with scores of "Slim Shady" characters dressed like him.</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't the only throwback with host Megan Thee Stallion dressing up like Britney Spears during her 2001 VMA performance of 'Slave 4 U' during which she carried a live snake.</p>
        
            <p>It didn't take long for Megan Thee Stallion to discard her reptile friend.</p>

            <p>There were plenty of awards handed out off camera, but when the ceremony began it was Taylor Swift and Post Malone who accepted the first award.</p>
        
            <p>They won Best Collaboration for 'Fortnight'.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to say, you know, waking up this morning in New York on September 11, I've just been thinking about what happened 23 years ago," Swift said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone who lost a loved one, and everyone that we lost, and that is the most important thing about today and everything that happens tonight."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>She went on to sing Post Malone's praises.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a very clear reason why Post Malone is everyone in music's favourite person to collaborate [with], and it is because you are so ridiculously talented, you are so versatile, and you're the most down to earth person, honestly, so unfailingly polite," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has taken me forever to get him to stop calling me ma'am."</p>
        
            <p>Of course, Post Malone couldn't resist a quip.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes Ma'am," he said when asked by Swift if he wanted to say a few words.</p>
        
            <p>The duo also won the biggest award of the night, Video of the Year, again for 'Fortnight', with Swift giving a shout out to her boyfriend Travis Kelce. Swift also urged Americans to register to vote.</p>

            <p>Girls want to have more than just fun, apparently.</p>
        
            <p>Cyndi Lauper, who won her first MTV VMA at the inaugural awards show 40 years ago, introduced Sabrina Carpenter, saying female artists were dominating the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Carpenter went on to lock lips with an alien during her performance, before winning her first ever MTV VMA for Song of the Year for 'Espresso'.</p>
        
            <p>She thanked her cats and dogs, who she said were watching at home.</p>

            <p>The Video Vanguard award is essentially a lifetime achievement award, and this year it went to Katy Perry.</p>
        
            <p>The award was handed to her by her partner Orlando Bloom.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you so much to MTV for believing in my weirdness from day one and for helping artists extend their world beyond a song," Perry said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are no decade long accidents."</p>
        
            <p>Perry also thanked "the LGBTQ community who I recognise I would not be here without, and who showed me that you can be both kind and cut".</p>

            <p>Chappell Roan read from her diary when she took to the stage to accept the award for Best New Artist.</p>
        
            <p>"I dedicate this to all the drag artists that inspire me and I dedicate this to the queer and trans people that fuel pop," Roan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to the fans who listen to me when I share my joys and fears.</p>
        
            <p>"To all the queer kids in the Midwest watching this right now, I see you, I understand you and don't let anyone tell you you can't be exactly what you want to be, b---h!"</p>
