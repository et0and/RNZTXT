            <p>From delicious cakes to savoury snacks like nachos, here are nine great ways up any leftover pumpkin you've got after carving out your jack-o'-lantern.</p>
        
            <p>A chicken casserole using up the majority of your leftover pumpkin? And you can freeze it? What's not to love. Foodsy owner Kathrine Lynch's country chicken casserole needs a whooping 1kg of pumpkin.</p>

            <p>Chef Sam Parish is all about cooking smarter, not harder. In just a few steps, she conjures up a flavoursome and comforting soup. This version it up a notch with the genius addition of crispy gnocchi and halloumi. The combination of textures and flavour contrasts makes each bite even better than traditional soup. Plus, you'll have extra soup to freeze for a quick meal another day.</p>

            <p>If you're feeling a little adventurous, give your hand a go at this traditional parcel of deliciousness - a buttery pastry filled with either meat or vegetables. Nilufar Allayarova and Hanifa Kodirova, who shared the recipe, say you can even experiment with other fillings to use up other leftovers, like chicken and mushroom or spinach and feta.</p>

            <p>Heather Kaniuk, who has worked in some of the world's top restaurants including at Gordon Ramsay's flagship London restaurant Maze, offers a light cake that can be baked into muffins or a loaf - it's also great for Halloween parties.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you've somehow ended up having to go away for a summer retreat and you're still stuck with that last bit of pumpkin. Inland Adventures' camp oven lasagne just might do the trick.</p>

            <p>And speaking of summer, food writer and author Sophie Gray has the perfect sharing platter which uses up half a kilo pumpkin plus the seeds. (She's helpfully provided tips on how to roast them too.)</p>
        
            <p>There are plentiful of ways you can use the seeds - other than roasting, salting and eating them. Food enthusiast and cookbook author Kelly Gibney has two healthy treats which use up pumpkin seeds (albeit you might need to cook them first, see Sophie Gray's tips above), so nothing goes to waste! And if that's not enough, they also make for great Christmas gifts.</p>

            <p>But if you're really looking to indulge, how about this healthy-ish dessert from Margo and Rosa Flanagan of Two Raw Sisters.</p>
        
            <p>If you're looking to use up every ounce of goodness in that seasonal squash, Little Bird Organics creator Megan May is on the same page. She uses a 2-litre container to collect kitchen scraps which can include - you guessed it - pumpkin skins.</p>
