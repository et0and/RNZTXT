            <p>Desperate for some low-cost and useful gift ideas? It's not too late to craft some Christmas presents, soaps, salves and food items, naturopath and medical herbalist Jane Wrigglesworth says.</p>
        
            <p>Wrigglesworth is the author of Everyday Herbalist and writes for numerous publications including NZ Gardener and Lifestyle Block. She has a raft of ideas on how to fashion useful presents that don't cost much to produce, especially if you've got a flourishing herb garden. </p>

            <p>Even if you're not particularly green-thumbed, re-potting garden centre herbs is a useful trick, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“You can get four herbs, the little potted herbs, for $20... you can either pot them up yourself or just pop them in a gift basket.</p>
        
            <p>“It's a really great idea for someone who loves to cook.”</p>

            <p>For a lover of Asian food, she suggests a combo of lemongrass, Thai basil, coriander and Vietnamese mint. For Italian food fans; mint, thyme, oregano, sage and basil.</p>
        
            <p>“Even if they like good old English food, then maybe rosemary for the roasts or chives and mint.”</p>
        
            <p>Dried herb mixes are another “super-easy gift option,” she says.</p>
        
            <p>“A beautiful gift is rosemary salt. All you're doing is drying your rosemary and mixing that with some coarse salt.</p>
        
            <p>“Once the rosemary is totally dry, put that in a salt grinder and then you've got a beautiful rosemary salt gift.”</p>
        
            <p>No-salt mixes can be made with celery, fennel and dill seeds and dried, powdered bay leaf, she says.</p>
        
            <p>You can dry using a dehydrator but it’s not essential, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“Just put them in little bundles, tie them with a rubber band and hang them up in a warm room.</p>
        
            <p>An airy room with lots of air circulation, not the kitchen, will see them dry in a week, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Wrigglesworth loves to make chamomile and lavender-infused honey. To do this at home, you'll need 50g dried chamomile flowers, 50g dried lavender flowers and 400g raw honey, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“You just want to crush the chamomile flowers and the lavender flowers with a blade of a knife and place in a sterilised jar, top it up with honey, seal with a lid, place it in a warm room and out of direct sunlight.”</p>
        
            <p>Leave that to infuse for about three or four weeks, then strain and transfer to a clean jar in time for Christmas gifting, she says.</p>

            <p>The easiest way to take the DIY soap route is to buy melt-and-pour soap base and add your own fragrance, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a soap base that you melt either in the microwave or on the double boiler on the stove. I like to use an aloe vera soap base, you can get all sorts - soy based and goat milk.”</p>
        
            <p>Then it’s a simple matter of taking it off the heat, adding some essential oils, pouring into a mold and leaving to set, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"It will dry completely in about 24 hours to 48 hours and then you're ready to roll.”</p>
