            <p>At last, the tax cut tease is over, the full details on full display. The Budget's headline was only ever going to be tax cuts - and they arrived almost exactly as promised.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis kept her promise, but will voters thank her?</p>
        
            <p>The tax package was almost identical to what National campaigned on, excepting a slightly delayed start date, and no change to Working for Families abatement thresholds, a promise abandoned in coalition negotiations. </p>
        
            <p>What people receive varies widely depending on their circumstances. Treasury suggests about 730,000 households will get at least $75 a fortnight and about 190,000 will get at least $100. Fewer than 3000 will receive the much-publicised $252 maximum. </p>
        
            <p>Pensioners are in line for just $4.30 every two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Willis is adamant she did not borrow for the $14.7b tax package - but keen observers will note $12b in new borrowing for the total Budget. </p>
        
            <p>She insists the tax cuts were "fully funded" through cuts across the public sector and some revenue measures.</p>

            <p>About two-thirds of new spending went towards health, education, and law and order, but those core areas also show signs of strain.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest broken promise was the lack of Pharmac funding ring-fenced for 13 specific cancer treatments. Willis promised that was yet to come - but the next two Budgets are looking very tight with allowances of just $2.4b in new spending. Treasury officials estimate that won't even cover regular inflation and wage pressures.</p>
        
            <p>The opposition labelled it a Budget with misplaced priorities: tax cuts over public services, landlords over first home buyers, promises ahead of prudence. </p>
        
            <p>But this Budget mostly does what the government said it would: some tax relief, some spending, some savings. Willis will consider that a success, though it carries risk too: try to please everyone and you may end up pleasing no one.</p>
        
            <p>In this week's Focus on Politics, Deputy Political Editor Craig McCulloch examines the first Budget of the coalition government.</p>
