        <h2>At the Movies - Origin</h2>
        <p>
Origin is a serious, well-cast film that presents some fresh and intriguing ideas about racism, says Simon Morris. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Origin is a semi-fictionalised adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about racism. It's a serious film with a strong cast and some fresh and intriguing ideas, says Simon Morris.</p>
        
            <p>Origin is the latest in a movie genre that I didn't even realise was a genre until recently.</p>
        
            <p>Certainly creative non-fiction has been a literary form since Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, I suppose. But it's relatively new on screen.</p>
        
            <p>Origin is about how journalist Isabel Wilkerson wrote a best-selling book about race. It was initially inspired by a real-life tragedy - the murder of a young black kid, Trayvon Martin, by a self-appointed vigilante.</p>
        
            <p>The question Isabel asks is "Why did a poor Latino kill a black man to protect a rich white neighbourhood?" The kneejerk answer "Racism" didn't seem enough somehow.</p>
        
            <p>While the book she wrote was an academic study - Caste: The Origins of our Discontents - Isabel included personal details within it about her marriage, her family, and a number of tragic deaths that happened while she was writing it.</p>
        
            <p>And so does this film.</p>
        
            <p>I think of previous blends of journalism and memoir - The Big Short, Adaptation, Nomadland and others - that all break the once number one rule. They put the writer into their own book.</p>
        
            <p>Origin is as much autobiography as treatise on racism. It was co-written by director Ava DuVernay, who made the more traditional docudrama Selma a few years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Origin stars Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Jon Bernthal as Isabel and her white husband Brett. Among other things it uses their relationship to illustrate key elements of the film.</p>
        
            <p>What is the most important contributor to apparent racism, she asks - colour, class, or something less easily tangible?</p>
        
            <p>What distinguishes Origin is how it attempts to follow Isabel's exploration of her theme with the various things happening in her life as she's doing it. It's an eventful journey - to Germany, to India, to the southern states of the USA.</p>
        
            <p>Though Caste nearly didn't get written at all.</p>
        
            <p>Wilkerson was originally approached by a newspaper editor to write a long piece about the Trayvon Martin case. She passes. She's not that sort of journalist these days, she says, she writes books.</p>
        
            <p>But once she hears the police tapes of the Martin case she changes her mind.</p>
        
            <p>She looks at this case, then at similar but different cases in Nazi Germany, then quite dissimilar cases like one of India's most distinguished statesmen who happened to be 'Dalit' - the lowest of all Indian castes who used to be called "untouchables".</p>
        
            <p>What links these cases?</p>
        
            <p>This is difficult stuff to sell - to publishers, even to her family. But the publishers have faith in her, while her family pushes her to make her point simpler and clearer.</p>
        
            <p>You'd think a film like Origin would also be a hard sell to a practical, profit-minded film company. But Origin is a remarkably well-resourced film.</p>
        
            <p>It looks fantastic, particularly when it flashes back to mass book-burnings in Nazi Germany and to newly independent India. There's a strong cast including Nick Offerman, last seen as the US president in Civil War, here in a small part as a racist plumber in a MAGA hat.</p>
        
            <p>This is a serious film, and it clearly expects us to keep up. But since the real-life book Caste expected the same thing, and went straight to the top of the bestseller list, I think Origin should expect no less either.</p>
        
            <p>I have to say I wasn't convinced the personal soap opera elements were completely necessary - the film is nearly two and a half hours long now. But the ideas in Origin are undeniably fresh and intriguing.</p>
        
            <p>Race is such a taboo subject these days but a regular opening-up of that conversation can't be a bad thing.</p>
