The Bounty Islands are tiny in terms of area – just some bits of granite jutting out of the ocean. But they are huge in terms of seabirds. James Frankham joins a team researching the erect-crested penguins who breed in this remote archipelago. Audio

            <p>The Bounty Islands jut out of the water like giant granite fins. Steep and sheer, with no greenery in sight. They are covered instead by a mottled white – guano or bird poo from the tens of thousands of penguins and albatrosses that come here to breed.  </p>
        
            <p>The Bounty Islands is one of two remote, subantarctic island groups home to the erect-crested penguin. Stout and handsome, with bright yellow crests that look like elaborate punk rock hairdos, their remote breeding sites means they’ve not been studied in depth.  </p>
        
            <p>But Dr Thomas Mattern of the Tawaki Project plans to change that.  </p>
        
            <p>Using drones to make photo mosaics of all the Bounty islands, Thomas has counted each penguin breeding pair and arrived at a number that suggests the Bounty Island population of penguins has remained relatively stable since the mid-1990s. Good news.  </p>
        
            <p>Not the case for their other breeding sites at the Antipodes Islands, where early evidence suggests a significant decline.  </p>
        
            <p>But these island groups are a mere 200 kilometres apart – a hop, skip and a jump in penguin swimming distance. How is one group seemingly doing fine while the other is in trouble?  </p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Geographic’s James Frankham joins an expedition to these remote and wild islands as the scientists begin to unravel this mystery.  </p>
        
            <p>
At the summit of Proclamation Island, part of the Bounty Islands, Otago University scientist Thomas Mattern launches a drone through ‘the albatross layer’ that swarms the island, with Dave Houston acting as an air traffic controller. Mattern (and his daughter Hannah who flew a second drone) took 8,145 photos on 44 white-knuckled flights to map and model the entire island group; data he will use to count every single bird that nests here.
