            <p>The Auckland Arts Festival has started with its own drama. The arrival of the festival staple, The Spiegeltent has been delayed due to global shipping disruptions. Four key performances have been postponed with organisers having to reorganise the schedule. The tent was travelling from Belgium and had planned to go through the Suez Canal but rerouted to go around Cape Horn, adding weeks to its journey. </p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Arts Festival runs until 24 March. </p>

            <p>In Poneke, Mark Amery is joined by playwright Stuart McKenzie who saw the premiere of Eleanor Bishop and Karin McCracken’s Gravity and Grace at Aotearoa New Zealand Festival (until 10 March) ahead of dates at Auckland Arts Festival (21-24 March).</p>
        
            <p>Stuart and Mark are joined by writer Duncan Sarkies, giving some of his picks of the New Zealand Fringe.</p>
        
            <p>Sarkies considers Sweeties, possibly his favourite: "a game show based around themes of how competition and capitalism corrupts communities and friendships."</p>
        
            <p>"I also saw two shows about disastrous health stories," Sarkies says, "one the extremely funny An Almighty Yes by Emma Lang and The Unluckiest Magician by Steve Wilbury which mixes magic and hideous confessional hospital tales." </p>
        
            <p>Both of these shows appear in the upcoming Dunedin Fringe.</p>
        
            <p>Duncan also picks out a travel-based show: the "immaculately staged" Suitcase Show by Trick of The Light.</p>
