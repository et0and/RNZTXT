            <p>Warning: This story deals with conversations around suicide. </p>
        
            <p>Right now, Aucklander Felicity Powell is in the US on a Fulbright scholarship doing a Master's degree in education leadership, organisations and entrepreneurship. But earlier this year she had brain tumour surgery after battling the health system for two years to get to that point.</p>
        
            <p>She first noticed her symptoms shortly before starting her dream job at Rocket Lab, she told RNZ's Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>"I was out surfing with some friends, went to stand up on my board, and my legs didn't work."</p>
        
            <p>She put it down to fatigue, but further symptoms followed.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd wake up in the morning and I couldn't use my left hand properly, I lost peripheral vision in my left eye. I had a lot of bruises down the left side of my body because I kept walking into door frames," she said.</p>
        
            <p>And then she was offered a job at Rocket Lab.</p>
        
            <p>"I was kind of trying to balance, doing what I loved and what was a pretty intense role, and I loved every minute of it, but also having these kind of mysterious health concerns."</p>
        
            <p>The journey to diagnosis was drawn-out, taking 10 months before she got to see a neurologist, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The neurologist who saw me took one look at me and said, 'well, you seem fine.'"</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, she was given an MRI scan, and said at this point "she put her faith in the health system."</p>
        
            <p>But she wasn't fine, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would sometimes get to my desk, and I would have meetings, and then I would have to go subtly to the bathroom to vomit up my breakfast because I was not able to keep anything down.</p>
        
            <p>"I had really bad nausea, I'd get spells of the spins. I'd just be sitting at my desk, and it would feel like somebody had tipped me sideways."</p>
        
            <p>She was finally diagnosed - by email - while on holiday in Mexico trying "re-teach myself how to surf".</p>
        
            <p>A week before Christmas she got an email From Manage My Health.</p>
        
            <p>"It said, in no fewer words, 'intracranial tumour referred to neurosurgery.'"</p>
        
            <p>She then had to return home, tell her family the bad news, and take her next steps.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand's health system also goes on holiday shutdown for three weeks over Christmas, except for emergency services, so I had to wait for three weeks to find out what it actually meant to have a brain tumour."</p>
        
            <p>While grappling with all this she learned she lost her job.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, in short order, my dream job was disestablished, and the programmes were shut down, and suddenly I was left with nothing.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to move out of my apartment because I couldn't afford it. It's very difficult to go job hunting when you have a brain tumour."</p>
        
            <p>It was a terrible low point, and she said, she thought about ending her life.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a plan. I didn't even know what was going to happen with my brain tumour, I was still suffering from the symptoms, and it felt that I had been forgotten by the health service."</p>
        
            <p>Her family wrapped around her, getting her through, and she was finally assigned a date for surgery.</p>
        
            <p>"The tumour was not in a very convenient location, tucked right behind one of the main blood vessels draining from my brain, so there was a high risk going into the surgery, which obviously I was well briefed about, and so we really didn't know what my life was going to look like on the other side of it.</p>
        
            <p>"But I knew that this was really the only opportunity that I had for having a shot at an unhindered life."</p>
        
            <p>She needed a post-surgery goal, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a marathon that I had been originally slated to do a couple of years earlier that I couldn't because of health reasons, and so I really aimed at that.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the Noosa marathon in May, which was only 15 weeks after the date of my surgery and it was only nine weeks after I was signed off by my neurosurgeon, that I was actually allowed to run - I ran my fastest marathon time."</p>
