            <p>When former truck driver Mike Jeffries started a mobile barbecue business 14 years ago, he was one of the "originals".</p>
        
            <p>Now, as well as running branches of The Big Smoke Barbecue Co in Tauranga and Auckland, he's scooping up awards on the international circuit.</p>
        
            <p>With Jesse Mulligan, Mike enthuses about his favourite cut of meat – pork shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>"That moment when you go to pull it and all the different muscles separate…"</p>

            <p>With Mount Maunganui barbecue chef Shane Southby, Mike will teach an American-style barbecue class at the upcoming Flavours of Plenty festival in Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>Years ago, Mike was living in London "driving trucks and bulldozers" when he first discovered the joys of American-style barbecue via a spit roast event and the reality show BBQ Pitmasters.</p>
        
            <p>"I came back from the UK and my dad died at the time. My other half wanted to buy a house. I fed her up on white wine and eventually she felt sorry for me. Next thing you know, I'd talked her into buying a barbecue.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically [we] came back to New Zealand and spent our house deposit on a barbecue. Went from there."</p>
        
            <p>14 years ago, when he started The Big Smoke Barbecue Co, Mike says he was one of the "originals" cooking meat over charcoal.</p>
        
            <p>"There was nothing back then. Even trying to find brisket, they would feed it to the dog and stuff. Back in those days, ribs had no meat."</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton's annual MeatStock festival, which last month attracted 10,000 people, has significantly changed the game locally, Mike says.</p>
        
            <p>Internationally, the Memphis in May world champs are something really special for those passionate about barbecued meat.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Mike's team (led by American barbecue icon Moe Cason) took out third prize in the Pork Shoulder category.</p>
        
            <p>"All the big names of barbecue and America that are there. Even [Foo Fighters frontman] Dave Grohl is a barbecue judge.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty cool. I love going over, meeting some great people and having a good time."</p>
        
            <p>If you're a big fan of American-style meats, a charcoal barbecue can be just as economical to buy as a gas number, Mike says.</p>
        
            <p>His pro tip? Let your meat reach room temperature before throwing it on the heat.</p>
        
            <p>"Otherwise you can shock the meats if you put them in when they're too cold."</p>
