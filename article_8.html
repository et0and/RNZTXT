            <p>Super round was super, but round three throws up a few interesting storylines for the New Zealand teams in Super Rugby Pacific. Can the Crusaders bounce back from a horror start? Are the Hurricanes able to cope without Jordie Barrett? And will the rotated Chiefs be able to get the job done in Brisbane?</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: Friday, 7:05</p>

            <p>A transplanted game is not what Moana would have wanted, but really this stands as an excellent opportunity to lock in some valuable competition points. The Rebels are capable of pulling off a result, like last weekend against the Force, but their defensive system looks about as effective as their financial planning right now. Moana will be keen to gash them as the Rebels are giving up 32 points a game already, so really it'll come down to how well their own defence can restrict the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Pepesana Patafilo, 13 Henry Taefu, 12 Julian Savea, 11 Anzelo Tuitavuki, 10 William Havili, 9 Ere Enari, 8 Lotu Inisi, 7 Sione Havili Talitui (c), 6 Jacob Norris, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Tom Savage, 3 Sione Mafielo, 2 Samiuela Moli, 1 Abraham Pole</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Tomasi Maka, 17 Sateki Latu, 18 Sekope Kepu, 19 Ola Tauelangi, 20 Irie Papuni, 21 Melani Matavao, 22 Christian Lealiifano, 23 Kyren Taumoefolau</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Jake Strachan, 14 Lachie Anderson, 13 Filipo Daugunu, 12 David Feliuai, 11 Andrew Kellaway, 10 Carter Gordon, 9 Ryan Louwrens, 8 Rob Leota (c), 7 Vaiolini Ekuasi, 6 Josh Kemeny, 5 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 4 Josh Canham, 3 Sam Talakai, 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 Matt Gibbon</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ethan Dobbins, 17 Isaac Kailea, 18 Taniela Tupou, 19 Tuaina Taii Tualima, 20 Daniel Maiava, 21 James Tuttle, 22 Glen Vaihu, 23 Lukas Ripley</p>

            <p>The Tahs head into their first game on a high, not only upsetting the Crusaders but showing that they may well have finally turned a much-needed corner in terms of cohesion. Jake Gordon and Tane Edmed looked like George Gregan and Stephen Larkham, so the assignment for the Highlanders loosies is to snuff out the Tahs' confidence as early as they can - however, they're going to have to do it without Billy Harmon and Sean Withy, at least not at first anyway. The pair have been benched after showing up late to a team meeting, which is pretty dumb considering Harmon is the captain.</p>
        
            <p>Waratahs: 15 Max Jorgensen, 14 Mark Nawaqanitawase, 13 Izaia Perese, 12 Joey Walton, 11 Triston Reilly, 10 Tane Edmed, 9 Jake Gordon (c), 8 Langi Gleeson, 7 Charlie Gamble, 6 Ned Hanigan, 5 Hugh Sinclair, 4 Jed Holloway, 3 Harry Johnson-Holmes, 2 Mahe Vailanu, 1 Angus Bell</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Julian Heaven, 17 Hayden Thompson-Stringer, 18 Tom Ross, 19 Miles Amatosero, 20 Fergus Lee-Warner, 21 Teddy Wilson, 22 Harry Wilson, 23 Mosese Tuipulotu</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 15 Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, 14 Timoci Tavatavanawai, 13 Tanielu Tele'a, 12 Sam Gilbert, 11 Jona Nareki, 10 Rhys Patchell, 9 Folau Fakatava, 8 Hugh Renton, 7 Nikora Broughton, 6 Tom Sanders, 5 Max Hicks, 4 Fabian Holland, 3 Jermaine Ainsley, 2 Henry Bell, 1 Ethan de Groot (c)</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ricky Jackson, 17 Daniel Lienert-Brown, 18 Saula Ma'u, 19 Sean Withy, 20 Billy Harmon, 21 James Arscott, 22 Ajay Faleafaga, 23 Jonah Lowe</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: Saturday, 2:05pm</p>
        
            <p>Churchill Park, Lautoka</p>
        
            <p>The Burning West, The Hot Corner, The Graveyard of the Pacific - call it what you want but Churchill Park in Lautoka stands as one of the most formidable venues in the competition. The Crusaders found that out the hard way last year, another loss this weekend will almost certainly see the pitchforks getting raised because their fanbase is not at all used to being winless through three games. The Drua are coming off a loss to Moana but they certainly got their attack going late, so if they can pick up where they left off there could be a big result on the cards.</p>
        
            <p>Fijian Drua: 15 Ilaisa Droasese, 14 Selestino Ravutaumada, 13 Iosefo Masi, 12 Apisalome Vota, 11 Epeli Momo, 10 Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 9 Frank Lomani, 8 Meli Derenalagi (c), 7 Vilive Miramira, 6 Etonia Waqa, 5 Ratu Leone Rotuisolia, 4 Mesake Vocevoce, 3 Jone Koroiduadua, 2 Tevita Ikanivere, 1 Haereiti Hetet</p>

            <p>The Brumbies were horrible against the Chiefs last weekend, so this stands as a good chance to get themselves back on track at home in Canberra. Their opponents are showing every sign so far that they'll be struggling to be more than a bit part player this year, the Force reverting to type early.</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies: 15 Tom Wright, 14 Andy Muirhead, 13 Len Ikitau, 12 Tamati Tua, 11 Corey Toole, 10 Noah Lolesio,9 Ryan Lonergan (c), 8 Rob Valetini, 7 Luke Reimer, 6 Tom Hooper, 5 Darcy Swain, 4 Nick Frost, 3 Sosefo Kautai, 2 Lachlan Lonergan, 1 James Slipper</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Billy Pollard, 17 Blake Schoupp, 18 Rhys Van Nek, 19 Cadeyrn Neville, 20 Jahrome Brown, 21 Klayton Thorn, 22 Declan Meredith, 23 Ollie Sapsford</p>

            <p>The game of the round takes place in the capital on Saturday night, with a Canes outfit having to find a way to win without the suspended Jordie Barrett. It's a tough ask anyway, given just how good the Blues were in their win last weekend against the Highlanders. Their loose forwards in particular are looking in immense form, with Hoskins Sotutu shooting out a reminder to everyone of the form that made him an All Black, while out the back Stephen Perofeta and Zarn Sullivan are running with an assured degree of freedom. There should be an intriguing battle up front, with both teams possessing impressive scrummaging capabilities. Meanwhile the Canes' backs are capable of striking from anywhere through the counter attacking ability of Ruben Love.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Ruben Love, 14 Josh Moorby, 13 Billy Proctor (cc), 12 Riley Higgins, 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Brett Cameron, 9 Cam Roigard, 8 Brayden Iose, 7 Peter Lakai, 6 TK Howden, 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 4 James Tucker, 3 Tyrel Lomax, 2 Asafo Aumua (cc), 1 Tevita Mafileo</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 James O'Reilly, 17 Xavier Numia, 18 Pasilio Tosi, 19 Caleb Delany, 20 Devan Flanders, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Peter Umaga-Jensen, 23 Salesi Rayasi</p>
        
            <p>Blues: 15 Zarn Sullivan, 14 Mark Telea, 13 Rieko Ioane, 12 Bryce Heem, 11 Caleb Clarke, 10 Beauden Barrett, 9 Finlay Christie, 8 Hoskins Sotutu, 7 Dalton Papalii (c), 6 Akira Ioane, 5 James Tucker, 4 Tom Robinson, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Ricky Riccitelli, 1 Ofa Tuungafasi</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Kurt Eklund, 17 Jordan Lay, 18 Marcel Renata, 19 Cameron Suafoa, 20 Adrian Choat, 21 Sam Nock, 22 Harry Plummer, 23 Stephen Perofeta</p>

            <p>It's almost a shame that the Reds have had two New Zealand opponents in a row, because with a little momentum, they do look like they could be a presence at the business end. Their loss to the Canes could have gone either way, but this is a tough ask against a very impressive Chiefs side. Clayton McMillan has rolled the changes, with Cortez Ratima, Samisoni Taukei'aho, Daniel Rona and Josh Ioane starting, but that just shows the depth of his squad more than anything else. Interesting addition to the Reds squad is former All Black Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, who has spent the last five season playing in England and Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>Reds: 15 Jock Campbell, 14 Suli Vunivalu, 13 Josh Flook, 12 Isaac Henry, 11 Mac Grealy, 10 Tom Lyngah, 9 Tate McDermott (cc), 8 Harry Wilson, 7 Fraser McReight, 6 Liam Wright (cc), 5 Ryan Smith, 4 Seru Uru, 3 Zane Nonggorr, 2 Matt Faessler, 1 Sef Fa'agase</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Josh Nasser, 17 Peni Ravai, 18 Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, 19 Cormac Daly, 20 John Bryant, 21 Kalani Thomas, 22 Harry McLaughlin-Phillips, 23 Tim Ryan</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Josh Ioane, 14 Shaun Stevenson, 13 Daniel Rona, 12 Rameka Poihipi, 11 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Cortez Ratima, 8 Luke Jacobson (c), 7 Simon Parker, 6 Samipeni Finau, 5 Naitoa Ah Kuoi, 4 Tupou Vaa'i, 3 George Dyer, 2 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 1 Aidan Ross</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Tyrone Thompson, 17 Ollie Norris, 18 Reuben O'Neill, 19 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 20 Wallace Sititi, 21 Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, 22 Josh Jacomb, 23 Anton Lienert-Brown</p>
