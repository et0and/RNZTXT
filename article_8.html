            <p>Fabiana Palladino is one to watch. Her father is legendary bass player Pino Palladino and while taking her time to release her debut release (13 years apparently) she has been playing as a session musician for the Maccabees, Jessie Ware, Sampha and Lorde. Her moody and passionate self-titled solo album is worth the wait. Think 80s pop, with a hint of 90s R&B - Janet Jackson springs to mind at parts. It's bright, strong and has such a groove.</p>
        
            <p>One of the most iconic performers of all time, Beyonce is famous for pop, R&B and hip hop music. But this year, Beyonce flexed her diversity, dropping us a country album. (Or, as Beyonce's website puts it: "This ain't a country album. This is a 'Beyonce album".) The release broke glass ceilings (Beyonce became the first Black woman to top the country Billboard charts), has the best guest appearances including Dolly Parton and Miley Cyrus and pays homage to a host of other legends including Queen, The Beatles, Willy Nelson, Beach Boys and Nancy Sinatra.</p>
        
            <p>It serves 1970s disco vibes and like many of the great albums this year it's long: 27 songs, running for an hour and 18 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Multi-disciplinary Māori artist Byllie Jean has been making music for many years, but her recent EP Filter is an absolute stand out. The powerful, emotional waiata on this release is written for her tīpuna and mokopuna. The sound is stunning as she weaves modern synths and 808s with taonga puoro. Listen out for the last track which features Marlon Williams.</p>
        
            <p>If you like Radiohead, you must listen to The Smile. The three-piece side project, featuring Radiohead members Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, along with British jazz drummer Tom Skinner, just released their second album Wall of Eyes.</p>
        
            <p>The way the band use electronic sounds alongside traditional guitars and live drums creates a strange, dissonant sound. Their music is clever and political.</p>
        
            <p>Cindy Lee is the stage persona of Canadian musician Patrick Flegel. This is Lee's seventh studio album, and for this particular release, you can only listen to it on YouTube - the intention is to hear the album as a whole, not as separate tracks.This dreamy two-hour session takes listeners on a garage rock trip. It's nostalgic and romantic at times. It harks back to 60s girl groups, motown bands or Velvet Underground. The production on this album is unusual - it could easily fit a David Lynch film.</p>
