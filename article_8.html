        <h2>A man and his sombrero wearing pug make a cheesecake - the internet explodes</h2>
        <p>
In his neat Auckland kitchen, wearing a singlet and apron, Daniel Rankin boogies to ‘Bamboleo’ by the Gipsy Kings as he makes a cheesecake.

            <p>An Auckland-based Samoan social media influencer is on a mission with his four-legged best mate, named Fraser, to help men learn "how to cook".</p>
        
            <p>Daniel Rankin, 29, is a baker and has taken TikTok by storm, building a massive following in his efforts to make men feel comfortable in the kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>Rankin has accumulated over 3.7 million likes on his @mancancooknz TikTok account, and has had similar success on his Instagram profile.</p>
        
            <p>He says the stigma around the world is that men, or Samoan men, don't cook.</p>
        
            <p>But in Samoa, many of the men do cook, he says.</p>

            <p>Rankin was born and raised Vaoala in Samoa, where he was known as the chef among his friends and aiga (family).</p>
        
            <p>He says he was overweight in his early years, but things began to change for him as he grew older and made healthier lifestyle changes.</p>
        
            <p>"I started cooking when I was about 10. I started just because I was a big kid. I ate a lot, and my parents weren't around as often, so I kind of just needed to learn to cook."</p>
        
            <p>Rankin's videos show him baking with his pug, Fraser, while dancing to music and singing in costume.</p>
        
            <p>His favourite foods to cook are mostly South American and Mexican.</p>
        
            <p>"I like it because it has heaps of flavour that you can share in a group."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Rankin named his online social content 'man can cook' to alleviate any doubt men had about being able to cook.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought there was a stigma that men couldn't cook, not just in Samoan culture, but in general. I named it 'man can cook'.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the chefs I followed [as role models] were men, that's how it came about, just to challenge that stigma.</p>
        
            <p>"In Samoa, a lot of the men do cook. They're out there Sunday morning, doing the umu and helping do the cooking in the evenings.</p>
        
            <p>"I think culturally it is quite normal for Samoan men to grow up cooking."</p>

            <p>Rankin filmed his first YouTube video in 2014, at the time not knowing how to film it and "just relied on a mate to shoot it".</p>
        
            <p>The cooking videos, he says, came "every couple of months".</p>
        
            <p>But then he bought a camera to create content for a gym he owns.</p>
        
            <p>"So I learned how to use [the camera]. Then lockdown came around, and I'm like, 'oh, I know how to use a camera, I know how to cook'.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's create some content for my members so they can stay engaged during lockdowns and learn how to cook nice and healthy meals.</p>
        
            <p>"And I was up, everyone loves Fraser, let's chuck him in there, and that's how it started."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>He started off with a lot more dialogue and talking to camera with his helper, Fraser, beside him in his outfit.</p>
        
            <p>But even that was a lot of work, while running the gym and then coming up with dialogue and content and recipes to cook.</p>
        
            <p>"So I decided to cut down my content into more short form, 45 seconds to 60 seconds, no dialogue, just, feel good music, feel good recipes, and that's where Fraser and I really kicked off," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But it has not been all smooth sailing for the influencer-baker.</p>
        
            <p>As is the nature of social media, he has been on the receiving end of some negative comments and messages.</p>
        
            <p>"It took me a while to get thick skin," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe in this industry, you have to have thick skin because you do get a lot of exposure out there, and not everything is going to be positive.</p>
        
            <p>"I kind of just dealt with it, focused on what I could control. And I have always found that just being kind to the negativity helps me take it."</p>

            <p>Rankin says the harshest comments he has received are regarding Fraser.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess the worst message I've got was, what are you going to do when your dog dies?</p>
        
            <p>"I found that pretty harsh; attack me if you want, but just leave Fraser out of it."</p>
        
            <p>He says his response to the negativity is to "respond with a love heart" emoji and "just respond with kindness and I feel good about it and move on with my life".</p>
        
            <p>Rankin says he will continue to create content and bake, and he hopes to create classes for men who wish to do something similar.</p>
        
            <p>"We are just going to keep cooking and baking and singing and dancing and see where it goes."</p>
