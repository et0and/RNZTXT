"The more you plan and the more organised you are, the more stress you take out of the whole Christmas period" - finance writer Lisa Dudson. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>People frantically rushing to the mall on 24 December will be those most likely to overspend this Christmas, says finance writer Lisa Dudson.</p>
        
            <p>The best way to take control of holiday spending and save your own sanity, she tells Susie Ferguson, is with some planning.</p>

            <p>Lisa Dudson is the owner of Acumen.co.nz. Her advice is of a general nature.</p>
        
            <p>After a couple of years of high interest rates, everyone's feeling the pinch a lot more this Christmas, Dudson says.</p>
        
            <p>As long as possible before the big day, she recommends sitting down with your partner or family and setting a budget of X dollars to spend on gifts, meals and experiences.</p>
        
            <p>Gift spending can sometimes get a bit out of control, Dudson says, on items that often get thrown in the back of a cupboard played with for five minutes then discarded.</p>
        
            <p>Writing up a gift list - of who you're going to buy gifts for how much you might want to spend on each of those people - can be really helpful.</p>
        
            <p>To save money, homemade gifts such as brownies, pickles, jam or even veggies or flowers from your garden can be nice.</p>
        
            <p>Charitable gifts, in which families decide that instead of spending money on Christmas presents they'll lend a hand to others "doing it seriously tough" via charity donations, can be an interesting lesson for your kids, Dudson says.</p>
        
            <p>Remember that your time - in the form of a night's babysitting, mowing lawns or cleaning a house - can also be a "fantastic gift".</p>
        
            <p>"When you get older, you realize how special that is when someone's actually put the time into making something for you rather than just zipping through the shop."</p>
        
            <p>Don't be afraid to take advantage of post-Christmas sales for Christmas gifts, Dudson says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's okay to say 'Look, I'm going to buy you something but I'm going to buy it in the sales after Christmas' or 'Here's a $100 voucher to buy something at the post-Christmas sales'."</p>
        
            <p>If you happen to be "super organised", Boxing Day sales are a great place to buy supplies for next year.</p>
        
            <p>"Not many people are that organised but that can be a really good idea, particularly if you need to top up your Christmas tree decorations and your Christmas wrapping paper."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to a Christmas meal, Dudson recommends potlucks as a way to spend less and create a more communal atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>For the Christmas Day potluck she's hosting for a group of friends this year, each person will bring a favourite Christmas dish they've chosen to make. Dudson will "fill in the blanks" and let people know if there are any double-ups.</p>
        
            <p>"You get that community spirit with everyone sharing and then also enjoying it more because they've got [a Christmas dish] that they've created themselves and one of their favourites."</p>
