        <h2>Herbivore - 'It's time for a good plant-based butter out there'</h2>
        <p>
Bay of Plenty entrepreneur Craig Brown says he created a high-quality coconut butter to benefit the environment first and vegan foodies second. Audio

            <p>After struggling to find a dairy-free butter he liked, Craig Brown decided to create his own.</p>
        
            <p>Brown, who previously ran a tech company, started eating vegan food while he and his wife were living in London several years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I found it a lot lighter. Certainly allowed me to have a couple of extra pints of beer so I was quite happy with that."</p>

            <p>Coming back to New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic, they decided to start a business that would be beneficial for the planet.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, the driver was to create a spread that's inherently better for the environment without compromising on taste, texture or performance. The fact it's vegan was really a secondary."</p>
        
            <p>Although New Zealand supermarkets offer plenty of plant based milk options, Brown says, it's taken a while for Kiwis to make the "switch" to a plant-based butter.</p>
        
            <p>Most other plant-based spreads are made with less than 10% coconut oil, he says. Creating a higher-quality alternative meant using more coconut oil.</p>
        
            <p>Herbivore coconut butter is now available in Kiwi supermarkets and expanding into Asia.</p>
        
            <p>"We're 67% coconut so we have a lot better mouthfeel."</p>
        
            <p>Coconut oil has some good health benefits, Brown says, and coconut trees don't require herbicides, insecticides or additional water.</p>
        
            <p>Herbivore is designed to be a one-for-one replacement for dairy butter, Brown says, that can be used "across the board".</p>
        
            <p>"The performance [of Herbivore] in making croissants, etc. comes from having that fantastic base [so] the food service space is the first place we can make a massive impact.</p>
        
            <p>"We have bakers that buy full pallet-loads of butter off of us on a monthly basis."</p>
        
            <p>Premium dairy butters usually cost $7:50 to $8.50, Brown says, while Herbivore retails for around $6 in over 180 New Zealand stores.</p>
        
            <p>He is "really delighted" at their strong supermarket sales.</p>
        
            <p>"It looks like the public agreed with us that it's time for a good plant-based butter out there."</p>
        
            <p>Herbivore, which is made with coconut oil from a production partner in the Philippines, doesn't make sense to everyone in the Bay of Plenty where Brown  lives.</p>
        
            <p>"Living in this area and saying you're gonna make a coconut butter, you get some some resistance from neighbours."</p>
        
            <p>From his office, which overlooks "beautiful grassland", Brown says he's flying the flag for "fresh thinking".</p>
        
            <p>"We've got big ambition for this product to to really fulfill our our goals of doing the right thing for the planet. We need a lot of people using it, which will reduce the overall emissions from butter and total butter consumption."</p>
