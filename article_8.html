            <p>Colman Domingo summons deep wells of pain and pride as a maximum security inmate in this deeply authentic prison drama.</p>
        
            <p>Sing Sing is the name of a nearly 200-year-old prison in upstate New York. There, 1500 maximum security prisoners see out their sentences.</p>
        
            <p>They don't execute people there anymore, although over 600 prisoners perished in "Old Sparky" before the practice was abolished in 1972.</p>
        
            <p>Still, it's a bleak environment. Like many prisons, the term 'correctional facility' seems to be inapt to say the least. There doesn't appear to be much correcting going on.</p>
        
            <p>The film Sing Sing shows us one of the exceptions - a programme called Rehabilitation Through the Arts that offers some lucky incarcerated men the opportunity to reestablish something of themselves through creativity, teamwork and fellowship.</p>
        
            <p>Sing Sing isn't a documentary but it has deep authentic roots.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the cast are themselves alumni of the RTA and co-lead actor Clarence Maclin plays a version of himself - an inmate who found a way out through the programme.</p>
        
            <p>The central character, though, is Divine G - played with deep wells of pain and pride by Colman Domingo in an awards-contender performance.</p>
        
            <p>Divine G is the victim of a miscarriage of justice and has been spending his years fighting for freedom. And writing and acting for the RTA in his spare time.</p>
        
            <p>Maclin - known as Divine Eye, which was a little confusing for a while - joins the troupe but at first, is brittle and resistant to what's required to put on a show.</p>
        
            <p>Guilt, shame and fear are emotions that don't tend to serve you very well in a prison environment, but you have to be able to access that vulnerability in order to make art.</p>
        
            <p>Like the recent Netflix documentary Daughters, which showed us what happens when the children of inmates are allowed to actually visit them and celebrate a Daddy-Daughter Dance, in Sing Sing we see what happens when we - as a society - decide to treat people with grace.</p>
        
            <p>But when we choose the path of dehumanisation - as we so often do - we shouldn't be surprised at the results we get.</p>
        
            <p>Both films have some astonishing statistics at the end that should convince anyone watching of the value of investing in these programmes.</p>
        
            <p>Sing Sing is rated M for offensive language and is playing in discerning cinemas all over the motu now.</p>
