            <p>Simon Morris presents a new show about food – what we eat, why we eat it, where it came from and when we started trying it.</p>
        
            <p>In this episode about New Zealand cuisine, chef and food writer Ray McVinnie declares that dry-roasted kūmara – sweetened up for an hour in a 200-degree oven – is his favourite.</p>

            <p>"Jus clean the kūmara, give it a wash, put it on a tray, stick it in a 200-degree oven for about an hour until you can push a small knife in there and it's completely cooked all the way through, split it down the middle and eat it with your other favourite foods. It's just delicious."</p>

            <p>McVinnie, who contributed a chapter about the kūmara to 2009's Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, says the sweet potato is a taonga that, thanks to the brilliant navigation skills of early Māori sailors, we are lucky to have here.</p>
        
            <p>It's believed that kūmara was first cultivated in Peru and Bolivia, and scientists have found evidence of it growing in New Zealand soil back in the 15th century.</p>
        
            <p>For early Māori, who stored kūmara in deep pits, the sweet potato was a very high-status vegetable because it was extremely labour-intensive to grow, McVinnie says.</p>
        
            <p>"It was always, always a highly prestigious ceremonial food."</p>
