            <p>Dome glamping, farm tours and jetting up the Hurunui River supplements income and highlights cultural heritage at a traditional sheep farm in North Canterbury's Blythe Valley.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm NgƒÅi Tahu on my mum's side. So we try and incorporate a little bit of that into the farm tours and jet boating, mainly through storytelling," Tim Loughnan said.</p>
        
            <p>Tim and his young family live on the 320-hectare dryland farm, Tawanui, with his parents Mike and Elspeth. Tawanui means "a big tree". he told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure who came up with it, it was before my time, but we've based our branding on it!"</p>
        
            <p>The farming and tourism operations sit under the umbrella of one company managed by the father and son team.</p>

            <p>"This is my wife's family farm and we've been farming it for the last 30 years," Mike said.</p>
        
            <p>He was born and bred on a sheep and beef farm at nearby Scargill.</p>
        
            <p>Elspeth's great great grandfather was one of the early settlers in the district.</p>
        
            <p>When the Cheviot Hills Estate was broken up in the 1890s he got a ballot farm on the south side of the Hurunui River.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only a one-person farm really, so we need to generate some income from somewhere else and, as we know, farm income is a bit up and down."</p>

            <p>Lambs and cattle are fattened on the farm but Mike said they've destocked because there's not enough feed.</p>
        
            <p>"2500 stock units are here normally but we're 900 stock units down now."</p>
        
            <p>The dry season and depressingly low lamb prices have dented Mike's passion for farming, but diversifying into tourism has put a hop back in his stride.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been challenging, but I must say that the tourism has given me another interest, and having Tim home has helped, so we're in it together."</p>
        
            <p>Mike enjoys doing the farm tours. It's a good way to share his knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>"Farmers can tend to get a wee bit insular in what they do and it's good to meet new people".</p>

When Tim was a child Mike would take him way up the Hurunui River in the jet boat

</p>
        
            <p>"We started commercial jet boating because we used to spend lots of time in the summer on the river, boating and barbecuing," Mike said.</p>
        
            <p>"And Tim came home and got the bit between his teeth and decided that we needed to do something about it!"</p>
        
            <p>Tim launched Energy Jet. He took the first load of thrill-seekers up the river in 2017 and it's still the only jet boating operator on the Hurunui River.</p>

            <p>Two years ago he upgraded to a bigger and more powerful 12-seater jet boat.</p>
        
            <p>"So above State Highway 1 is the gorge where there's some amazing scenery. And then the lower section is a bit more spread out and the boating's quite exciting over the braids."</p>
        
            <p>He also does contract work for the Department of Conservation, ferrying staff along the Hurunui and the Waiau Rivers to do bird counting and nassella grubbing.</p>

            <p>At one of the highest and most isolated points on the farm are two four-person geodesic glamping domes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all off-grid and there's a hot tub and composting toilets," Tim said.</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes flocks of sheep graze around the fenced-off site that has a birds-eye view of the Hurunui River as it meets the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably the best view on the farm. We were lucky we already had good track access up here and water."</p>

            <p>Tim said the rustic accommodation attracts people from all walks of life.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people don't really want to talk to you so you just show them around and bugger off. But some will talk to you for ages and offer you a beer and what-not."</p>
        
            <p>A few paddocks away from the domes is a new seven metre tall A-frame building. The luxurious getaway for two is the Loughnan's latest project.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted something a bit more high-end, so we've got two ends of the spectrum covered now with the two sites, but it's been an undertaking!"</p>
