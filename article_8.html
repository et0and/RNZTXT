            <p>When science writer Lucy Jones had a baby, she found herself in an unexpectedly frightening and lonely new world.</p>
        
            <p>In her new book Matrescence, she takes a deep dive into the profound psychological and physiological effects of motherhood.</p>
        
            <p>"Early parenthood is depicted as this banal, ordinary, pastel-hued, calm, passive experience... but actually it's gnarly and hardcore and I found it terrifying.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't find myself in any of these parenting manuals. The one book that I kept going back to was Franz Kafka's 1915 fantasy novel The Metamorphosis. Gregor Samsa turns into an insect - possibly a cockroach - overnight and then he's isolated in a room, away from his family.</p>
        
            <p>"[Early motherhood] was like that for me. I just felt so bizarre. And one of the aspects of that was feeling like my brain was different.</p>
        
            <p>"In pregnancy, I thought my body was like a box or a pot and the baby would grow inside it and then be born, and I would be myself again, I'd go back to who I was… But actually I felt completely different and that was quite discombobulating and bewildering."</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to "an amazing raft of research" over the last decade, we now understand a lot more about how pregnancy renders significant and pronounced changes to the mother's brain, Jones says.</p>
        
            <p>"We all know that people going through adolescence feel weird and ... need support, but the science is telling us that matrescence - the transition into motherhood - can be similarly vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>"This new brain research is ... showing how vulnerable this time can be and that it is a transitional stage which we've neglected and it's a massive deal for the mother."</p>
        
            <p>Up to 60 percent of mothers find childbirth traumatic, she says, and her own "quite frightening" three-day labour came as an unpleasant surprise.</p>
        
            <p>"I was told that if I did all my breathing properly and all my exercises, that it wouldn't hurt very much and it would be all be fine as long as I was in the right state of mind. That was the messaging that I had absorbed, and that was just so not the case … I felt in my moment of the worst pain of birth quite betrayed by the messages that I had received."</p>
        
            <p>In Western society, new parenthood is a very isolating and lonely experience, Jones says.</p>
        
            <p>Public places are often designed in a way that is "hostile" for people with babies, and there's a lack of infrastructure, family-friendly spaces and transport accessibility.</p>
        
            <p>"The way we neglect and we don't support new mothers, new parents, infants and any caregivers in our individualistic neoliberal societies is really wrong."</p>
        
            <p>Like many new mothers, Jones was diagnosed with postnatal depression and for a long time thought there was something really wrong with her.</p>
        
            <p>Since publishing Matrescence she's heard from many other new parents who've also felt "strange or immoral" in being overwhelmed by the experience.</p>
        
            <p>While there is a biological aspect to parenthood that can precipitate mental illness, Jones says, there's also a "massive social problem" to address.</p>
        
            <p>Isolation seems to be the norm in the maternal experience, with some studies suggesting up to 100 percent of new mothers feel lonely.</p>
        
            <p>"[As a parent] feeling lonely, feeling isolated, feeling anxious, feeling depressed in a society which doesn't value care is probably quite an understandable and normal response."</p>
        
            <p>For Jones, one of the most helpful ways to view motherhood is with an existential perspective, which acknowledges how inherently and deeply frightening it is.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge risk. It involves a lot of choice every day. It involves a loss of freedom. It involves more confrontation with mortality, with time...</p>
        
            <p>"Any relationship, even a relationship with a beloved animal where you love them so much, makes you very vulnerable. I think that is just a difficult, profoundly human experience that we don't give space to breathe."</p>
