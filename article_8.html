            <p>Many of us avoid thinking about death, but not Keanu Reeves.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm 59, so I'm thinking about death all the time," the Hollywood megastar has revealed to BBC News.</p>
        
            <p>That's a good thing, he adds.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully it's not crippling, but hopefully it's sensitised [us] to an appreciation of the breath we have, and the relationships that we have the potential to have."</p>
        
            <p>The reason we're sitting with The Matrix star, ruminating on life and mortality, is not because he has another blockbuster to promote.</p>
        
            <p>This time, it's a new book - Reeves' first novel.</p>
        
            <p>The Book of Elsewhere, written in collaboration with British science fiction author China Miéville, follows an immortal warrior, who wants to be able to die.</p>
        
            <p>We meet Reeves and Miéville in a lowly lit hotel bar in central London.</p>
        
            <p>The Canadian actor, who is based in Hollywood, makes time to see us in between gigs with his Dogstar band.</p>
        
            <p>The night before, the band played in Manchester. Reeves looks a bit tired as we begin the 30 minute interview.</p>
        
            <p>But his passion for his novel also comes through strongly.</p>
        
            <p>The Book of Elsewhere is based on the hugely successful BRZRKR comic book series created by Reeves.</p>
        
            <p>Released in 2021, BRZRKR - pronounced "berserker" for the uninitiated - is also due to be adapted into a live-action Netflix film starring Reeves, as well as an anime series.</p>
        
            <p>For Reeves, comic books have a special appeal.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the images," he said. "I love words and storytelling and I love the way that you can have this engagement that overlays. And so you can look at the art and then you can follow the story."</p>
        
            <p>The actor plays down his role in the collaborative process though, insisting: "I didn't write a novel. China wrote a novel."</p>
        
            <p>Miéville argues "that's putting it too far," adding: "It wouldn't exist in the form without a lot of very thoughtful and careful work with Keanu."</p>
        
            <p>The central character in the plot is known only as "B".</p>
        
            <p>With his long dark hair, B shares physical similarities with Reeves.</p>
        
            <p>And when the comic book first came out, some fans also pointed out certain thematic similarities between the two, including a difficult personal life.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves has lost several people he has loved in his life, including his girlfriend, their stillborn daughter and his best friend.</p>
        
            <p>But that might be where the similarities end.</p>
        
            <p>B is 80,000 years old, half-mortal and half-god. He also has a "curse of violence", which seems completely unlike Reeves.</p>
        
            <p>The actor, who is known for his gentle, mild-mannered persona, has often been described as the nicest man in Hollywood.</p>
        
            <p>B, on the other hand, is someone who can "punch through people's chests and rip their arms off, rip their heads off", according to Reeves.</p>
        
            <p>So where does such violence come from?</p>
        
            <p>"I think it was influenced by some of the action films that I had done," said Reeves, who has also starred in the Speed and John Wick franchises.</p>
        
            <p>Reviews of the comic book were broadly positive when it came out, so Reeves and Miéville will be hoping to replicate that success.</p>
        
            <p>In Flickering Myth, Calum Petrie awarded it seven out of 10 stars, writing that it was "enjoyable" but also "a bit more on the gory side than I am used to in a lot of comics".</p>
        
            <p>It was given 9.5 stars by Justin Harrison in AIPT Comics, who praised it as "excellent" and "intriguing" while also cautioning readers about the violence it depicts.</p>
        
            <p>There's no doubt that this book is violent. In its opening pages, it describes a shooting, followed by "the tough bloody business of the clean-up".</p>
        
            <p>We asked Reeves about the much debated link between violence on-screen and in books, and in the real world.</p>
        
            <p>Momentarily, he appears defensive.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope if they read BRZRKR, that they don't go out and start ripping people's arms off and chopping their heads off," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because there's also a love story in it. But if you do read it, I hope maybe you can find love if you don't have it."</p>
        
            <p>Miéville also pushed back against there being a connection between depicted violence and real violence.</p>
        
            <p>"I get quite irritated about how this question is posed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so clearly a kind of cultural scapegoating," he added. "I think the idea of looking at video games and movies and so on, it's just a way of exonerating the people who are really profiting from the violence."</p>
        
            <p>Having created a whole fantasy world, you wonder whether Reeves is trying to escape from reality.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe ultimately the fantasy of building another world brings some kind of comfort in some way," he admits.</p>
        
            <p>"There's something ultimately about the creative gesture that comes from pain," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Creating stuff is great. Just creating, sharing, and hopefully people like the stories that we tell."</p>
        
            <p>And if they do - if the book is a success - what will Reeves do with the proceeds of the book?</p>
        
            <p>The actor is famed for his generosity, and a lot has been written about how he reportedly doesn't like owning things.</p>
        
            <p>But this, too, is something Reeves appears to push back on, as our interview comes to a close.</p>
        
            <p>"I love owning things, I love having stuff," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm certainly not going to present myself as someone who gives everything away."</p>
        
            <p>The Book of Elsewhere is published on 23 July by Penguin.</p>
