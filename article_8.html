            <p>The Black Caps have developed a knack for upsets at cricket's global tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The odds are certainly stacked against New Zealand for Wednesday night's World Cup semi final against hosts India in Mumbai.</p>
        
            <p>A home side in rampant form, coming into the clash with a perfect nine wins from nine, and a billion adoring fans behind them.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Black Caps have forged a storied history of giant killing at the 50-over showpiece.</p>
        
            <p>Jonty Dine looks back at the greatest upsets the Black Caps have caused at World Cups.</p>
        
            <p>1983- beat England by two wickets, Group Stage, Birmingham. </p>
        
            <p>A captain's knock by Howarth. </p>

            <p>Taking on the hosts first up, New Zealand was handily defeated by 106 runs however in the rematch just six days later, fortunes were reversed in the first upset of the '83 World Cup. Sir Richard Hadlee and Lance Cairns combined to take three wickets apiece as England was dismissed for a respectable 234. Captain Geoff Hoarth anchored the innings for New Zealand with 60 from 104 balls, but struggled to build a partnership until Jeremy Coney, scoring his highest career total of 66 not out, arrived at the crease. A crucial cameo of 31 by Hadlee ensured the Kiwis got home with one ball of the 60th over remaining.</p>
        
            <p>1992- beat Australia by 37 runs, Group Stage, Auckland. </p>

            <p>The late Martin Crowe's legend was solidified with this career-defining innings at Eden Park. Facing the defending champion Australians in the World Cup opener, Crowe's crafty knock of 100 not out from 134 balls, supported by Ken Rutherford's half century guided the hosts to a solid total of 248/6. The bold skipper then made the audacious call of calling on spinner Dipak Patel to open the bowling. David Boon led the chase for the Aussies with 100 but while looking comfortable at 92-2, Australia collapsed. When Chris Harris ran out Boon and with Steve Waugh making the only other score of substance, the heavily-favoured Australians fell 37 runs shy to kick start the Kiwi's memorable '92 run</p>
        
            <p>1999- beat Australia by five wickets, Group Stage, Cardiff. </p>
        
            <p>Twose heroics humble Aussies. </p>

            <p>Set a reasonably modest target as 76 from Darren Lehmann saw the Aussies claw to 213, Geoff Allott doing the damage taking 4/37. Reduced to 4-49, New Zealand were in deep strife before Roger Twose 80 not out, Chris Cairns 60, and Adam Parore brought it home for New Zealand with 28 balls to spare. Two bowling greats had been nullified, with Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne claiming just two wickets between them as the Black Caps reached 214/5. The loss lit a fire inside Australia who went on to win the tournament and the next two after that.</p>
        
            <p>2003- beat South Africa by nine wickets (D/L), Group Stage, Johannesburg. </p>

            <p>Recent meetings between the two sides prior to this fixture did not make pretty reading for New Zealand fans. The Black Caps were a staggering 1-18 in their previous 19 games against the Proteas, so needless to say the home side was tipped to win. At the halfway mark those predictions appeared astute after Herschelle Gibbs' 143 helped South Africa rack up 306/6. However, the cricket gods were not smiling on the home side and the clouds eventually rolled in. Intermittent rainfall saw the target reduced, though the form Stephen Fleming was in, it may not have mattered. Arguably the best ODI innings of his illustrious career, Fleming's 134 not out and an unbeaten half century from Nathan Astle got the Black Caps to their reduced target of 229 with nine wickets and 13 balls in hand.</p>
        
            <p>2007- beat South Africa by five wickets, Super Eights, Grenada. </p>

            <p>The Proteas were hungry for revenge four years later, but made little impact with the bat at St George's. South Africa saw out their 50 overs but managed to scrape together just 193 runs for the loss of seven. Early strikes for Shane Bond and James Franklin had South Africa 3-2 which became 52-3 before a fighting 60 from Herschelle Gibbs gave his side something to defend. Franklin and Bond proved impossible to get away, conceding just two an over and strangling the Proteas with 92 dot balls in their first 20 overs while an unlikely contribution of 3/23 by Craig McMillian kept the pressure on. Half centuries for Stephen Fleming and Scott Styris, with an unbeaten 28 from McMillian got the Black Caps home with 10 balls to spare.</p>
        
            <p>2011- beat South Africa by 49 runs, Quarter Final, Mirpur. </p>

            <p>Yet another South African heartbreak, the 2011 quarter final started positively for the Proteas as the Black Caps lost openers Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill cheaply. However, an uncharacteristically patient 83 from Jesse Ryder, got the side back on track. Ross Taylor chipped in with 43 but other than 38 from a young Kane Williamson batting at six, the tail failed to fire, Morne Morkel claiming 3/46 as the Black Caps posted 221/8. The total looked well below par when factoring the power batting lineup of South Africa. Jacques Kallis fought hard for 47 and the South Africans appeared to be cruising at 108-3. The world cup curse would strike again though as would the Black Caps scrambling tactics in the field. A superb 4/39 from Jacob Oram and 3/24 by Nathan McCullum saw South Africa capitulate, losing their last seven for just 66 runs.</p>

            <p>A low scoring thriller for the ages. A modest 151 was thought to be an easy target after Trent Boult ripped through the Aussie lineup to take 5/27.</p>
        
            <p>At 78-2, through a typical McCullum blitz of 50 from 24, the Black Caps were in complete control when wickets suddenly began to tumble as they had no answers for a rampaging Mitchell Starc. His fiery spell had the home side reeling at 149/9. The hero of the first innings, Boult had to see out two deliveries from Starc with Williamson poised at the other end. Boult somehow negotiated both and Williamson then nonchalantly launched Pat Cummins over his head for six to end the pulsating encounter.</p>

            <p>Born in Johannesburg, Grant Elliot etched himself into Kiwi cricket folklore after this historic night in Auckland. The old foe was again in the way and this time determined not to wear the chokers tag. A captain's knock of 65 by AB de Villiers and a clinical 82 from Faf du Plessis helped South Africa post 281/5. Another blistering Brendon McCullum half century whittled down the run rate but South Africa stayed in the hunt through regular wickets and rain breaks. With the target extended and overs reduced, it was a tall task for new Zealand but supported by Corey Anderson's 58, Grant Elliot's masterful 84 brought his side within striking distance before he plundered six off the penultimate Dale Steyn delivery.</p>

            <p>In a bizarre scenario, this Manchester semi final was played across two days, leaving Ross Taylor and Tom Latham in the unique position of going to bed not out in an ODI. The 28-hour match began with Martin Guptil dismissed cheaply before Kane Willliamson 67, and Taylor 74, combined for one of their many but maybe most crucial partnerships. The platform had been set but the lower order could not build on it, Bhuvneshwar Kumar snaring 3/43 as the Black Caps mustered 239/8. India's top order was then reduced to 6-92, Matt Henry the chief destroyer with 3/37, while Trent Boult and Mitch Santner took two apiece. However, MS Dhoni 50 and Ravi Jadeja 77, steadied the ship and India were storming home before Guptill's stunning direct hit sent Dhoni packing. The tail was then quickly mopped up to set up that infamous final against England.</p>
        
            <p>2023- beat England by nine wickets, Group Stage, Ahmedabad.</p>

            <p>Complete domination and the unearthing of a new superstar. The 2023 World Cup opener could not have been scripted any better for the Black Caps. Winning the toss and sending England in to bat, the defending champions stuttered to 282/9, Matt Henry the pick of the bowlers with 3/48. After losing Will Young to a golden duck, the English would see no more success as Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra decimated their attack to all parts of Ahmedabad. Conway hammered 152 with Ravindra not far behind on 123 as the Black Caps romped to an emphatic nine-wicket win, sending a massive statement to kick off of the tournament.</p>
