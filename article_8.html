        <h2>Lee Fields: ‘I try to touch people's souls’</h2>
        <p>
American soul singer Lee Fields' classic voice has taken him all over the world, now he brings his soulful southern grooves to Aotearoa for a special one-night-only performance at the Hollywood Avondale in Auckland. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Growing up in North Carolina in the 1950s, musician Lee Fields didn't believe he would be a singer. “When I was 13 years old I wanted to be a businessman. In those days people of colour had very little”. </p>
        
            <p>As fate would have it, after being dared by a friend, Fields entered a local talent show and the backing band playing offered the teenager a job. </p>
        
            <p>Fields released his first single in the late 60s, a cover of James Brown's Bewildered and soon he found himself playing with pioneers Bobby Womack, B.B King, Kool & The Gang and Sharon Jones.</p>

            <p>Today, Fields is a funk, soul and blues stalwart with a 50-year career in the music industry and twenty albums under his belt. Fields admits he treats it like a business and keeps disciplined. Eager to deliver a show that will astound his audience. </p>
        
            <p>“Charles (Bradley) was like a natural, I don’t consider myself a natural and I think Sharon Jones was a natural. Once I walk on stage I connect with the audience and I don’t do anything that will break that connection”.  </p>
        
            <p>At 73 he shows no sign of slowing down, his song Forever featured on a major Super Bowl commercial. The musician has spent the better part of this year touring his latest album Sentimental Fool. A beautiful listen, released by Daptone Records, full of rich soul classics. </p>
        
            <p>“I try to sing songs where you get something out of it. I try to touch people's souls”. </p>
        
            <p>Today his signature brand of soul music continues to echo in the mainstream with J.Cole, Rick Ross, A$ap Rocky and Travis Scott each sampling Fields music.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017 Lee Fields and the Expressions returned the favour sampling Outkast's iconic track SpottieOttieDopaliscious in their song Never Be Another You. </p>
        
            <p>Does he feel the pressure to hold the legacy of soul? No because, “This desire to make soul records has always been there and always will be there. I feel the obligation is to God. My main purpose is to reach people and bring them joy and to say something in my music. Let’s not forget about God!”</p>
        
            <p>Fields was last in Aotearoa six years ago and now the soul star is ready to play at Tāmaki Makaurau's Hollywood Avondale with his band on 10 December.</p>
