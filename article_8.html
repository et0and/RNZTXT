            <p>Roots artist Hori Shaw was laying concrete fulltime until a hunting accident nearly paralysed him and sent him into music.</p>
        
            <p>“Life sort of changed a couple of years ago when I was doing something I really love to do, which is hunting. Everything just happened so fast,” the Ōpōtiki-based musician, known as Hoaris the Boaris, told RNZ.  </p>

            <p>“I went for a hunt on my horse, my horse ended up getting a fright and he just sort of played up and bucked me off.</p>
        
            <p>“I just came straight over the front of his head and crushed three of those vertebrae in your neck which was enough to damage my spine, my spinal cord.”</p>
        
            <p>Shaw lay paralysed for 13 hours, from midnight on Friday night. His father realised he hadn’t shown up for work on Saturday and came out on a motorbike and found him at 3.30pm.  </p>
        
            <p>“I was lying down, he came up on the motorbike and he was broken, he was in tears and everything to find me like that,” Shaw said.  </p>
        
            <p>“The first thing he said to me was ‘are you alright?’ and I was like ‘yeah, yeah… just don’t move me’.</p>
        
            <p>“Lucky he didn’t move me, cause if he tried to lift me up... the people in the helicopter said it would have made it worse.  </p>
        
            <p>“… I ended up getting shipped up to Auckland, to the Middlemore Hospital, and from there I went to the rehab centre. I was in that rehab centre for three, four months… just trying to get all my feeling back in my legs, my arms, my hands.”</p>
        
            <p>No longer able to work as a labourer, Shaw said the incident led him to pick up his music career fulltime.</p>
        
            <p>Then this year, Hoaris the Boaris was named the 'People's Choice' winner at the Aotearoa Music Awards.</p>
        
            <p>“That was my first time on the red carpet, I had to take the old Red Bands with me, those go wherever I go. Got to keep it natural.”</p>
        
            <p>Shaw describes his sound as roots reggae with an East Coast flavour, all crafted on very simple technology, created with a mate who’s a “beat maker” and producer.  </p>
        
            <p>“When I do music, I don’t really sit down and write to it. Just whatever comes in my head I just put it down… and keep going over it and fixing it up.”</p>
