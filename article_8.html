        <h2>Five local albums to listen to this week</h2>
        <p>
These five local albums are well worth your time, from joyous power pop to ambient instrumentals inspired by native flora.

            <p>This album's title is an oxymoron that nicely describes the Wellington band's sound: slightly scuzzy, and frequently gloomy, but no less lovely for it.</p>
        
            <p>Tessa Dillon's voice brings to mind Mazzy Star, and Lana Del Rey, and she has a knack for striking lyrics, like "I must be a sleeve for you to put your arm through" on 'In a Shell'.</p>
        
            <p>Mixing mellow vocals with churning guitars isn't new, but the wooziness here feels unique, with emphasis on atmosphere and smoky soundscapes.</p>
        
            <p>It's an album committed to a particular vision: knotty and intentionally unkempt, the sound of light and dark in perpetual scuffle.</p>

            <p>Originally formed in Dunedin, Marlin's Dreaming are a vehicle for the songs of Semisi Ma'ia'i, and since 2017 have released a handful of albums trafficking in crisp, polite indie rock.</p>
        
            <p>Their latest, HIRL, was three years in the making - a more prolonged gestation than prior - and as such is a finely sculpted piece of work. Its title is an onomatopoeia for a gust of wind, which is an apt metaphor for the music, quietly insistent but never gale-force.</p>
        
            <p>They're nimble songs, but not attention-grabbing. It's around the third listen that Ma'ia'i's melodic hooks really sink in, and the band's careful environments start to feel like comfy spots to linger.</p>

            <p>Katie Everingham and band are good at a certain type of self-deprecation (as per this album's title), which was expertly deployed on the single 'Be Good', a fantastic slice of power pop. It turns out the LP is stuffed with similar gems.</p>
        
            <p>Everingham writes gymnastic melodies, and can deliver lines like "please knock me out' with a wink (in a song that seems to be about wanting to go back to sleep).</p>
        
            <p>Captured at Vogelmorn Hall in Wellington, with The Beths' Jonathan Pearce on recording and mixing duty, there's some lyrical bite, and occasional sincerity, as well as plenty of joy.</p>

            <p>Office Dog are led by songwriter Kane Strang, who hit pause on a solo career to embrace the more spontaneous approach of a band. Their first album Spiel was favourably reviewed by international outlets like Mojo and Uncut, and in advance of an American tour, they've released a new EP.</p>
        
            <p>The volume is turned down slightly here, but the songs still master the trick of sounding in-the-moment while carefully thought out, balancing discord with pop smarts.</p>
        
            <p>A wider range is also evident, with 'Can't Wait' sounding like a wistful waltz, and 'Intact' like a friendlier Bailterspace. A forthcoming full-length is great news.</p>

            <p>This ambient album's five tracks traverse "the anatomy & physiology of the k≈çwhai including the roots, stem, leaves, flower and environment".</p>
        
            <p>There's a link here to prior instrumental albums with an ecological angle, most obviously Mort Garson's Plantasia, but Burbery has clearly put a huge amount of thought put into these compositions, and how they relate to a pointedly native plant.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the enjoyment, aside from relishing the soothing sounds, is thinking about how each maps to its subject: you may find images of birds, nectar, or pollen forming in your mind.</p>
