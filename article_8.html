        <h2>At The Movies: The Zone of Interest</h2>
        <p>
The Zone of Interest is a harrowing film about the commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp and his family - the pictures are almost home movies, the sound is pure horror, writes Simon Morris. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest managed a rare double at the recent Bafta Awards – both Outstanding British Film and Best Film Not in the English Language.</p>
        
            <p>Set in Poland and performed entirely in German, it was based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis.</p>
        
            <p>Writer/director Glazer has stripped it of most of its plot, so all that’s left is its nightmare wartime setting.  </p>

            <p>It entirely takes place at the home of the Höss family – husband Rudolf, wife Hedwig and their four or five well-behaved children.</p>
        
            <p>The family has done very well for themselves.  Army officer Rudolf has secured a plum job, and it shows.  </p>
        
            <p>Wife Hedwig has turned their house and garden into a showcase for any visitors - it’s even got a swimming pool.</p>
        
            <p>A wall separates the garden from Rudolf Höss’s work – the Auschwitz concentration camp where he’s the commandant.  </p>
        
            <p>There are two narratives in place. What we see is the happy, domestic life of the Höss family. And in the background – unseen, only heard - is the sound of terror.  </p>
        
            <p>There are sudden, distant gunshots, there are muted cries from the inmates. There’s the constant noise of machinery – the efficient infrastructure of the Nazi regime that enabled in the Holocaust.</p>
        
            <p>This is hardly a new story, of course, but it’s usually from the point of view of the victims. The perpetrators are shadowy monsters at the side of the picture.</p>
        
            <p>Not this time. There they are, basking in the sunlight, seemingly oblivious. But of course, they’re not.  Where did the fur coat come from? Who are the unpaid gardeners?</p>
        
            <p>What makes The Zone of Interest impossible to shake off is how it makes undeniable evil seem somehow normal.</p>
        
            <p>Just as inner-city dwellers no longer hear the constant noise of traffic, the Höss family have long since stopped looking or listening.</p>
        
            <p>The film was shot in a way that accentuates the impersonal. Cameras were hidden all over the house and grounds, no lights, no visible microphones, not even a film crew. It was shot remotely from behind the wall.  </p>
        
            <p>Visitors call - salesmen from an appliance firm showing the latest, more efficient incinerator. The kids have their friends over – presumably the offspring of other Auschwitz officers.</p>
        
            <p>One outsider - Hedwig’s mother – comes in to admire the family home and how far her daughter’s come up in the world.  </p>
        
            <p>She’s the only one to notice, and comment on, the wall to the camp, idly wondering whether the woman she used to clean for is in there now.</p>
        
            <p>We keep waiting for their comeuppance, when they’re finally forced to confront what they’ve done. And it never comes – at least not in the way we’re expecting.  </p>
        
            <p>That would imply that these people are different, they’re monsters, they’re not us.</p>
        
            <p>But Glazer has no intention of letting us off the hook.   The performances – particularly Anatomy of a Fall’s Sandra Hüller as Hedwig - are brilliantly normal.  </p>
        
            <p>Who wouldn’t do this? they seem to ask. It’s just a job.  Look at the benefits.</p>
        
            <p>The only overt criticism in The Zone of Interest comes from the music of Mica Levy which starts unsettling and ends terrifying and hellish. </p>
        
            <p>How could anybody live through this, it demands?   Which of course is the message of every movie ever made about the Holocaust.  </p>
