            <p>The disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant - the meltdown, deaths, and eventual abandoning of the city of Pripyat, Ukraine - is the stuff of legend.</p>
        
            <p>But Wellington-based artist Raúl Ortega Ayala isn't as interested in the catastrophe as he is in the damage done to ordinary people's lives.</p>
        
            <p>Ortega Ayala has repeatedly visited Pripyat - along with Plymouth on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, which was decimated by a volcano in 1995 - to gather visual and aural memories from what remains in the rubble and people's thoughts with these abandoned cities.</p>
        
            <p>He uses still and moving imagery and sound to examine the ways people remember, forget and repress the past. </p>
        
            <p>Ortega Ayala's film The Zone is currently showing in the exhibition Infrastructure: Power, Politics, Imagination at the Adam Art Gallery in Wellington. </p>
        
            <p>It focusses on the infrastructure provided for the people of Pripyat: what remains of their homes, their paths through the woods, a swimming pool, and a school. It looks at a cinema in which a married couple first met and a Ferris wheel that never opened. </p>
        
            <p>“I loved the city very much, it was a very beautiful city,” one of the interviewees says, and in the ruins Ortega Ayala finds much new beauty.</p>

            <p>But there is a pervasive sadness stemming from people having been severed from the place they loved.</p>
        
            <p>“They sincerely believed they would go back,” another interviewee says. “That things would be OK.”</p>
        
            <p>If the celebrated 2019 HBO series Chernobyl dealt with the human events around the explosion, The Zone considers what remains, both in the exclusion zone and in people’s minds.</p>
        
            <p>The camera takes us into dark derelict spaces today to find light and nature returning. </p>
        
            <p>Otega Ayala’s recent project Montserrat - a phono-archeology was recently exhibited in the Hague, in the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>Montserrat was a British colony and holiday destination until a previously dormant volcano erupted. It buried the capital city of Plymouth and created a large uninhabitable exclusion zone. </p>
        
            <p>Visiting the zone, Ortega Ayala kept finding objects that contained sounds or were connected to its production, including layers of vinyl records and tapes.</p>
        
            <p>Beatles producer George Martin ran a famous recording studio, Air in Montserrat over the 1980s, recording everyone from The Police and Rolling Stones to Elton John. </p>

            <p>Ortega Ayla focussed on buildings where music had played an important role, like the studios and churches.</p>
        
            <p>His film contains sounds derived from reels and vinyl records unearthed from the sites, collaborating with a DJ to produce soundscapes and make acoustic experiments in the abandoned studios. </p>
        
            <p>Raúl Ortega Ayala lives and works between Pōneke Wellington and Mexico City.</p>
        
            <p>His work involves immersion into foreign worlds and disciplines for extended periods of time. It encompasses film, painting, sculpture, photography, performance and happenings.</p>
        
            <p>Infrastructure: power, politics and imagination is on at Adam Art Gallery Wellington until 30 June.</p>
