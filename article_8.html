        <h2>Christopher Reeve doco earns Kiwi a BAFTA</h2>
        <p>
"It's a really beautiful film about how families come together after trauma, how you can become closer to people when things happen that you would have otherwise thought would be devastating blows," says Kiwi producer Lizzie Gillett. Audio

            <p>A cold call via LinkedIn has ended up with Kiwi producer Lizzie Gillett winning a BAFTA.</p>
        
            <p>Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story is the story of 1970s Superman actor Christopher Reeve who was paralysed in a horse-riding accident in 1995.</p>
        
            <p>The documentary shows how Reeve and his family coped with his injuries and was made with the support of his three children and aided by hours of family video footage.</p>
        
            <p>But it was no hagiography, London-based Gillett, told RNZ's Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>"They didn't want a puff piece about their dad. They wanted a true reflection of his life, of his work.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, there's things in there that are slightly critical of Chris, and views he took on disability and so on, and that he wasn't a perfect person."</p>
        
            <p>The call asking her to be part of the project came out of the blue, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This person got in touch with me and said I've got the Christopher Reeve family, and they have a whole load of tapes. They're keen to do a documentary. Would you like to be part of it? And of course, I leapt at the chance."</p>
        
            <p>Gillett, who has 20 years' experience as a documentary maker, said the first task was to wade through hours and hours of Reeve family footage.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a wonderful young researcher called Miha who sat and watched every tape, we had to hire a special deck because the tapes were on different formats. But she had to sit in the office and watch them, and she would suddenly shout out, 'oh my goodness, this is Will's fourth birthday party!'"</p>

            <p>The researchers watched every minute of the footage and logged what was on the tapes, she said. The Reeve children themselves, didn't know what was on much of them.</p>
        
            <p>"They handed us 125 tapes of archive, and they didn't know what was on those tapes, and they sat for six hour interviews, each of them separately. We didn't know that they'd made a pact between the three of them to leave nothing unsaid.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, the interviews were incredibly raw, incredibly emotional."</p>
        
            <p>That rawness has connected with audiences where the film has shown, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really beautiful film about how families come together after trauma, how you can become closer to people when things happen that you would have otherwise thought would be devastating blows.</p>
        
            <p>"And I think that's what the BAFTA community has responded to. The emotion in the film, the most common response we had from people who watched the film is just that they cried that they were broken by the film and hopefully put together a bit because it is inspiring and uplifting as well."</p>
        
            <p>The award was timely, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In 1978 Christopher Reeve won his first and his only BAFTA, for the Rising Star Award for his role in the first Superman film. And now 45 years later, we've got him a BAFTA, a BAFTA for Best Documentary, and we just feel so pleased to honour his legacy, to also elevate the story of the disabled community, which is often overlooked, including in the film industry and in Hollywood."</p>
