            <p>Reefton's Lisa Ryan is officially New Zealand's oldest female boxer, at the ripe age of 55.</p>
        
            <p>She cannot box competitively here in New Zealand, as the cut-off age is 50. But overseas the Masters circuit is booming, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Ryan had a knockout win at the Ageless Warriors amateur tournament in Australia and now she is gearing up for her next event, the Pan Pacific Masters Games.</p>
        
            <p>She needs a challenge to get motivated, she told RNZ's Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"I just put my hat in there and gave it a go. Because I am one of these people that are actually quite lazy unless I set myself a bit of a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"And I wouldn't train probably for anything unless I set myself a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"My fear of humiliation will usually drive me to make sure I do the training and then able to compete."</p>
        
            <p>She first got into boxing in the 1990s when as a reporter she met new Zealand's oldest boxer Eric Briggs.</p>
        
            <p>"I was playing other sports at the time. And I went up to watch one of his training sessions and he was running a gym up at the Workingmen's Club in Greymouth.</p>
        
            <p>"I watched what he went through with the training and he invited me to come in and have a go. And so, I did the skipping and some of the other exercises, and I was pooped afterwards, absolutely pooped after only about five minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"So I thought well, there's got to be something good in this. And I just joined up from there. And they chucked me in the ring after only three months' training. So that was a good experience."</p>
        
            <p>She won that bout, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I managed to stop my opponent in the first round. It was probably lucky for me, I think, at the time I was that nervous that I just didn't stop hitting, and so had it gone for longer than the first minute I probably wouldn't have lasted, because you do three two-minute rounds in the ring, and it's a lot of time to be punching without thinking, and I think that's what I was doing at the time - but it got me through."</p>
        
            <p>Then came the Canterbury Champs.</p>
        
            <p>"I took out two titles, the 54kg Open woman's title, the 57kg woman's title that was a bit of an upset because Maria McCallum was the current national champ at the time and had been unbeaten.</p>
        
            <p>"So this little girl from the West Coast went over there, but I think it was just, I didn't really know what I was in for and just gave it a go."</p>
        
            <p>After competing for the national side, there was a long hiatus from boxing, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're younger, you make some bad choices. And I was involved in a relationship that was not too good for me.</p>
        
            <p>"He was involved in boxing so, I avoided the very thing I loved for 20 years. And then I thought to myself, why am I avoiding something I really, really love? And so that's how I got back into boxing."</p>
        
            <p>The Masters boxing circuit is "pretty huge" in Australia, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a big tournament, the Pan Pacifics in November, where they have fighters from all over the world come to fight in a tournament. People from Russia, Thailand, South Africa and Scotland. So that will be a wonderful test to see if I can give it a wee whirl over there."</p>
        
            <p>Getting back in the ring has empowered her, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's helped get me through, it's good both for me, you find what's good for you, don't you? But for me, mentally and physically, it's a really good mix."</p>
        
            <p>These could be her golden years, she says, and has no plans to retire just yet.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had two knee surgeries on my right knee and one on my left, but I still managed to box, probably a bit too much road running and squash back in the day.</p>
        
            <p>"But you know, I can still move around and it's an all-body workout and it's not too jarring on what little cartilage is left in the knees. So, whilst I still can keep moving, I think I'll just keep at it."</p>
