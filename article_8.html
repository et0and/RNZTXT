            <p>Elizabeth Knox, one of New Zealand's most celebrated writers with 12 novels to her name, is a Stephen King super fan.</p>
        
            <p>King’s use of polyphonic voices in his writing was ground-breaking, she told Nights.</p>
        
            <p>“Most of his books have multiple points of view. And I think he's very influential... It's impossible not to be influenced by Stephen King if you’re ever thinking of doing a big canvas work.”</p>
        
            <p>King was and remains skilfull at capturing the teenage voice, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“He was a keen observer of his children and probably now his grandchildren. He's just good at people, he's good at imagining them from the inside.</p>
        
            <p>“And when he was a young man he was very good at imagining old men, and old women later. He stepped into the shoes of various old women narrators like Dolores Claiborne. He's just a very imaginative writer, and compassionate.</p>
        
            <p>“He's very moral writer, I've always thought that horror is one of the great moral genres. And he's a demonstration of that really, he can be terrifying or repulsive and really bad things happen to the characters, but he's not sadistic and and he's not prurient.”</p>

            <p>King sits with the greats of American literature, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“He is a great writer, great writers can appear in any genre.”</p>
        
            <p>Her two favourites are The Dead Zone and crime novel Joy Land.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s set in the 1970s about somebody in their student holidays working in an old amusement park, a kind of old, tired fading amusement park. It's such a good book, so atmospheric, and it's so suspenseful.”</p>
