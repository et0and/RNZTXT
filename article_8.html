        <h2>What won big at the Oscars? Men's fashion</h2>
        <p>
Men seemed to rival the women in red carpet fashion with many adventurous outfits that went far beyond the tuxedo.

            <p>There's no hiding it: the men on the red carpet at this year's Oscars served up many surprising delights.</p>
        
            <p>Best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet wore all lemon, minus his black shoes. Fellow best actor nominee Colman Domingo wore a red Valentino jacket that was belted at the waist. Actor Jeremy Strong, last seen in a mint green bucket hat and sunglasses at the Golden Globes, opted for an olive green suit with an abstract necktie.</p>
        
            <p>There were also some themes such as conflicting textures and brooches, brooches and more brooches.</p>

            <p>"One thing I would say that hopefully the Oscars does show there is an ability to dress up, be formal, be elegant and it is a yearly reminder that it can be really fun for men and really inspiring," says Benny Castles, New Zealand fashion commentator and director and designer of the WORLD brand.</p>
        
            <p>As New Zealand fashion publication noted the men were "unabashedly enjoying fashion as much as their female counterparts..."</p>
        
            <p>While Castles steered away from delving into "trend" dressing, he said there was such a great variety of styles that New Zealand men could take inspiration from whoever they liked and "help push your envelope as far as you feel comfortable".</p>
        
            <p>The fashion world collectively gushed about Chalamet's custom Givenchy outfit that Castles described as "sweaty moustachioed piece of sorbet".</p>

            <p>Castles wasn't the only one using food descriptions to determine Chalamet's yellow. The New York Times suggested French butter, egg yolk, or lemon as possible colour comparisons.</p>
        
            <p>"It looked just delightful," says Castles.</p>
        
            <p>Actor Andrew Garfield was an example of something of a theme on the red carpet: different textures in one outfit. For Garfield, this was different textures in a rich tobacco brown.</p>
        
            <p>"There was so much play of satin versus wool or satin versus matte as well as some really unique fabrications used on the textures of men's garments," says Castle.</p>

            <p>This was also seen in actor and musician Omar Apollo, who often brings a creative surprise to the red carpet. At the Oscars, he wore a veil that was in contrast to a satin cravat. Kieran Culkin, who took home the award for best supporting actor, also played with textures.</p>
        
            <p>Extravagant brooches were seen on probably dozens of male attendees at the Oscars. Variety Magazine called it the menswear accessory of choice.</p>
        
            <p>Best actor winner Adrien Brody matched his silver, shiny and spikey brooch to the single earring of his girlfriend Georgina Chapman. Apollo wore a diamond-encrusted lizard to complement his veil. Joe Alwyn's brooch was a slightly smaller floral design from Bulgari.</p>

            <p>Actor Jeff Goldblum went with what appeared to be a living brooch - a corsage, really - with a purple orchid pinned to his lapel.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of conversation in men's fashion that it's all in the detail, that sort of age-old phraseology," says Castles.</p>
        
            <p>The translation from Oscars red carpet to men in New Zealand is that "fashion is for everyone and anyone who wants it," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"When they get dressed - whether it be for a challenging day at work or a fun night out - fashion should be a positive twist."</p>
