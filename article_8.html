Bill Williams reckons the converted church he lives in is also home to the world's largest clock collection. Audio

            <p>Bill Williams told his wife he’d stop collecting clocks when he got to 100.</p>
        
            <p>“She thought I meant 100 clocks,” he chuckles.</p>
        
            <p>The 78-year-old retired schoolteacher had 3822 clocks at last count, and he’s still on the hunt for more.</p>
        
            <p>They line the walls and stack the shelves of the old church building in a paddock of his property near Colyton in Manawatū.</p>
        
            <p>Most he found in New Zealand, at garage sales or from deceased estates.</p>
        
            <p>They range in vintage from the early 1700s to the mid 1980s.</p>

            <p>Williams bursts with energy and passion as he takes Country Life on a tour of his museum, open at the weekends or by appointment.</p>
        
            <p>From a sonorous mantlepiece clock which chimes the nursery rhyme Frere Jacques to a kitsch 70s piece decorated with swirling fish, Williams has a hugely varied selection and many favourites.</p>
        
            <p>When he heard the Frere Jacques clock strike for the first time, he was ecstatic.</p>
        
            <p>“I rushed down to the place I bought it from and gave them an extra 50 bucks.”</p>

Most of the clocks have been collected from within New Zealand

            <p>The American-made clocks are reliable but they have the worst sounding chimes, he said, grimacing as he mimicked a harsh bonging sound worthy of a house of horrors.</p>
        
            <p>Fritz, a mahogany dog with eyeballs that roll around to tell the time, is one of his favourites.</p>

            <p>Then there’s his “pride and joy”, a curious grandfather clock, made of thousands of matchsticks by a Christchurch prison inmate in the 1940s or 50s.</p>
        
            <p>“Apparently he was a lifer so he had plenty of time on his hands.”</p>
        
            <p>Williams used to wind up about 100 clocks a week until he got a bit tired of it.</p>
        
            <p>He became hooked on clocks after opening up the back of one he found in an Auckland second-hand shop 25 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>“It was a pendulum clock. The movement really intrigued me.”</p>
        
            <p>Anything battery-powered does not get a look in at his museum, only wind-up or weight-driven clocks which work.</p>
        
            <p>It’s harder and harder to find these sorts of clocks, Bill said.</p>
        
            <p>“Mainly because I’ve got most of them!</p>
        
            <p>“But, also because clocks are not really part of young people’s life anymore and so they wouldn’t dream of buying one.”</p>

            <p>Williams believes he has the largest collection in the world although he hasn’t registered it with Guinness World Records.</p>
        
            <p>He tried contacting them but they never got back to him, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really, really hoping I can get to 4000 before I drop off the perch."</p>
