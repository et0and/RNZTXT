            <p>The tourism industry is being urged to embrace technology and prepare for more "digital natives" to be arriving at New Zealand's doors in the future.</p>
        
            <p>A new industry report suggests the visitor experience will be quite different in just five years' time with more "digital natives" - people who have grown up in the internet age.</p>
        
            <p>Industry leaders discussed the future of their sector at Tourism Summit Aotearoa in Auckland on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Minister Matt Doocey wanted New Zealand to be viewed as a year-round destination and he wanted to see 70 percent of tourism growth occur off-peak.</p>
        
            <p>In a video message, he talked about the government's work to develop a roadmap to explore how the industry could grow.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Tourism New Zealand kicked off a campaign to attract more visitors between March and November outside of summer, aiming to grow tourism by $5 billion over the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Ren√© de Monchy said they had not turned their back on the summer.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting more people year-round is going to make it easier to employ people year-round, make business obviously more profitable, more sustainable during the year. It's also the most sustainable form of growth."</p>
        
            <p>De Monchy wanted more travellers to find out about the many activities they could do throughout the year - including winter and the shoulder season.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the industry released its strategy to 2050 with plans to address underfunding, grow its workforce and become net carbon zero.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, the industry released a visitor experience report, showing there were big changes on the horizon in how people plan, book and engage on their future holidays.</p>
        
            <p>It showed tomorrow's tourists would be younger, more digital-savvy and on the search for special experiences, but there would also be a large group of older, well-off retirees who wanted to travel.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Industry Aotearoa chief executive Rebecca Ingram said they wanted to prioritise balanced growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We have the opportunity and the plan to predict a great future by creating it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that with the right settings, tourism could be worth $55 billion per year by 2030, and we can deliver this in a sustainable and resilient way."</p>
        
            <p>Frances Valintine from academyEX said using artificial intelligence could help to remove the pain points from organising a trip.</p>
        
            <p>"My request is around where to go. We have a time period, the months of the year, the airlines I want to fly, the budget that I have, I want to stop in Dubai. I've asked all these questions in a single prompt," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Within minutes, a complete itinerary was laid out.</p>
        
            <p>Technology was here to make people's job easier, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand's Jeremy O'Brien said there was a lot of new tech on its way including SkyNest, biometric boarding gates and digital bagtags.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes, actually, you don't have to person-to-person interaction, particularly when it's a really mundane task like checking in. Actually, you just want to get through, out the other side," he said.</p>
        
            <p>They were also working on a way to end the midnight munchies.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have a Sky Pantry. It will be fully stocked, you'll be able to go to it, eat when you want, as much as you want," O'Brien said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand plans to trial wifi on domestic flights from next year.</p>
