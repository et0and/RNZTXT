            <p>This is the little known story of The Forgotten Soldiers of Niue: 150 men plucked from their island paradise and sent 17,000 kms away to the cold frontlines of France during World War I.</p>
        
            <p>The Niuean soldiers never made it to the frontline, however. They instead died en route with the introduction of diseases they had never been exposed to.</p>
        
            <p>Leki Jackson-Bourke takes us on a journey back to Niue and through history to discover why these men went to fight and die for a war they didn’t understand, and for a king they didn’t know. He discovers the incredible legacy this has left on Niue, as well as his own special connection to these men and this war.</p>
