            <p>The red carpet has been rolled away, the awards have found a place on the mantel - the Aotearoa Music Awards are all done and dusted for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ captured some of the best moments at the awards in Auckland on Thursday night on and off stage. Here are some of our favourites.</p>
        
            <p>Accepting his Te Māngai Pāho Mana Reo prize, Best Māori Artist winner TAWAZ gets the crowd singing te reo Māori alphabet song A Ha Ka Ma Na with him.</p>
        
            <p>Stan Walker is given the new award, Te Manu Mātārae from Tame Iti. He dedicates the prize to his father, who died two days earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Best Group winner The Beths explain why half of the best band were missing, and tease a New Zealand tour (they just don't want us to get sick of them).</p>
