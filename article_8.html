            <p>Run out of stuff to watch? Join us as we dig deep into the streamers' catalogues for shows worth your time. This week: The Walk-In. </p>
        
            <p>The Walk-In (2022) made by ITV in the UK arrived on TVNZ+ in February with minimal fanfare.</p>
        
            <p>Written by Jeff Pope (Philomena) and starring the always watchable Stephen Graham, the five-parter is based on the true story of how Matthew Collins of activist group Hope not Hate infiltrated, with the help of an informant, British neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, foiling a plot to assassinate Labour MP Rosie Cooper.</p>
        
            <p>Collins was a member of far-right parties The National Front and the British National Party in the 1980s but turned informant for anti-Fascist publication Searchlight in the 1990s. He went into hiding in Australia once this came to light.</p>
        
            <p>Now back in the UK, we meet Graham as Collins monitoring and blogging about new extreme Fascist group National Action for Hope not Hate.</p>
        
            <p>British neo-Nazis have been emboldened the anti-immigration feelings stirred up by radical Muslim terror attacks and the more toxic, dog whistles of the Brexit campaign.</p>
        
            <p>This culminates, horrifically, in the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a man shouting white supremacist slogans. National Action made no secret of its approval of the murder.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile National Action recruit Robbie Mullen (Andrew Ellis) is the titular walk-in and is giving Collins information about National Action's plans to escalate violence against MPs seen as pro-immigration. In this case a plot to murder Labour MP Cooper.</p>
        
            <p>Pope's script deftly keeps the action ticking and the tension of Graham constantly moving house to keep his family safe from far-right reprisals is gripping. As is Mullen's anxiety that he will be rumbled by his new Fascist National Action pals.</p>
        
            <p>Mullens radicalisation is nicely handled, without judgement, he's a loner in a dead-end job - a prime Fash prospect.</p>
        
            <p>This is top class British fare and with populist and Fascist parties across Europe on the march, grimly prescient.</p>
