        <h2>What we're watching: Tokyo Vice</h2>
        <p>
Dan Slevin recommends a crime thriller with a powerful - and unusual - sense of time and place.

            <p>It was the name Michael Mann that attracted me to Tokyo Vice, a noir thriller based on the 2009 memoir by Jake Adelstein - the first American journalist to work for a major Japanese newspaper.</p>
        
            <p>Mann is one of the greatest movie directors around - responsible for classics like The Last of the Mohicans, Heat and the first Hannibal Lector film, Manhunter - but he hasn't been involved in much television since he produced Miami Vice in the 80s.</p>
        
            <p>To have him actually behind the camera for the pilot episode, as well as executive producer, means that Tokyo Vice has a big head start on the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Ansel Elgort plays Adelstein. He's ambitious and impatient which gets him into trouble in the deeply traditional and hierarchical world of Japan's biggest paper, the Meicho Shimbun.</p>
        
            <p>One of the sources he cultivates is a hard-boiled cop on the Yakuza beat, played with delightful world-weariness by Academy Award-nominee Ken Watanabe.</p>
        
            <p>Adelstein becomes embroiled in the seedy side of Japanese life as he investigates a series of mysterious suicides and discovers links between those cases and a growing battle between Yakuza criminal gangs.</p>
        
            <p>The show is set in 1999 and it does a lovely job of evoking a period when the internet was hardly a thing, people phoned each other because texting on mobile phones was so painful, and family updates from home came on cassette tapes.</p>
        
            <p>Elgort is excellent as a wide-eyed innocent, wandering around the city in a poorly fitting suit, notebook in his nerdy college backpack, chasing down leads, but there is a strong ensemble around him, each one presenting an alternative angle on one of the most fascinating cities on the planet.</p>
        
            <p>Story: 4/5 (The main villain disappears for a few episodes which reduces the intensity a little but when he returns? Oh boy.)</p>
        
            <p>Production: 4/5 (The visual panache of the first Michael Mann episode isn't maintained but the production's attention to detail - from rarely seen locations to intricate Yakuza tattoo art - is exemplary.)</p>
        
            <p>Bingeability: 4/5 (There are two seasons - of eight and ten episodes respectively - and there's no word on whether there will be a third, so binge with confidence)</p>
        
            <p>Sh≈çgun (more Japanese intrigue, but much further back in history)</p>
        
            <p>Miami Vice (Mann's original series isn't available online here so check out his stylish 2006 reboot with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx instead)</p>
        
            <p>Giri/Haji (a reverse fish-out-of-water thriller with a Japanese cop battling Yakuza in London).</p>
        
            <p>Tokyo Vice is streaming now on TVNZ+</p>
