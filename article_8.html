        <h2>New Zealand's finest architecture of 2024</h2>

            <p>A repurposed classroom 'in the clouds' of Nepal, Dunedin's Railway Station and a learning centre based on a legendary explorer are among 23 buildings recognised as the best of Aotearoa's architecture in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The winners, announced at the New Zealand Institute of Architects' 2024 Awards in Tāmaki Makaurau on Friday night, were selected from a shortlist of 48 across 11 categories.</p>
        
            <p>"So many projects came from completely different walks of life, but used the vehicle of architecture to explore the potential of partnership between cultural groups. It was epic," jury convenor Caro Robertson said.</p>

            <p>After the 2011 Christchurch earthquake destroyed the Scarborough Hill home of philanthropist Jim and Dr Susan Wakefield, the couple commissioned the Ravenscar House Museum to gift their home and art collection to the public. It opened its doors in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Patterson Associates Limited architects said they wanted it to serve as "a lasting symbol of resilience" and explored the idea of galleries as "ghost" rooms.</p>

            <p>They also wanted to acknowledge the "gothic architectural legacy" of the city in the wake of the earthquake aftermath and managed to incorporate rubble from other damaged buildings in the city that was otherwise destined for landfill.</p>
        
            <p>"As visitors move through the galleries, they transition from light to dark and vice versa, encountering subtle reminders of vanished homes, gardens, the lost city, upon new discoveries."</p>
        
            <p>NZIA said the Sir Edmund Hillary visitor centre in Khumjung Village was "a one-of-a-kind cultural project", envisioned by Auckland-based Pearson & Associates Architect, and was the only winner in the international architecture category.</p>

            <p>The centre, which has repurposed the 1961 building Sir Edmund and his wife built as a classroom after his historic summit of Mount Everest, focuses on the many projects the mountaineer undertook in the area as well as the work of the Himalayan Trust.</p>
        
            <p>"This modest 'school house in the clouds' has a huge cultural significance to the local community and Nepal at large," Pearson & Associates Architect said in their submission.</p>

            <p>"In restoring and repurposing this building we have tried to ensure its legacy will continue into the future and maintain a positive influence on the local community and visitors to the area."</p>
        
            <p>It officially opened last year in celebration of the 70th anniversary of Sir Edmund's summit.</p>

            <p>Salmond Reed Architects described Dunedin's restored railway station as "one of the finest examples of public architecture" in the country.</p>
        
            <p>The restoration was commissioned by the city council for repairs and conservation of the category 1 heritage building.</p>

            <p>"The building opened in 1906 and after a long history as a railway station, is now used primarily for tourist trains and is a popular visitor attraction in its own right. The building use has diversified, now housing a restaurant, art gallery, and the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame."</p>

            <p>Te Taumata o Kupe Nuku, at Te Mahurehure Marae, aims to be a place for people to "recite and receive mātauranga Māori".</p>
        
            <p>The Point Chevalier building, which opened in 2022, is named after Kupe, the legendary Polynesian navigator and explorer acknowledged by some iwi as the discoverer of Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>It was inspired by korero from kaumātua Christine and her husband John Panapa, Tā Patu Hohepa, Rereata Makiha and Julian Wilcox.</p>
        
            <p>"The building's sweeping, organic form embodies the dynamism of Kupe's waka as it sailed towards Aotearoa. The glazing is like a sail with the reflection of the shifting sun and clouds making the building appear to move like a waka across the ocean," TOA Architects said in their application.</p>
        
            <p>The elevated platform aims to create an illusion of the building hovering, the architects said.</p>
