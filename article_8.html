            <p>In Late Night with The Devil, a 1970s TV host goes for the ultimate shock interview at Halloween.</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely brilliant," says Stephen King. Is he right?</p>

            <p>Very well-known novelist Stephen King and B-movie director Kevin Smith loved this film to death, apparently. Obviously, I can't argue with that, even if I'm personally not a big fan of either.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike the target audience for something called Late Night with The Devil, of course.</p>
        
            <p>The film's star has an unfamiliar name - David Dastmalchian - but a very familiar face. He's that creepy guy in films like The Dark Knight, The Suicide Squad and Dune.</p>
        
            <p>This is Dastmalchian's first starring role, playing a non-creepy guy for a change - TV host Jack Delroy.</p>
        
            <p>Late Night with The Devil takes place in 1970s America when television's top-rating shows were late-night talk shows.</p>
        
            <p>Comedian Johnny Carson established the blueprint - a bit of standup, a few sketches, music, and undemanding interviews with celebrities and newsmakers.</p>
        
            <p>Jack Delroy is the perpetual runner-up on the TV station UBC, and he and his producer Leo are coming to the end of the road.</p>
        
            <p>Unless they can pull something out of the hat, their midnight show will be cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>So they come up with something sensational for Halloween Night, 1977.</p>
        
            <p>The show will be stacked with the paranormal - a fork-bending medium, a professional sceptic and the author of a best-seller called Conversation with the Devil and her subject, a young girl called Lilly.</p>
        
            <p>And the climax of Late Night with Jack Elroy will be, apparently, an interview with Mr Scratch himself, via Lilly.</p>
        
            <p>Before that happens we've already been softened up with the sort of thing Stephen King and Kevin Smith throw into their own genre pictures.</p>
        
            <p>We learn that Jack's wife Madeleine recently died - is there anybody there, we wonder? We discover that Jack himself is a member of a secret organisation for business, church and media figures.</p>
        
            <p>An organisation that regularly holds midnight meetings at an ancient Native American burial ground. But you knew I was going to say that, didn't you?</p>
        
            <p>Late Night with The Devil was written and directed by a couple of brothers from Australia.</p>
        
            <p>In fact they couldn't have had more Australian names - Cameron and Colin Cairnes - and they've thrown everything but the kitchen sink at the film to, as I say, highly satisfactory reactions.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from David Dastmalchian, there are no names to speak of in the film, but the cast certainly gives it heaps.</p>
        
            <p>Particularly young Australian actress Ingrid Torelli as the unnerving Lilly who devours the scenery - possibly literally - by the end.</p>
        
            <p>I'd recommend seeing this film in a crowded cinema - possibly at midnight. It's a film that definitely won't work nearly as well on your laptop.</p>
        
            <p>I suspect when Stephen King and Kevin Smith saw it, the clunkier lines were drowned out by panicky screaming by their neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>Which is how a film called Late Night with The Devil should be, of course.</p>
