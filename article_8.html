How do you encourage children to start making their own decisions? First off, it's all about helping them build "decision-making scaffolding", education specialist Mark Osborne tells Nine to Noon. Audio

            <p>How do you encourage children to start making their own decisions? And at what age should they be able to do this with confidence?</p>
        
            <p>First off, it's all about helping them build "decision-making scaffolding", education specialist Mark Osborne tells Nine to Noon.</p>

            <p>Mark Osborne is the founder of Leading Learning and has worked with schools throughout Australasia, North and South America, Europe and Asia.</p>
        
            <p>The skills needed for decision-making are goal setting, planning, organising and managing time and resources, monitoring progress and reflection, Osborne says.</p>
        
            <p>To foster these in your children, he recommends the following:</p>
        
            <p>Don’t be a “snowplough parent”</p>
        
            <p>The 'snowplough parent' tries to clear all obstructions and the blockages from a child's path to make their life go smoothly, Osborne says.</p>
        
            <p>“We know that that just delays the inevitable as when they eventually leave home, they're going to need these skills.”</p>
        
            <p>Build a skills scaffold</p>
        
            <p>Imagine you're thinking about taking the dog for a walk and talk through your decision-making process, Osborne suggests.</p>
        
            <p>"We might start with saying 'Well, okay, let's take the dog for a walk. What do we need to get done? We need to make sure that we've got all the things that we need in order to go for the dog walk."</p>
        
            <p>Many considerations will be going through your head almost automatically, but making a checklist to verbalise will be the initial "scaffold" for modelling the process.</p>
        
            <p>“We need to have a look out the window and see what the weather's doing. </p>
        
            <p>“We'll need the lead, won't we? And we'll probably need, if the weather's looking a bit dark, we'll need to need a raincoat."</p>
        
            <p>As time goes on, you might then invite a young person into the decision-making process, Osborne says.</p>
        
            <p>Eventually the scaffold won’t be needed and the child will have formed their own routine.</p>
        
            <p>FAIL – First Attempt At Learning</p>
        
            <p>The most important thing is not necessarily whether the child succeeds in their decision-making, he says, but what they learn along the way.</p>
        
            <p>We need to create a "pro-learning" culture in schools and also in our families.</p>
        
            <p>“If [their decision] didn't go according to plan, we can be asking things like 'How did that make you feel? Or what would you do differently next time? Or what did you learn as a result of that?' That's a model or a scaffold.”</p>
        
            <p>Don't throw them in at the deep end</p>
        
            <p>Our brains don't cope very well with anything too sudden, Osborne says.</p>
        
            <p>“We’re actually much better at growing those neural pathways by trying things with gradually adjusting course.”</p>
        
            <p>By gently removing the skills scaffolds, we encourage the child to make the decision-making process a habit, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“We give the kids the language to be able to reflect, we provide it for them until they internalise it and use that themselves.”</p>
        
            <p>I do, We do, You do</p>
        
            <p>This is a common teaching technique that works well in the development of decision-making skills, Osborne says.</p>
        
            <p>"I’ll pack your bag for the first time, then we move to the ‘we do’ so we do it together and there's a bit of a check.</p>
        
            <p>"But then just to make sure that you're not leaning on me a little bit too much, move it over to the ‘you do’ now. Show me that you can do it independently.”</p>
