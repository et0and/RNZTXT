        <h2>Sounds Air cans Taupō flights amid rising costs</h2>
        <p>
The airline can't pass on massive fare increases or have shareholders subside services indefinitely, boss says.

            <p>Regional operator Sounds Air is canning its Wellington to Taupō service as escalating costs put the squeeze on the aviation sector.</p>
        
            <p>Sounds Air cancelled its Wellington to Westport service three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Andrew Crawford said while demand for flights was strong, costs were too high.</p>
        
            <p>"Decisions like this are not taken lightly. This has been a very tough call for management and our shareholders," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have done everything that we can to avoid cancelling these services."</p>
        
            <p>Crawford said the company could not pass on massive fare increases or have shareholders subsidise services indefinitely.</p>
        
            <p>Sounds Air was not alone in reviewing its regional flights, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Air New Zealand reviews its regional services on a regular basis and Jetstar has made it clear that they do not intend to extend their domestic network to include regional New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington to Taupō route was the last the company would can, Crawford said.</p>
