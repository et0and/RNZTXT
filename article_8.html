            <p>After weeks of confusion, online furore and official pageant investigations, the winner of Miss Universe Fiji has officially been crowned.</p>
        
            <p>Manshika Prasad, a 24-year-old MBA student, was adorned with her tiara and winner's sash on stage at Fiji's Pearl Resort and Spa at the start of September.</p>
        
            <p>But two days after her win at Fiji's first Miss Universe pageant in more than 40 years, Miss Universe Fiji said a "breach of protocol" had occurred, and later announced "runner up" Nadine Roberts as the real winner, a 30-year-old model and property developer originally from the Gold Coast whose mother is Fijian.</p>

            <p>A press release from Miss Universe Fiji at the time claimed that "correct procedures" had not been followed on the night. The controversy about the winner centred around an extra eighth vote, with vote-rigging allegations flying.</p>
        
            <p>Both Prasad and Roberts claimed to be the rightful winner, their respective social media flooded with their thoughts for the weeks that followed. Miss Universe Fiji and the official Miss Universe Organisation in the US had not responded to RNZ when asked for confirmation.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC in Australia reported accusations of racism, vote-rigging, conflicts of interest and "conspiracy theories" all from the "official" Miss Universe Fiji organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Six weeks later a statement has been released by the official Miss Universe Organization in the US, revealing that Prasad, the original winner, will be the one flying to Mexico for the November 17 international competition.</p>
        
            <p>"The Miss Universe Organisation is aware of the confusion and concerns that were recently raised after the results of the Miss Universe Fiji pageant were called into question," they wrote in a statement published on its website this week.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to assure all fans, participants and parties involved, that we have investigated this matter with the utmost seriousness and with the commitment to clarify the situation in a reasonable time.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been conflicting reports regarding the winner of the pageant. While Manshika Prasad was announced as the winner of the Miss Universe Fiji pageant, information posted on the Miss Universe Fiji organization's website and official Instagram account suggest that Nadine Roberts was the winner, due to alleged voting irregularities.</p>
        
            <p>"The Miss Universe Organisation, after communicating with the parties involved to better understand how events unfolded, and after reviewing that the processes and results of the national pageant have complied with the Organization's transparency and fairness policies, and with our "pageantry 101" standards, has determined that the winner of Miss Universe Fiji 2024 is Miss Manshika Prasad."</p>
        
            <p>Marine biologist Melissa White had flown over from New Zealand to represent an environmental charity as a judge at the September event in Fiji. She told RNZ's Midday Report back in September that the days following the win had "tainted" what should have been a historic event for Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>"When the votes were counted on the night of the event, it was four to three. So Manshika Prasad had the four votes to the three and was given the crown as the clear winner," White explained.</p>
        
            <p>"Two days later we were told that the crown had been taken from her and that all of a sudden there was an eighth judge who was the licensee of the holder for the Miss Universe Fiji.</p>

            <p>"It was just a bit unheard of that there was an absentee judge all of a sudden, and now all of a sudden there was a tie, there was a tie-breaker, and this other girl wins and they take the crown away from the girl who won fairly that night."</p>
        
            <p>Fiji had not held a Miss Universe competition since 1981 as they had not been able to find anyone willing to fund a national pageant in the small island nation.</p>

            <p>The global beauty pageant is run on a franchise basis, which enables licensees to use the brand and sell tickets. This year, property development firm Lux Projects Bali inked a deal for Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>Miss Universe Fiji had confirmed to RNZ that the Miss Universe Organisation were dealing with Lux Projects Bali "at the highest level". Lux Projects had not responded to RNZ's request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>"What has been presented by Lux Projects Bali is false and defamatory and my legal team will also be addressing," Miss Universe Fiji spokesman, Grant Dwyer, wrote in a statement to RNZ at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been very sad for both Manshika, the other finalists, the judges, the sponsors and Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>"The rightful winner was and is Manshika."</p>
