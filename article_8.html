Masterton is buzzing this weekend for The Golden Shears - a shearing competition billed as the world's best. Video, Audio

            <p>Masterton is buzzing this weekend to the sound of shears, wool handlers' brooms and the cranking of wool presses.</p>
        
            <p>The Golden Shears, billed as the world's premier shearing and wool handling competition, has this year drawn around 500 entries, more than 25 percent up on last year.</p>
        
            <p>The competition attracts top shearers from around the world and has been going since 1961, with grades from novice to open and even a teddy bear shearing contest for the little ones.</p>

            <p>Wool pressing, one of the most demanding jobs in the woolshed, is also on display and hotly contested among single and paired competitors. </p>
        
            <p>Squeezing the wool into a target weight, neatly baled, pinned and branded in the shortest time possible is the aim of the game. </p>

            <p>Two hundred of the entrants are in the novice or junior grade, thanks to new training programmes, bringing people into the industry.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen-year-old Wairoa College student, Ashlin Swann, who won the Novice final, showed it's not all about speed.</p>
        
            <p>She was slowest, shearing the two sheep in just under seven and a half minutes but received only three penalties in the pen where judges check to see how efficiently and carefully the fleece has been removed.</p>

            <p>Four thousand sheep head through the stadium from farms in Wairarapa and as far south as Otago. It's a well-oiled machine unloading the animals in the compact yard area in the town centre.</p>

            <p>The Saturday night Open Shearing Final is the culmination of a year's worth of hard work involving many volunteers and officials.</p>
        
            <p>Defending champion and eight-time winner Rowland Smith has pulled out due to injury, throwing the competition wide open to a raft of hopefuls.</p>
