            <p>If you live in Cromwell, lock up your wardrobe.</p>
        
            <p>A local cat has been slipping into people's houses and pinching whatever he fancies and right now, it is pink shoes.</p>
        
            <p>The 4-year-old ginger cat named Marlin started out with a few odds and sods from a neighbouring section and now he has gone all Imelda Marcos on it.</p>
        
            <p>Marlin's owner Elise Jaunay told Checkpoint he is busy during the night.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always at nighttime. Normally on Monday nights, but he's been doing it for about three-and-a-half years, but it's only been a problem when he's bringing back people's shoes."</p>
        
            <p>She said he drops what he finds on her front door.</p>
        
            <p>"He does his classic meow saying I've got something special. Normally what most cats have is mice or a bird, but no.</p>

            <p>"You wake up and there's one pink Croc and you put it to the side. Then you wake up the next morning, and there's the other Croc."</p>
        
            <p>Marlin has brought home three pairs of children's Crocs and two adult pairs.</p>
        
            <p>"At first he would litter our house with just plastic rubbish from roadsides and I thought that's good, he's doing something for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Then it proceeded from tools, bolts and nuts from building sites. Then we're like well, people are going to start missing this."</p>
        
            <p>She said Marlin is a small cat but with a strong mouth and she thinks he likes the texture of the Crocs.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he likes texture because he likes steelier pads and rags and towels."</p>

            <p>Jaunay said she first adopted Marlin with another cat, who he used to hunt for things with.</p>
        
            <p>"I adopted them together and they were best buddies. Then one died last year and ever since then, he's got more serious with his hunting."</p>
        
            <p>She has put the Crocs Marlin took on the local community page on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"Up till now, we've just kept it because we don't know where it comes from, but I felt bad, people will miss them, those are kind of important, especially kids' ones."</p>
        
            <p>Marlin has been a repeat offender, going back several times and pinching the same Crocs, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We did try chucking them on the verge in front of houses, hoping that owners will pass and see them and pick them up.</p>
        
            <p>"But no, he keeps bringing them back. So that's why I had to put it up on the page saying 'come get your Crocs' because otherwise the cat will keep bringing them back."</p>
        
            <p>Jaunay said she thinks Marlin is trying to send her a message.</p>
        
            <p>"They have all been pink and we own yellow and blue pairs and everything else but pink and I'm sure not many people own pink Crocs and I'm pregnant and we don't know the gender.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's saying it's a girl."</p>
        
            <p>If Marlin was to have a dating profile, she said he has multiple characteristics aside from being a collector.</p>
        
            <p>"A one-man band. Anti-sociable but works hard for the right person."</p>
