            <p>Sweetcorn season is in full swing.</p>
        
            <p>Before Christmas, Aotearoa's largest sweetcorn grower said there was a bumper season ahead. That means there's no better time to get your fill of juicy kernels either straight from the cob (sweetcorn loses 25 percent of its sweetness 24 hours after being picked), barbecued or used in a salad.</p>

            <p>Not sure how to cook corn so it's tender and juicy? It's simple: bring a pot of water to the boil and add husked cobs. By the time the water is boiling again, the cobs will be cooked.</p>
        
            <p>For a speedier result, leave the husks on and microwave corn on 100 percent power for 2-3 minutes (use caution when husking, the leaves will be very hot). If barbecuing, Dame Alison Holst's Barbecued Glazed Sweetcorn recipe has great advice for corn-cooking beginners.</p>
        
            <p>If you're looking for more ways to make corn the star, check out Alby Hailes' Grilled Sweetcorn and Nectarine Salad with Miso Dressing. This fresh, vibrant salad makes use of lots of abundant summer produce.</p>
