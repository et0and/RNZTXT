            <p>The country's biggest bank is making buying a house a little cheaper for some buyers, as brokers say competition is heating up for mortgage business.</p>
        
            <p>Edge Mortgages director Glen McLeod said ANZ was allowing customers to apply to have their low-equity premium waived.</p>
        
            <p>This is a fee that is charged when someone has less than 20 percent deposit. It can vary from 0.25 percent of the loan amount for people with just under a 20 percent deposit through to 2 percent for those with less than 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The fee is common across most lenders, but some apply a margin to the interest rate charged rather than an upfront fee.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're over 80 percent [loan-to-value ratio] we can request that you don't have a low equity premium on your rate. You'll actually get a fairly good rate now. It's an area where they're deciding to compete, which is interesting."</p>
        
            <p>He said ANZ had recently shaken up the market with a one-year offer of 5.65 percent, and this seemed like a continuation of that.</p>
        
            <p>"That was taking business from their competitors and their competitors reacted."</p>
        
            <p>A relatively small number of customers would be affected by the latest change but it would be meaningful to them, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Whether the premium would be waived would be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        
            <p>He said brokers had also been told they could request non-utilisation recovery fees be waived, too. That is charged when people reserve a rate and then do not use it.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ has been approached for comment.</p>
