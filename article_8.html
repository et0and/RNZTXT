            <p>When Canterbury photographer Shoshana Schande goes tramping, she usually has her five-year-old son and 18-month-old daughter in tow.</p>
        
            <p>"I keep thinking, well, if I didn't go with them I'd be like 'Oh, you're missing out on all these cool things," she tells Jesse Mulligan.</p>
        
            <p>Shoshana Schande shares tips and inspiration for outdoor adventures with kids on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>A good age to start kids tramping is the question that fellow parents most frequently ask Schande on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Although she says most people hold off until their kids are six or seven – "because that's when it gets a lot easier" – she didn't want to wait that long and started taking her five-year-old on day walks as an 18-month-old.</p>
        
            <p>Until the age of four, he was carried the whole way in a baby carrier, Schande says. Now, although he can comfortably walk 10kms-a-day, he still sometimes gets a ride.</p>
        
            <p>"My kids live in the baby carrier. I carry them everywhere. I carry them at home... I find that's especially helpful because it kind of helps you build up your strength, carrying them around while you're gardening and stuff."</p>
        
            <p>Although she has now taken her kids on multi-day tramps, Schande says she began slowly with short walks then built up.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't need all the fancy big expensive gear, especially when you're starting. [It's just a case of] finding some running shoes and putting the baby in a backpack."</p>
        
            <p>Tramping with nappies is something Schande  has "stressed over" a lot. While cloth nappies are bigger and bulkier than disposable ones, she finds them more practical as they can be washed and reused.</p>
        
            <p>Also helpful for toileting in the wild is the EC (elimination communication) method Schande uses.</p>
        
            <p>"I go with their natural cues to go to the toilet. My baby is nine months old now. And she hardly ever soils a nappy because she catches everything on the toilet ... That's a big help for tramping because I follow her natural cues and then take her to the toilet when she says she needs to go."</p>
        
            <p>Out in the hills, snacks are a hugely important motivator for both parents and kids, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very food-motivated so when I'm going camping I'm always thinking of what food I can take. It's a time when I bring out all the special stuff that we don't have at home.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll go to the supermarket and I'll let [my son] choose lollies or anything like that, anything that he wants to carry in his pack, and then he gets to eat that on the trip.</p>
        
            <p>"When he was about two to three, we'd have quite a few walks and I would take marshmallows and just kind of drip-feed them to him every few metres down the track when he wasn't feeling motivated, and that really helped a lot."</p>
        
            <p>While Schande wants her kids to enjoy tramping as a break from the busyness of life, she also sees it as an opportunity to teach them endurance and that sometimes life isn't easy and you've just gotta keep pushing on.</p>
        
            <p>"I just enjoy it so much that taking the kids along, well, it is extra effort but the reward is greater."</p>
