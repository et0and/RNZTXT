        <h2>At The Movies: The Iron Claw</h2>
        <p>
The Iron Claw, starring a bulked-up Zac Efron, is based on the real-life story of a family of superstar wrestlers, the Von Erichs, and the astonishing run of tragedy that stalked them. Video, Audio

            <p>What comic-books are to literature, what soap opera is to TV drama, so pro wrestling is to sport, I suppose. It’s bigger, it’s flashier, it’s more colourful and of course the end result is more satisfying.</p>
        
            <p>Wrestlers don’t like people calling these bouts “fake”. They prefer “predetermined”. I imagine North Koreans feel the same way about their elections.</p>
        
            <p>But fake or not, pro wrestling is still hugely popular around the world, with its larger-than-life characters and its mapped-out storylines that culminate in villains defeated and heroes triumphant. </p>

            <p>Good guys like the famous Von Erich family.</p>
        
            <p>Now, I say “famous”… It has been quite a while since I last watched the WWF’s Wrestlemania in slightly dazed confusion.</p>
        
            <p>So, I’d rather forgotten about the doomed Von Erich brothers and their domineering father Fritz.</p>
        
            <p>Fritz used to be a wrestler himself. His persona in the Sixties was a villainous Nazi, and the Von Erich signature move was grabbing his opponent’s forehead in the dreaded Iron Claw.  </p>
        
            <p>Now Dad relies on his wrestler sons Kevin and David, and later Kerry and Michael to win the coveted World Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin, the eldest, is played by Zac Efron, who’s an eyeful for people who just know him as a teenage heartthrob in High School Musical and The Greatest Showman.   </p>
        
            <p>There’s certainly a lot more of him – he looks like a miniature version of The Rock in this film. Zac’s the one brother who’s allowed a love-life – that’s if you don’t count Mum and Dad.</p>
        
            <p>English actress Lily James must have set some sort of record for number of starring roles without quite graduating to A List.  </p>
        
            <p>Downton Abbey, Mamma Mia, Yesterday, TV’s War and Peace, Pam and Tommy…. What’s a girl got to do to get noticed? Possibly not The Iron Claw.</p>
        
            <p>Zac’s brothers include Harris Dickinson as David - the one with the gift of the gab - and Jeremy Allen White as Kerry, the one with emotional problems. </p>
        
            <p>The other brother, the rather weedy Michael, would rather be playing guitar. Good luck with that, Mike.</p>
        
            <p>If you’re not already on board for the idea of a story about the Von Erich brothers and their famous Family Curse, chances are you’re not a big wrestling fan. </p>
        
            <p>You’ll be asking inconvenient questions about “predetermined sports” and how you compete to win a championship when the result has already been fixed?</p>
        
            <p>If you are a wrestling fan and therefore excited by the prospect of The Iron Claw, you may have your own inconvenient questions. </p>
        
            <p>Like how come these popular actors look very little like the gigantic originals, apart from their dodgy Eighties wigs?  </p>
        
            <p>When Efron steps into the ring with a caption saying “Six foot two”, that’s certainly a test for the fans’ willing suspension of disbelief.</p>
        
            <p>The story is already well-known to them of course – the tragic string of casualties among the brothers, and how they somehow kept going, generation after generation.  </p>
        
            <p>For the rest of us there’s not much, apart from counting the number of times The Iron Claw name checks “family” and “brothers”.</p>
        
            <p>But we can certainly enjoy James gamely smiling throughout the movie with a pretty good Texas accent. You go, Lil!</p>
