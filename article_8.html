        <h2>'Wetlands have got a real place on any farm'</h2>
        <p>
A 7,500m2 wetland at the bottom of South Wairarapa's Kaiwaiwai Dairies is reducing nitrates drained from paddocks.  Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Drinking from the drain flowing out of a corner of his South Wairarapa dairy farm is not such a crazy idea, Aidan Bichan says.</p>
        
            <p>If it weren’t for the wildlife living in Kaiwaiwai Dairies’ three-quarter hectare wetland, its co-owner has only a few qualms about taking a sip.</p>
        
            <p>He took Country Life on a tour of the wetland, established nearly a decade ago.</p>

            <p>It was designed with advice from Greater Wellington and NIWA after several iterations and dug by an earth-moving contractor who’s a fellow shareholder in the farm.</p>
        
            <p>“He understood the issues around dirt.”</p>
        
            <p>Six metre-wide channels were dug in the carbon-rich peat and the soil pushed up to form banks in between 12 tightly squashed up curves.</p>
        
            <p>The banks are now heaving with harakeke and native trees and shrubs.</p>
        
            <p>Water-filtering plants were added and over the years they found raupo did the best job of “polishing up the water.”</p>
        
            <p>The aim was to remove nitrates from the water drained from 200 hectares of pasture.</p>
        
            <p>In earlier times the pollutants from cow urine, fertiliser and plants would have ended up in the Wairarapa Moana.</p>
        
            <p>While nitrate loss from the farm is relatively low - because of low fertiliser use and minimal soil disturbance - Bichan said monthly monitoring shows the wetland’s working.</p>
        
            <p>“We know that it's taking out somewhere between half and three quarters of a ton of nitrate out of the water every year.”</p>

            <p>Kaiwaiwai Dairies milks 900 cows off a 350 hectare milking platform. Clay and iron pans under the paddocks mean water drains sideways rather than leaching downwards.</p>
        
            <p>“If it ends up in a drain we can put it through a wetland and scrub it or polish it. And that's what this was basically demonstrated to do.</p>
        
            <p>“Once the temperature’s above about 10 or 11 degrees, we're taking out 95 to 99 percent of the nitrate that comes through.”</p>
        
            <p>In winter it still takes half the nitrate out, Bichan added.</p>
        
            <p>“So it is quite temperature dependent for the processes for the bacteria. But that's nice clean water.”</p>
        
            <p>Bichan lifts the lid on a drum at the inlet to the wetland showing where a large kōura - freshwater crayfish - had earlier taken up residence.</p>
        
            <p>Tuna - eels - also live here and the wetland’s designed with wide enough bays for its resident marine wildlife to take shelter when it needs to be cleaned.</p>
        
            <p>The area has also been home to a nesting Australasian harrier - swamp-hawk or kāhu - and plenty of ducks and pūkeko.</p>

            <p>It cost not more than $27,000 to install and was planted up with help from hundreds of volunteers and grants, Bichan said.</p>
        
            <p>He describes the project as an environmental hobby for those in the farm’s team who have time, skills and energy to put into such projects. Besides, it’s a great way to show they’re doing “the right thing.”</p>
        
            <p>“This is about being a role model. Wetlands have got a real place on any farm.</p>
        
            <p>“Half a hectare in the bottom corner of your farm … makes everything better. And yeah, this is a great place to come and sit.”</p>

            <p>The farm hosts walking tours and open days and welcomes discussion about all aspects of farming, with “science at the table”, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“I want to get our story out there that actually, farmers are not the evil people that some quarters would perhaps like to present.”</p>
