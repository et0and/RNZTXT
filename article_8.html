            <p>A mesmerising scene of western toad tadpoles has earned its photographer the coveted title of Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The picture, captured by Canadian Marine Conservation photojournalist Shane Gross, took top honours in this year's Natural History Museum competition.</p>
        
            <p>Gross captured the image while snorkelling through carpets of lily pads in Cedar Lake on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.</p>
        
            <p>He swam for several hours, ensuring not to disturb the layers of silt and algae covering the bottom of the lake.</p>
        
            <p>Other than the overall victory, this stunning image also earned Gross first place in the Wetlands: The bigger picture category.</p>

            <p>Kathy Moran, who chaired the judging panel, said the jury was excited by the addition of a new species to the awards' archive.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last few years, the competition has highlighted environments and species that are often overlooked yet provoke the same wonder and delight when shared as the more typically photographed wildlife and wild places."</p>
        
            <p>The competition attracted a record-breaking 59,228 entries from 117 countries which were judged anonymously by an international panel of experts on their originality, narrative, technical excellence, and ethical practice.</p>
        
            <p>The winning images showcase the natural world in all its diverse glory.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at some of the other category winners.</p>
