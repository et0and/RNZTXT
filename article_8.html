            <p>You might remember women "getting their colours done" in the 1980s. Were you a Soft Autumn or maybe a Bright Spring?</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to social media, the art of analysing which shades best complement a person's natural colouring is again having a moment.</p>
        
            <p>Rachel Bilu of Colour Lab Stylist tells Susie Ferguson about the benefits of knowing which colours help you look your best.</p>
        
            <p>The first step is identifying whether someone has cool or warm skin undertones, Bilu says. This is assessed by "draping" their face in different-coloured pieces of fabric and seeing which looks best.</p>
        
            <p>The person can then be categorised as either a Summer, Autumn, Winter or Spring.</p>
        
            <p>Her virtual service involves analysing "really clear photos" of a person's face, showing the shade of their skin and eyes at different ages and in different lights.  </p>
        
            <p>"I cut your little face out of the photo that you've sent. So I don't have your hair in the picture, I don't have your clothes in the picture, it's just your face. And from there, I basically insert that picture into little backgrounds of colours…</p>
        
            <p>"We go back and forth and compare. It's a process of elimination until we come to a conclusion about which colours look best."</p>
        
            <p>While most of her clients enjoy getting confirmation of their "season", Bilu says sometimes people initially reject the palette of colours she recommends they wear.</p>
        
            <p>"I always say to them, 'Just have a think about it, go out to the shops, try on some of the colours, try on some of the makeup, see how you go, you don't have to purchase anything.'</p>
        
            <p>"In every one of those cases, I have had an email back four to six weeks [later] saying, 'You're absolutely right. I was wrong. These colours do look great on me'."</p>
        
            <p>For Summers, Autumns and Springs, this sometimes means saying goodbye to black.</p>
        
            <p>"The colour black is only found in the Winter season, which is heartbreaking for a lot of people as we rely on black very heavily in our wardrobe. But once people get used to it, they start to say, 'Oh yeah, I see that definitely isn't one of my best colours'."</p>

            <p>Over time, Bilu has learned to see straight away whether a colour accentuates a person's dark circles under their eyes or makes skin imperfections more obvious.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't want to see any yellowing of the skin [from the colour you're wearing] ... You know how people often talk about being washed out? It's that kind of look."</p>
        
            <p>By contrast, wearing a flattering colour can enhance a person's skin, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"You should see a very subtle lift to the jawline or any jowls that you might have. You should see a very subtle airbrushing to the skin so if there are any imperfections, it should even them out a bit. Which is part of the reason it's so important to wear the best colours that you can."</p>
        
            <p>While age will not change your "season", it may lead to a hair colour that "doesn't harmonise" with an Autumn and Spring complexion, Bilu says.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are to go grey and you belong to a cool season, it's going to look fabulous. But if you belong to a warm season and you're going grey, obviously [grey hair] is a bit more cool-toned so typically it's not going to harmonise with your season. This is when [you should] really lean in to the advice surrounding your clothing colours as well as your makeup colours."</p>
        
            <p>A person's natural hair colour will be the most flattering to them nine times out of 10, Bilu says, but some of her clients find artificial hair colour can "elevate" their look.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people just look better with some blonde highlights .. to add a bit of contrast. Other people might find that dyeing their hair a warm red colour when they're naturally a brunette is really flattering, too, if they belong to a warmer season."</p>
        
            <p>Shopping smarter and wasting less</p>
        
            <p>In a cost-of-living crisis, most people don't have money to spare on mistake clothing purchases, Bilu says.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people are leaning towards more [of a] capsule wardrobe...  where everything's able to be mixed and matched.</p>
        
            <p>"In the long run, it does save you ... money when you're not wasting [it] on clothes you don't need. And the bonus of that is helping out the environment. As we know, a lot of clothing ends up in landfill so it's great if you can just find things that look good and wear them for years to come.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm searching online for things I just type in a certain colour that I know looks good on me, find the top in that colour and off I go."</p>
        
            <p>A quest to understand why some outfits didn't look "quite right" in the mirror was one of the main reasons Bilu got into colour analysis.</p>
        
            <p>"[I'd think]. 'This is a nice outfit, objectively, but this pair of pants and this top... there's just something not right.' I've since learned that it was because the colours weren't harmonising properly.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, because everything in my wardrobe matches, I can just grab a top, a pair of [trousers] and run out the door in the morning. And I don't have to stop and think about whether they match 'cause they always do."</p>
        
            <p>Funnily enough, Bilu says, her husband also happens to be a Soft Summer.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have a look at our washing line when I hang everything out, it's all very cohesive and matchy-matchy so it's definitely a bonus."</p>
