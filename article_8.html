        <h2>Elizabeth Banks shines in Kiwi medical drama A Mistake</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand film A Mistake sees Elizabeth Banks delivering a pitch-perfect performance as a surgeon facing up to a very bad day at the office.
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand film A Mistake - like so many of our films - shies away from obvious goodies and baddies, though it is a story, in part, about our habit of looking for someone to blame when something goes wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Particularly in the case of medical misadventure.</p>
        
            <p>We meet Elizabeth Taylor - a rare female surgeon in a field dominated by men - as she operates on a young patient.</p>
        
            <p>We've seen this before in countless hospital dramas, but director Christine Jeffs and her cinematographer partner John Toon do a brilliant job following the procedure up to when something goes wrong, and how Elizabeth deals with it.</p>
        
            <p>Critically, it was not just an operation but a training exercise for Elizabeth's junior, Richard - not just in the theatre but dealing with the family afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>There is more than one mistake involved in this complex and engrossing story.</p>
        
            <p>Elizabeth is played by American actress Elizabeth Banks, better known for her comedy work - as an actress in The Hunger Games and Pitch Perfect, latterly directing films like Cocaine Bear.</p>
        
            <p>Actually, I was more reminded of Cate Blanchett as the conductor in TÃ¡r - another strong woman in a man's world, with that slight sense of entitlement that goes with it.</p>
        
            <p>The point being how unsettling a mistake at work can be when it's literally a matter of life and death. Even the word "mistake" hardly cuts it when you're dealing with people whose first experience of major surgery is so harrowing.</p>

            <p>This is brought home in brilliant performances by Rena Owen and Matthew Sunderland as the grieving parents.</p>
        
            <p>The closest thing to a villain in A Mistake is Simon McBurney as Elizabeth's devious boss, more than capable of throwing expendable colleagues under a bus to protect the hospital's reputation.</p>
        
            <p>But A Mistake isn't about pointing the finger at easy culprits, or letting anyone off the hook for that matter. It's a beautifully judged account of the ripple effects of one seemingly minor misjudgement.</p>
        
            <p>It's a beautiful job by director Christine Jeffs - who also adapted Carl Shuker's novel - and a pitch-perfect performance by Elizabeth Banks.</p>
