            <p>The roadie is a classic New Zealand holiday. We load up the car with all the outdoor gear, and hit the road.</p>
        
            <p>But as we increasingly electrify our cars, is the future of the road trip electric?</p>
        
            <p>Richard Edwards is an EV road trip veteran and managing editor of EVs and Beyond, he believes the electric-powered roadie is with us now.</p>

            <p>Range anxiety is largely a thing of the past, he told Afternoons, and EVs are suitable for most road trips, within reason.</p>
        
            <p>“These days the modern EVs that are coming into the country, they're pretty much really capable when it comes to traveling long distances.</p>
        
            <p>“There are these things they potentially can't do as easily as other vehicles. If you're going to load up for three weeks camping with a two-and-a-half-ton boat on the back, then potentially, an EV is not for you yet.</p>
        
            <p>“But for most other purposes, they are a great way of traveling with a huge range of positives.”</p>
        
            <p>The average EV sold in New Zealand today will do between 300 and 400kms on the open road, which is five to six hours of driving, he says.</p>
        
            <p>Over 300kms you will pass plenty of charging stations, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“I'm doing a road trip next week, I'm driving Auckland to Christchurch, and I'm only probably going to charge twice on that entire trip.</p>
        
            <p>“I'll actually pass you know, 30 to 40, great high speed charging options on that trip that I just don't simply won't need to use.”</p>
        
            <p>A longer roadie requires rest breaks anyway, he says, so combine the two.</p>
        
            <p>“I find you probably need to rest more often than the car needs to be charged.”</p>
        
            <p>There are apps such as Plugshare, Power Trip and a Better Route planner that will tell you where charge points are, he says.</p>
        
            <p>If you're carrying a heavy load, allow for more charge stops, he says.</p>
        
            <p>Another tip is to book into hotels or campgrounds that have charge facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"I make a big policy of that when I'm traveling, I always try and stay at a hotel with charging, or a motel with charging, or these campgrounds that do have charging as well.</p>
        
            <p>“And the reasons behind that multiple one, when you're fast charging during the day, you're generally only getting at good efficient speeds up to about 80 percent.</p>
        
            <p>“But if you charge overnight at a hotel, then you're leaving to start the day with 100 percent.</p>
        
            <p>“So you're always going to end up with the best possible range for that day.”</p>
        
            <p>Many booking engines will allow you to add charging points to your search filters, he says.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of an electric road trip is cheaper than petrol, even allowing for planned introduction of road user charges for EVs, he says. And EVs make for a more comfortable ride, he believes.</p>
        
            <p>“One thing I will say, travelling in an electric vehicle I have found is nicer than travelling in a petrol vehicle for a couple of reasons.</p>
        
            <p>“You have less noise; you have less vibration. And I personally feel it’s more relaxed way of traveling. The other aspect too is a lot of these electric vehicles now have modern driver assistance technologies like adaptive cruise and lane keep.”</p>
