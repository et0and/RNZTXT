Do you really need to get your car serviced? How often do you need an oil change? Do you know how to check your tyres?

            <p>While it's tempting to think that your car is going along okay and could skip its service, don't.</p>
        
            <p>"When we see significant motor issues or failures, it's generally because people haven't serviced them," AA mechanic Grant Waters warns in the latest episode of RNZ's Thrift podcast.</p>
        
            <p>
Grant Waters is a southern franchise manager for the Automobile Association. Before that, he ran the vehicle testing workshops for the southern region. And before that, he was a mechanic.

            <p>Sometimes it's up to five years with no oil or filter, he says. There will be almost no oil on the dipstick and "it's literally turned almost like rock inside there".</p>
        
            <p>Follow and listen to Thrift on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, iHeart, YouTube Music or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>
        
            <p>That creates internal engine issues and leads to a failure and a big fat bill.</p>
        
            <p>A service will cover checking brake fluids, transmission levels and replacing the engine oil and filter. A mechanic should check drive belts, accessory belts and another form of mechanical inspection under the car. And then there's the brakes and tyres.</p>
        
            <p>Check your radiator cooling tank </p>
        
            <p>On the side of the tank there is a minimum and a full mark - keep your coolant between those two. The cooling system keeps the car's temperature down, but that can change if the system gets blocked or the coolant fluid is low and leaking.</p>
        
            <p>You can top it up yourself, just make sure you find the right coolant to use - different motors have different metal compounds. And take care near your car's radiator - if it's been running it will be hot. Once it's cooled, remove the cap and fill it up to the full mark. Waters recommends checking the coolant when the seasons change.</p>
        
            <p>While you're there - check your radiator cooling hoses - are they soft, cracked or perished?</p>
        
            <p>"If they do blow out while you're driving, it could cost you," Waters warns.</p>
        
            <p>You should also get a full coolant change every two years or every 60,000 kilometres, and that's more of a job for the workshop.</p>
        
            <p>Oil check </p>
        
            <p>Make sure the car's been turned off for 10-15 minutes, and that all the oil settles to the bottom of the engine. Then pull out the dipstick - there will be two marks of your minimum and a maximum - make sure your level is between the two.</p>
        
            <p>If it's too low, same deal as the coolant. Check your manual or check online to get the right oil and the right viscosity or thickness for your car. Just add a little at a time until the level rises.</p>
        
            <p>You will need a full oil change by the experts at some point, when a mechanic will drain the oil from the bottom and replace the filter. Regular checks can ward off expensive problems, so Waters recommends an oil and filter every 10,000 kilometres, and don't leave it longer than a year, as the oil breaks down over time.</p>
        
            <p>"If it breaks down, it's not going to provide adequate lubrication for your motor. Again, it's something to prevent any long term damage to your vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>The battery </p>
        
            <p>The average lifespan of a car battery is between four and six years. If you look at your battery, you can see how it's tracking.</p>
        
            <p>"Green means it's okay, black's right on the borderline and white will be no good," Waters explains.</p>
        
            <p>You can try to prolong your battery life with a roadtrip. Cars don't really like short stop-start trips around town.</p>
        
            <p>Tyres</p>
        
            <p>Keep them pumped up to the right tyre pressure - you can find that on the inside sill of one of your doors. There are different units of pressure, but when you use a pump at your local service station, you can enter the correct tyre pressure for your car using either a manual or automated gauge. Don't forget to check your spare, too.</p>
        
            <p>It also pays to have the right tyres for the right situation.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have a 4WD type vehicle with big, chunky tyres, obviously that creates more drag on the road, so use more fuel,"</p>
        
            <p>Think about whether you're driving the right car for your needs. Do you need a roof rack? Is your car the right size for you? Or could you get something smaller and more economical?</p>
        
            <p>"It all adds up - so vehicles want to be slippery through the air to create less drag, you'll then go and put something a couple inches above the roof (like roof racks or roof box), which is acting as a bit of a windbreak."</p>
        
            <p>It's not just the size of the car, but the way you drive that could save fuel and money. Maintain good following distances so you're not having a stop and start.</p>
        
            <p>"When you take off from like intersections or traffic lights, don't accelerate hard, just ease on with the accelerator, because the harder you put your foot down, the more fuel it's going to use. And potentially you're not going to get any further, because there's already a car in front of you," Waters says.</p>
        
            <p>If your car is going to be off the road for a few months, Waters recommends putting your vehicle registration on hold. You can do it for a minimum of three months, or up to 12 months. Just don't forget about it and make sure you re-register before the year is up, so your car doesn't have to go through re-compliance.</p>
