            <p>Businesses in central Wellington say despite the packed streets, their stores are practically empty.</p>
        
            <p>You can follow the blog of the hīkoi at Parliament here.</p>
        
            <p>But every business RNZ spoke to supported the cause, with staff saying they weren't bothered about the temporary loss of customers - it was for a good cause.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria Linton, an employee at Bailey Nelson Willis Street, was one who welcomed the disruption.</p>
        
            <p>"I think this is an incredibly important moment in our history, to come together and stand for indigenous sovereignty."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had a personal stake in the matter.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm British, I'm very aware of our colonial history," she said. "I think it's my responsibility to stand with Māori voices and for Māori voices."</p>
        
            <p>Karwen Holland, who runs gift shop What's on Willis, said she was not expecting lots of sales today.</p>
        
            <p>She said everyone had a right to march and it was great to see such a large turnout for the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just part what we do as a country - you have to speak what you want to say," she said. "I just think good them [for going] down to Parliament and say what they have to say."</p>
        
            <p>Holland said she expected business to pick back up tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>On top of the disruption for foot traffic, a number of bus routes have been diverted in the central city.</p>
        
            <p>With so many people in the area, Metlink said buses were detouring away from Courtenay Place, Taranaki Street, and Manners Street.</p>
        
            <p>From midday, the bus interchange at Wellington Station was closed, with Metlink advising people to use the stops further into town.</p>
        
            <p>Bowen Street and Molesworth Streets had closed to traffic too, with buses on routes 2, 4, 22 and 24 detouring down The Terrace.</p>

Susan Cameron says the cause is worth the disruption to business.

            <p>Capricorn Spirit owner Susan Cameron whose business is also on Willis Street, said she had opened up her store's toilet for public use, and the cause was worth the disruption to business.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not worried about sales," she said. "We've got to tell Parliament as a whole country that we do not stand for this."</p>
        
            <p>To those on the hīkoi, she said: "Good on you. Well done. I wish I could be with you, but at this moment I can't, I need to be here, but I support everything you're standing for here."</p>

Sarah Green's business is among the exceptions and is having a busy day.

            <p>Staff at Dixon Street coffee shop Swimsuit had been rushed off their feet, comparing Tuesday's volume to its busiest Saturdays.</p>
        
            <p>Barista Sarah Green said when she saw the queue at the door at 7am, she called in reinforcements.</p>
        
            <p>Five staff were on deck for 320 orders - many of which were for multiple coffees.</p>
        
            <p>Green said she had not had time to make a coffee yet for herself.</p>
        
            <p>Only two biscuits remained in the cabinet. Meanwhile, at its sister store on Lombard Street, there was no cabinet food left at all.</p>
