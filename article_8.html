            <p>Pony Baby is the country-music collab of solo artists Jazmine Mary and Arahi.</p>
        
            <p>The pair met while supporting Reb Fountain at her Hawke's Bay show in late 2022. Soon after that encounter, Arahi put all his possessions in his truck and moved in with Jazmine near the West Auckland coast.</p>
        
            <p>They join Jesse Mulligan in the studio off the back of touring their self-titled debut album.</p>
        
            <p>Jazmine Mary on how they formed Pony Baby:</p>
        
            <p>"[Arahi] said 'One day I might move to Auckland'. And I said 'How's about now?' He showed up with his red ute and his very neatly packed boxes of things.</p>
        
            <p>"It sort of started a bit as a bit of a joke and then it all got very serious."</p>
        
            <p>Jazmine Mary on country music:</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a beautiful thing in country music where you can really lean into those tragic stories and there's a lot of freedom in that, especially writing with someone else. Because no-one knows if it's a story or if it's real so there is a freedom to say a lot of honest things in it."</p>
        
            <p>Jazmine Mary on their matching Pony Baby arm tattoos (based on a drawing by Arahi):</p>
        
            <p>"Baby boy was growing up and I thought 'well, you know, you got to commit to a band'. We'd finished the whole album at home except for one guitar solo. This tattoo appointment was Arahi's birthday so we went and we got the tattoos and then we got home and we recorded the last solo."</p>
        
            <p>Jazmine Mary on their "really wonderful" recent tour of Aotearoa:</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of the only times I've actually got home from tour and not felt exhausted. I felt rested and I didnt get sick, which is actually crazy. There's something really nice about having two people, as well. I don't know. You can bounce off each other."</p>
