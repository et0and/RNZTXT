            <p>For many who received questionable sex education in school, social media has become a safe way to learn more about sex and sexual health.</p>
        
            <p>Sex worker Kayla Jade, sexologist Juliet Allen and podcaster Abbie Chatfield are just some local influencers, or "sexfluencers", posting on platforms like Instagram and Tiktok.</p>
        
            <p>There are also medical practitioners sharing health information, and everyday people speaking about their lived sexual experiences - including those from diverse and minority communities who previously haven't had a platform, said Alexandra James.</p>
        
            <p>She's a research fellow from the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University.</p>
        
            <p>"Digital spaces are very much a go-to for anything that is taboo and even health," said James.</p>
        
            <p>"People feel safe to learn in this online, anonymous environment."</p>
        
            <p>She said many sexfluencers are "relatable", able to break taboos and shame and focus on traditionally absent topics such as female pleasure.</p>
        
            <p>And while the rise of sexfluencers is neither positive nor negative according to James.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it just 'is'."</p>
        
            <p>She believes having the digital literacy to responsibly and critically consume the content is key.</p>
        
            <p>Sexfluencers are playing a role in the "democratisation of sex", said James, meaning, it is accessible to everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"[We are seeing a focus] on pleasure - female pleasure especially, which for so long has been absent or neglected," James said.</p>
        
            <p>"And diversity in general in terms of different types of bodies and abilities."</p>
        
            <p>She said professionals such as pelvic floor physiotherapists bringing attention to female sexual health have also been a positive of sexfluencing.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of these experts are also working to combat other less evidence-backed information."</p>
        
            <p>Kassandra Mourikis, a sex therapist based in Melbourne, said there are conversations about exploring pleasure in diverse ways, for example, bringing kink more into the mainstream.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hearing about different types of relationships... it might be open relationships or relationship anarchy."</p>
        
            <p>She said there are also increasing discussions around masturbation and sex toys.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of that increase is sexual wellness brands showing footage of vibrators and discussing their benefits, dispelling myths."</p>
        
            <p>People from a diverse range of communities sharing their lived experiences has been an encouraging shift, said Mourikis.</p>
        
            <p>"Like fat activists talking about sex and pleasure for people in larger bodies, or black and brown people taking up space in a white-dominated area.</p>
        
            <p>"I really appreciate seeing disabled and neurodivergent and chronically ill people sharing their experience and giving tips and skills for navigating casual sex and dating - in a way that sex educators have totally missed."</p>
        
            <p>Being aware that the influencer space is largely self-regulated, however, is helpful to remember when consuming content, said Mourikis.</p>
        
            <p>"There are risks around people giving advice they are not actually qualified to give."</p>
