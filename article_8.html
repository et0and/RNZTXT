        <h2>Despite star cast, William Tell a 'damp squib'</h2>
        <p>
Despite plenty of thespian firepower, William Tell misses the mark, writes Simon Morris.
</p>
        
            <p>A new movie about legendary Swiss hero William Tell took me back to my yesteryears and a creaky TV series of the same name.</p>
        
            <p>I remember very little of it, apart from having a crush on a pretty actress called Jennifer Jayne, who played Mrs Tell, the forgettable Conrad Phillips as William and an immense actor called Willoughby Goddard, who played the evil Gessler - but I do remember the theme song.</p>
        
            <p>The 'William Tell Overture' is one of the best-known pieces of music there is - with or without the Lone Ranger. It opens a rather less famous opera by Rossini, which in turn was based on a play by the famous German Friedrich Schiller, urged on by mate Goethe, no less.</p>
        
            <p>That rather busy play is the basis of this movie.</p>
        
            <p>Incidentally, the director is Nick Hamm, a man with a considerable theatre reputation, not least as resident director at the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p>
        
            <p>Among the cast of his Tell are Jonathan Pryce, Sir Ben Kingsley, Rafe Spall and Danish star Claes Bang as William himself.</p>
        
            <p>How, we wonder, can all this firepower have led to such a damp squib?</p>
        
            <p>One point of similarity with the early TV version of the tale of Tell is a certain lack of commitment among the actors. I remember the TV cast seemed resigned to the fact they were no great competition to the hit Robin Hood show, on which it was clearly modelled.</p>

            <p>Likewise, for all the story of William Tell's traction in Central Europe, here in the Anglophone world, we're aware that he shot an apple from someone's head and that's about it.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike Robin Hood and King Arthur, who boasted Merry Men and Knights of the Round Table respectively, we have nothing to attach to Tell, apart from an apple.</p>
        
            <p>Which doesn't mean we can't find out. I mean, if the story's strong enough, not knowing what happens next is a good thing, surely?</p>
        
            <p>That's a big if, unfortunately. The story certainly takes its sweet time getting there.</p>
        
            <p>The evil Austrians have conquered the noble Swiss, which means rapacious Tyrolean tax-collectors regularly grab Swiss villagers by the heels and shake vigorously.</p>
        
            <p>As we all know, tax-collecting inevitably leads to raping, murdering and villagers named Baumgarten taking revenge.</p>
        
            <p>Among the local aristocracy, some dukes take the Swiss side, while others toady to the Austrian King - Sir Ben Kingsley with a very distracting eye-patch, possibly for disguise purposes. It's no good, Ben, we see you.</p>
        
            <p>He's got a noble niece called Bertha - possibly the first action heroine of that name in all cinema.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the King's sheriff - I don't think he actually is a sheriff, but you know what I mean - is a rather trimmer Gessler than I remember. He advances the plot - finally - by putting a hat on a pole, then demanding everyone bow to it.</p>
        
            <p>I imagine many of you are saying,'This is all very interesting, I'm sure, but where's William Tell? I thought it was his show'."</p>
        
            <p>Belatedly, in he comes, crossbow in hand, sneering at the hat and refusing to bow, for which the only punishment the law allows, apparently, is to shoot an apple from his son's head.</p>
        
            <p>Of course, William Tell might have worked better in the original German or, later, sung in Italian.</p>
        
            <p>All I can say is that, in English that wobbles between ye-olde, with lots of 'thees' and 'thous', and modern kids TV, it's less convincing.</p>
        
            <p>I do like Bang - in part because of his name, like Rip Torn and Tuppence Middleton - but here, he tries to blast his way through the substandard material, where he should have taken a tip from Conrad Phillips.</p>
        
            <p>"Just keep your head down," Conrad would have told him. "Cash the cheque and two weeks later, everyone will have forgotten you were in it."</p>
        
            <p>Always good advice. I just hope Claes wasn't paid in apples.</p>
