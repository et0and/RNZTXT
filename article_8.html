        <h2>Catching musicians when they're young </h2>
        <p>
We tend to focus on the masters, but every musician has to start somewhere. And that's when Christopher Norton comes to the fore. Video, Audio

            <p>There's a good chance his music is played more often than any other living New Zealand composer, maybe as much as any composer anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>You'll hear his tunes in practice rooms, at grade exams, at children's concerts, in school halls and in the homes of teachers and students around the globe.</p>

            <p>We're talking about the music of Christopher Norton – the master of music for beginners.</p>
        
            <p>Ask any music teacher anywhere about his 'Hungarian Stomp' and they'll know what you're talking about.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand born Christopher Norton is one of the leading writers of music for learners. He's the brains behind the Microjazz series of graded pieces, for which its publishers, Boosey & Hawkes are eternally grateful.</p>
        
            <p>Yet he comes from a family with no musical background – they didn't even have a piano.</p>
        
            <p>Back in New Zealand on holiday, Norton sat down to talk about his work and career with RNZ Concert host, Bryan Crump.</p>

            <p>Norton's father Edwin was a weightlifter and bodybuilder. He represented New Zealand at the then Empire Games in 1950. He was 'Mr New Zealand' in 1948.</p>
        
            <p>However, Norton's parents were churchgoers and that's where the young Christopher started playing the piano and organ, learning church pieces by ear.</p>
        
            <p>Searching for a music teacher, Norton's mother knocked on the door of an Auckland convent. When a nun told her there was no room in the music room, she insisted they listened to her son play.</p>
        
            <p>"To this day I don't know what I was playing because I hadn't had any lessons, but I could play already ... and I played for the nun and she said, 'we'll find a slot'."</p>
        
            <p>By 1975, Norton was one of the best young pianists in the country. He won the National Concerto Competition that year playing Prokofiev's fiendishly difficult Piano Concerto No 1.</p>
        
            <p>That was also about the time a friend roped him into a gospel band, Maranatha.</p>
        
            <p>While Norton didn't end up a Christian rock star, he thinks the band played a key role in opening up his musical imagination to the simple – but profoundly difficult – art of writing a good tune.</p>
        
            <p>Not long after leaving New Zealand to live in the United Kingdom, Norton already had a stack of learners' music in a bottom drawer.</p>
        
            <p>He showed them to a publisher from Boosey & Hawkes who saw their potential, and even came up with a name: 'Microjazz'.</p>
        
            <p>Boosey & Hawkes already owned the rights to Béla Bartók's collection of graded piano pieces, Mikrokosmos. Microjazz was a sort of late-20th-century update.</p>
        
            <p>First published in 1983, Microjazz was initially aimed at pianists. Now the series offers music for most of the major classical instruments, from beginners to Grade 8.</p>
        
            <p>Norton doesn't necessarily set out to write learners' music. He just writes.</p>
        
            <p>Usually someone else decides what level of ability each piece is suited to.</p>
        
            <p>He thinks they work because he's able to conjure up catchy melodies.</p>
        
            <p>"It's as simple as that, and students when they play them, they kind of think 'I know what to do with this'. Because it's not just the tunes side: they also, I think, feel 'I understand the language of this', even a seven-year-old. So teachers, of course, are quite relieved when they find material where students feel like that."</p>
        
            <p>Which means Norton can wander into music shops and find signs saying his piece 'Intercity Stomp' is sold out. We don't think Bartók ever had that problem.</p>
        
            <p>Norton's interests go way beyond pedagogical publishing. He also arranges hymns, produces records and writes music for fully-fledged professionals.</p>
        
            <p>He's just finished a second piano sonata, which will get its premiere in China soon.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really know where it comes from. It's a funny thing composing. It's like people who paint, you just can do it or you can't, and for some reason I can do it."</p>
        
            <p>Norton, now lives in Canada, because "my wife's from there", but he's loving being back in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>After speaking with Bryan Crump, he's off to a reunion of his gospel band Maranatha. If he's within earshot of any music teacher's studio on the way, chances are he'll hear one of his tunes before he gets there.</p>
