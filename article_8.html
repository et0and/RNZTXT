            <p>Every year on Easter Saturday, unwanted bric-a-brac goes under the hammer at a huge Paddy's Market and white elephant sale in Akaroa.</p>
        
            <p>It's run by the Akaroa and Bays Lions Club, which raises thousands of dollars for the local community.</p>
        
            <p>Donated goods collected by Lions volunteers over the past 12 months are displayed in lines across the recreation ground.</p>
        
            <p>"We have two auction trucks that go up the lines and people bid and that's how we sell things," said Lions member and Paddy's Market organiser, Tony Mason.</p>

            <p>From a yacht and old stereos, to saw benches and oddball furniture, it's an interesting cultural display of what people no longer want in their lives.</p>
        
            <p>Erected in the corner of the ground is the make-me-an-offer white elephant marquee. It turns out a good place to be, as the day is showery.</p>
        
            <p>Inside, 25 volunteers frantically load the tables with just about everything you can find in a house.</p>

            <p>Outside, hundreds of punters wait patiently, then at 10am, a bell rings and in they race.</p>
        
            <p>After a few minutes, the tables have been ransacked for coin-priced stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"It's surprising what people buy. There always seems to be something for somebody which is wonderful!" says white elephant co-ordinator Pip Mason.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of the day it's all about supporting people in need, and Tony's hoping the fundraiser will generate at least $14,000.</p>
        
            <p>"This market doesn't have a specific beneficiary. We raise this basically to have enough money in our coffers to be available to anyone who needs it."</p>
