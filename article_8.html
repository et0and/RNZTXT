            <p>Papa Tom's quest for truth, history, and culture has taken him around the world and even out of space, but it was in Aotearoa and the Cook Islands that it all began...</p>
        
            <p>The extraordinary Kiwi Cook Islander, the first person from New Zealand to work for NASA, was one of the grandfathers of traditional vaka sailing in the Pacific, and who revolutionised economic reform in the Cook Islands. He is still little known to generations of young Pacific people and to the New Zealand public in general.</p>
        
            <p>This mini-doco biopic will look at the life of this extraordinary Kiwi-Pacific Islander, who smashed new global frontiers in space and the ocean in a life that spanned so many fields of work.</p>
