            <p>Jack Black tackles Po's final Dragon Warrior adventure with his usual exuberance​, says Simon Morris, but the animation is what carries Kung Fu Panda 4.</p>
        
            <p>Despite having minimal interest in either kung fu or the often overblown animation of Dreamworks Studio, I have fond memories of the original Kung Fu Panda movies - were they 15 years ago?</p>
        
            <p>The story of overweight panda Po who surprised everyone - including himself - to become leader of kung fu heroes the Furious Five, was sweet-natured, funny and particularly well-cast.</p>
        
            <p>The secret of its success, and that of its two sequels, was Jack Black - born to play Po - and a star-studded support cast including Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogan, Jackie Chan and particularly Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Po's best friend and strongest critic.</p>
        
            <p>No Angelina this time, sadly, as Po is told that his days as mere Dragon Warrior are now over, and he's about to be kicked upstairs as Grand Master.</p>
        
            <p>But first Po must pick a new Dragon Warrior, and then start practising that spiritual leadership thing.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Kung Fu Panda 4's villain is warming up in the wings - someone who has the shape-shifting ability to conjure up, and then impersonate, some of Po's past enemies.</p>
        
            <p>Including Ian McShane as Tai Lung, the - we thought - dead leopard.</p>
        
            <p>In Kung Fu Panda world everyone is some sort of animal. And the villainous shape-shifter - Viola Davis, who seems to be getting into a badass villainess rut at the moment - is none other than The Chameleon. What else?</p>
        
            <p>Po needs help from someone who knows about The Chameleon, and that turns out to be a small but feisty fox called Zhen, played by small but feisty Awkwafina.</p>
        
            <p>Chalk, meet cheese, in other words.</p>
        
            <p>So, before devoting his life to inner peace, Po takes off on one more Dragon Warrior adventure, with an unreliable fox at his side.</p>
        
            <p>Expect the pair to get into a bunch of scrapes as they tackle the dreaded The Chameleon and her army of - why not? - listless Komodo dragons.</p>
        
            <p>Jack Black carries the movie with his usual exuberance, but he gets decent support from Awkwafina as a sort of Artful Dodger with possibly ulterior motives.</p>
        
            <p>Certainly, her old friends don't trust her as far as they can throw her. Mind you, you can throw a small fox quite a long way.</p>
        
            <p>It's a series that possibly benefits if you've got a working knowledge of matters kung fu, or indeed Chinese.</p>
        
            <p>The visual style of the series has always been a cut above, and Chinese-American co-director Stephanie Stine keeps that up. In fact the animation is one of the main attractions of Kung Fu Panda 4.</p>
        
            <p>Would I have liked it as much if the competition hadn't been so relentlessly bloody this week? Possibly not, and I have to say I missed the presence of Angelina Jolie and Seth Rogen, who was reduced, as far as I can tell, to one syllable in Kung Fu Panda 4.</p>
        
            <p>But at least no pandas were hurt in the making of this film.</p>
