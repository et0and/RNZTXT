        <h2>How spicy are the noodles dubbed 'too spicy' for Denmark?</h2>
        <p>
Denmark says the instant ramen noodle flavours have worryingly high capsaicin levels. But how much spice are we really talking?

            <p>Denmark has recalled several spicy ramen noodle products by South Korean company Samyang, claiming the capsaicin levels in them could poison consumers.</p>
        
            <p>Capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers - it's the thing that gives you a burning sensation when consumed. Three fiery flavours of Samyang noodles were withdrawn because of it: Buldak 3x Spicy & Hot Chicken, 2x Spicy & Hot Chicken, and Hot Chicken Stew.</p>
        
            <p>However, the products continue to be sold elsewhere around the world, including New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>David Lee, the restaurateur behind some of Auckland's finest eateries (including Gochu and Aigo, which draw from his South Korean heritage), said people's sensitivity to spiciness varied.</p>
        
            <p>"Some foods may be too spicy for some people. Especially as the spiciness level measured by the Scoville scale increases, more people are likely to find it 'too spicy'."</p>
        
            <p>The Scoville scale is a measurement of pungency (spiciness or heat) of chili peppers and other substances.</p>
        
            <p>Samyang noodles get their fiery flavour from Cheongyang red pepper, the hottest red pepper in Korea, and red pepper oil.</p>

            <p>Cheongyang red peppers have an intensity of 10,000 - 23,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU) on average - only marginally more than the average Serrano pepper, which has an SHU of 8000 - 22,000.</p>
        
            <p>But both pale in comparison to the Carolina Reaper, which holds the title of World's Hottest Chili, with a heat kick of 2,200,000 SHU.</p>
        
            <p>Lee said he had noticed his patrons' tolerance for spicy food had changed over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"Nowadays more people enjoy spicy food, and many customers specifically want spicier food. This change may be due to increased access to foods from different cultures."</p>
        
            <p>As New Zealand continued to become more multicultural, so did its diverse and growing culinary scene.</p>
        
            <p>Most New Zealanders ordering Sichuan noodles or an Indian ghost pepper curry had heard the question: 'You want it hot, or Kiwi hot?'</p>
        
            <p>"When determining the spice levels in our menus, we prioritise our customer feedback," Lee said.</p>
        
            <p>"Korean spiciness usually uses ingredients like gochujang or gochugaru, which are made of Korean chili, that give a strong, deep heat.</p>
        
            <p>"In contrast, New Zealand's spiciness tends to be milder and often incorporates chili peppers with fruity notes, as well as tabasco sauce for a tangy heat."</p>
        
            <p>Those not so inclined towards spicy food could increase their tolerance slowly by introducing small amounts of heat into their diet, Lee said.</p>
        
            <p>"Start with milder foods and gradually increase the spiciness level. Eating with milk or yoghurt can help as well."</p>

            <p>Of course, that was only for those who wanted to - not everyone needed to jump straight into Buldak 3x Spicy & Hot Chicken, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While it might be fun and enjoyable for those who enjoy spicy food, it could be unpleasant for those not used to it. I once had a customer strongly complain after eating very spicy Korean fried chicken at my restaurant, even though we clearly marked it as extremely spicy on the menu.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe the packaging of the mentioned Samyang ramen also clearly indicates how spicy it is."</p>
        
            <p>Many fans of Korean instant noodles find the product fiery, but irresistible. Those who wanted to enjoy the flavour without suffering could always use a portion of the sauce packets. But for those who relished the burning sensation, Lee said they could take it one step further.</p>
        
            <p>"My favourite Korean instant noodle is Jin Ramyun. To make it spicier, I add extra Gochugaru, and I eat it with kimchi which is spicy as well. This way, I can enjoy a deeper and more intense spiciness."</p>
