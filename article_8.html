        <p>
Antarctica is melting and it's the biggest environmental story in in the world, Paddy Gower says. Audio

            <p>In a new two-part series, Paddy Gower travelled to Antarctica to witness the consequences of climate change first-hand.</p>
        
            <p>Antarctica is the planet's thermostat, he told RNZ's Afternoons ahead of the show's debut on Three on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>"The sea ice, which is the ice around Antarctica that freezes every year, then defrosts, then freezes, then defrosts, what's been happening is that, as it freezes again, it's getting smaller year after year.</p>
        
            <p>"So the protection around Antarctica is decreasing, and that's incredibly frightening to the scientists, because that actually insulates the main bits of ice in Antarctica."</p>
        
            <p>The worry was that weaker outer protection would expose huge sheets of ice deep in the continent, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet goes, we're talking about four meters sea level rise, according to the New Zealand scientists. And then if the Eastern ice sheet goes, which is even bigger, that would be 10 meters of sea level rise."</p>
        
            <p>Much about Antarctica was unknown to science, and what scientists there saw worried them, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I never realised that Antarctica is like the world's thermostat.</p>
        
            <p>"All of the world's major oceans come off Antarctica in some place. It actually pumps cold water into the world. It's got this crucial role in controlling everything else that is out there."</p>
        
            <p>The documentary asked if we had "awoken a beast", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It looks like we have, we've awoken this beast down there, and changed what Antarctica is doing, and what is that going to mean for the world, and how does it link back to things that we see here, like cyclone Gabriel?"</p>
        
            <p>Meeting the scientists that worked there was inspiring, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's been a gift to me to be around passionate people like that that want to find ways of telling us what's happening to our world and potentially help save us."</p>
