        <h2>Have we got too good at cancelling plans?</h2>
        <p>
Why does it feels so satisfying? And - importantly - is there a polite way to switch from yes to no when end-of-year obligations overwhelm?

            <p>Opinion - I regularly cancel plans. It almost seemed a personal dig when I was tasked with writing about reneging on social obligations.</p>
        
            <p>I'm not alone, though. A scroll through social media (maybe once you've donned those home pants after flaking on the night's party) will indicate enough people find enough joy in eleventh-hour stay-home plans - they're making memes about it.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ spoke to Umbrella Wellbeing clinical psychologist Dougal Sutherland for the low down on abandoning plans, why it feels so good and - importantly - if there's a polite way to switch from yes to no when end-of-year obligations overwhelm.</p>
        
            <p>It does appear more common in recent years, he suggests. It is a trend that likely comes down to the effortless ease - compared to a decade or two earlier - of backing out of an RSVP.</p>
        
            <p>You no longer need to face the person you're bailing on in person or on the phone. It takes a moment to send a message or change a "yes" to a "no" on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>It's easier, says Sutherland. But you can also "remain a bit faceless".</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch-based Sanura Jones, 30, is a serial canceller. She's been off work since a spinal fusion in May, and an earlier surgery in 2018 kept her out of work for a year.</p>
        
            <p>"With me being home a lot [recently], my anxiety has risen," she says.</p>

            <p>"And when it does come time to catch up with my friends, I feel like my life has been put on pause."</p>
        
            <p>There's no judgement from her social circle, and when she does make it out, she has a good time (sometimes leading to grand plans for future catch-ups), but she sees her friends doing "great, magnificent things" while her own life feels "stagnant".</p>
        
            <p>That anxiety builds in the "getting ready" phase - often leading to a last-minute text, a believable excuse and a decision to stay home.</p>
        
            <p>And anyone familiar with having penned that "sorry" message will likely be familiar with the feeling of satisfaction that comes next.</p>
        
            <p>That relief, says Sutherland, could be a little dopamine hit - either from dreading cancelling but finally getting it over with, or simply getting out of leaving the house.</p>
        
            <p>But he warns that dopamine is a "morally neutral substance". That sense of relief doesn't necessarily mean you've done the "right" thing.</p>
        
            <p>"It just means that you've escaped doing something you weren't keen on anyway."</p>

            <p>For Jones, that feeling often comes with a twinge of missing out on gossip and adventure. Plus, she fears "my friends will just stop inviting me to stuff".</p>
        
            <p>The effect your cancelling has on your social circle largely depends on the event's significance, Sutherland says. Ditch a casual weekly group hang for a night in? You're likely fine. Your friend's wedding after RSVPing yes? People will notice.</p>
        
            <p>But if you consistently make plans without following through, "don't be surprised if those social invites over time start to dry up a bit".</p>
        
            <p>An easy fix would be to simply not say yes to things we won't attend, right?</p>
        
            <p>Again, says Sutherland, it comes back to simplicity. As easy as it's become to cancel, it's just as effortless to "click yes" without thinking through.</p>
        
            <p>"We perhaps overcommit, and do it much more spontaneously and impulsively than if we have to look at our diary or calendar and go, 'Oh, can I do that'?"</p>
        
            <p>Jones often commits when she's already out and having a good time. After a few drinks, big plans are made for months down the line.</p>
        
            <p>"Then it comes time, and you're like, 'Oh my God'."</p>
        
            <p>It's a sentiment many will be familiar with as social calendars rapidly fill throughout the holiday season. When that sense of overwhelm hits, is there a polite way to back out?</p>
        
            <p>Ideally, Sutherland says, the best time to back out is before you say yes at all. He suggests being honest about what you can manage before agreeing to engagements.</p>
        
            <p>Still need to make a last-minute cancellation? Make it more personal than an online message, he says.</p>
        
            <p>A phone call and honest explanation, he says, lets you explain and carries a bit of weight.</p>
        
            <p>It can be the difference between, "they rang to [explain] so I understand" and, "they just cancelled over social media. I don't know why they're not coming".</p>
        
            <p>As for little white lie excuses? They can "come back to bite you in the ass".</p>
        
            <p>"If you can't manage [going], just be honest and upfront about that and hope that your relationship is strong enough to weather it," Sutherland says.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have to lie, it sounds like you're scratching around for an excuse. Maybe just go."</p>
