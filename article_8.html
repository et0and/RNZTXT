        <h2>Rural Riders - 'I smile a lot here'</h2>
        <p>
The nationwide mountain bike group Rural Riders gives farmers a chance to spin some yarns and focus on dips and jumps rather than weather and the price of milk. Audio

            <p>Focusing on the bike track instead of the cows for a change is great for wellbeing, according to members of the mountain biking group Rural Riders.</p>
        
            <p>And you don't need anything fancy to ride on to enjoy it, they say.</p>
        
            <p>Dairy farmer Brendan Cairns borrowed his daughter's bike when he first started going out with the New Plymouth branch. </p>
        
            <p>Now with his own bike, he tries to get out as much as he can.</p>
        
            <p>"If you don't have an appointment then you won't get off farm. Because we have to be here at 6 o'clock you have to get your jobs done."</p>
        
            <p>He's one of a bunch coming off the trails at Lake Mangamahoe and standing over a chilly bin of cold beers, chatting to Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>The first Rural Riders group was set up in Taupo in 2019 and now there are a dozen groups around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Following the model of Surfing for Farmers, on bikes rather than boards, the activity is about promoting health and wellbeing in the agriculture industry.</p>
        
            <p>The groups range in size from 10 to 30-plus and the rides take place weekly or fortnightly.
 
Supported by the Rural Support Trust and several commercial sponsors, Rural Riders is winding up another season on the trails.</p>
        
            <p>From physical to mental health, the New Plymouth riders say the biking all helps.</p>
        
            <p>"Dairy farming's not as physical as it used to be," farmer Neil Ryan told Country Life. </p>
        
            <p>"You sit in a tractor and you walk up and down the pit in the cow shed but you don't break into a sweat digging post holes like you used to."</p>
        
            <p>From banter to the serious stuff, they cover many topics while out on the trails.</p>
        
            <p>"You just get stuck in your own little rut and you just keep going so it's good to get out and socialise," Stephen Hancock said.</p>
        
            <p>He hadn't hopped on a bike for 20 years until he was persuaded to come along.</p>
        
            <p>The social aspect is what has Dwayne Hill looking forward to Thursday evenings.</p>
        
            <p>"I smile a lot here."</p>
        
            <p>He works in an office these days in biosecurity for bees but also sees the benefits the rides give to those on farm.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a week when we've talked about the hardship of some of the things people were going through and helped each other out.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think everyone gets that output or that comfortable space ... especially working on a farm (when) you're with your worker and you maybe don't want to open up to them as much as you do some random person that you go riding with once a week."</p>
