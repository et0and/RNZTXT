            <p>Indian Ink Theatre Company first burst onto the New Zealand (and Edinburgh Fringe Festival) stage in 1997 with Krishnan’s Dairy, and after many other productions including The Candlestick Maker, The Pickle King and Mrs Krishnan’s Party, they’re still going strong.</p>
        
            <p>Last year saw the debut of Dirty Work, the latest show from company co-founders Jacob Rajan and Justin Lewis, and it's coming to Hamilton, New Plymouth and Whangarei during May.</p>
        
            <p>Dirty Work is a show where music takes an important part. There’s a different choir involved in the performances at each venue, and although they know what they’ll be singing, they’re told as little as possible about how it will fit into the play.</p>
        
            <p>David Morriss caught up with the show’s music director, Josh Clark.</p>
