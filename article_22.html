        <h2>Zakir Hussain: performing on stage is a happy place</h2>
        <p>
Tabla virtuoso Ustad Zakir Hussain is coming to New Zealand at the end of June as part of the Triveni concert tour. He talks with RNZ Concert's David Morriss. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Ustad Zakir Hussain is regarded as one of the greatest Indian tabla players of his generation. He’s a master of classical Indian styles, and also a keen collaborator with musicians from many different genres.</p>
        
            <p>Zakir Hussain is coming to New Zealand later this month through the Society for Performing Arts, New Zealand (SPANZ) in collaboration with Bhoomija in India, and supported by the High Commission of India. For the Triveni concert tour, he’s joined by violinist Kala Ramnath and Jayanthi Kumaresh, who plays the Saraswati veena.</p>

            <p>‘Triveni’ (trinity) is the mythical site of the convergence of three sacred rivers in India: the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati. The name also represents the meeting of classical music traditions: the northern (Hindustani) violin, and the southern (Carnatic) veena.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert’s David Morriss caught up with Zakir Hussain just after he’d finished performing a concert in Boston, USA – part of a tour of the 2024 Grammy award-winning album As We Speak with Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer and Rakesh Chaurasia.</p>

            <p>Watching videos of the master tabla player and the energy with which he performs, it’s obvious just how much he enjoys being on stage.</p>
        
            <p>But how does he managed to do this night after night?</p>
        
            <p>“Well, I’m on the stage with my best friend, which is my instrument – tabla. Since my childhood, it has never left my side (except for when I’m on my date with my wife!)”</p>
        
            <p>“It’s like being in the best playpen that anyone can ever imagine to be in, with the finest toy that one can have.”</p>
        
            <p>“I look forward to getting on stage and playing. It’s never a job, or work, it’s all great fun and I love the experience that I have...”</p>
        
            <p>“And the icing on the cake is that I get to play with some of the greatest musicians around on this planet, and interact with them and talk music with them. Learn more and more, grow myself as an artist.”</p>
        
            <p>“So yes, it’s a happy place, it’s a happy time for me.”</p>
