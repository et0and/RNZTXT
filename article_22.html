            <p>Congratulations to Vocal FX, the Tawa-based, young person's barbershop a cappella group who were overall champions in the Pop Category at the recent World Choir Games, and also received a gold in the Indigenous Category.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert’s Bryan Crump caught up with Vocal FX director Charlotte Murray in a spare moment between teaching classes on barbershop harmony in Denver, Colorado. They talk about the group (which turns 21 this year) and its recent success, how she got into barbershop in the first place, her own musical influences growing up, and her passion for education.</p>

            <p>Charlotte pays tribute to her mother, Shona Murray, who was Head of Music at Tawa College for over 30 years (including the years Charlotte herself was a student there) and has inspired many students on their musical journeys.</p>
        
            <p>“She’s an amazing musician... In our family, she’s ‘the Queen’. We’re very thankful for her.”</p>

            <p>What is it about singing that makes it bigger than just singing itself, or music making?</p>
        
            <p>“There’s just something about when we sing that we can express emotion in a way that we can’t do in any other way. And also singing in harmony with other people – there’s a connection there between us all when we do that.”</p>
        
            <p>“I think we crave connection, we need it in our lives to feel like we belong and are settled, and I think singing helps connect to ourselves but also connect to others.”</p>
