            <p>Our guest selecting the songs is Romesh Dissanayake, a Sri Lankan and Kor-yo Saram writer, poet and chef from Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington. </p>
        
            <p>His award winning debut novel, When I open the shop, is an ode to the city of Wellington with fresh voices, often under-represented in NZ literature. His protagonist Devendra juggles grief, mounting debt and strange encounters in his small Te Whanganui-a-Tara noodle shop following his mother’s death. </p>
        
            <p>Romesh’s work explores ideas of identity, decolonisation and place. His latest is a new poetry collection called Favourite Flavour House, which featured in AUP New Poets 10. </p>
        
            <p>He speaks to Maggie Tweedie about how music and food etch into his words on the page and continue to be a source of inspiration for him creatively. </p>
