            <p>Made of apricot wood, it looks a little like a recorder and makes one of the most haunting sounds in all music.</p>
        
            <p>Itâ€™s called the duduk, and one of its finest exponents is Armenian musician Arsen Petrosyan.</p>
        
            <p>Arsen spoke from Armenia with Three to Seven host Bryan Crump about this instrument whose sound is described as close to the human voice.</p>
