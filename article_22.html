            <p>Gracie Francis grew up in a team environment.</p>
        
            <p>When her twin sister played the violin, Francis played the piano.</p>
        
            <p>That unspoken communication, when two or more fine performers make music together, is second nature to the Waikato-raised musician.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend Francis will perform her final recital for her Doctorate of the Musical Arts at the Julliard School of Music.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily for us, the wonders of modern technology mean that the recital is taking place not in New York, USA, but at the Auckland School of Music.</p>
        
            <p>On the programme is music by Beethoven, Schumann, Ravel and Gareth Farr, which she'll perform with violinist Lara Hall, and horn player Lucie Krysatis.</p>
        
            <p>Francis says the Julliard School's flexibility made a New Zealand doctoral recital possible. She just has to make sure a verifiable video and recording gets to her examiners in New York.</p>
        
            <p>The pianist had already established herself accompanying choirs and performers around Auckland, prior to her stint at Julliard, but had always had a desire for further study.</p>
        
            <p>She won a Fulbright Scholarship to study in the USA and applied to Julliard not necessarily expecting to get in - but why not aim high?</p>
        
            <p>One of the surprises during her time at the prestigious music school was discovering how many other musicians were collaborators like her. Francis had expected to find a hotbed of single-minded solo performers.</p>
        
            <p>The good news for New Zealand is that while she loved New York, she would rather live in a smaller city.</p>
        
            <p>Francis continues to make music with her twin sister, who is now a violinist based in Hamburg, Germany.
After her doctoral recital in Auckland, she's off to Germany.</p>
        
            <p>We hope by the time she returns to Aotearoa, Gracie will be a Dr Francis.</p>
