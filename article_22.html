            <p>Alexander Hope Watson: it's difficult to know where to start.</p>
        
            <p>Looking at the résumé of this brilliant young musician, composer, mathematician and trampolinist, it seems she may find it difficult to stop.</p>
        
            <p>Did we mention she also flies planes upside down? She's a member of the NZ Aerobatic Club.</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes busy minds can fall down rabbit holes. Such is the case with Hope Watson: her latest project is a work she's written for orchestra and singers based on the writing of Lewis (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) Carroll.</p>
        
            <p>"A Magical Musical Mystery" debuts at The Piano in Christchurch this Saturday 28 September.</p>
        
            <p>It features 32 members of the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra along with solo singers Naomi Ferguson and John Bayne, Helen Grout (solo saxophonist), and conductor Naomi Hnat.</p>
        
            <p>Hope Watson chatted with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump ahead of the performance, talking about her love of logic, Lewis Carroll, whether she has trouble keeping her mind still, and why she likes flying through the air.</p>
        
            <p>She also told listeners what to expect should they like to come down the rabbit hole with her at The Piano this Saturday.</p>
