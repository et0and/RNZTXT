            <p>Miki Magasiva's first feature film, Tinā, is about a lot of things: love, loss, grief, being Samoan, overcoming prejudice, family, friendship, teamwork.</p>
        
            <p>So why did he decide to set the story against the backdrop of The Big Sing, New Zealand's secondary school choir competition?</p>
        
            <p>Talking to RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Magasiva says it all goes back to seeing this video of a mainly Palagi choir singing a very Samoan waiata.</p>
        
            <p>This is a video of the combined Westlake Girls' and Boys' High School choirs, Choralation (their music director at the time was Rowan Johnstone), performing " Maunga e ole Atuolo" at The Big Sing in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>The two Westlake schools are in the heart of the wealthy Auckland suburb of Takapuna.</p>
        
            <p>There wasn't a single Samoan in the choir that year, and you could perhaps expect a proud Samoan Kiwi like Magasiva to take exception to Palagi stealing a precious tāonga.</p>
        
            <p>But such was the care and respect given to the music,the lyrics and the dance, Samoans across Aotearoa and around the world were won over. Magasiva was one of them.</p>
        
            <p>So when he wanted a vehicle to thread the story of a grief-stricken Samoan mother trying to put her life back together after her daughter dies in the Christchurch Earthquake, who becomes a leader not just in the Samoan but also the Palagi world, having her direct a choir from a wealthy school was the perfect fit.</p>
        
            <p>Tinā's heroine, Mareta Percival, is played by Anapela Polata'ivao, who is something of a cultural leader in the real world, being an experienced director as well as actor.</p>
        
            <p>Tinā translates to "mother" in Palagi, and Magasiva says much of Mareta's character is based on his own mother, and other strong Samoan women.</p>
        
            <p>Just quietly, Magasiva hopes the film helps to foster the values of community effort and teamwork, so important in Samoan culture, to a wider audience - especially in this "individualistic age".</p>
        
            <p>It also has a pretty good soundtrack.</p>
