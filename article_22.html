Sounds good playing Bach as well as Blerta.

            <p>There's no shortage of young musicians wanting to take up the saxophone. Thanks to rock and roll, jazz and Lisa Simpson, the sax is one of the coolest instruments on the playlist.</p>
        
            <p>But Michael Jamieson is looking for budding saxophonists willing to embrace their classical side.</p>

            <p>This year's NZ Saxophone Summer School, which Jamieson has been organising since 2016, is coming to the South Island for the first time and takes place in Christchurch on 14-16 February.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the school, Jamieson chatted with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump about enriching New Zealand's classical saxophone scene, how other instrument makers tried to derailÂ Adolphe Sax's 19th century invention, and the top international saxophone player he's bringing out to the school, Japanese master Nobuya Sugawa.</p>
        
            <p>The good news is, once sax school's out, Sugawa will embark on a short tour of Aotearoa with concerts in Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington, so you too can witness his artistry for yourself.</p>
