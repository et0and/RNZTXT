            <p>"I noticed it growing up, obviously, but when you're younger you don't have the historical context, you don't really understand where that bias has come from.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's heartwarming now to see [trumpet] players like Tine [Ting Helseth] and Alison [Balsom] leading the change."</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately the statistics show that we've still got a long way to go in that sector. And I think that the way to lead that change is by having more female teachers and more performers..."</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to break the boundaries, and I'm excited to go to London and meet lots of female brass players."</p>
