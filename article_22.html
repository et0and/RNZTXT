            <p>Sometimes a school assignment can change a life.</p>
        
            <p>Grace Wellik hadn't given much thought to writing music, until a Wellington Girls' College composing assignment came around.</p>
        
            <p>Her teacher thought the result so good, she suggested Wellik write some more.</p>
        
            <p>Before long she'd had her music performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and now she is the Auckland Philharmonia's 2025 Young Composer-in-Residence.</p>
        
            <p>That's already led to one new piece, "Meditations on the Waitemata Harbour", with two further works scheduled for performance later in the year.</p>
        
            <p>The Meditations got its world premiere earlier this month at the end of the Auckland Philharmoniaâ€™s Orchestral Summer School.</p>
        
            <p>Wellik told RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump the piece was inspired by her ferry commute into Auckland University (where she is studying composing) from the city's North Shore.</p>

A great place to meditate.

            <p>Wellik's second piece for the Auckland Philharmonia will be part of its Discovery Concert for schools in May, and later in the year she'll be writing a chamber piece for members of the orchestra.</p>
        
            <p>Evie Dwyer-Leech, the Auckland Philharmonia's Tertiary Projects Executive from its Learning & Participation team, says as the Young Composer-in-Residence, Wellik not only gets the opportunity to write for a full orchestra, but receives mentoring from established composers including Ryan Youens, and the UK-based New Zealander, Lucy Mulgan.</p>
        
            <p>Wellik says she's about halfway through completing her second piece for the orchestra. It hasn't got a title yet, but she's loving the experience of writing for an orchestral canvas.</p>
        
            <p>Turns out she's always had big tunes playing in her head, it just didn't occur to her that she could write them down so others could hear them too - until that high school assignment.</p>
