            <p>Nitin Sawhney is a musician, composer, and producer known for fusing jazz, electronic, orchestral and Indian classical music.</p>
        
            <p>Born in 1964 in London to Indian immigrant parents, his work is deeply influenced by his multicultural upbringing.</p>
        
            <p>Despite his success, Sawhney has remained politically engaged, using his platform to discuss issues such as immigration, racism, and global conflict. His work often reflects his personal experiences growing up in a racially tense Britain, which shaped his perspective and artistic expression.</p>
        
            <p>Nitin has released over a dozen solo albums and has collaborated with artists like Paul McCartney, Sting, Jeff Beck, Anoushka Shankar, and Norah Jones.</p>
