            <p>English singer-songwriter Beth Orton brings her otherworldly sound to Aotearoa this month for two special shows.</p>
        
            <p>Best known for '90s hits like 'She Cries Your Name' and 'Stolen Car', Orton's sound has been shapeshifting for over 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>Critics described her latest album Weather Alive – which Orton will perform songs from here –as the BRIT Award-winner's best work to date.</p>

            <p>Beth Orton performs at Auckland's Powerstation on 20 April and Wellington's St James Theatre on 21 April.</p>
        
            <p>On singing for others:</p>
        
            <p>"I just really enjoy and get behind the kind of openness and lack of … this is deeply sincere and possibly slightly embarrassing sometimes but you know, fair play, I mean every word of it. So I just sort of enjoy inhabiting those moments."</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>On the "true" creativity of the London music community:</p>
        
            <p>"There's like a real lack of pretension in what's happening right now in London, this is very true musical endeavor of making beautiful music is at the forefront, rather than it being a scene. [You can see the] meetings of minds and hearts of the people who are coming together right now, I think. It's [about] a similar intention and a similar desire to create rather than hanging on a genre of any sort or a movement or a scene."</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>On her precious old piano from Camden Market:</p>
        
            <p>"The guy in the shop was like 'you don't want that one. That's the granny piano'. I did buy it and he was a lovely man. He's an interesting guy. He used to literally get pianos and take them to Mozambique or just take them to much farther-flung places in Africa, places where people didn't have pianos. He'd get pianos to places in the world where otherwise people wouldn't have them. A lot of his pianos were old-school pianos. This one was a bit beaten up and I just thought it had the most beautiful sound. That was the one I wanted and I got it home. I had it tidied up - which I sort of regretted for a minute, then it settled and it was fine."</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>On waking up to the "gift" and craft of songwriting:</p>
        
            <p>"My curiosity is just piqued. I'm like 'Oh, hang on a minute'. It's like I woke up and remembered what it was I could do or found out I could do what it is I do. I just hadn't really tweaked. I always used to have this sort of magical thinking like it had to come out of this ethereal place. Now it's like 'No, I can actually dig and find this and craft this. I do feel particularly excited to have woken up and to be like 'What a gift, what a wonderful thing that life has given me, which is the ability to put so much of what I don't know where to put otherwise into music."</p>
