            <p>Speaking to RNZ Concert Host Bryan Crump, the orchestra's chief executive Diana Weir says performing Strauss's musical depiction of himself has long been a dream of the Philharmonia's principal conductor, Giordano Bellincampi.</p>
        
            <p>Other epic works coming up in 2025 include Ravel's sumptuous ballet "Daphnis and Chloe", Mahler's massive third symphony (when the orchestra teams up with students from Australia's National Academy of Music), and a night of film music by the screen composer Hans Zimmer.</p>
        
            <p>Visiting soloists include the British pianist Benjamin Grosvenor, and Canadian violin genius James Ehnes, who will stay with the Philharmonia for a two-week residency.</p>
        
            <p>There'll be crossover concerts with New Zealand singer-songwriters Bic Runga and Ria Hall, and next year's Opera in Concert will be Verdi's heartbreaking "La Traviata".</p>
