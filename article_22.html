            <p>Dieterich (Diderich) Buxtehude (1637-1707) was Danish organist and composer, who, in his post at St Mary's Church in Lübeck, Germany, became one of the leading organists of his generation and the most influential on the organists who followed including JS Bach.</p>
        
            <p>This Prelude is a toccata-like work with fugal sections included.</p>

            <p>The date of composition of this work is uncertain. It's thought it probably comes from Bach's period in Weimar as a young man.</p>
        
            <p>It's one of Bach's organ masterpieces. The toccata itself is on a monumental scale with bold harmonic moves and containing two extensive solos for the pedals.</p>

            <p>Josef Rheinberger (1839-1901) was a child prodigy who became Professor of Music at the Munich Conservatory at the age of 21.</p>
        
            <p>He's most remembered now for his organ works. This sonata is one of 20 he wrote for the instrument.</p>
        
            <p>Rather than being in conventional sonata form, it can be viewed as a Prelude and Fugue with an Adagio interlude between them.</p>
