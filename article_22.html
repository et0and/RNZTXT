            <p>American soul singer Teddy Swims may have blown up on the charts, but he knows New Zealand loved him first. </p>
        
            <p>His breakout song, ‘Lose Control’, was number 1 on the radio here for 11 weeks and reached the top 10 across Europe, the US and UK, taking with it his debut album I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1).

It’s a bittersweet success, given the album was written during a relationship breakdown, Swims tells Charlotte Ryan.</p>
        
            <p>“It wasn't until after the album came out, and all these things started coming to fruition, I ... started hearing my album from a whole new standpoint.</p>
        
            <p>“Like somehow my heart knew this the whole time, and it was trying to tell me this and I wasn't listening to myself, even though I was writing songs about what I needed to do.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s quite strange how life, or art, can just give you so much therapy in life and how your consciousness can speak openly to you through music and can heal you in a lot of ways. And this album continues to heal me.”</p>
        
            <p>Although it was a painful episode in his life, Swims says it was something he had to go through.</p>
        
            <p>“I think all that pain was necessary, you know... and it wasn't in vain at all. And so, I'm very grateful for everything that has happened in my life.”</p>
        
            <p>Performing the songs live is cathartic, he tells Music 101.</p>
        
            <p>“It's kind of painful to sing some of that stuff sometimes, but I think in the best way.</p>
        
            <p>"I always say it's a good day to cry, you know, and it's a good day to just let it out and get it all out and remind yourself of where you come from and what happened and [be] accepting of that at all times.”</p>
        
            <p>He’s always been a heart-on-sleeve person, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“I was an emotional little boy. You know, a cry baby, for sure.</p>
        
            <p>“I'm still the same emotional toddler I was when I was probably four years old. But I'm grateful to be sensitive, man. I was lucky to have people in my life that let me be sensitive, and let me love. Nothing's ever changed in my heart - I mean what I say.”</p>
        
            <p>Without the power of social media, he wouldn’t be where he is today, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“I know a lot of people will be like, I'm an artist, not an entertainer, and I think it's very important to be both in this climate, because you get to control the narrative and people get to decide. It was at one point, with music especially, that the only people that were getting seen or heard were the people that were getting seen or heard. </p>
        
            <p>“And now everybody's got this open opportunity, this shot, and this chance [with social media]. I get to live my life fully as a human being and ... it's not like the Michael Jacksons of the world [where] you only heard about their life based off of what was shown to you and I'm very lucky that I get to walk around like a glass house and share every moment of my life that I want to... just to be regular and be a normal guy with issues, and be seen and heard and felt that way.”</p>
        
            <p> Being directly accessible to his fans, and being so honest about his life, makes him relatable, he says.</p>
        
            <p> “I'm an insecure person and I get to wear all those insecurities and I don't have to be perfect - and it's great.”</p>
