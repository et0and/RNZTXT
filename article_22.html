            <p>Ashley Brown is saying goodbye to NZTrio, but he hasn't bid farewell to all music just yet.</p>
        
            <p>Brown has been the cellist with the ensemble - which he helped to found - since its beginning in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>Now, 23 years later, he feels it's the right time to move on, although as Section Principal of the Auckland Philharmonia cellos, he'll remain a big part of the New Zealand classical music scene.</p>
        
            <p>Brown looked back on his time in NZTrio with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, starting with the decision to set it up with fellow Auckland Philharmonia player, violinist Justine Cormack.</p>
        
            <p>They were joined by pianist Sarah Watkins, then recently back from living in the United States.</p>

            <p>Right from the start, Brown says, the group wanted to play work by fellow New Zealanders, and he shared a selection of NZTrio recordings of mostly Kiwi composers during his conversation with Crump.</p>
        
            <p>They included works by Gareth Farr, Alex Taylor, and Brown's partner in life, Victoria Kelly.</p>
        
            <p>He also talked about the search for a new violinist and pianist when Cormack and Watkins themselves moved on - a search which eventually lead to the current line-up of Brown, violinist Amalia Hall and pianist Somi Kim.</p>

            <p>Brown's last performance with NZTrio will be next month, but he'll continue leading the Auckland Philharmonia cellos.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, you can see Brown performing with the trio this month in Hamilton, in Auckland (including a gig at the Auckland Arts Festival) and at Womad Aotearoa where NZTrio will join forces with the indie pop group, The Veils.</p>
        
            <p>Brown's last public performance with NZTrio will be at the Wanaka Festival of Colour in early April.</p>
