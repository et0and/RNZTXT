            <p>This Southern Stars tour, presented by Choirs Aotearoa, took the New Zealand Secondary Student’s Choir all around the South Island, where they gave concerts in Nelson, Blenheim, Wanaka, Queenstown, and Christchurch. RNZ recorded the choir’s Christchurch performance at St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral. Sue Densem was the choir’s director, and Brent Stewart was both assistant director and piano accompanist.

            <p>The New Zealand Secondary Student’s Choir is made up of singers aged 13 to 18 years. And the 2021-2022 group of national representatives were chosen from 35 schools all over the country. The Choir was set up to give talented young singers the opportunity to learn from some of Aotearoa’s most experienced vocal coaches and conductors. And to help students realise their potential in music and singing. Many find it a life-changing experience that sparks them to join other choirs , or study voice at university. The Choir also gives students experience singing with other talented singers both in New Zealand and overseas.
