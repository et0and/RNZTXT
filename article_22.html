        <p>
In a performance full of fun songs, beautiful orchestrations, and infectious beats, Troy Kingi and the¬†Auckland Philharmonia perform Kingi's psychedelic-soul album, Shake That Skinny Ass All The Way To Zygertron.
</p>
        
            <p>A slightly surreal experience, this concert is full of great tunes, fun songs, beautiful orchestrations and infectious beats.</p>

            <p>Also Sprach Zarathustra - Sunrise & Aquarii B</p>
        
            <p>When the APO offered to play this as an intro I was all in, I couldn‚Äôt have thought of a more fitting introduction to a 70s space odyssey than Also Sprach Zarathustra.</p>
        
            <p>I tried pairing it with the only thing in my arsenal (I felt) that had the same galactic scope and wizardry and that was the ever buzzy Aquarii B.</p>

            <p>Luna Steppa</p>
        
            <p>For those that don‚Äôt know, this song is about our protagonist Cosmo Colombus aka The Golden Foot aka Golden Taurus, living on a moon (one of 33) in the 5th dimension and inside the luna carved face of Michael Jackson. ‚úåüèΩ</p>

            <p>Time Lapsium Gangtasium</p>
        
            <p>This was my attempt to do a Pusherman-type vibe (Curtis Mayfield)¬†and this song talks of time travelling portals with varying parallel universes.</p>

            <p>Golden Taurus</p>
        
            <p>Probably my favourite song on the album, it was my effort at trying to write one of the slowest soul songs in NZ. The segue at the end, me and Mara conjured up delirious in the studio at about 4am on the final mixing night.</p>

            <p>Flat Earth Syndrome</p>
        
            <p>This song is all about conspiracies.</p>
        
            <p>The intro to this song I think was inspired by Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs ‚ÄòDamn‚Äô record (the last album I ever heard with 2 working ears). He had all those cool a capella intros to his songs, I just wanted a little piece of the action.</p>

            <p>Gold Shoes</p>
        
            <p>My whole thing about this song was to have no snare drum, let it drive on the toms with a tribal-like rumble. Probably the coolest lyrics on the Zygertron album.</p>

            <p>Salina Fisher: Galaxy</p>
        
            <p>An orchestral interlude in the concert. This is a beautiful piece by NZ composer Salina Fisher and fits right in with the cosmic theme of the concert.¬†</p>

            <p>9 Million Light Years</p>
        
            <p>This was my favourite song to play with the APO. Their accompaniment was like a nice warm blanket making my ordinary humdrum love song sound and feel like a million bucks.</p>

            <p>Aztechknowledgey</p>
        
            <p>Always a crowd favourite, I never get sick of playing it - and you only get a handful of chances to play it with an orchestra if you‚Äôre lucky.</p>

            <p>Eyes at 80 Fathoms</p>
        
            <p>Nice funky dance track about a hidden portal in Matauri bay that only reveals itself at midnight on a full moon. Spoooky</p>

            <p>Tur≈´kanƒ´nƒ´</p>
        
            <p>This one felt like the song of the night, and being Matariki it was a fitting song to celebrate our indigenousness and mana Ma≈çri motuhake.</p>

            <p>Predetermined Machine</p>
        
            <p>The second song that me and Mara TK ever jammed on (after cold steel) - the theme is straight out of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, AI robots taking over.¬†</p>

            <p>Grandma's Rocket Poem</p>
        
            <p>This is always my closing song, every show - it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm known for and my audience know every word. What a pleasure to play this with the APO.</p>

            <p>All Your Ships Have Sailed</p>
        
            <p>Always have an encore up ya sleeve, and this one seems to go down a treat.¬†</p>
