Lyell Cresswell's posthumously published autobiography is a wonderfully quirky read. RNZ Concert's David Morriss talks with one of the book's editors, Scilla Askew, about the composer and his music. Audio

            <p>This year is the 80th birthday of one of New Zealand’s most individual composers, though sadly Lyell Cresswell is no longer with us, having died in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra will be marking this anniversary with a concert including the first performance of Cresswell’s Third Piano Concerto.</p>
        
            <p>And Te Herenga Waka Victoria University Press will shortly be releasing his intriguingly-titled autobiography, Divagations, Doodlings and Downright Lies.</p>
        
            <p>Scilla Askew, who edited the book with Dame Gillian Whitehead, talks with RNZ Concert's David Morriss about Lyell Cresswell and his musical legacy.</p>
