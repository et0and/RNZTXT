            <p>It's February 14th, and we here at RNZ Concert's Three to Seven are looking for a Valentine's Day story.</p>
        
            <p>Enter rising singing stars Alfred-Fonoti-Fuimaono and Sarah Mileham, who are preparing to share the stage in a Hamilton Arts Festival production of Donizetti's "The Elixir of Love".</p>
        
            <p>Donizetti wrote the comic opera, which is based partly on the story of Tristan and Isolde and the magic love potion that got them into trouble.</p>
        
            <p>Donizetti's version predates Wagner's version, and takes itself a lot less seriously. To underline that, director Jacqueline Coats has set it in a Kiwi fish and chip shop.</p>
        
            <p>While Mileham and Fonoti-Fuimaono's characters may not end up happily ever after on stage, they're sure to be together after the show - the two have been a real life couple since meeting as singing students.</p>

            <p>Fonoti-Fuimaono is one of the supremely talented family of Samoan-Kiwi singers from Hawkes Bay, while Mileham was the winner of last year's Nicolas Tarling Aria Competition.</p>

            <p>They told RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump they're happy to share each other's lives as well as the stage. In fact, they believe sharing the unusual job of singing opera for a living is a big plus in their relationship.</p>
        
            <p>Given the date, Crump wants to know of Fonoti-Fuimaono has purchased a Valentine's gift for his partner.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes," she laughs - a new cuddly toy.</p>
        
            <p>Keep up the good work, Alfred.</p>
