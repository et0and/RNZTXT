            <p>Although Jane Austen is well-known for her literary brilliance, the significance of music in her life is less familiar to many.</p>
        
            <p>Dr. Kirstine Moffat, Associate Professor in the English Programme at the University of Waikato, is a recognised expert in the field.</p>
        
            <p>Moffat is dedicated to both teaching and research, and was honoured with the Ako Aotearoa National Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Her lifelong passion for Jane Austen's novels, along with the author's love of music, is a central theme in many of her academic talks.</p>
        
            <p>In her talks, Dr. Moffat frequently performs selections from Jane Austen's music books on the piano, including well-known dance tunes, traditional songs, and compositions by Joseph Haydn, Ignace Pleyel, Johann Baptist Cramer, and the Duchess of Devonshire.</p>
        
            <p>Moffat speaks with RNZ Concert's Clarissa Dunn on Three to Seven about the role of music in Austen’s life and books.</p>
