            <p>Andrew brings extraordinary experience from an interesting and diverse broadcasting career in Australia and Europe. Combined with his life-long passion for classical music, we know he’ll be a wonderful addition to the RNZ Concert team.

“I’ve visited New Zealand many times and I’m looking forward to settling in and being part of the team at RNZ Concert, sharing my love of classical music with the station’s listeners,” Clark said.

Andrew Clark has already had a remarkable career as a journalist, editor, producer and presenter.
 
His love of classical music began as a child in Scotland when he learned trumpet, trombone and euphonium and completed grade eight. He moved into languages at University to train as an interpreter. He speaks French, German and Spanish, which has proven extremely useful for classical music presentation.</p>
        
            <p>After graduating he moved to Europe, working as an English teacher and radio newsreader. He went on to present a children’s television show in Lithuania, and filed stories for CNN’s World Report, before joining the BBC. In his thirties he became the youngest ever news editor on BBC World.
 
Before moving to Australia 14 years ago, he helped to launch Al-Jazeera English in Asia and then moved to public broadcaster SBS, where he rose to the position of Executive Producer of SBS News.
 
After 25 years in news, Andrew left SBS in 2020, keen to focus his media talents on another passion, classical music. He began presenting Breakfast and Drive on Australia’s oldest FM radio station 2MBS Fine Music Sydney. He had already been hosting specialty shows on the station for more than a decade as well as a short stint presenting for sister station 4MBS in Brisbane.
 
Andrew comes to New Zealand to present RNZ Concert Mornings, bringing together his passion for media, classical music and the love of experiencing different countries and cultures.</p>
        
            <p>He replaces Siliga Sani Muliaumaseali'i who announced in June that he will return to his international singing career later this year, with RNZ’s thanks for a wonderful year on air.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Clark will hosting Mornings from, 6–10am Monday to Thursday on RNZ Concert from November, with Carey McDonald continuing to host the show on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>
