            <p>Mime Yamahiro Brinkmann is a virtuoso baroque cellist, soloist, and chamber musician – she's been described by Strad Magazine as ‘a musician who captivates audiences with a musicality that flows as naturally as breathing’.</p>
        
            <p>She’s in New Zealand for a series of concerts this Friday and Saturday with NZ Barok, featuring three contrasting baroque cello concertos.</p>
        
            <p>Mime Brinkmann studied the modern cello growing up in Japan, but changed her focus to the earlier version of the instrument after hearing a French baroque orchestra rehearsing at a Tokyo university music school.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert’s David Morriss spoke with Mime Brinkmann what about the differences between the baroque and modern cello, and what captivated her about the period instrument sound.</p>
        
            <p>"The soundscape was [like] nothing I had ever heard before, especially the colour of gut strings - that actually caught me really hard."</p>
        
            <p>"I thought, 'this is something I really want to do'... so I did."</p>
