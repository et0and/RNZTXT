            <p>This is the lesser-heard Violin Sonata by Maurice Ravel  – the 'Posthumous Sonata', published after his death but written as a student when he was in Gabriel Fauré’s composition class at the Paris Conservatory.</p>
        
            <p>It’s a shortish work in one movement. Actually it’s believed that Ravel intended it to be the first of a multi-movement sonata but he never completed that.</p>

            <p>This work has remained one of Fauré’s most loved pieces and it made an immediate impact when it was first heard in 1876. It marked a turning point in his career.</p>
        
            <p>The older composer Camille Saint-Saëns was full of praise: “This sonata has everything that will seduce the gourmet: novel forms, exquisite modulations, uncommon tone colours, the use of the most unexpected rhythms. And hovering above all this is a magic which envelops the work and brings the masses of ordinary listeners to accept the wildest audacities as something perfectly natural.”</p>
        
            <p>The work has four movements.</p>

            <p>Brahms wrote this sonata (the third of his three) between 1886 and 1888 – it’s one of his later works – all of his symphonies and concertos are behind him and there are only a few works still to come. He’s at the height of his compositional powers and this work is tight and muscular, but also – especially in the Adagio second movement – lyrical and tender. He dedicated it to his friend and colleague Hans von Bülow.</p>
