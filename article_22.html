            <p>Opera NZ is running a forum aimed at gathering budding opera creators into one room for a week and seeing what magic may transpire.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Opera Participation Officer, Frances Moore, says the forum aims to create a space for story-telling creatives in Aotearoa to consider the essential steps required before starting new opera projects.</p>
        
            <p>It's aimed at both composers and librettists.</p>

            <p>Speaking to RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Moore says the forum is aimed more at those who already have an idea for a music-based drama in embryonic form, but she wants to spread the net as wide as possible.</p>
        
            <p>Also participating are two of the more successful creatives in UK opera at the moment. Jonathan Dove and Alasdair Middleton are composer and librettist respectively of the Jane Austen-inspired Mansfield Park, which NZ Opera is performing in April.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone interested in the New Opera Forum is welcome to get in touch with expressions of interest by emailing Frances Moore at participation@nzopera.co.nz</p>
