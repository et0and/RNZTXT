            <p>Organisers for the country's biggest one-day music festival admit some perseverance was needed in securing this year's headliners.</p>
        
            <p>A crowd of about 35,000 will flock to Christchurch's Hagley Park on Saturday for Electric Avenue, a festival which continues to make annual gains, despite the fragmented and unpredictable challenges served up by running a large-scale music event on these shores.</p>
        
            <p>The festival is nearing a decade-long tenure of operations after it first landed in the Garden City back in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Nine years on, they've managed to secure the services of one of the world's biggest festival heavyweights.</p>
        
            <p>British electronica veterans the Chemical Brothers will headline this year's festival, marking their first visit to New Zealand in more than a decade as they promote their tenth studio album For That Beautiful Feeling.</p>
        
            <p>Although the six time-Grammy winners have twice played closing Boiler Room slots at the old Big Day Out (2000 and 2005) and a handful of stand-alone shows over the years, Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons are a significant booking victory for Electric Avenue organisers, given the duo's reputation of producing astonishing live performances.</p>
        
            <p>Electric Avenue organiser Callam Mitchell said he had been pursuing the act for a few years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty big coup for us," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one I've been personally working on for about three years and for one reason or another it just couldn't happen, or the date got pushed back.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when the war kicked off in Ukraine, rising fuel prices put things on the backburner for another year."</p>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, Mitchell concedes their headliners absorbed a significant amount of the budget.</p>
        
            <p>"The timing has worked really well this year, given their album release a few months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Their live show is pretty amazing, their visual show, their laser show, the giant robots that come out, it will be pretty special and a lot of people here would never have seen anything like it."</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, homegrown favourites Six60, Shapeshifter and L.A.B. will take to the main stages, alongside a further 30 local and international acts.</p>
        
            <p>It will mark a final hurrah behind the kit for departing Six60 drummer Eli Paewai, ending a 16 year stint which has seen the band become a Kiwi institution.</p>

            <p>It is set to be a massive cash cow for the Christchurch economy, with about half of revellers from outside the region. The festival equates to about $6 million visitor spending.</p>
        
            <p>But the festival hasn't been without its problems previously.</p>
        
            <p>Gone are the RFID wristbands of 2023 which caused some headaches for patrons and the site has been extended so the congestion of last year is avoided.</p>
        
            <p>"You're always learning I guess, you solve a set of issues one year and the next year you encounter a new set," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've put all our food vendors into a dedicated food vendor village, so getting food is just easier to navigate.</p>
        
            <p>"Increasing toilet block numbers, increasing bar capacity, a lot of it is just trying to do those basics right.</p>
        
            <p>"We're fairly confident we've got it right."</p>
