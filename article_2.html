            <p>It was a moment if déjà vu for Adrian Solomon-Maere when he stepped under the arch of Christchurch's Bridge of Remembrance.</p>
        
            <p>Last Wednesday, Ōtautahi had their Hīkoi mō te Tiriti activation to oppose ACT's Treaty Principles Bill. However, Solomon-Maere has stood in the same place before while protesting the 'Treaty of Fraud'.</p>
        
            <p>"I come back from Australia after [more than] 35 years and it's still happening. We're still protesting under the Bridge of Remembrance. It's unreal."</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty of Fraud protest saw many ascend the ANZAC memorial bridge in solidarity with those at Bastion Point during the late 1970's early 1980's movement.</p>
        
            <p>This time, Solomon-Maere looked through the arch towards the crowd of a thousand plus and began to well up.</p>
        
            <p>The 'wairua' of the crowd took him to another place and left him speechless.</p>
        
            <p>"I can feel it, I don't have to say anything... beautiful.</p>
        
            <p>"It shows that Māori can be noticed."</p>
        
            <p>Solomon-Maere isn't just a man with a growing passion for te ao Māori, he's reconnecting with his heritage after being forced to start a new life from scratch.</p>
        
            <p>That's because he's a 501 deportee.</p>
        
            <p>"I made one little mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"I spent three years in an Australian immigration detention [facility], two-and-a-half years on Christmas Island."</p>
        
            <p>The Detention Centre on the island - which is closer to Indonesia than Australia - has a history of opening and closing after many protests and being deemed 'inadequate' and 'too isolated' by the Australia Human Rights Commission. It has now been shut since 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Solomon-Maere said he was the oldest detainee during his time there.</p>
        
            <p>He still remembers his first interview with Mihingarangi Forbes in 2019 who was working for The Hui at the time.</p>
        
            <p>It was an interview he couldn't finish because he was struck by the sudden "forever" change.</p>
        
            <p>Since then he has featured on many news sites - domestic and international - as well as being involved with many seminars on 501 deportees.</p>
        
            <p>But it has been four years since being cut off from Australia, and he still misses it dearly.</p>
        
            <p>A father and a koro - he can't "just hop on a plane" to see his children and grandchildren because of the mistake he made.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm used to home now; I finally think I'm home. It's taken me a while though."</p>
        
            <p>It's a void he cannot fill, and striving towards connection adds many layers of emotions, so for him to see Māori come together puts the band-aid over his struggles.</p>
        
            <p>"When I see things like [the activation], I feel at home."</p>
        
            <p>The Kahungunu descendant now resides in Ōtautahi and finds solace in seeing tamariki take charge in historical events such as the hīkoi to Parliament, which concluded on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good for our tamariki," he said.</p>
