            <p>A man receiving treatment from paramedics in Hamilton became "aggressive and threatening" and managed to hijack an ambulance from the crew who had fled the scene, before then crashing it into a nearby building.</p>
        
            <p>The incident began shortly after 12.30pm in Ulster St in the Hamilton suburb of Whitiora where a man who was receiving treatment from paramedics was blocking their access and refusing to let them leave, a police spokeswoman said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The man then got into the driver's seat and crashed the ambulance into a building a short distance away," the spokeswoman said.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrested the man a short time later without incident, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old is set to appear in the Hamilton District Court tomorrow charged with unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John confirmed one of its ambulances was involved in an incident in Hamilton at around 12:30pm today.</p>
        
            <p>"Two ambulance officers were called to an address in Hamilton to attend to a patient. The patient became aggressive and threatening towards the ambulance crew," a St John spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"While the ambulance officers fled the scene on foot to a safe location, the patient gained access to the ambulance and crashed it into a nearby building."</p>
        
            <p>St John said the ambulance has been taken off the road for repairs, and replaced with another vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"The ambulance officers involved are receiving support. Hato Hone St John takes the safety and well-being of its people very seriously and any assault or abuse against ambulance staff is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated under any circumstance," a St John spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John is supporting police with their investigation.</p>
