            <p>New Zealand is one of three countries that is calling for urgent international efforts for a "sustainable ceasefire" in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has joined his counterparts in Australia and Canada in saying: "The price of defeating Hamas cannot be the continuous suffering of all Palestinian civilians."</p>
        
            <p>They say they are alarmed at the "diminishing safe space" for civilians in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>"Australia, Canada, and New Zealand mourn every Israeli and Palestinian innocent life which has been lost in this conflict and express our condolences to all families and communities affected by the violence."</p>
        
            <p>... More to come </p>
