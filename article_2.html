            <p>A worker has been winched out by crane after becoming trapped under a steel pole at a major Auckland Council infrastructure project.</p>
        
            <p>More than a dozen fire fighters and several police and ambulance staff are on the scene at the Central Interceptor site on Haverstock Rd in Sandringham.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it happened in a 6-7m deep hole.</p>
        
            <p>The man was put on a stretcher and winched out by a crane on the site accompanied by a rescue officer just before 10am.</p>
        
            <p>He has been taken to hospital by ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>The Central Interceptor is a new sewage system for Auckland and a huge tunnel is being bored under parts of the city.</p>
        
            <p>The project is the answer to decades of sewage spewing from old pipes every time it rains.</p>
        
            <p>Once up and running Central Interceptor will prevent the majority of wastewater overflows, when the volume of stormwater exceeds the pipes' capacity, resulting in wastewater overflowing into creeks and streams and contaminating them.</p>
