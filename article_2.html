            <p>Almost $50 million of repairs to a rutted expressway between Auckland and Hamilton are mired in delays and question marks.</p>
        
            <p>The latest low point in the decade-long saga of the section of State Highway 1 outside Ngāruawāhia, has come with the completion date suddenly shooting out by another 15 months.</p>
        
            <p>Consternation is revealed in newly released project management board minutes from Waka Kotahi.</p>
        
            <p>"BLANK [name redacted] queries how within a month of setting baseline programme, the update moves completion date out by 15 months," August minutes state.</p>
        
            <p>The completion date has blown out from late 2023, to mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>"No way! No, well I didn't know that," said Waikato district councillor Janet Gibb when told of the delay by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"That surprises me... I thought it was rectified and I thought it was close to being finished.</p>
        
            <p>"I just feel really sorry, especially as summer's drawing closer, for the people travelling in cars that are going along and all of a sudden they're held up for a while.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be crawling along."</p>

            <p>Locals knew how to get around the back roads but still looked askance at a repair job that was costing so much time and money, Gibb said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite years of stopgap fixes up until 2018 on the section of road, three years of investigations from 2019-22, and now 14 months of repairs since October 2022, major problems persist, while the basic approach and designs of repairs were still in limbo even just a few weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>That leaves locals and holidayers facing at least another summer of disruption on one of the country's busiest sections of highway, though there will be a short pause in roadworks over the Christmas period itself.</p>
        
            <p>Another district councillor Eugene Patterson said they were already hearing complaints from locals - and this was when most of them thought the project was almost over.</p>
        
            <p>"People get frustrated, thinking that, y'know, it's a reasonably new expressway and to be having to do major works like that," Patterson said.</p>
        
            <p>The council was seeking more information from NZTA including about the detours through the town when the highway was closed.</p>
        
            <p>"How often, how long will they be?" he asked.</p>
        
            <p>The 12km-long stretch that cost $166m for construction alone to build, is now costing at least $46m to repair. This appears to be about 50 percent more than last year.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher Construction is paying 60 percent of the basic repairs - or $13m - but the bill to NZTA is much higher, at another $33m, because it is opting to also strengthen the road.</p>
        
            <p>The rutted road has defied Waka Kotahi's efforts.</p>
        
            <p>The minutes from November showed the project board was still wondering where the stormwater designs had got to for the parallel $19m of safety upgrades - so motorists can travel at 110km/h on the rest of the 100km-long, $2.1 billion expressway.</p>
        
            <p>Was it "worth trying to include the stormwater works in the pricing given the delays to date?" they asked.</p>

            <p>As well, they had been debating in August what the best repair approach was to save time, even though this was months into the job.</p>
        
            <p>"An agreed solution and programme, along with more resources from the contractor, are expected to see work accelerated this summer," the transport agency said in October.</p>
        
            <p>Yet a month later, overnight roadworks once again had to be postponed "due to resource constraints".</p>
        
            <p>Once the Ngāruawāhia highway surface started failing, the agency adopted a harder, much more costly surface called Hi-lab for other, later expressway sections.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāruawāhia is not getting Hi-lab, but instead so-called "deep-lift" asphalt that Waka Kotahi said should last 30-40 years.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, the locals around here know the land and there's a lot of local farmers who work on the swamp land. They know what the swamp land does," said Gibb.</p>
        
            <p>"And I believe a lot of local farmers said at the time, 'This isn't gonna work'. But of course, no one listened to them ... It's a shame."</p>
        
            <p>Patterson said he had heard that, too.</p>
        
            <p>"They felt as though they were ignored. It's probably got some of the deepest peat areas... Maybe there wasn't enough thought put into that."</p>
        
            <p>Roadworkers had been suffering from motorists venting their frustration.</p>
        
            <p>"The people on the ground are there in all types of weather and don't deserve to be abused," Waka Kotahi said in October. This had eased off recently.</p>
        
            <p>Managing up to 25,000 vehicles a day was a major challenge, the agency said on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Work could be done quicker with a north or south detour but the old route isn't suitable for heavy vehicles who make up close to 20 percent of traffic."</p>
        
            <p>The agency blamed the mounting delays on the scale of the job, and shortage of resources.</p>
        
            <p>"Initially further deterioration of the pavement since 2019, when the first section was repaired, has meant the quantity of full structural repairs has increased," it told RNZ on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Repairs cannot be undertaken during the winter period... The increase in the quantity of repairs has meant they cannot all be completed within the previous expected completion date."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, resourcing "challenges" had beset Fletcher and its subsidiary Higgins, as well as the designers, held up in trying to finalise drawings and schedules of quantities.</p>
        
            <p>The contractor was going to bring in crews and materials from outside the region.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a big push to progress this over the upcoming construction season," the agency said in October.</p>
        
            <p>On top of the $46m of repairs, almost $19m is being spent to make safety improvements.</p>
        
            <p>Higgins has had a bad year, owing in part to "poor execution on a range of small construction projects" and taking a $17m hit from Cyclone Gabrielle, Fletcher's annual report said.</p>
        
            <p>The August minutes recorded a manager asking how Fletcher "will ensure that Higgins perform and deliver the above within cost and programme".</p>
        
            <p>Someone else responded that Fletcher "are unlikely to look elsewhere for asphalt works but could consider other options for pavement and earthworks".</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher and engineers WSP have been approached for comment.</p>
