            <p>New Zealand completed an unprecedented 3-0 series sweep in India as the Black Caps dismissed the hosts for 121 on a tricky wicket to secure a 25-run victory on day three of the third and final test in Mumbai on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The last time India were blanked at home was in 2000, in a two-match series against South Africa, and Rohit Sharma's side will be feeling the pressure ahead of a challenging five-match series against Australia starting later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Rishabh Pant was the lone Indian batsman to show resistance as he made a sublime 64 after the hosts were reduced to 29-5 on a turning Wankhede Stadium track.</p>
        
            <p>Man-of-the-match Ajaz Patel claimed 6-57, his second five-wicket haul in the match, while fellow spinner Glenn Phillips took 3-42 to help skittle the hosts again for a famous win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's seriously special first of all to win a test match here at this historic ground but also to win a series 3-0," said Daryl Mitchell, who scored 82 in the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something you dream of. To come over here and actually achieve it is pretty special against a world-class Indian team.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just a bunch of Kiwis taking on the world."</p>
        
            <p>The tourists won the opening match in Bengaluru by eight wickets for their first test victory in India in 36 years, and wrapped up the series in Pune with a 113-run win.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's maiden series triumph in India going back to 1955 also snapped the hosts' home streak of 18 straight series triumphs since a 2-1 loss to England in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>Sharma threw the first punch by stepping out of his crease to hit Matt Henry for a four in the opening over of the day, but the skipper's disappointing recent run of form continued as he fell for 11 after a rash shot against the same bowler.</p>

            <p>Patel made it two wickets in two overs as Shubman Gill, who had scored a splendid 90 in the first innings, left a ball that crashed into the stumps and departed for one.</p>
        
            <p>Virat Kohli did not last long after arriving at the crease as he edged Patel back to slip on one to leave India in trouble at 18-3 on a tricky Wankhede Stadium pitch.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd fell silent again as Yashasvi Jaiswal was trapped lbw for five by Glenn Phillips and Sarfaraz Khan hit a full toss from Patel straight to Rachin Ravindra in the deep on one.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra Jadeja steadied the ship alongside Pant in a 42-run stand, but a stunning catch by Will Young meant India were on the ropes at 71-6.</p>
        
            <p>Patel dismissed Pant following a New Zealand review after lunch, although the batsman appeared to suggest that he had not made contact with the ball before it was caught.</p>
        
            <p>The runs dried up after that and India collapsed in a heap with Washington Sundar the last to go while looking to go big.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand resumed their second innings on 171-9 earlier, but India needed only 14 balls to bowl the Black Caps out, as Jadeja had Patel caught in the deep to end with 5-55, after bagging five in the first stanza.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand captain Tom Latham, in his first series as test captain for the Black Caps, said it was a series for the history books.</p>
        
            <p>Winning 3-0 was something "we could only have dreamed of three weeks ago", he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously the seamers did a great job in Bangalore and different guys have stood up at different times.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's the beauty of a team sport. Last week it was Mitch (Santer) and this week it was Ajaz (Patel).</p>
        
            <p>"He did a fantastic job, he loved bowling here in Mumbai. It was just a fantastic team effort all round, great team effort, and I'm certainly proud of the guys."</p>
        
            <p>India captain Rohit Sharma said it was a tough defeat to take.</p>
        
            <p>"Losing a series, losing test matches is never easy," he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"This was an unfortunate series when it didn't come off. As a captain I was not at my best at leading the team or with the bat as well.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't play our best cricket, and we are facing the results of that, and New Zealand played better than us throughout the series.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a lot of mistakes that we made and we have to accept that."</p>
