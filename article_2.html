            <p>A Christchurch city councillor hopes the discovery of remains in the year-long search for real estate agent Yanfei Bao will bring some closure to a case that has gripped the community.</p>
        
            <p>The 44-year-old was last seen alive on 19 July last year at a property in Hornby, where she was due to show a potential buyer through a house.</p>
        
            <p>A man charged with her murder is due to go on trial in October.</p>
        
            <p>Bao's disappearance shocked and horrified the community and the country.</p>
        
            <p>An extensive police search took place over months, centred on Lake Ellesmere and nearby suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>Police now believe they have found Bao's body, after a recent tip-off led officers to find a shallow grave on a private farm in Greenpark yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Peters is the councillor for Hornby and said her disappearance had gripped the community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not something you want to have happening in your neighbourhood, and not having the certainty of closure - it's not been a comfortable feeling."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped yesterday's discovery would bring that closure.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the case has also opened up conversations about safety.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes you think about when you are out door-knocking, or if you are in a profession like real estate when you are on your own, you have to make sure you're safe in what you're doing."</p>
        
            <p>Bao had been working at Harcourts.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Bryan Thomson said in a statement they had seen the confronting news and their thoughts were with her family, friends and colleagues within their network.</p>
