        <h2>Hydraulic system failure caused Jetstar plane to swerve off runway</h2>
        <p>
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission has launched an investigation into the incident.
</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is investigating the incident where a Jetstar plane slid off the runway at Christchurch Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Flights were cancelled after the flight hit trouble while landing, however, the airport opened mid-morning.</p>
        
            <p>Initial reports indicated the Airbus A320 aircraft experienced a steering problem as it was landing, TAIC accidents chief investigator Naveen Kozhuppakalam said.</p>
        
            <p>All passengers on the Auckland to Christchurch flight JQ225 disembarked safely, with no reported injuries to passengers or crew, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kozhuppakalam said the commission would include cockpit voice and flight data recordings in its investigation, as well as airport CCTV footage.</p>
        
            <p>Crew, authorities, air traffic control, and eyewitnesses would also be interviewed.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers aboard a 180-seater Jetstar aircraft said they heard noises mid-flight.</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar chief operating officer Matt Franzi said the aircraft experienced a steering issue "associated with one of three hydraulic systems failing on the aircraft".</p>
        
            <p>"During landing the aircraft veered on the runway before going onto the grass at low speed for a short period of time before returning to the runway and coming to a stop."</p>

            <p>He also said there were no injuries to passengers or crew.</p>
        
            <p>The aircraft was towed to the gate and all passengers disembarked.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working with Airbus and relevant authorities to investigate what happened."</p>
        
            <p>He said the aircraft would not be returned to service until fully operational.</p>
