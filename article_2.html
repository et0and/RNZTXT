            <p>The Minister for Children has overridden a decision by Oranga Tamariki to pull funding for a youth helpline, and has told Oranga Tamariki to "pause its current review" of contracts with providers.</p>
        
            <p>In June last year, providers were given little notice their funding from the care and protection agency would be reduced or discontinued as their contracts came up for renewal in the new financial year.</p>
        
            <p>The process is now being investigated by the Auditor-General.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported this morning a range of providers were concerned about the future impacts of cuts to prevention services by Oranga Tamariki, including Barnardos chief executive Matt Reid.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Children Karen Chhour said Oranga Tamariki had been reviewing its contracts to address "under-utilised or under-performing services, remove the duplication of services being provided, and align services to its core business priorities."</p>
        
            <p>She said the timeliness of communication and engagement with the sector was "handled poorly by Oranga Tamariki" and created unnecessary disruption and uncertainty for both providers and the public.</p>
        
            <p>"I have asked Oranga Tamariki to pause its current review and extend existing contracts for providers who do not have a current contract, or have a contract that will end shortly, until 31 December 2025."</p>
        
            <p>"This will provide more certainty to providers and allow Oranga Tamariki to input into the wider work the government is undertaking on social service contracting practices."</p>
        
            <p>Barnardos announced this morning they would lose all government funding for their helpline 0800 WHATS UP from July 1 this year.</p>
        
            <p>The helpline answers more than 12,000 calls and chats a year from 5 to 19 year olds.</p>
        
            <p>CEO Matt Reid said there was a crucial need for the helpline, and government funding accounted for almost half the total cost to run the service "threatening to close 0800 What's Up all together."</p>
        
            <p>Chhour had intervened to ensure Barnardos could continue to deliver the service.</p>
        
            <p>"When I found out about the potential impact to this service, I asked Oranga Tamariki for an explanation.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on the information I have received, Oranga Tamariki's handling of this process has not met my expectations," said Chhour in a statement released on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"I met with Oranga Tamariki last night, and instructed them to work with Barnardos to ensure the service can continue to be delivered to families and children."</p>
