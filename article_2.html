            <p>The mother of an Ecostore employee whose eyesight was permanently damaged by chemicals, has spoken of the "scary" aftermath of his injury.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, WorkSafe published details of the incident at Ecostore's Auckland factory in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The man had been working in a factory in the East Auckland suburb of Pakuranga when he suffered chemical burns to his eyes while making dishwasher powder in March 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He was trying to shut off a pressurised hose that had come loose and was spraying hazardous liquid into the air.</p>
        
            <p>The injury caused permanent damage, impacting his vision.</p>
        
            <p>His mother, who didn't want to be named to protect her son's identity, says her family was thrown into turmoil.</p>
        
            <p>She said she cried every night while her son was in hospital.</p>
