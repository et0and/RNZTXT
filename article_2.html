            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Health Minister Shane Reti are announcing "five major health targets" to cap off the government's 100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are speaking at WhangƒÅrei Hospital after a visit to the radiation oncology facility there.</p>
        
            <p>The targets are:</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora would be directed to report quarterly on each target, with the regime coming into effect on 1 July - so the first results will reflect the three months to September.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said child immunisation rates currently were at a disappointing 83 percent, well behind the UK, Australia and Canada - and below New Zealand's 93 percent of 10 years ago - while wait times for first specialist assessments were just 66 percent of people seen within four months.</p>
        
            <p>He said having effective targets and reporting them publicly would help identify problems and take action on them.</p>
        
            <p>"Health workforce will be key to achieving these targets. We know how committed the health workforce is and how hard they are working, which is why building our workforce remains a priority."</p>

            <p>The targets represented a "vigorous new direction in health" after the health system "went backwards under the previous government and its failure to drive targets," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are unapologetically an outcomes-driven government. In health, that means setting targets which will deliver better results for all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>The 100-day plan , unveiled in November, broadly specified two of the targets would include "wait times", and "cancer treatment", but Friday's announcement should outline the other three - and detail what specifically is being aimed for.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon confirmed months ago the deadline for the plan was to be 8 March, and has been confident the government had achieved all 49 actions - though questions could be raised about some of these.</p>
        
            <p>"We told you what we're gonna do, we've done it, and now we're telling you what we've done," Luxon said of the plan on Thursday, as he unveiled the government's fast-track legislation alongside three other ministers.</p>
