            <p>Anika Moa says she's ready to fight to reclaim her culture as much as possible, but that there are also real benefits in dealing with traumatic events with humour.</p>
        
            <p>The multitalented wāhine joined Susie Ferguson on Saturday Morning for this year's final Playing Favourites.</p>
        
            <p>An ubiquitous part of the music scene for decades, more recently Moa's turned her hand to TV and radio presenting including TVNZ show Anika Moa ​Unleashed.</p>
        
            <p>With a trademark interview style that combines cheek and earthy charm, she's managed to reveal a whole new side to guests such as Sir Ashley Bloomfield.</p>
        
            <p>Moa's favourite song choices for Playing Favourites, such as Kora's 'Politician', reflect her thoughts of the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't believe in this government," she says of the new National-led coalition.</p>
        
            <p>"I am Māori and I whakapapa back to Ngāpuhi and I am feeling a little bit pissed off really... I want to help fight to reclaim our reo, our language, our heritage, our culture as much as I can."</p>
        
            <p>Moa says she often deals with traumatic events with humour.</p>
        
            <p>It's a big part of her personality.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always a funny side to something. It can morbid but then it can be funny for me because that's how I channel my trauma or pain."</p>
        
            <p>"I've always been like that."</p>
        
            <p>She says when she first stepped into the music scene's spotlight, her record company "were like, don't be funny," in her music videos.</p>
        
            <p>"I was doing these video clips that were so serious and all I wanted to do was take the piss out of myself."</p>
        
            <p>Moa says there are a lot of sides to being a human.</p>
        
            <p>"I love being funny, I love entertaining people and I love telling rude jokes."</p>
        
            <p>Moa told Saturday Morning she's at the "end of year haul."</p>
        
            <p>"`You just have to wake up and do it. Get the presents, get the kids to school, get them to prize-givings and Christmas parties and buy things and make things. So generally speaking, I'm absolutely exhausted."</p>
        
            <p>Moa says she does a lot but this year she's slowed down, due to a diagnosis of type-1 diabetes and dealing with the depression that followed.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people talk about 'they went through depression and now they're out the other side.' I'm deep in the heart of it. I am on anti-depressants, ADHD medication and I'm trailing a few different things."</p>
        
            <p>Moa says it's "not nice," but she has "glimmers of beautiful moments."</p>
        
            <p>Like with her kids, doing her new upcoming RNZ podcast, walking her dogs. Even buying a lawnmower.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm like to my ex-partner, 'I can come over and help you mow the lawns'.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the simple joys in life."</p>
        
            <p>Her interview series for RNZ called 'It's Personal' is due to air early next year.</p>
