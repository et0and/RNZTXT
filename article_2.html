            <p>Two giant sculptures that have appeared above Wellington's Transmission Gully which have had motorists scratching their heads - and some taking photos while driving - are part of a larger project by philanthropists Gareth and Joanne Morgan.</p>
        
            <p>Last month drivers on the new stretch of State Highway 1 spotted a massive park bench had been placed to look over the motorway.</p>
        
            <p>It joined another huge sculpture, which people on social media described as like a giant feather that was installed two months ago over what was formerly the Pauatahanui golf course.</p>

            <p>Gareth and Joanne Morgan bought the land on Paekakariki Hill Road in 2019, relaunching it as The Morgans, a conservation and recreational area, which still includes a golf course.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson would not confirm whether the Morgans are starting a Wellington giant sculpture garden to rival Gibbs Farm.</p>
        
            <p>She says the bench is one of several that are being installed "as part of a larger project that is still a work-in-progress", while a couple more works will be put in place over the next three months.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors should be able to access the site by the end of April.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022 the Morgans installed a 16-metre steel rainbow-coloured bridge on their land.</p>
        
            <p>It is not visible to northbound traffic but can be seen from the southbound lanes.</p>
