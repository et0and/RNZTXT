            <p>The majority of submissions made about a McDonald's restaurant opening in Wānaka are not lovin' it.</p>
        
            <p>Consent is being sought to open a 455 square-metre restaurant at the Wānaka-Luggate Highway, with a drive-thru operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 366 submissions made to the Queenstown Lakes District Council, 339 were opposed, 21 were in support and six wanted changes.</p>
        
            <p>One hundred and six people have agreed to speak at a meeting later in November.</p>
        
            <p>Wao Aotearoa Charitable Trust, strongly opposed to the idea, had concerns about the visual and aesthetic impact on the town.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed site is highly visible at the entrance of Wānaka and is adjacent to significant landscape features such as Mount Iron," its submission said.</p>
        
            <p>"The development will have a substantial adverse impact on the visual and aesthetic values of this sensitive location.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed mitigation measures, including planting and mounding, are insufficient to address the impacts of the building, signage, lighting, and parking areas.</p>
        
            <p>"This site does not align with the community's objective to protect and enhance our natural landscapes."</p>
        
            <p>The trust also had concerns about waste management, with the submission saying Wānaka had shown leadership in the move to a zero-waste economy.</p>
        
            <p>"McDonald's continued use and reliance on single-use and disposable packaging goes against commitment to zero waste and environmental protection. The toxicity and waste caused by single use packaging leaks into the environment, and causes a huge amount of damage to our ecosystems."</p>
        
            <p>In a joint submission by Wastebusters and Plastic Free Wanaka, opposed to the idea, said the heart of Wānaka's shared values was protecting the natural environment.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes guardianship of our outstanding natural landscape, protection of our alpine waterways and transitioning to a circular economy, and is recognised in the council's strategic documents including the Vision Beyond 2050, the Destination Management Plan and the Waste Management and Minimisation Plan.</p>
        
            <p>"Thirty percent of the community (5565 people) have already signed a petition to stop a McDonald's from opening in Wānaka, with waste and the environmental impact being commonly cited concerns."</p>

            <p>There were also people who would like to see some golden arches in their area.</p>
        
            <p>One woman, who lived about a kilometre from the proposed site, was for the restaurant being built - but with some conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Opening hours are restricted to 10pm on weeknights and 12pm on weekends," her submission said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am concerned by the potential for excessive traffic movements, unsafe driving and anti-social behaviour by McDonalds customers speeding along Aubrey road at night disturbing sleeping residents. Limiting opening hours would help reduce the impact."</p>
        
            <p>The local also wanted to see safe access for cyclists and contribution to local community projects that enhance the environment of the adjacent Mt Iron Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident in favour said it would be "a positive addition to take away food outlets in the town" and that "it is appropriate for people to have food choices".</p>
        
            <p>The council meeting is set down for 25 November.</p>
