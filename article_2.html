More than 7000 properties were affected by the catastrophic storms, but fewer than half that number have registered so far.

            <p>Monday is the last day that Auckland homeowners can sign up for the region's buyout scheme for flood- and landslide-affected homes.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council said more than 7000 properties were impacted by 2023's catastrophic storms, but fewer than half that number had registered.</p>
        
            <p>Council spokesperson Craig Hobbs said anyone whose house flooded more than half a metre, was given a red or yellow sticker, or was affected by a landslide should consider signing up on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are making a special effort to reach homeowners we think could be at high risk but haven't heard back from many of them," Hobbs said.</p>
        
            <p>"Support under the categorisation programme might be the best and last option to receive local and central government support to make their home safe or move somewhere safer."</p>
        
            <p>The council had been assessing and categorising affected properties based on whether there was an intolerable risk to life from future storms, and whether there was anything that could be done to reduce the risk, he said.â€¯</p>
        
            <p>There were construction and consenting grants available for homeowners to do work on their property that would reduce this risk to life, including building retaining walls and shifting or raising the home.</p>
        
            <p>Where there was nothing that could be done on the property or in the community to reduce the risk, the council was offering a voluntary buyout at the property's valuation before any storm damage.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a voluntary programme, but we are strongly urging high-risk homeowners to consider registering," Hobbs said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also important owners in impacted multi-unit developments, like apartment buildings or townhouse complexes, look at registering."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's recovery office expected 900 homes to be bought out and demolished or removed.</p>
        
            <p>So far 770 homes have qualified for buyout.</p>
