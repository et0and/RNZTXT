            <p>The 1960s Rolls-Royce which served as the limousine for Queen Elizabeth II’s royal tours in New Zealand is being auctioned. </p>
        
            <p>Made in England and brought to New Zealand specifically for the tours in 1963 and 1970, the Phantom V would have been selected for its spacious interior and V8 engine. The engine would have allowed the monarch to cruise along at a significant speed to a tight schedule of appointments throughout New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It was estimated this piece of history could sell for between $175,000 and $200,000, said Webb's Head of Collectors' Cars and Marketing Caolán McAleer in an interview with Culture 101.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was likely to sell for more than any other usual Phantom V car of the same era because of the royal connection.</p>
        
            <p>"That definitely is very important when it comes to this. For a Phantom V of this age, this condition and this sort of spec you'd be talking about somewhere around maybe $100,000."</p>
        
            <p>McAleer said Webb's had sold a similar luxury royal tour car in 2019 for around $180,000.</p>
        
            <p>He guessed it would likely be bought by a New Zealand-based collector and stay here in New Zealand "but all bets are off until someone raises a paddle".</p>

            <p>Originally introduced in 1959, there were many notable features of the car including a lowered carriage to accommodate the height of the Duke of Edinburgh. </p>
        
            <p>With the Queen's dislike of leather, the seats were made of wool.</p>
        
            <p>"If she was down in Invercargill or the South Island then it might have been a bit cold if it was leather," said McAleer.</p>
        
            <p>He raved about the Queen's love of luxury cars and the Phantom V's unique features in particular:</p>
        
            <p>"The Queen always used British vehicles in any kind of tour or any kind of use. Her favourites were Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Land Rover and Jaguar. All the classics.</p>
        
            <p>"So this would have been specially specced out for her. So it has got places for the little flags to go so they could be flapping along for people to wave at. The windows aren't tinted to that people could see in and clearly see them which is quite special. </p>

            <p>"It has got three layers of carpet as was supposed to be her preference. That would have absorbed a lot of sound and made it a very comfortable cabin. It has also got nice little foot rests.</p>
        
            <p>"And to add a real touch of glamour it has got its own little fold-down drinks cabinet filled with goblets and decanters. So it can be cocktail hour no matter where you go. All day."</p>
        
            <p>For the majority of its running life, the car was maintained by Wally Presard on behalf of the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
        
            <p>It's been owned by the vendor's family for 40 years and throughout the 80s and 90s, it was used as a wedding car where people could feel like a queen if they hired it, remarked McAleer.</p>
        
            <p>It was then put into storage for 30 years but in 2021, the owner carried out remedial work to make it roadworthy again.</p>
        
            <p>McAleer said that the royal fleets of today would probably come with updated extras like bullet-proof glass and "really high safety features". </p>
        
            <p>"In the '60s,.. I don't think this one comes with bullet proof glass, but let's not find out," he said chuckling.</p>
        
            <p>The car was set to be sold at a collectors' cars, motorcycles and automobilia auction on 11 August.</p>
