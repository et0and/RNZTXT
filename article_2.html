            <p>New Zealand's six Super Rugby Pacific sides name their squads for next season today. First up at 10am we have last year's beaten semi-finalists, the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw has brought in nine new players for next season. While Brett Cameron has been named, he faces a lengthy rehab for an ACL injury, so first five Riley Hohepa returns to the Hurricanes after a season with the Crusaders. Two South Island locks also make the move north, Will Tucker from the Highlanders and Zach Gallagher from the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Ere Enari joins the Canes after spending three seasons at Moana Pasifika, while rookies Tjay Clarke, Kade Banks, Arese Poliko, Fehi Fineanganofo and Lucas Cashmore come in as well.</p>
        
            <p>Laidlaw will have to look for some leadership in new areas, their biggest losses are All Blacks Jordie Barrett and TJ Perenara. Barrett will be back after a season in Ireland, but his absence gives the highly rated Riley Higgins a free run to start in the midfield. Josh Moorby has also left, which means the door is wide open for Clarke and Banks to make a case to start in the back three.</p>
