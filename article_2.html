            <p>Inflation has slowed to a three-year low, with the consumer price index (CPI) falling back into the Reserve Bank's target band.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said the consumer price index rose 0.6 percent in the three months ended September, taking the annual rate to 2.2 percent from 3.3 percent - the lowest since March 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest contributors to the quarterly result were higher rates, food and medical costs, which offset cheaper fuel and early childhood costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Prices are still rising, but not as previously recorded," Stats NZ senior manager of prices Nicola Growden said.</p>
        
            <p>Government policy changes affected several price moves.</p>
        
            <p>The reimposition of prescription charges was a driver in the 10.1 percent rise of medical products and services.</p>
        
            <p>However, the scrapping of the Auckland regional fuel tax contributed to lower transport costs, and the Family Boost Scheme subsidy for pre-school childcare lowered education costs.</p>
        
            <p>Official taxes on tobacco and alcohol increased prices by 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Domestic prices - known as non-tradables - remained the backbone of inflation, notably rates and rents.</p>
        
            <p>Non-tradables rose 1.3 percent for the quarter, and 4.9 percent for the year.</p>
        
            <p>Local authority rates rose 12.2 percent, accounting for more than half the quarterly inflation rate.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the largest rates increase since 1990," Growden said.</p>
        
            <p>Rents were up 4.5 percent for the year, and insurance cost 12.9 percent higher.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, the price of imported goods and services - tradables - fell 0.2 percent for the quarter and by 1.6 percent for the year.</p>
        
            <p>The inflation numbers were close to the Reserve Bank's (RBNZ) August forecasts, and supported the prospect of another large official cash rate cut in November.</p>
