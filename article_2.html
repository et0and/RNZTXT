        <p>
Meanwhile, NSW Premier Chris Minns is suggesting a similar memorial to the one honouring victims of a cafe siege in Sydney 10 years ago.

            <p>A permanent memorial for the victims of the Bondi Junction attack has been flagged by NSW Premier Chris Minns on ABC Radio Sydney this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Minns was among community leaders including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who laid floral tributes at Bondi Junction on Sunday, honouring the six people killed in the attack on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The Premier says the government will look at establishing an enduring memorial in the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking at a more permanent memorial at Bondi," Minns told ABC Radio Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a horrible and traumatic event for the city," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe the families can draw some strength from the fact that there's millions of people that are standing with them and caring about them."</p>

            <p>Also on Monday, New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park said he had been "delighted" to learn the condition of the nine-month-old baby injured in the attacks had improved.</p>
        
            <p>The condition of the baby girl who is being treated at Randwick Hospital has moved from "critical to serious".</p>
        
            <p>"That's a big change and a significant improvement," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>The baby's mother, Ashlee Good, who was 38, was killed in the rampage.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has named the sixth person killed in the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Yixuan Cheng was a Chinese national studying in Australia. Her family is currently on their way to Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Minns said a memorial would be similar to one in Martin Place for the two people killed in the Lindt Cafe siege in central Sydney in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson were killed during the siege, after a lone gunman took 18 hostages inside the CBD cafe.</p>
        
            <p>Waverley mayor Paula Masselos, whose council area includes Bondi Junction, said council will discuss ways they can support the community at their meeting on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm thinking that a memorial of some kind for this would be most appropriate," Masselos said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am putting up a mayoral minute that will be looking at what council can do to support the community both from a physical and practical point of view, but also something that will help the community come to terms with the dreadful, dreadful events."</p>

            <p>Albanese declared today a national day of mourning for the victims.</p>
        
            <p>Government buildings will be flying flags at half mast today and the Sydney Opera House sails will be lit up tonight with a black ribbon to honour the victims.</p>
        
            <p>People have been laying floral tributes at the Oxford Street Mall in Bondi Junction, across the road from the shopping centre where the attack happened.</p>
        
            <p>Written condolence messages are being collected next to the floral tributes, while an online condolence book has also been set up by the NSW government.</p>
