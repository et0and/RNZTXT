            <p>The banking sector lacks competition, a Commerce Commission draft report, released on Thursday, has found.</p>
        
            <p>It was asked by the government in June 2023 to look into the potential barriers or behaviours affecting competition and quality of services in personal banking.</p>
        
            <p>The commission's draft report into the personal banking sector said there was a two-tier market in which the big four Australian owned banks have the major share.</p>
        
            <p>The sector lacked disruptive forces to drive change and deliver benefits to consumers, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Commerce Commission chair John Small said the four major banks - ANZ, ASB, BNZ and Westpac - focused more on "price-matching strategies" which result in "very stable market shares".</p>
        
            <p>He said disruption needed to be "baked in" to push aggressive competition which consumers were missing out on.</p>
        
            <p>"Ongoing disruption is key to promoting enduring competition in this sector. Today's maverick could be tomorrow's oligopolist, so the aim should be to ensure contestability over the longer-term."</p>
        
            <p>It has recommended reducing barriers for those seeking to take on the major banks.</p>
        
            <p>One way would be to encourage innovative players to enter the market, Small said.</p>
        
            <p>It is recommending the government look at ways to beef up Kiwibank by increasing its capital and making it a 'disruptive competitor'.</p>
        
            <p>The report also suggested speeding up the move to have open banking operating by mid-2026, to allow consumers to switch banks easily.</p>
        
            <p>The report also said customers needed to have the tools to make informed decisions about their banking providers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the supermarket moment for the banks," Monopoly Watch director Tex Edwards told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"The glory days of ANZ and ASB are over."</p>
        
            <p>He was upset that the report did not recommend breaking up ANZ and ASB, "which is precedented in the UK".</p>
        
            <p>It would be brave of the government to not see a problem with the banking sector after this report, he said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was 15 years behind the OECD on open banking, Edwards said.</p>
        
            <p>As for Kiwibank, it had been "a toy of the incumbent big-four oligopoly".</p>
        
            <p>He said it has failed to deliver disruption and doubted a recapitalised reinvigorated Kiwibank would "break up such a cosy club of big four Australian banks".</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwibank is going to be under scrutiny."</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission study looked at banking services for personal or household use, that included current account, deposit, and overdraft account services, personal loans, and mortgage and credit card lending.</p>
        
            <p>For the study, the commission spoke to businesses, consumer groups and industry bodies, providers of personal banking services, and consumers. It also aimed to engage with MƒÅori.</p>
        
            <p>The commission will now take feedback on the preliminary findings and recommendations. The final report will be released in August 2024.</p>
