            <p>Para-cyclist Anna Taylor won New Zealand's first medal of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games with silver in the women's C4 3000m individual pursuit on 31 August (NZT) and more medals have since come on the bike and in track and field events.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton's Danielle Aitchison won the first of her two silver medals at these Games in the women's 200m T36 and the 23-year-old backed it up in the women's 100m T36.</p>

            <p>Despite forgetting her prosthetic, the Kiwi had earlier hacked more than two-and-a-half seconds from her national record in qualification, registering 3:37.599 and the 31-year-old Cambridge-based Para cyclist was even more impressive in the bronze medal final.</p>
        
            <p>William Stedman claimed New Zealand's fourth medal of the Games with silver in the 400m T36 on the athletics track. Competing a little under 16 hours after finishing fourth in the long jump, the 24-year-old Christchurch-based athlete set a national record time of 52.92 behind defending champion James Turner of Australia who set a world record mark of 51.54.</p>
        
            <p>For Stedman, it was the fifth Paralympic Games medal of his career and a third successive Paralympic Games medal in the men's 400m T36 after winning bronze medals at both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>

            <p>Dunedin's Grimaldi will also compete in other events later in the Paralympic programme.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-nine year-old Holly Robinson won her first shot put Paralympics medal with a bronze in the F46 final. Robinson has previously won javelin medals at the Paralympics.</p>
