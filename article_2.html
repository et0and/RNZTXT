            <p>Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg turned heads on Wednesday when he posted an image of his wife, Priscilla Chan, standing next to a large silver and blue statue sculpted in her likeness.</p>
        
            <p>The statue - which stands about 2.1m tall - was commissioned by the chief executive of Facebook's parent company in an effort to honour "the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife", Zuckerberg wrote on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>New York-based artist Daniel Arsham crafted the sculpture, which was placed under a tree in what appears to be a residential garden.</p>
        
            <p>The figure's striking colour and towering size sent the internet buzzing with comparisons to the Avatar characters and jokes about Zuckerberg's identity as a so-called "wife guy".</p>
        
            <p>In the photo, the real Chan is seen sipping from a mug in the same light blue colour of the statue. She commented on her husband's Instagram reveal of the artwork, saying, "The more of me the better?" along with a heart emoji.</p>
        
            <p>A sculpted silver garment looks like it is draped over and flowing behind the teal woman.</p>
        
            <p>According to the National Museums Liverpool, statues in ancient Rome were often made to honour deceased loved ones or "to refer to significant relatives and to make meaningful associations".</p>
        
            <p>Zuckerberg and Chan have been married since 2012 and have three daughters.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
