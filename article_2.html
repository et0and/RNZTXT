            <p>The briefing followed a weekend announcement of new legislation banning gang patches.</p>
        
            <p>The government announced new legislation in the next few days to back a ban on the patches in public and said police would be given extra powers to stop gang members congregating.</p>
        
            <p>Critics questioned the legality and enforceability of the ban and Ōpōtiki Māori Wardens chairperson Te Owai Gemmell said gang members would be "laughing", but Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said new laws would help officers do their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said people had no tolerance for gangs' behaving as if they were above the law, and the new legislation would support police to take action.</p>
