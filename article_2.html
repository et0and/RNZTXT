        <h2>Emotional Shaw on Efeso Collins: 'An authentic, genuine, warm man'</h2>
        <p>
Fa'anānā Efeso Collins was "the most beautiful man" whose death is devastating, James Shaw says.
</p>
        
            <p>Politicians from across the spectrum are offering tributes for the life and contribution of Green MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins who died suddenly in Auckland on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The news has brought Parliament to a standstill - leaving the Greens caucus - in particular - in a state of disbelief and deep sadness.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said: "I am truly shocked and saddened at the news of Efeso Collins' sudden death".</p>
        
            <p>"Efeso was a good man, always friendly and kind, and a true champion and advocate for his Samoan and south Auckland communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go to his family, his community and colleagues."</p>

            <p>Greens co-leader James Shaw became emotional during a press conference, saying he alongwith other Green members were devastated.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā's loss would be felt across the political divide, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was clear he had respect across the House."</p>
        
            <p>Shaw said Fa'anānā's ability to talk about love in the House "spoke volumes to me".</p>
        
            <p>He was "the most beautiful man" and Shaw was hopeful Pasifika people would be inspired by Fa'anānā's example to enter both local body and national politics.</p>
        
            <p>"In many ways Efeso's political career was only just beginning. He was such an authentic, genuine, warm man who had respect for everyone. It's a model of politics that I aspire to and I hope more people will live up to that standard."</p>

            <p>Labour deputy leader Carmel Sepuloni said she had known Fa'anānā for decades, studing and working alongside him.</p>
        
            <p>Labour was "incredibly saddened" and her thoughts were with Fa'ānānā's wife and two daughters.</p>
        
            <p>"His voice, his advocacy was one of the strongest, I believe, in Aotearoa for our Pacific community."</p>
        
            <p>He had moved out of Labour's fale into the Greens, but he was only next door, Sepuloni said.</p>

            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said he remembered looking at him and thinking he was going to go far and that he was "one to watch".</p>
        
            <p>Fa'ānānā was very clear in his values and who he was and it was a tragedy he had died just weeks into his first term in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>One of Fa'ānānā's last messages was to Labour's new finance spokesperson Barbara Edmonds to congratulate her. She broke down in tears at the media briefing.</p>
        
            <p>Former prime minister Helen Clark said on X: "Efeso will be remembered for his strong sense of social justice and fairness."</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour agreed Fa'anānā was liked and would be missed by both sides of the House.</p>
        
            <p>He said Fa'anānā was "a passionate, articulate, and charismatic advocate for south Auckland".</p>
        
            <p>Health leader Sir Collin Tukuitonga said he was in a state of shock at the loss of a man who was "on the same mission" as other Pacific leaders.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely devastating for his family, for the Pasifika community, for NZ and beyond."</p>
        
            <p>He said Pasifika people could not afford to lose an outstanding man who was "ethical, strong, community minded".</p>
        
            <p>"It feels like a sudden stop in someone who has already had a big impact."</p>

            <p>Health and Pacific Peoples Minister Dr Shane Reti said he was deeply saddened.</p>
        
            <p>"Fa'anānā Efeso was a pillar of our communities, particularly the Pacific community and his hometown, South Auckland's Ōtara.</p>
        
            <p>"Fa'anānā Efeso worked hard to serve all communities for many years, dedicating his time in both local and more recently in national politics to progress issues he was passionate about, particularly supporting young people to realise their potential."</p>
        
            <p>He was among many offering condolences to Fa'anānā's widow and two daughters.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown who defeated Fa'anānā in the mayoral race in 2022 said Fa'anānā's death was a sad day for the city.</p>
        
            <p>"He is someone I had a lot of respect for, and although we competed for the mayoralty, we actually became quite good friends."</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop said all of Parliament was in deep shock and after tributes this afternoon, it would adjourn until 27 February as a mark of respect.</p>
