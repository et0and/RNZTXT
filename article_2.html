            <p>U.S. billionaire Elon Musk has drawn criticism from German politicians from the government and opposition for an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which they deemed "intrusive" outside influence.</p>
        
            <p>The support of the AfD from Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.</p>
        
            <p>The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by Musk on social media platform X last week in which he wrote "only the AfD can save Germany" and praised the party's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the publication of his commentary, the editor of the newspaper's opinion section said on X that she had resigned.</p>
        
            <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and current favourite to succeed Scholz as chancellor, said in an interview with the Funke Media Group: "I cannot recall a comparable case of interference, in the history of Western democracies, in the election campaign of a friendly country."</p>
        
            <p>Merz described the commentary as "intrusive and pretentious".</p>
        
            <p>Saskia Esken, co-leader of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), vowed fierce resistance to attempts by state actors as well as the rich and influential to influence Germany's elections.</p>
        
            <p>"In Elon Musk's world, democracy and workers' rights are obstacles to more profit," Esken told Reuters. "We say quite clearly: Our democracy is defensible and it cannot be bought."</p>
        
            <p>Welt's editor-in-chief designate defended the decision to publish the commentary, saying that democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of opinion, including polarising positions.</p>
        
            <p>The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart a centre-right or centre-left majority. Germany's mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level. (Reporting by Miranda Murray and Andreas Rinke; editing by Jason Neely)</p>
