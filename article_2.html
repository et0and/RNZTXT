            <p>The sentencing of a former Auckland eye surgeon found not guilty of murdering of his wife is set to start in the High Court at Auckland on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Polkinghorne was found not guilty of murdering of his wife, Pauline Hanna, after a nine-week trial ending in September.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutors said Polkinghorne murdered Hanna and staged the scene as a suicide due to a combination of financial problems, infidelity and drug use.</p>
        
            <p>The defence argued Hanna took her own life after struggling with depression for many years.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne pleaded guilty in July to two charges of possessing methamphetamine and a pipe.</p>
        
            <p>The retired ophthalmologist had 37 grams of methamphetamine, worth over $13,000, hidden throughout his Remuera home. He was charged in August 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The maximum sentence for possessing a Class A substance is six months in prison, while possessing a pipe can carry a one-year jail term.</p>
        
            <p>Both charges can also include fines of up to $1000.</p>
        
            <p>During the trial, the jury heard that methamphetamine testing was carried out at Polkinghorne's workplace, the Auckland Eye ophthalmology clinic.</p>
        
            <p>It revealed concerningly high levels of the drug at his workplace, suggesting it had been used there.</p>
        
            <p>Testing officer Jeremy Hill told the jury he took 14 swabs from four rooms at the premises.</p>
        
            <p>A meth pipe, embossed with the words 'sweet puff' on the side, was also found at Polkinghorne's work.</p>
        
            <p>In one consult room, where the pipe was found, levels of methamphetamine found were above safe levels, Hill said.</p>
