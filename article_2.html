            <p>Los Angeles Times entertainment and arts deputy editor Matt Brennan called the 102-minute film "an uncommonly revealing portrait of leadership in action", while Variety's Siddhant Adlakha described it as an "intimate but simplistic documentary".</p>
        
            <p>The film festival runs in Utah from 23 January until 2 February.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand release date has not yet been announced for the film.</p>
