        <h2>Olympics live: 'Fairytale ending': Victorious Black Ferns welcomed home</h2>
        <p>
The gold-medal winning team have arrived home to a heroes' welcome, after New Zealand's rowers have moved the country up the table with a triple.
</p>
        
            <p>Black Fern Tyla King says she is finishing her career on a high with a gold medal and being met by her young niece and nephew when she arrived home in Auckland this morning.</p>
        
            <p>There were touching scenes as King draped her medal around her nephew's neck</p>
        
            <p>"It's a fairytale ending for me," she told RNZ at the airport.</p>

            <p>The country's fastest ever woman is expecting to be alongside at least one of the biggest names in athletics - such as Sha'carri Richardson, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce or Dina Asher-Smith.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand sits 12th on the medal table with two golds, two silvers and a bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Last night women's double sculls team Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won gold in their event, while the women's four took bronze and a silver in the men's coxless four.</p>
