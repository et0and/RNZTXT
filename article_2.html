            <p>Auckland's central city business association is calling for a more visible police presence after retailers faced a difficult 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses have grappled with increasing costs and rising safety concerns in the central city over the past 12 months but sector leaders say 2024 could be a turning point.</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck said increased visitation in the city was good news for business.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a bumper cruise season and we're hoping to see a lot of tourists, because that's good for business and brings a lot of vibrancy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Beck said the city was also seeing more international students coming back.</p>
        
            <p>But the new year was not without its challenges, and she wanted to see more police in the central city.</p>
        
            <p>"We definitely want to see more police here, a much more visible presence, and ideally a downtown police station," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's quite a strong consensus that that will change the dial here."</p>
        
            <p>Beck said she wanted to see a stronger pipeline for events and their funding in Auckland, after the success of events like the FIFA Women's World Cup last year.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the head of the Auckland Business Chamber said he hoped 2024 would end stronger than last year for Auckland businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Business Chamber chief executive Simon Bridges said the year may start off sluggish for businesses, before improving.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think help, hope, confidence is on its way in the second half with potentially lower interest rates, with [the] government going better, with just a general business environment, I think, feeling more optimistic."</p>
        
            <p>Bridges said while crystal balls were "hard to come by" when making predictions, businesses should be realistically optimistic for the coming year.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly if we see interest rates go down in the second half [of the year], and a few other factors go our way, I'm willing to predict, with a bit of realism, it's going to be a more optimistic second half of 2024 for business."</p>
        
            <p>Bridges said business confidence was already up.</p>
