            <p>Members of a tennis club on Auckland's North Shore are shocked by the theft of their honesty box.</p>
        
            <p>Campbells Bay Tennis club members came to play their regular matches on Wednesday morning, only to find a hole where their honesty box for court fees used to be.</p>

            <p>Club secretary John Roughan told RNZ the offenders dug up the box from the ground and wheeled it away in a rubbish bin.</p>
        
            <p>"They had dug the whole thing up," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Roughan said the honesty box was for non-members to put $10-$20, depending on how many were playing and for how long.</p>
        
            <p>He said the box had not been cleared since before Christmas and could have contained a few hundred dollars by the time it was taken.</p>
        
            <p>"It's shocked us all a bit," said Roughan.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all a bit nonplussed, and wondering who it was, and how it happened."</p>
        
            <p>He said they were told by police there was not much that could be done.</p>
        
            <p>"We probably won't replace the honesty box, we'll go now to a fully electronic, fully online system of paying for casual court hire."</p>
        
            <p>Roughan said they were wanting to improve the security of the park around the tennis club.</p>
        
            <p>He said they had been told by Auckland Council it was the club's responsibility to look after security of the building as the lessee.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to improve the security for the park in general, make sure people can't drive vehicles in there later than they're allowed to.</p>
        
            <p>"We're quite concerned that we're going to get a far more serious break in unless something is done," said Roughan.</p>
        
            <p>"Sports clubs, tennis clubs, are not rich,</p>
        
            <p>"They exist hand to mouth pretty much, so we miss the contributions we can get from casual players."</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment.</p>
