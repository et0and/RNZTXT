            <p>The government has won a long-running pay dispute with the police union.</p>
        
            <p>The parties could not agree on a pay deal after about a year of talks, so an independent arbitrator - employment law specialist Vicki Campbell - was brought in to decide which of the final offers would be adopted.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the arbitrator was in favour of the government's offer, which includes a $1500 lump sum payment, a flat $5000 pay increase for officers, plus another 4 percent increase in July and again in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a 5.25 percent increase in allowances backdated to last November.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association members rejected a similar offer in April, saying it was nowhere enough and staff would leave in droves.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in July, members were furious after the union pulled back its offer in a bid to reach a settlement.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to members seen by RNZ, the Police Association said it was disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>"A recurrent theme in the arbitrator's decision is a need for Police to adhere to the government's fiscal constraints, and that appears to be have been a key determinant behind this outcome," it said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has also seen an email from Police Commissioner Andrew Coster, who acknowledged the process was long and drawn out, and had left staff feeling frustrated and disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>"While this may not be the decision that staff were hoping for, the independent arbitration process has found that the offer was fair," he said.</p>
