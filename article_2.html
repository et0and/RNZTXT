            <p>The installation of a rainbow crossing in Tauranga is bittersweet says the pride advocate who made it happen.</p>
        
            <p>The new zebra crossing was installed on Devonport Rd in the city centre on 18 December flanked by the progress pride flag.</p>
        
            <p>LGBTQIA+ advocate Gordy Lockhart told Local Democracy Reporting he was unhappy that Tauranga City Council hadn't held an opening ceremony for it.</p>
        
            <p>Lockhart campaigned for six years for the crossing and petitioned Tauranga City Council for one in April.</p>
        
            <p>The council's community, transparency and engagement committee approved the crossing in September.</p>
        
            <p>Lockhart said he was so proud that he had a lump in his throat when he first saw the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>"To finally see it on the ground was just so heartwarming. It was wonderful.</p>
        
            <p>"Anybody can now walk down Devonport Road and an LGBT youth can see a symbol that says our community values you.</p>
        
            <p>"As somebody who's been through that process of coming out and being a young gay man in Scotland when it was illegal, for me to have seen that would have been life-changing.</p>
        
            <p>"Not [to] blow my own horn too much, but I did that. I'm so proud. I made a difference and that's brilliant."</p>
        
            <p>This has been "a little bit tainted" by the council's choice not to have an opening or blessing for it, Lockhart said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's probably what makes it bittersweet. Don't get me wrong it's 80 percent absolutely sweet."</p>

            <p>He said he wasn't expecting a ticker tape parade but the same kind of blessing that would be held for any new council building or public infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>In his view, an opening wasn't held because the crossing was deemed "too divisive".</p>
        
            <p>Council general manager of city development and partnerships Gareth Wallis said the council spoke to Rainbow Youth and Gender Dynamix when considering whether to hold a formal event.</p>
        
            <p>"Neither of these groups were in support of an overt opening event or ceremony for the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>"They were content with the installation, its intent, and indicated that they would support installation in their own way."</p>
        
            <p>The council did not as a matter of principle hold an opening event or ceremony for every project completed, Wallis said.</p>
        
            <p>"When we do, it is a collaborative process, that incorporates the views of many different interested and impacted stakeholders.</p>
        
            <p>"Lockhart was updated throughout the installation process and provided our rationale for not progressing an event and allowing the installation."</p>
        
            <p>Lockhart said the two organisations were not representative of the 16,000 people who were part of the LGBTQI+ community in Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>He believed it was being "used as an excuse" to not have an opening.</p>
        
            <p>The council shared photos of the crossing in an Instagram post on 18 December.</p>
        
            <p>The post said the council was "thrilled to unveil our brand new crossing, celebrating love, inclusivity and diversity in our beautiful city".</p>
        
            <p>It has gained 134 likes from the page's 1067 followers.</p>
        
            <p>RainbowYOUTH regional coordinator Leanne Fry said the organisation was incredibly excited about the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's super important for the city to publicly show that everyone is welcome.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of our rangatahi don't feel comfortable or completely safe being openly themselves in public places in the city and this is a good first step towards changing that."</p>
        
            <p>Pedestrian crossings depicting a rainbow flag can also be found in Auckland, Gisborne, Wellington, New Plymouth and Dunedin Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the year, rainbow crossings in Gisborne and Auckland were painted over with white paint, resulting in arrests and charges of alleged vandalism.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga's crossing faced opposition before installation. An online petition was started in September calling for the crossing to be halted because of the estimated $10,000 cost.</p>
        
            <p>The council could not provide the final cost as it had yet to receive the invoices for its installation.</p>
        
            <p>Lockhart had a coffee with some of Tauranga's local councillors on 20 December to unofficially mark the crossing's installation.</p>
