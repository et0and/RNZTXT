            <p>National's bolstered caucus will spend the next two days focused on ensuring its large cohort of new MPs are prepared for the party's first full year back in government.</p>
        
            <p>National MPs have gathered in Christchurch for the party's first annual caucus retreat since being elected in October.</p>
        
            <p>No announcements are expected during the three-day event, with the coalition government still implementing its 100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>National will instead focus on its first-time MPs, who make up more than a third of the party's caucus.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood the party will be instilling the need for discipline on its MPs during the annual caucus retreat.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a focus on team building and ensuring National's 19 new MPs have all the information needed to do the job.</p>
        
            <p>During previous caucus retreats, National MPs have heard from guest speakers, like Australia's former foreign minister Julie Bishop and former British Conservative politician George Osborne, but no one has been lined up to speak at this year's event.</p>
        
            <p>The gathering will be Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's first major appearance for 2024. He arrived in Christchurch last night for an informal BBQ with his MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will address the National caucus on Thursday afternoon and is expected to discuss the year ahead and the issues his government will be focused on.</p>
        
            <p>He will also likely face questions from reporters about the upcoming national hui, due to be held at Tuurangawaewae Marae on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Late last year, the Kiingitanga called for the hui to be held to discuss the coalition government's plans for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi across the country are set to work out a unified response to the coalition government's policies.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will not be attending the hui, but met with Kiingi Tuuheitia on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party will be represented at the hui by Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka and Dan Bidois.</p>
