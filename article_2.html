            <p>Emergency services are investigating a suspicious smell at Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said seven hazmat crews had been sent to assist the Airport Fire Service with an unusual smell that they suspected could be a gas leak.</p>
        
            <p>They said passengers and staff at the airport were safe.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ journalist said their flight from Auckland to Wellington was met by emergency services after it touched down.</p>
        
            <p>A handful of police were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were all off the flight and the situation was very calm, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was an 'engineering delay' when we took off in Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>It smelled like there had been an aviation gas leak, the staffer said.</p>
        
            <p>Another RNZ staffer, who was due to catch the same plane on the next flight from Wellington to Auckland, said their flight - NZ458 - had been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Staff at the airport were trying to get people on new flights or book them accommodation for the night, she said.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
