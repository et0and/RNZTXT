            <p>The demand for relief teachers has come early this year as winter sicknesses - and Covid-19 - impact schools.</p>
        
            <p>Schools have been forced to split classes or send students home as they struggle to find cover for unwell staff.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Mt Cook School in central Wellington asked parents to keep their children home because half of its teachers were off sick with Covid.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Regional Primary Principals' Association confirmed the problem had been building, particularly over the last few weeks, and other schools are finding it hard to get relievers, too.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Relief Teachers' Association chairperson Sally Wallwork said it was not known how many relief teachers there were across the country, but demand had been rife.</p>
        
            <p>Relief had been needed in Auckland and Wellington but she recently heard that Christchurch had also had huge demand for relievers to cover teachers with Covid.</p>
        
            <p>Wallwork told Checkpoint in the last week, a central Auckland school had 12 teachers - a third of its school - off sick.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a common occurrence across the country right now in the main cities."</p>
        
            <p>Schools were having to split classes, which meant each class had more students in it, and in some cases, principals and deputy principals were going into the classroom to cover.</p>
        
            <p>Wallwork said it was "way early" for such demand - as relievers were usually needed in July.</p>
        
            <p>But Wallwork said schools would just have to make do for now.</p>
        
            <p>Sending students who were sick to school would contribute to contaminating others - including relievers who were needed.</p>
        
            <p>"it just makes the problem worse, I believe."</p>
