            <p>A civil defence volunteer in Arthurs Pass village says travellers will be taken back to their vehicles on Monday morning after they were stuck in heavy snow.</p>
        
            <p>About 50 people had an unexpected stay in the village last night, with State Highway 73 closed either side due to heavy snow.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, people in Pahiatua in Tararua District will be continuing to clean up after some homes in the town were flooded on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain on Saturday night left several streets in the town under water, and the council said about two dozen properties were affected.</p>
        
            <p>In inland Canterbury some people were picked up and taken to Arthurs Pass village after their vehicles got stuck on the pass, while others made it there, but couldn't drive any further.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteer Chris Stewart said residents will help people reach their cars this morning, and it looks as if they should be safe to continue their journeys today.</p>
        
            <p>One woman who had an unexpected stay in the village overnight said she was grateful to be put up by some kind locals.</p>
        
            <p>She was on her way home to Rangiora after visiting her daughter on the West Coast, and got caught out when the snow hit far earlier than she thought.</p>
        
            <p>Julie said she was going to sleep in her car, but a motel worker offered her a bed in her house, and she was pleased to have somewhere warm to stay.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has a few warnings in place including for snow on the Desert Road today from 7am to 10pm. Snow showers are expected above 1000 metres.</p>
        
            <p>A similar warning is in place for the Lewis Pass (SH7) through to 8pm today and also for the Lindis Pass (SH8) until 3pm today.</p>
        
            <p>Further south snowfall warnings have been issued for the Crown Range Road (until 10pm) and the Milford Road (SH94) until 11pm.</p>
