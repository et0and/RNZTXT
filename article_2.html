            <p>An Act Party MP is mourning the loss of his son, garnering tributes from the prime minister, other politicians and public figures.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Cameron paid tribute to his son Brody Cameron, 22, on social media on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>He said: "Good speed my son, my boy. I love you always, Dad. RIP."</p>
        
            <p>His son was a former member of the Vikings Rugby Football Club in Northland, playing with the team in 2018 and in the WhangƒÅrei Boys High 1st XV.</p>
        
            <p>Cameron thanked the prime minister for his support and kindness.</p>
        
            <p>Act Party colleague and government minister Karen Chhour said: "Take care, my friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with you."</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 other comments of goodwill and condolences were left on Cameron's tribute.</p>
        
            <p>Holding back tears at his son's service at the Dargaville Rugby Club on Thursday, Cameron said no parent should ever have to bury a child, "yet we are all here".</p>
        
            <p>"Brody Cameron, you are all of my successes and none of my failures... As a father and as a human being, I love you.</p>
        
            <p>"When patience fell to anger [and] frustration for some of us, you found temperance, pause and thought. When apathy beset the many, you found sympathy, empathy and kindness that only a few of us could actually ever parallel. When some looked for shortcomings and weakness and errors of the vulnerable, my boy you found decency, dignity and their blessings.</p>
        
            <p>"Son these are the lessons you gave this world; you gave all of us. The many qualities that I do not have, some here do not have, you brought to all of us," Cameron said.</p>
        
            <p>He added that in his son's absence, the family was lost and the community broken.</p>
        
            <p>"From a father to a son, I say to you tackle the bastards, run straight, leave your shoes and your hat at the door and remember to smile when you're greeted, for we will say hi, you will say hi and we are together.</p>
        
            <p>"I love you, my boy."</p>
