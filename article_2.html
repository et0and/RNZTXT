            <p>Manurewa-Papakura ward councillor Angela Dalton says it's important local people follow the advice to stay inside, particularly those living south of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"Just because of the wind drift. They should stay inside, close all their windows and just stay out of the smoke, until further messaging when it is safe."</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said people should not venture outside to catch a glimpse of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>A FENZ spokesperson said they can't say how widespread the emergency text was sent, but it was targeted at people south of Hunua Road.</p>
        
            <p>A worker at a fish and chip shop a couple of kilometres away from the fire in Papakura said they are still pretty busy with customers.</p>
        
            <p>Ezra, who works at Opaheke Takeaways, said when the fire first started, around 4.30pm, he could see a cloud of smoke the height of a tall building.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a big cloud of black smoke you couldn't see the hills behind it, it was really thick," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ezra said traffic is still at a standstill but the cloud is now grey.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ journalist said Redcrest Avenue, which runs through the middle of the suburb of Red Hill which is adjacent to the fire, is shrouded in smoke, and residents have all pretty quickly hurried inside as the smoke grew thicker and the smell become quite strong.</p>
