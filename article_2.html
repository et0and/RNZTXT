            <p>Heat is the weather word of the day - again.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland just notched up its hottest day in four years, and is heading for another scorcher.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA meteorologist Chris Brandolino told Morning Report that Auckland, Northland and Waikato would be looking at temperatures in the upper 20s. "A few spots will flirt with 30 degrees, which is pretty impressive for this area.</p>
        
            <p>"If you didn't like yesterday, odds are you will not like today. Beaches and pools are where you should cool off."</p>

            <p>As Auckland sits on an isthmus, surrounded by water, it was unusual for our largest city to reach 30C, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions will remain sticky, with humidity predicted to reach 92 percent - and tomorrow would be no different for the upper North Island, Brandolino said.</p>
        
            <p>There was a cold front in the South Island that would gradually move north, but it would not get here in time to avoid another hot day for upper North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, MetService was predicting a much cooler weather pattern for the second half of week; Blenheim was expected to reach 30C today, but would drop to around 20C on Wednesday, so "just hang tight if you don't like the heat", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Parts of the country saw heavy rain yesterday and overnight. The good news was that the heaviest rain was shifting south and would move offshore and wind down as day progressed, he said.</p>
