            <p>About 140 police are ready for a tangi for slain gang member Albert Enoka in the Wellington region as the hunt for the killer continues.</p>
        
            <p>The 39-year-old was shot in the Lower Hutt suburb of Naenae on 10 December.</p>
        
            <p>Police have named 28-year-old Wipuhara Kapene as the man wanted for the killing.</p>
        
            <p>Kapene - who wears heavy Black Power facial tattoos - is considered to be armed and dangerous, and should not be approached.</p>
        
            <p>Police say Wipuhara Kapene has strong links to the Wellington district, including the Wairarapa, and also has links to the Eastern district which includes Hawke's Bay Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>Police warned people should expect traffic delays on Tuesday as the body is taken from Wainuiomata in Lower Hutt to Whenua Tapu Cemetery in Porirua during the late morning.</p>

            <p>Acting Area Commander Inspector Shaun Lingard said officers would be monitoring the funeral and procession to ensure family and mourners could grieve safely and within the law.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got approximately 140 staff available for this operation.</p>
        
            <p>"I would say that's a reasonably large number of police, but as they say it's better to be prepared."</p>
        
            <p>This included police from outside the Wellington region alongside specialist teams. There would be checkpoints in place to monitor the procession, and officers patrolling.</p>
        
            <p>The procession was likely to be on SH1 and SH2 but may also be on the alternative Haywards Hill Road / SH58 route, Lingard told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Police would take action where needed under the Gangs Act which bans gang insignia in public, Lindgard said, and would arrest people and take the patches.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in the early days of the Gangs Act.</p>
        
            <p>This is a very good tool for reducing harm in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"So yes there might be significant numbers thrown into this in the next couple of months, but that will get scaled back because we understand the gangs will start to comply."</p>
