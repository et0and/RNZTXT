            <p>This story discusses details about allegations of sexual assault.</p>
        
            <p>French actor Gérard Depardieu is to be tried over allegations of sexual assault, Paris prosecutors say.</p>
        
            <p>The 75-year-old actor was summoned to a Paris police station on Monday morning, broadcaster BFMTV said.</p>
        
            <p>He was questioned over separate allegations brought by women who worked with Depardieu on film sets in 2014 and 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Depardieu was released from custody later the same day and denies the accusations, his lawyer said.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly afterwards, prosecutors said Depardieu would appear in court in October over the allegations of assault in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"I confirm that following his custody... G. Depardieu has been issued a summons to appear before the criminal court," the Paris public prosecutor told the BBC.</p>
        
            <p>"He will be judged in October 2024 for sexual assaults allegedly committed in September 2021 against two victims, during the filming of the movie 'Les volets verts' (The Green Shutters)."</p>
        
            <p>One of the woman involved in the incident alleges the assault took place on the set of the film, which was released the following year.</p>
        
            <p>Her lawyer told BFMTV her client was "passing through a corridor where Mr Depardieu was sitting.</p>
        
            <p>"He grabbed her, trapped her between his legs and touched her body up to her breasts.</p>
        
            <p>"She felt completely powerless, incapable of escaping this trap."</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, the actor was charged with the rape of actor Charlotte Arnould, when she was 22-years-old in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>In its statement on Monday evening, the prosecutor said: "Additionally, G. Depardieu is under investigation (in another case) for the offenses of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed in August 2018 against Charlotte Arnould.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigating judge concluded their inquiries on 17 April 2024, and forwarded the case to the Paris prosecutor's office to gather their recommendations on the next steps to take".</p>
        
            <p>A separate case was brought by actor Hélène Darras but was dropped by prosecutors for being past the statute of limitations.</p>
        
            <p>Depardieu has also been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women.</p>
        
            <p>He denies wrongdoing and claims any relationships he has had were consensual.</p>
        
            <p>In an open letter published last year, he said: "Never, ever have I abused a woman".</p>
        
            <p>Oscar-nominated Depardieu is a prominent figure in French and international cinema, having made more than 200 films.</p>
