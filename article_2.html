            <p>The winner of Lotto's first equal biggest prize is yet to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>One lucky player in Auckland will be sitting on the winning ticket worth a record-breaking $44 million.</p>
        
            <p>The winning numbers were 24,17, 25, 30, 6, and 3. The bonus number was 36 and the Powerball number was 1.</p>
        
            <p>The winner also gets the $1 million Lotto prize, matching the record for the largest prize in Lotto history, held by an Auckland couple who won $44.06 million in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Fourteen other Lotto players also won $66,667 with Lotto First Division. The winning tickets were sold at Relay Auckland Domestic Airport in Auckland, Caltex Dinsdale in Hamilton, and on MyLotto to players from Northland, Auckland and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, two Strike players also won $250,000 with Strike Four. The winning Strike tickets were sold on MyLotto to players from Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Lotto NZ head of corporate communications Lucy Fullarton said the best thing the winner of the $44m prize could do was call Lotto NZ's Customer Support team.</p>
        
            <p>"We will then walk them through how to claim their prize and pass on the many pieces of valuable advice our previous big winners have shared with us," she said.</p>
