            <p>Corrections staff were allegedly bribed with sex and money to take contraband into Rimutaka Prison.</p>
        
            <p>Six people have been charged with corruption and bribery after a three-year investigation by police into the Upper Hutt jail.</p>
        
            <p>A 50-year-old man, who cannot be named, appeared in Hutt Valley District Court on Tuesday for allegedly accepting sex twice from a woman named Jacinta Cherry, 37, as a bribe to smuggle contraband into the prison.</p>
        
            <p>But Cherry, who is charged with bribing the man, failed to appear and Judge Tim Black refused her lawyer's request for name suppression. He also issued a warrant for her arrest.</p>
        
            <p>A current Rimutaka inmate is allegedly party to offering that bribe, while three men have been charged with accepting money to bring in contraband.</p>
