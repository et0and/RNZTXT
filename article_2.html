            <p>The government has agreed to toll three new highways being built in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The three are Ōtaki to north of Levin, Penlink in north Auckland, and the Takitimu North Link.</p>
        
            <p>These will become the first new toll roads in years, and double the existing number of tolled highways, from three to six.</p>
        
            <p>But tolls would not be put on the new Manawatū-Tararua Highway that replaces the old Manawatū Gorge highway.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, the government announced that existing roads can be tolled too, if they gain capacity or are extended by new projects.</p>
        
            <p>This is a major change as currently existing roads cannot be tolled.</p>
        
            <p>The 7km Penlink will join Whangaparāoa to State Highway One.</p>
        
            <p>Takitimu North Link is a 7km route north of Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>The stretch to be tolled north of Wellington picks up State Highway One from where it has been upgraded to date as far as Ōtaki.</p>
        
            <p>"Tolling on these roads will support the ongoing cost of delivering these roads and maintaining and operating them," Transport Minister Simeon Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will help motorists in Auckland, Tauranga, and Greater Wellington gain faster, safer, and more reliable journeys."</p>
        
            <p>Each route would offer a free, viable alternative, as is the current requirement by law.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, suggestions the Manawatū-Tararua highway might be tolled sparked local outrage.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said "late consultation and timing constraints" mean it would not be cost-effective to toll it till well after the road's completion, placing it outside expectations for new tolling.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, existing roads cannot be tolled, and toll revenue must be used only to help run the highway it applies to.</p>
        
            <p>But the new changes announced by Brown would allow tolling of a whole corridor - a new highway and existing roads that connect to it.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes will enable the ... [NZTA] to consider tolling in circumstances beyond what is currently possible," said Brown in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The government is already requiring every new highway project to consider using tolls, under its GPS (government policy statement) on land transport.</p>
        
            <p>On top of that, the new policies will set an automatic inflation adjustment to toll fees and require trucks to use toll roads where a road was designed to divert traffic away from built-up or suburban areas.</p>
        
            <p>A viable free alternative route must be available - as is the case now.</p>
        
            <p>A $100m-plus tech upgrade is underway. Brown said the law would also be changed to toll the vehicle owner rather than the driver to make it easier to collect payments.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation would be introduced next year.</p>
