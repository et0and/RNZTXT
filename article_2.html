            <p>A new bill to make serving drinks at hair salons legal has surprised the industry, with many unaware they were in breach of the law.</p>
        
            <p>East Coast MP Dana Kirkpatrick said a 2008 regulation made serving things like tea, coffee, or alcohol at hair salons illegal, which the new bill sought to change.</p>
        
            <p>"We just think people should be able to relax a bit, have a glass of bubbles while they get their hair transformed and basically have a good time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hair salon owner Grant Bettjeman told Checkpoint he thought the industry as a whole was "blissfully oblivious" that he practice of serving drinks was illegal.</p>
        
            <p>"Its offered, I would say, completely across our industry," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you go into a salon, its not just about the cut and the style, it's about the experience you have there."</p>
        
            <p>The business offered tea, coffee, wine after 5.00pm, and even had a restaurant service from next door.</p>
        
            <p>No health inspector had ever raised any concerns, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have health department checks and we're very strict about health and hygiene in our sort of industry ... but they've never, in my memory, ever said that we couldn't serve a hot drink in the salon."</p>
        
            <p>Clients would be "very disappointed " if they were no longer able to be served refreshments at the salon, Bettjeman said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not to be able to have a coffee or a tea while you read the latest magazine while your hair is processing just seems unbelievable really.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think they'd like it one iota, and I think we'd see it as a huge drop in service."</p>

            <p>The bill also proposed to allow small dogs in salons.</p>
        
            <p>"We know dogs in a handbag are no threat to anybody, and we love our little mates and they go everywhere with us these days," Kirkpatrick said.</p>
        
            <p>This was also absolutely fine as well, Bettjeman said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really mind about dogs at all, really ... as long as they don't disrupt the rest of the the salon.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that the health department has been a bit strict about dogs in salon, and I've always found that ... a bit overkill."</p>
