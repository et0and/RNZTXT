        <h2>Enchanter trial: Skipper not guilty of breaching duties</h2>
        <p>
Five men died after a monster wave capsized the boat near North Cape. The judge says he could not be sure skipper Lance Goodhew could have forseen that coming.

            <p>A Northland charter boat skipper has been found not guilty following a trial relating to the Enchanter tragedy that claimed five lives off North Cape in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Lance Goodhew, of Mangōnui, was charged by Maritime New Zealand with breaching his duties as a worker on the vessel, putting his passengers and crew at risk of serious injury or death.</p>
        
            <p>The harrowing, three-week-long trial was held in the Whangārei District Court in May, with Judge Philip Rzepecky delivering his verdict this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Rzepecky said the terrible tragedy was caused by a significant rogue wave in otherwise benign conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot rule out the possibility that the cause of this tragic maritime casualty was just a terrible accident, and not a cause from which anyone was actually responsible for.</p>
        
            <p>"Therefore I'm not satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case against Mr Goodhew in respect of a single charge beyond reasonable doubt."</p>
        
            <p>He could not be sure Goodhew could have foreseen the wave given the information he had at the time.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come ...</p>
