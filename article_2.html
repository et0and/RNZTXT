            <p>Mayor Helen Lash has declared a local state of emergency for the southern ward of Westland District.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as parts of the West Coast experience their wettest night in decades as emergency managers continue to closely monitor the situation.</p>
        
            <p>Orange level rain warnings are in place for Westland until at least this afternoon, with a small chance warnings could escalate to red.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Civil Defence has partially activated its emergency operations centre, with emergency managers meeting later on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>About 350 millimetres of rain had fallen across the coast in the 24 hours to 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Franz Josef experienced its wettest 24 hours in 45 years.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management minister Mark Mitchell earlier said Westland residents should stay off the roads as heavy rain continues to fall.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said Emergency Management officials and the community are well prepared, but they need to stay vigilant, and stay off the roads if they can.</p>

            <p>He said the main area of concern is the Waiho river near Franz Joseph, which experts are keeping a close eye on.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, State Highway Six between Haast and Fox Glacier was closed because of a slip.</p>
        
            <p>The highway between Haast and Makarora was also closed, due to flooding.</p>
        
            <p>There was no detour for either section of highway.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, warnings of heavy rain are still in force for other parts of the South Island, as a strong wind watch for Canterbury High Country.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued orange heavy rain warnings for Grey and Buller until 9pm Saturday, with 100 to 130mm of rain expected.</p>

            <p>Canterbury High Country is still under strong wind watch until noon Saturday, with a moderate chance to upgrading to a warning, as some northwest winds may approach severe gale in exposed places.</p>
