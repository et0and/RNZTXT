            <p>Bird flu has spread to another shed on an Otago farm, the Ministry for Primary Industries has confirmed</p>
        
            <p>MPI's chief veterinary office, Mary van Andel, said 80,000 chickens would now need to be culled at Mainland Poultry's Hillgrove Egg Farm, doubling from 40,000.</p>
        
            <p>She says there's no indication the H7N6 virus has spread beyond the farm.</p>
        
            <p>But van Andel told Morning Report it was not unexpected for the disease to spread between sheds on the same property.</p>
        
            <p>The farm has four sheds in total with 160,000 birds across them.</p>
        
            <p>"We're preparing to take measures across all of those sheds if it is required," van Andel said.</p>
        
            <p>It was not a region with very dense poutry production and six other farms were to be tested.</p>
        
            <p>Van Andel said the virus can spread with human movements.</p>
        
            <p>"It's moving with the movements of people, equipment and machinary, those types of things," she said</p>
        
            <p>Van Andel was confident the the country could continue free range farming.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Federated Farmers' Luke Kane told Morning Report he wasn't surprised by the spread as it appeared the sheds were in close proximity to each other.</p>
        
            <p>The detection of the virus on the farm would be difficult for those involved, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's taking a toll on all the people that are involved here, the staff, the owners, everybody."</p>
        
            <p>Kane said the industry needed to be aware of the risk of farm birds interacting with native or wild birds.</p>
        
            <p>The outbreak should not result in an egg shortage, the Finance Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis told First Up there was also no risk to humans.</p>
        
            <p>"They've done the right thing and reported early so we're in a good position here and there are no further reports of any avian flu symptoms at any other poultry farms so at this point it appears contained.</p>
        
            <p>"The other thing I really want people to know is there are no food safety concerns, there's no evidence that people can be affected with this strain."</p>
