        <h2>Council pays influencers to boost tourism in Mid Canterbury</h2>
        <p>
It's costing ratepayers about $7000 but the council says it's creating profit for local businesses.

            <p>Ratepayer-funded social media influencers are paying off in Mid Canterbury, local tourism operators say.</p>
        
            <p>Ashburton District Council is paying influencers to show off the region as part of its district promotion strategy.</p>
        
            <p>It's costing ratepayers about $7000 but district promotions lead Shelley Donnelly said the paid-for content is creating profit for local businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Donnelly has been engaging specific influencers based on their audience.</p>
        
            <p>Influencer Lilia Alexander recently shared posts of her jetboating the Rakaia Gorge, in a hot tub while glamping and visiting the Ashburton Aviation Museum.</p>
        
            <p>The social media posts can capture "lots of likes, shares, and saves which can be vanity metrics", but the aim is boosting the economy, Donnelly said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's money in the bank that we want to see. The revenue for our operators and that's the feedback I'm definitely getting".</p>
        
            <p>Donnelly said feedback from local operators showed the influencer posts had boosted business.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Sommers who runs Dirt Bandits, a UTV motorsport experience in Methven, participated in the promotion.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had a busy December on the back of some influencer posts and felt it was money well spent.</p>

            <p>"The influencers produced good content and the engagement with their audience is quite high.</p>
        
            <p>"If they influence their audience, it's small dollars."</p>
        
            <p>Sommers praised Donelly's work in promoting the district and noted that the participating tourism operators were providing experiences for the influencers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not like we are sitting back getting the council to do all the work, we are vested in the process."</p>
        
            <p>Traditionally Methven dies after the ski season shuts but hasn't this year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't say it's especially what Shelly and her team are doing but something is working.</p>
        
            <p>"More tourists are visiting Methven and the district."</p>
        
            <p>Ashburton Aviation Museum's Owen Moore said the venue had "the busiest December and January ever by a long shot" after featuring in influencer posts.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't guarantee it's because of them, but we've been the busiest we've ever been so you would think it has something to do with it".</p>
        
            <p>The Museum doesn't ask where visitors found out about the venue, but will when its new facility - currently being constructed- opens, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Council compliance and development group manager Ian Hyde said the council is spending about $7000, which is about 4 percent of the $160,590 district promotion budget for 2024/25, hosting five content creator visits in the district.</p>
        
            <p>The visits included New Zealand travel content creator Lilia Alexander spending a week in December visiting 19 operators, with one TikTok video at Erewhon Station having over 2.1 million views.</p>
        
            <p>Over 4000 photos and videos were commissioned through Alexander's visit that operators and Experience Mid Canterbury (the tourism arm of the council) can use in their own promotional activities.</p>
        
            <p>Alexander said using social media is cost-effective as she is able to produce videos "at a much lower cost than traditional professional videography and film crew style commercials".</p>
        
            <p>"Viewers these days simply don't want to see a commercial, they want to see a real person's experience, captured in a way that feels organic and relatable."</p>
        
            <p>Another to visit the district in January was Brit Cunningham, a social media influencer from Auckland with over 5,000 TikTok followers.</p>
        
            <p>Donnelly said her followers, predominantly women aged 25 to 40 in Australia and New Zealand, "send her photos of what they are doing that she did - to try and live her life".</p>
        
            <p>A travel writer from Air New Zealand's in-flight magazine, Kia Ora, also spent five days in Mid Canterbury in January.</p>
        
            <p>Donnelly said the writer raved about her experience - apart from "one flat tyre in the conservation park" - and the article will feature in the April magazine.</p>
        
            <p>Hyde said the council did not pay the writer but covered expenses of about $700 for the trip.</p>
