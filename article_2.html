            <p>The alleged victim in what a military prosecutor says was a violent attack by two soldiers on a junior colleague can now be identified as a man who drowned in an unrelated incident last year.</p>
        
            <p>Gunner Nikau Minhinnick Gill died when trying to rescue his dog from the Manawatū River in Palmerston North in November. He was 21.</p>
        
            <p>His name was suppressed, but Judge Mina Wharepouri on Thursday removed the interim order in place at a Court Martial at Linton Military Camp near Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>A military panel was now deciding the fate of two soldiers accused of assaulting Gill, their junior colleague, at the end of an international operation in Hawaii.</p>
        
            <p>It was alleged Sergeant Leaongo Tanginoa and Bombardier Gus Nove attacked him in the early hours of the 25 November, 2023, at Schofield Barracks, after he was drunk and abusive.</p>
        
            <p>The prosecution said the pair punched and kicked Gill, and Tanginoa strangled him, causing him to lose consciousness as they beat him for mouthing off.</p>

            <p>But the defence said Gill was drunk and insubordinate, and the accused were restraining him, slapping him to calm him.</p>
        
            <p>Tanginoa has pleaded guilty to one charge of striking.</p>
        
            <p>Gill and his friends cooked up a story so he did not get in trouble for his behaviour, the defence said.</p>
        
            <p>Three senior military officers retired on Thursday afternoon to consider their verdicts for the five charges each Tanginoa and Nove have pleaded not guilty to.</p>
        
            <p>In closing, military prosecutor John Whitcombe said the accused were confronted with abuse and insubordination.</p>
        
            <p>"After Gunner Gill continually refused to listen to them they lost their tempers and meted out some barrack room justice."</p>
        
            <p>Gill mouthed off at Tanginoa over alleged ill-treatment during the operation, and the two accused left him wounded, including a mild brain injury, as they attacked him inside and outside the Hawaiian barracks.</p>
        
            <p>Tanginoa strangled Gill, causing him to lose consciousness, and he and Nove landed more than 20 kicks and punches.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with military police Gill did not minimise his own poor behaviour, such as calling Tanginoa a dick, so his account was reliable, Whitcombe said.</p>
        
            <p>"He told the whole story even when it didn't paint him in a particularly good light," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, nothing he did that night justified or warranted the response of Sergeant Tanginoa or Bombardier Nove."</p>
        
            <p>Whitcombe dismissed defence suggestions of a concocted story and said statements the accused made to military police, where Tanginoa admitted slapping Gill twice, and Nove admitted four slaps, were not consistent with the injuries suffered.</p>
        
            <p>Tanginoa's defence lawyer Steve Winter said Tanginoa did at one stage grab Gill by the collar and slap him, partly in self-defence, and this could have resulted in some injuries to the neck.</p>
        
            <p>Winter said Gill was drunk, aggressive and up for a fight, and his friends lied about what happened to excuse his behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Their evidence was in conflict to two defence witnesses, who did not see punches or kicks.</p>
        
            <p>Tanginoa was honest when speaking with military police, making admissions that he lost his temper and had slapped Gill, even when that did not look good for him, Winter said.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast Gill and his friends got together and came up with a story, starting the morning after the fracas when they photographed the soldier's injuries, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're building a case already against Sergeant Tanginoa and Bombardier Nove."</p>
        
            <p>Nove's defence lawyer Matthew Hague said Nove did not kick or punch Gill, nor threaten him to keep quiet, as the prosecution alleges.</p>
        
            <p>Hague disputed that Gill's account was truthful, and said he did not tell military police he confronted and pursued Tanginoa, and refused to go to bed when ordered to.</p>
        
            <p>He echoed Winter's comments about the unreliability of some witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>Nove admitted he slapped Gill to shut him up, but that was not the subject of the striking charges, which alleged punches were thrown.</p>
        
            <p>The military panel was continuing its deliberations.</p>
