            <p>Parents and staff of a Waitara community childcare centre are shellshocked it has been forced to close.</p>
        
            <p>Early Childhood Council CEO Simon Laube says the 52 children who attend Waitara & District Community Childcare have been left with nowhere to go and families left reeling.</p>
        
            <p>"They are absolutely devastated and distraught. I've been to the centre that is a treasured part of the Waitara community. There is nowhere for these children to go."</p>
        
            <p>The centre, which has a 44 year history, leases part of a building managed by Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand (LINZ).</p>
        
            <p>Laube said LINZ had been responsible for a series of blunders.</p>
        
            <p>The childcare had been served a 90 days' notice to vacate which expired in May, but this week it was revealed that suspected black mould in another part of the building - not used by the centre - was the reason behind the notice.</p>
        
            <p>Laube said the Ministry of Education stepped in to close Waitara & District Community Childcare almost immediately, leaving staff shellshocked and local parents stranded without childcare.</p>
        
            <p>"Early childhood centres keep getting treated like they don't matter.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe LINZ knew about the suspected black mould in their part of the building as far back as 2019, and yet they took no steps to manage it or disclose it to our provider until yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"They've effectively terminated this treasured community childcare centre without compassion, transparency or taking responsibility," said Laube.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in disbelief at having to temporarily shut our centre due to LINZ negligence. Through failing to meet their responsibilities and maintain the building, we're having to close the centre and find alternative premises."</p>
        
            <p>Waitara & District Community Childcare centre director Beth Moeahu said the centre's closure was very upsetting</p>
        
            <p>"We're a tight knit community and it's been devastating having to share this with our whānau - there will be a massive financial and emotional impact on them and their children.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of LINZ's poor management of these buildings, the Waitara community is set to lose a childcare centre with community ties that go back generations.</p>
        
            <p>"Questions need to be asked about whether LINZ's management of buildings they lease to early childhood providers is up to scratch, because in this case, they've not been responsible landlords."</p>
        
            <p>Laube said hoped the centre could be saved.</p>
        
            <p>"We have not given up hope - while we understand the MOE is helping WDCC find temporary accommodation, we intend to call a community meeting and invite the government officials to share their plans, so we can understand what went wrong and try again to find solutions."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education and LINZ have been asked for comment.</p>
