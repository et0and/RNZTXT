            <p>A south Auckland man's dream of building his beach community their first pump track for kids may finally come true.</p>
        
            <p>Byron Scott has tried for years to build a track in the Maraetai and Beachlands area.</p>
        
            <p>He had the expertise and the funds but lacked the space to bring his dreams of a 360 square metre asphalt track to life.</p>
        
            <p>"Originally we tried to get one in ÅŒmana Regional Park, which we weren't able to do," Scott said.</p>
        
            <p>"We then tried the local schools, but they don't really have space."</p>
        
            <p>His company, Trailpro, built asphalt pump tracks and bike tracks in schools and for councils, all over the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>"We just didn't have one in our community ... we have to travel to Papakura for a decent one.</p>
        
            <p>"And, our local skate park is very dilapidated and very basic; and needs an upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>"As a father of three young boys, I find it sad that my boys have no where to go to skate or bike."</p>
        
            <p>Scott was willing to put up more than $100,000 for the project, and got in touch with the Franklin Local Board to help secure a space.</p>
        
            <p>Constellation Park on Beachlands was their final opportunity to finally build the pump track.</p>
        
            <p>Constellation Park was considered a suitable site by local board staff, and had adequate space to accommodate the proposed facility.</p>
        
            <p>The park currently had a playground that catered to younger children, had a concrete circular pathway and bike racks.</p>

            <p>At the recent local board meeting in December, Scott said his company was in a position now to bring this dream to reality and wanted to build this summer.</p>
        
            <p>"I am willing to meet all costs to make this happen in our area, this includes a high level design plus labour and materials to build it.</p>
        
            <p>"A track of this value normally costs around $80-100k but I wish to donate this to the community."</p>
        
            <p>He said they were also going to reach out to the community for help in fundraising for special material.</p>
        
            <p>"We really need this facility."</p>
        
            <p>Franklin Local Board voted in December to fast-track the process and have limited consultation, as well as find funding in their budget to contribute to the project.</p>
        
            <p>Board member Logan Soole said he fully supported the project and didn't want to miss the opportunity of valuable funding from a resident, to build an important community asset.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important we don't miss out on this," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope we can get consultation on this as quickly as possible ... [I'm] always in support going to full consultation but we need to speed this up before we lose this investment."</p>
        
            <p>Scott said it was not just about building a pump track for his kids, but one for the whole community.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel for the local kids that don't have somewhere to go, and that's what this is all about.</p>
        
            <p>"The area is very bike-centric, so there are a lot of people keen on bikes, so this is, I think, a piece of the puzzle that's missing."</p>
