            <p>The crash has been described as sounding like a "bomb".</p>
        
            <p>"It is quite frightening to hear, that noise of a helicopter crashing," QAS senior operations supervisor Caitlin Denning said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been reports it sounded like a bomb, and seeing smoke and fire from that, a lot of the occupants of the hotel were very unsure about the situation at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of unease at the evacuation centre."</p>
        
            <p>Two people in the building were taken to Cairns Hospital in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>It is unknown how many people were in the helicopter, or their condition.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is sending a team of investigators.</p>
        
            <p>Hotel guests have been evacuated to a nearby hotel.</p>
