        <h2>Battle to contain Waipoua fire continues</h2>
        <p>
There will be a big push today to fully contain a 100-hectare fire near Northland's Waipoua Settlement, in the hope 20 people evacuated four days ago can return home. Audio

            <p>There will be a big push today to fully contain a 100-hectare fire near Northland's Waipoua Settlement.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says if that is successful, 20 people evacuated four days ago could go home on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Incident controller Corey Matchitt said that would also depend on the health risk posed by smoke, which filled the valley in the mornings before the wind came up.</p>
        
            <p>One hundred firefighters, many of them freshly arrived from Auckland, are fighting the fire today.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Kaipara's Mayor is confident the world's largest surviving Kauri tree is safe from the fire.</p>
        
            <p>A total fireban has now been imposed across much of Northland at the top of the Far North, around Hokianga, and the Ripiro and Paparoa fire districts.</p>
        
            <p>Craig Jepson told Saturday Morning that despite the blaze being some kilometres away, there was no danger towards Tane Mahuta at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>Jepson expected the fire to be fully extinguished in a week.</p>
