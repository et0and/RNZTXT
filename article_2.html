            <p>A 22-year-old man has been arrested in relation to a violent home invasion in Fairfield, Hamilton on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Mike Kaukau said the two women were attacked by an unknown man at the Paul Crescent address.</p>
        
            <p>The man forced his way into the property about 7.30pm. He has been charged with burglary, and two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>The victims were taken to hospital with serious injuries. They are in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a terrifying event for the victims to endure," Kaukau said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody has the right to feel safe in their home."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no ongoing threat to the public, but there would be a heightened police presence in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in the Hamilton District Court on 4 December.</p>
