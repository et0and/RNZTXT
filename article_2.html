        <h2>Mahé Drysdale lives 100km from the city he hopes to run</h2>
        <p>
But the mayoral candidate says he has worked in the city, grew up there and, if elected, will move at the end of the year.

            <p>If Mahé Drysdale is successful in becoming mayor of Tauranga City he will be the only mayor in the country to live outside his city boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>He will also be the only sitting mayor to have successfully won a mayoralty while living outside the area.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale currently lives in Waikato's Waipā District - nearly 100km and an hour's drive away - and said he would not immediately move to Tauranga City if elected.</p>
        
            <p>Over the last several weeks, RNZ has asked all district, city and unitary councils if their mayor lived within the area. All 66 currently do.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ also asked if the mayor lived within the district when they ran for mayor. Again, 100 percent did.</p>
        
            <p>In Kawerau District Council, for example, mayor Faylene Tunui lived within the district prior to the 2022 elections, as did Malcolm Campbell for the 21 years he held the mayoralty.</p>
        
            <p>Buller mayor Jamie Cleine was born in the district and had lived there "for all of his 47 years", a council spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>In South Waikato, a council spokesperson said the area was basically in the DNA of their mayor Gary Petley, who had lived in either Tokoroa or Putāruru most of his life.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale was surprised to learn he was trying to achieve something no other current mayor had done.</p>
        
            <p>However, despite not living in Tauranga his links to the city were strong, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be weird if I went and ran for Palmerston North, or somewhere that I had no links or knowledge of, but I'm very familiar with Tauranga."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale had worked in the city for the past two and a half years, it was where he grew up and is the city he considers home.</p>
        
            <p>He is no stranger to having to move for work, he said - indeed, he moved to Waipā for his rowing career.</p>
        
            <p>The fact he lived outside Tauranga had not been an issue on the campaign trail, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"People are curious as to what my intention is, but there are other mayoral candidates in the race who also live outside [Tauranga] and I think people accept what my links are to the city."</p>
        
            <p>If elected mayor, Drysdale said he plans to move to Tauranga with his young family once the current school year is over.</p>
