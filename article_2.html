            <p>Politicians are in for a pay rise after the Remuneration Authority determined MPs salaries should go up by 2.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The independent body, responsible for setting pay for key public office holders, has reported back on its review into MP's remuneration on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>An ordinary MPs' salary will rise from $163,961 to $168,600, a 2.8 percent rise backdated to last October.</p>
        
            <p>That will be followed by another 2.9 percent bump from July, a further 2.4 percent next year, and then 2 percent in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's salary will rise from $471,000 to $484,200 and then $520,000 by 2026, with the deputy prime minister's salary increasing to $344,100.</p>
        
            <p>However, Christopher Luxon has indicated he does not want or need the increase - and will be donating his to charity.</p>
        
            <p>Ministers inside Cabinet will earn $304,300 and Ministers outside Cabinet $256,800.</p>
        
            <p>Although the Remuneration Authority sets the pay for these roles, Parliament can pass legislation to overrule it.</p>
        
            <p>This happened in 2018, when Dame Jacinda Ardern instituted a pay freeze for MPs and in 2020 when her Cabinet voted to take a pay cut during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>It has been 20 years since MP remuneration was fully reviewed and more than six since politicians got a pay rise.</p>
        
            <p>The Remuneration Authority is legally required to consider "prevailing adverse economic conditions" when determining remuneration rates.</p>
        
            <p>In this review, it formed the view there was not a compelling case that meets this legislative test.</p>
        
            <p>The authority looked at the pay of MPs in other Westminster style democracies and remuneration paid elsewhere within New Zealand in both the public and private sectors.</p>
        
            <p>The comparisons showed New Zealand MPs' salaries were less than the salaries of almost all those comparisons.</p>
