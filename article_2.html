            <p>Jetstar has admitted it has not paid some Kiwi travellers - who are legally entitled to a compensation - after having their domestic flights delayed or cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The airline has apologised for "letting customers down" and admitted its communication and customer service for New Zealanders has been below par, particularly in recent years amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>An alert had been issued on Jetstar's website offering customers the ability to lodge historical claims if flights had been delayed or cancelled due to reasons "within the airline's control".</p>
        
            <p>It comes a day after it was revealed Australia's biggest airline Qantas had agreed to pay a penalty of AUD$100 million (NZD$110m) to settle a legal case accusing it of selling thousands of tickets for flights it had already cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Under the deal with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the airline was set to launch a plan worth up to AUD$20m (NZD$22m) to compensate affected passengers.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Jetstar said its restart following the pandemic was a difficult time, for both travellers and airlines, and its communication and customer service "could have been better".</p>
        
            <p>"We sincerely apologise for letting customers down during this time," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are encouraging anyone who feels they may not have received adequate compensation for a New Zealand flight disruption to contact us to have their case reviewed."</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear what had prompted the claim proposal or how many passengers it may affect.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Civil Aviation Act, passengers have rights to either compensation or a refund if certain "engineering requirements or crew limitations" have disrupted scheduled flights.</p>
        
            <p>"Where your domestic flight has been delayed or cancelled for reasons within Jetstar's control, you may have rights under the Civil Aviation Act.</p>
        
            <p>"Different laws apply to international travel.</p>
        
            <p>"You may also have rights under consumer laws such as the Consumer Guarantees Act."</p>
        
            <p>The airline was extending an offer for a secondary claim to passengers who felt a previous request for reimbursement "was not handled correctly".</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar said the customers can claim for a review if their flight was disrupted prior to 7 May 2024.</p>
