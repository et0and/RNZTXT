            <p>It's no secret that social media has been obsessed with the viral Dubai chocolate, but the original creator of the culinary trend told CNN she didn't think it would reach globally.</p>
        
            <p>Sarah Hamouda, founder of FIX, aka 'Freaking Incredible Experience', started her business in 2021 as a side hustle. Inspired by her pregnancy cravings, Hamouda set out to create something different than the "typical" chocolate fix.</p>
        
            <p>The bars have fillings based on Middle Eastern flavours like karak (spiced tea blend), dates and knafeh, an Arabic dessert with shredded pastry, pistachios, sweet cheese and syrup.</p>
        
            <p>Hamouda told CNN she's "awed" by the global response, and is flattered by recreations.</p>
        
            <p>"We get messages from people saying, 'thank you for inspiring us to be creative at home,' so that's something that I'm proud of."</p>
        
            <p>More than 80 million people watched the viral TikTok of a food Influencer eating different FIX chocolate bars.</p>
        
            <p>The exclusive FIX Dubai Chocolate bars usually sell out 500 in just minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Hamouda says keeping up with demand is a challenge. Within months, FIX grew from just her and her husband, to a team of 10 in a rented kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa's own recreator is so popular people are travelling from WhangƒÅrei and Hamilton to queue up at Botany Night Markets for 'WhiskedCreationsbyNiki's' take on the viral chocolate bar.</p>
        
            <p>Paddy Gower tried the famous recreations and said it's viral for one simple reason, "it tastes pretty good".</p>
        
            <p>'WhiskedCreationsbyNiki' creator Niki Joel told Stuff she made her recreations as a Mother's Day gift, but immediately got requests across the country from desperate chocolate lovers.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a woman who was pregnant from Hamilton, she made an order, but was worried how long it was going to take as she was desperate to get her hands on it. It came in the morning and she gave birth in the afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>The original FIX gooey chocolate bars are only available in Dubai, but Hamouda has messages of support all the way from Canada to Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>"It's insane what's been happening.</p>
        
            <p>"Every trend has its moment. But I think we have so much more to give and I think this is just the beginning for us."</p>
