            <p>Three people remain persons of interest in the death of Baby Ru, but no charges have yet been laid six months on, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The toddler, now known as Nga Reo Te Huatahi Reremoana Ahipene-Wall, died of serious head injuries at Hutt Hospital in October.</p>
        
            <p>No-one has yet been charged over his death - the result of blunt force trauma to his head, either inflicted by a weapon or by slamming his tiny skull on a hard floor or table, according to police.</p>
        
            <p>Police previously said three people of interest were at the house at the time of the toddler's injuries, but there was not enough evidence to arrest them.</p>
        
            <p>They had been revealed as the child's mother (Storm Wall), another woman called Rosie Morunga and her partner Dylan Ross.</p>
        
            <p>The toddler's great aunt, Sarah Jane Reremoana, who cared for him as a baby, told RNZ last month the lack of progress was frustrating for the whānau.</p>
        
            <p>The family's grief had been made worse by being abused and attacked online, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Born premature, he faced many challenged, Reremoana said.</p>
        
            <p>"No matter what medical obstacles he had, Nga Reo was a good baby, [he] always had a smile, never wanted much, loved big hugs and kisses and he is missed so much."</p>

            <p>A dedicated team was reviewing a significant amount of material and following active lines of enquiry, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are determined to get justice for Baby Ru and provide closure for his whānau and the wider community."</p>
        
            <p>Police urged anyone with information that could help the investigation to come forward.</p>
