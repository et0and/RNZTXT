            <p>Wellington's mayor says councillors should look to "share the pain" across the city as they consider project cuts following the airport vote.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly two weeks ago the council voted to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The sale had been part of its long-term plan (LTP), adopted in June.</p>
        
            <p>Now the council has to undergo a LTP amendment process, which will involve community consultation and a final vote on the changes in June next year.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tory Whanau warned that the council will have to look at cuts as a result of the vote.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released on Monday, Whanau said that she had met with councillors again on Monday afternoon discuss the amendment process. She said it would be fast-moving, with the hope of having key elements of a draft amendment ready by the end of the year.</p>

            <p>Whanau said making savings would be a difficult process, and councillors had discussed what should inform those changes.</p>
        
            <p>"As a top priority I think every councillor agrees that the LTP amendment decisions should not further increase rates and should not reduce funding for water.</p>
        
            <p>"The focus is on reducing new infrastructure and community building projects as these are debt-funded."</p>
        
            <p>She said she would also seek to avoid cuts to the council's provision of social housing and climate action.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said reductions to community projects were difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"Where these are considered, it is my view that we should seek to share the pain as much as possible across different wards and between the central city and suburbs."</p>
        
            <p>The mayor's office shared the following dates for the long-term plan amendment process:</p>
        
            <p>The statement came as the city council was under pressure due to threats from the government of intervention in the council due to the recent vote.</p>
        
            <p>An urgent meeting was held last week between councillors, which was followed up by a meeting between Whanau and Local Government Minister Simeon Brown on Thursday last week.</p>
