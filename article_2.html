            <p>The NRL is no fairytale world.</p>
        
            <p>'The Prince of Penrose' couldn't produce any final pieces of magic, as the Warriors succumbed to the Bulldogs 34-18 in Shaun Johnson's last outing in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The final chapter of the Johnson story was scripted like much of his 10-year-career with the Warriors - beginning with promise, but ending in heartache.</p>
        
            <p>It was a frustrating finale, which saw glimpses of the generational player's wizardry, but it was not enough, as frequent handling errors and defensive lapses saw the swansong fall flat.</p>
        
            <p>It marks the end of a forgettable season at home for the Warriors, with the faithful also saying goodbye to Jazz Tevaga and Addin Fonua-Blake, with just one match remaining against the Sharks next week.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson bows out as arguably the the greatest Warrior of all time.</p>
        
            <p>He told the fans in attendance that it was a special night, and thanked them for the years of support.</p>
        
            <p>"I've loved representing this club, it was a dream of mine as a kid."</p>

            <p>It was an inauspicious start for Johnson, who spilled the ball on his first touch, likely still wiping the tears from his eyes after a powerful entrance onto Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>He quickly made up for the blemish, forcing a line drop out after a towering bomb proved too much for Connor Tracey at the back,</p>
        
            <p>A dubious penalty against the Warriors from the restart quashed the opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing to have drawn first blood, the Warriors were denied by the bunker as Adam Pompey had the ball dislodged from his grasp.</p>
        
            <p>However, just two plays later, Shaun Johnson Stadium was brought to its feet as Johnson out it on a platter for Marcello Montoya to crash over.</p>
        
            <p>It was back to back for the Warriors, Kurt Capewell thundering onto a Luke Metcalf short ball and slicing through the dogs defence.</p>
        
            <p>After a wealth of possession, Canterbury finally cracked the Warriors line, Bronson Xerri doting down as the visitors stretched the defence on the right edge as rain fell over the ground.</p>

            <p>Sending the kick off dead, the Bulldogs had another immediate shot, and took full advantage as Stephen Crichton snaffled a spilt bomb from Capewell.</p>
        
            <p>The Bulldogs blitz continued, Viliame Kikau strolling through some woeful tackle attempts to drawing the last man and sending Kurtis Morrin in under the sticks to take the lead for the first time, 16-12.</p>
        
            <p>Just at it seemed the Warriors would head to the sheds behind, Wayde Egan stole one from dummy half to re-establish the advantage.</p>
        
            <p>It didn't take long for the crowd to kick back into gear after oranges, a high hot sending Roger Tuivasa-Sheck to the sidelines for an HIA as chants of 'off!' roared through the ground.</p>
        
            <p>They were soon silenced when Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad was unable to handle a grubber on the greasy grass, Harry Hayes scooping up the scraps to put the dogs back ahead.</p>
        
            <p>A superb finish from Josh Addo-Carr, grounding a kick ahead just inside the dead-ball line, pushed the Bulldogs even further in front.</p>
        
            <p>Jacob Kiraz then drove the final nail in, streaking away to well and truly shut the gate on any hope of a comeback, and bring the curtain down on the thrilling journey that was Shaun Johnson's NRL career.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers</p>
        
            <p>Bulldogs 34 (Xerri, Crichton, Morrin, Hayes, Addo-Carr, Kiraz, tries, Burton 5 goals)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 18 (Montoya, Capewell, Egan. tries, Johnson, 3 goals)</p>
