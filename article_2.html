            <p>Polar conditions have rolled through parts of the South Island overnight and much of the country can expect colder than average temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law told Morning Report it was "definitely a cold and wintery night".</p>
        
            <p>And it wouldn't be the last, with some places 8C colder than usual, particularly in the south, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some areas in the south would see night time temperatures back down below zero.</p>
        
            <p>A south-westerly wind would make it feel colder too, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's worth saying that we're all going to find a bit of cool air coming up towards us as we head through this week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even as we head in towards [Tuesday] night, towards Wednesday, I think we'll find those temperatures back down below average for many spots, even on the North Island as well."</p>

            <p>"Spring is a classic season for that real changeability in the weather, we can see our temperatures flip-flopping and yo-yoing as we go through the season.</p>
        
            <p>"It really is one of those changeable seasons but this definitely is on the colder side."</p>
        
            <p>The western side of the North Island could see thunderstorms today, he said, particularly Northland and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>There was a possibility of snowfall on the higher roads around the Central Plateau and Raukūmara Range.</p>
        
            <p>"So really worth taking extra care, extra caution on any of those higher roads ... over the next couple of days."</p>
        
            <p>The South Island will see rain and snow arrive Monday night.</p>
