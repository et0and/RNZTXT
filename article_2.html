            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation after the death of a baby boy in Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The 10-month-old boy was brought unconscious to Te Kuiti Hospital on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Tragically, despite the best efforts of medical personnel, he was unable to be resuscitated," detective inspector Graham Pitkethley said.</p>
        
            <p>"An initial examination showed the baby boy suffered violent, blunt-force trauma.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe these injuries were not accidental."</p>
        
            <p>Pitkethley said the homicide investigation was in its early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of work ahead of us as we gather information."</p>
        
            <p>The full extent of the baby's injuries would be determined by a post-mortem examination, but the results would not be known for some time, Pitkethley said.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not be releasing details of his specific injuries at this time.</p>
        
            <p>Pitkethley said officers had been speaking to members of the boy's family, including his parents.</p>
        
            <p>"They are working with us as we establish what occurred in this young child's life and how he came to be so badly injured."</p>
        
            <p>Police would be conducting a scene examination at a Te Kuiti address over the coming days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>That property had been under police guard since Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Kuiti locals can expect to see Police in the town making enquires and we ask for the public's co-operation and understanding.</p>
        
            <p>"The death of any child is a shock to the community, and we know many in Te Kuiti will be affected by this.</p>
        
            <p>"The public can help by talking with us; we need to hear from anyone who has information that could help the investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information was asked to call police on 105 and reference the file number 240608/8263.</p>
