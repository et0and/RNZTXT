            <p>A private car park charging up to $74 a day is being called the most expensive parking space in the country.</p>
        
            <p>First Up visited Wilson Parking on Fort Street in Auckland's CBD where an early bird spot cost $55 a day if you pay using the Park Mate app or $74 if using the machine on site.</p>
        
            <p>For casual parking it starts at $16 on the app and $22 per hour for using the on site machine.</p>
        
            <p>One man told First Up it was not always this expensive.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in the days it was a lot cheaper, but I have no idea why it just jumped so high right now. I mean, two hours, $44, people don't make that when they work. They don't make $23. That's crazy. Great business, right?"</p>
        
            <p>A few tourists who came in to the city to run errands said they were leaving because the Wilson carpark was simply too expensive.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Schulz, senior investigative journalist at Consumer NZ, said he could not find a carpark in the country more expensive than the Wilson site on Fort St.</p>
        
            <p>"We looked into all of the major centres where you would expect car parks to be pretty expensive. Auckland's definitely up there, it's definitely the most expensive. I guess you'd expect that.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think you'd expect the extreme prices that Wilson Car Park on Fort St in particular is charging, $22an hour is like every car going into that car park is earning minimum wage," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Just over 60 percent of New Zealanders commute to work by car.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland CBD it costs at least $5 an hour in the council-owned Downtown, Civic and Victoria Street carparks. The maximum fee per day is $24.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to street parking, there's no charge if you leave within 10 minutes. After that it's at least $4 an hour on weekdays.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington CBD, the hourly rate in a council parking building is $5, while in Christchurch it is $4.30.</p>
        
            <p>In New Plymouth, the newly opened Downtown carpark charges $3 per hour, but is running a half-price special until the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Further south you can put the 'car' in 'Invercargill' with the first 30 minutes free in the central carpark and $3.50 an hour after that.</p>
        
            <p>It could be the cheapest town in the country to park, with no charge for half an hour on the street, then only $1 an hour after that.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on the Fort Street chartes, Wilson Parking said its prices were primarily driven by supply and demand.</p>
        
            <p>"As a small site in the heart of Auckland's CBD, it is highly sought after site.</p>
        
            <p>"Beyond this, to make parking more affordable, we offer ParkMate, which provides rates 25 percent lower than machine prices and virtually eliminates breach notice risks, if used correctly.</p>
        
            <p>"Our new ParkMate Guest feature also allows drive-up customers to access these discounts without needing to download the app."</p>
        
            <p>Schulz said the company encouraged people to use the carpark app which provided slightly cheaper rates down to $16 an hour, but most people who drive into the carpark don't have time to download it.</p>
        
            <p>"Most people ... they don't notice the parking app.</p>
        
            <p>"They roll in there and ... they've parked the car they've got out and they've looked at the prices and it's $22 an hour."</p>
        
            <p>It is not just just parking prices that are higher than usual at the site, he said,</p>
        
            <p>"If you're late, they will ping you with this extra $85 fee.</p>
        
            <p>"They wouldn't tell me how quickly you get charged $85, nut I've looked through the Google reviews and a lot of people complain about it.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people are maybe 10 minutes late, 15 minutes late back to the car. But you know, a week, two weeks later they get a breach bill."</p>
        
            <p>A QR code at the Fort St park can be scanned to read the terms and condition, and those said a breach could result in an $85 notice.</p>
        
            <p>But Schulz said said Wilson Parking did not make it easy to find the fine print.</p>
        
            <p>"Wilson is hiding its terms and conditions behind a QR code that is right at the bottom of the sign ... there's no sign up in that car park that says you're liable for an $85 fine if you overstay."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport estimates Auckland CBD has at least 21,000off-street carparks in buildings owned by council and private operators like Wilsons.</p>
        
            <p>Despite that - several drivers at the carpark with a $74 early bird rate told First Up they could not find anything else nearby.</p>
