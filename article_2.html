            <p>A large truck has rolled down a steep bank on a notoriously winding road in the Wellington suburb of Aro Valley.</p>
        
            <p>Three homes below were evacuated after the concrete truck rolled down a bank on Mortimer Terrace, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed the driver was uninjured and out of the truck when emergency services arrived.</p>
        
            <p>The houses below the truck have been evacuated as a precaution while it is being removed.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said they have stabilised the truck with ropes and chains to stop it rolling or slipping further. However, it will be salvage experts that will remove the truck.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services are on the scene directing traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Mortimer Terrace residents say they spied the truck in the bush shortly before 9am.</p>
        
            <p>A Fulton Hogan staff member said everyone was safe and the truck belonged to one of their subcontractors. RNZ was referred to the council for further questions.</p>
