            <p>Blues forward Cameron Suafoa has revealed he is taking a break from rugby to complete radiation treatment for cancer.</p>
        
            <p>The North Harbour lock, 25, played two Super Rugby Pacific matches last month but has now decided to step aside temporarily while treatment continues for the undisclosed illness.</p>
        
            <p>Suafoa opened up about his medical status in a video released by the Blues, explaining how his outlook had changed since being diagnosed last November and having a tumour removed.</p>
        
            <p>He played a third-round match against the Hurricanes on 9 March, followed a week later by a game against the Waratahs in Sydney, which was preceded by a highly unusual buildup.</p>
        
            <p>After undergoing radiation on a Friday, Suafoa flew to Sydney that night and played the following day, coming off the bench for his 20th Super Rugby appearance.</p>

            <p>He said playing at a high level while receiving treatment had become too difficult to sustain.</p>
        
            <p>"I get real tired easily," Suafoa said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the mornings I'm pretty good, I've just woken up so I'm usually full of energy but after 12 or 1, that's when I'm usually on the decline fatigue wise."</p>
        
            <p>Suafoa, who played two matches for the All Blacks XV last year, said he was more determined than ever to succeed in his chosen sport.</p>
        
            <p>"In my mind, if let this bog me down and I keep thinking about it, it's just not going to help me move forward," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be stuck saying 'why me' all the time, if I can pull something positive out of this and come back fitter and stronger and hopefully then aim to pick up where I left off."</p>
