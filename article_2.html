            <p>Hawke's Bay Airport's brand new fire truck has a brand new name - with 'Judy Drench' winning the naming competition.</p>
        
            <p>About 1500 different names for the truck were submitted, and more than 6700 people voted for the final top five that were shortlisted:</p>
        
            <p>But 'Judy Drench' has been a clear favourite right from the start, taking out more than 62 percent of the votes.</p>
        
            <p>"And just like the grand dame who inspired the winning name, we are looking forward to our Judy Drench having a long and stellar career with Hawke's Bay Airport," said Airport chair Wendie Harvey.</p>
        
            <p>The competition even attracted international attention.</p>
        
            <p>"The Hawke's Bay public has really gotten onboard, submitting names and then voting on the final five. We've also attracted votes from 40 countries offshore, which is unexpected, but really exciting," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Other commendable naming ideas include Flick, Rosie, Hos√©, Trucky McTruck Face, Squirty McSquirt Face and Arnold.</p>
        
            <p>The $1.6m Rosenbauer Panther fire truck is from Austria and has a 700hp engine, two monitors that can spray water up to 90 metres, and the capacity to carry 7400 litres of water.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a two-year procurement process to get Judy Drench, and she will begin work this month at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>But she has a much shorter life expectancy than her namesake, with a service lifespan at Hawke's Bay Airport of about 25 years.</p>
