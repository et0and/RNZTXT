            <p>A Nadi man charged with allegedly concealing over a tonne of methamphetamine at a property in the Western Division is the proprietor of a popular Nadi kava bar who also owns a business that has imported kava to Australia, RNZ Pacific and The Fiji Times have found.</p>
        
            <p>Jale Aukerea, 42, was among 13 people charged over two separate seizures of a total of 4.8 tonnes of meth last month, which Fiji Police have said was imported into the country by barge and was intended for re-export abroad.</p>
        
            <p>Aukerea has been charged in part with concealing 1.1 tonnes of the meth at a property in Maqalevu, Nadi.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the drugs had been transferred from large bundles into smaller packaging disguised as 62 packets of kava, police have said.</p>
        
            <p>Aukerea is the well-known operator of Kava Kings, a Votualevu kava bar known for hosting and promoting concerts by Fijian artists such as Paradise Rootz, Tana Music, and Vegas 6, RNZ Pacific and The Fiji Times have found.</p>
        
            <p>Corporate registry documents also show he is the part-owner and director of another company in Sydney by the same name, Kava Kings Pty Ltd, that promotes itself online as "Official Australian Government Approved Importers."</p>

            <p>Police and prosecutors have not alleged any link between Aukerea's Fijian and Australian businesses and the alleged meth plot.</p>
        
            <p>Kava Kings' Australian website features branded merchandise such as socks, t-shirts, bucket hats, and bandanas.</p>
        
            <p>Its website features advertisements for a series of reggae concerts it promoted in August 2022 in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane dubbed "Stir It Up".</p>
        
            <p>The concerts featured acts from popular Fijian artists including Billy T, Ratu, and Taufa, KKU and Kuki.</p>
        
            <p>Aukerea's Sydney-based partner in Kava Kings Pty Ltd, Peter Su, said he had been unaware that Aukerea had been arrested in the meth bust.</p>
        
            <p>"We parted ways about over two years ago, so we haven't had contact or communications for quite a long time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Su added that Aukerea's initial plans for the company, founded in 2020, was for it to be a major kava importer, but that business soon fizzled.</p>
