            <p>Family and friends of a New Zealand woman who died on Australia's Gold Coast in a suspected overdose are trying to bring her body home.</p>
        
            <p>Danielle Whittaker, originally from Wellington, died on Good Friday while celebrating her 40th birthday with friends in an apartment, Queensland police said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to The Esplanade unit about 11pm after she was found dead while two of her friends were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Her loved ones hope they can repatriate her body back to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Josephine Harris, a friend of Whittaker, started a GoFundMe page to raise funds to cover the costs of getting her body home.</p>
        
            <p>"Danni was larger than life, a fierce defender of what she believed was right, creative, clever, hilarious and always fun to be around," Harris said on the page.</p>
        
            <p>"She would want her body returned to the earth of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The cost to repatriate Whittaker would cost around $10,000, Harris said, which was an "unexpected" cost on her family.</p>
        
            <p>"Her friends would love to help the family out by raising money to assist."</p>
        
            <p>Whittaker's family were "still processing" their grief, Harris said, and details of a funeral and memorial service would be shared with loved ones "when the time was right".</p>
        
            <p>Queensland Police said Whittaker's death was not being treated as suspicious, and they would prepare a report for the Coroner.</p>
