            <p>Australian hockey player Tom Craig has been arrested after allegedly trying to purchase cocaine in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Paris public prosecutor's office confirmed a 28-year-old Australian was arrested on Tuesday evening, local time, after allegedly being seen by police attempting to buy the illicit substance.</p>
        
            <p>No charges have been laid.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd firstly like to apologise for what has occurred over the past 24 hours. I made a terrible mistake, and I take full responsibility for my actions," Craig said outside a Paris police station.</p>
        
            <p>"My actions are my own and by no way reflect the values of family, my teammates, my friends, my sport and the Australian Olympic team.</p>
        
            <p>"I've embarrassed you all, and I'm truly sorry."</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Olympic Committee earlier said the Australian in custody was a member of the hockey team.</p>
        
            <p>"The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has confirmed an Australian hockey team member is in custody after being arrested in Paris on August 6," the AOC said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"No charges have been laid. The AOC is continuing to make enquiries and arrange support for the team member."</p>
        
            <p>The Paris prosecutor's office said the Australian was arrested after officers witnessed an attempt to purchase cocaine in the 9th arrondissement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police officers who witnessed a cocaine transaction at the foot of a building in the 9th arrondissement, on the night of August 6 to 7, arrested the seller, born in December 2006, and the buyer, born in September 1995 in Australia and said to be a member of the Australian field hockey team."</p>
        
            <p>The Australian men's hockey team, the Kookaburras, were knocked out of the Olympics after a loss to the Netherlands in a quarterfinal on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old Craig, a silver medallist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, has played more than 100 games for the national side.</p>
        
            <p>ABC Sport has contacted Hockey Australia for comment.</p>
