            <p>Michael Mosley has been remembered as "one of the most important broadcasters of recent decades" in a special tribute programme following his death.</p>
        
            <p>The final edition of his radio show Just One Thing, recorded live at the Hay Festival on 25 May, aired on BBC Radio 4 on Friday and is available on BBC Sounds and through podcast apps.</p>
        
            <p>The recording was introduced by fellow TV doctor and presenter Chris van Tulleken, who praised the impact Mosley made and said he would miss him as a "friend, mentor and most of all as a broadcaster".</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a special TV programme titled Michael Mosley: The Doctor Who Changed Britain, on BBC One on Friday night (local time).</p>
        
            <p>Mosley's body was found in a rocky area on the Greek island of Symi on Sunday, four days after he went missing while on holiday.</p>
        
            <p>Paying tribute in the introduction to the posthumous broadcast, Van Tulleken said: "Michael's genius was to make himself the patient in a way that's utterly relatable."</p>
        
            <p>Van Tulleken, who worked with Mosley on the BBC's Trust Me, I'm A Doctor series, referred to his colleague deliberately infecting himself with a tapeworm and having a camera inserted to examine his bowel.</p>
        
            <p>In the special edition of Just One Thing, Mosley was in conversation with Paul Bloom, professor emeritus of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University.</p>
        
            <p>Discussing tips for leading a better life, Mosley said it was a challenge to have a cold shower "despite the fact I know I'll feel better afterwards".</p>
        
            <p>He told the audience at Hay that "it's always followed by a lot of screaming" and he got through it by "singing loudly, which my wife really hates".</p>
        
            <p>Mosley also spoke about meditation and mindfulness, and admitted that even though he told other people to do it, "the reality is I don't really do it".</p>
        
            <p>"I mean to do it, and I have long conversations with my wife about it, but somehow we never get round to it," he confessed.</p>

            <p>Later in the episode, Mosley shared with the audience one of the "scarier experiments" he had taken part in - a personality test.</p>
        
            <p>"I was stuck in a brain scanner and showed images of someone being hit with a ruler and then they hit me with a ruler," he explained.</p>
        
            <p>When he asked for the results, the psychologist said: "I'd send your wife out of the room at this point."</p>
        
            <p>Mosley admitted that "according to this test, I am a bit of a psychopath".</p>
        
            <p>As the audience laughed, Bloom reassured Mosley: "If you're worried you're a psychopath, you're not a psychopath."</p>
        
            <p>The TV special will focus on how the 67-year-old broadcaster and columnist transformed people's lives through science.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley, who studied medicine in London and qualified as a doctor, was also known for programmes like The Truth About Exercise and Lose a Stone in 21 Days, and for appearances on BBC One's The One Show and ITV's This Morning.</p>
        
            <p>He also wrote a column for the Daily Mail, and was an advocate for intermittent fasting diets, including through the 5:2 diet and The Fast 800 diet.</p>
        
            <p>The father-of-four was reported missing after he set off for a walk from Agios Nikolaos beach - near where he was staying on the north-east side of Symi - at about 1.30pm local time on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Despite an extensive search by the Greek authorities, his body was not found near Agia Marina beach until Sunday by local journalists, staff and the mayor.</p>
        
            <p>An initial post-mortem examination concluded on Monday that he died of natural causes.</p>
        
            <p>Separate toxicology and histology reports have been ordered but the results have not yet been released.</p>
