            <p>Recent fires that have sprung up around the country are being called suspicious, while a new one has broken out in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>Two North Island fires are being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency were notified of one approximately 40km west of Auckland, on Anawhata Beach last night where several people had to be rescued.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is now extinguished, but FENZ said they are treating it as suspicious. The cause is not yet known.</p>
        
            <p>Another blaze in the Rangitikei District has been contained but has burned through nearly a hectare of 10-year-old standing pine.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been deemed suspicious and it's being investigated by a fire investigator," Shift manager Murray Dunbar said said.</p>
        
            <p>He said multiple crews are working alongside excavators to strengthen containment trenches and extinguish hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency are also responding to a vegetation fire in Northland this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Six trucks, one tanker, and three helicopters are at the scene in Tāheke, with another helicopter on standby.</p>
        
            <p>Northland District Commander Wipari Henwood is asking people to stay away from the Horeke Road area. Crews are protecting one structure which is threatened by the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is currently 10ha in size.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of several fires in recent days.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another helicopter has been called to the scene of a fire 20km north of Taupō.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the fire on Te Toke Road in the Tahorakuri Forest area around 12.30pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said another helicopter has been called due to a change of fire conditions and wind strength.</p>
        
            <p>That fire has burned through approximately 19ha of vegetation so far.</p>
