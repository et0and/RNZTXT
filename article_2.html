            <p>An inquiry into the response to last year's catastrophic storms shows the government must move quickly to save lives and prevent further devastation, those affected say.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry report, released on Tuesday, found the emergency management system failed in places and is not fit for purpose.</p>
        
            <p>The country is not ready to respond to large-scale emergencies, like the Auckland Anniversary floods, and Cyclones Hale and Gabrielle, it found.</p>
        
            <p>People felt let down by Civil Defence, it said. Aleysha Knowles, whose Auckland home is now unliveable, is one of them.</p>
        
            <p>"They were unheard of, they were unseen, there was nothing that Civil Defence did for any of the victims that I know of from the Auckland Anniversary floods."</p>

            <p>The inquiry found Civil Defence agencies lacked capability and capacity, and were not adequately prepared.</p>
        
            <p>Relieved the inquiry acknowledged what Knowles and her community had been feeling, she said it was now time to improve the system - and fast.</p>
        
            <p>"Throw away the red tape, stop needing to make law changes to make changes, because we don't want to have to have another 15 people lose their lives in a natural disaster to learn from our mistakes."</p>
        
            <p>But a Hawke's Bay resident said while it was clear changes were needed, the inquiry was too harsh on Civil Defence.</p>
        
            <p>Kiriana Laison and her entire Waiohiki community were rescued from their marae, which they had evacuated to before it became surrounded by rising floodwaters.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence saved lives, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They picked us up, for frick's sakes, with the army, on a Unimog.</p>
        
            <p>"Who in their lifetime get to actually experience being evacuated from a major disaster, and the army come and picks you up and saves you from being stranded, on your own bloody island?"</p>

            <p>An aspect of the report Laison did agree with was a recommendation to formally include iwi Māori in disaster response and planning.</p>
        
            <p>Her own whānau were taken in by another marae - Waipatu - where they lived for the best part of last year while her home was repaired.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu chairperson Bayden Barber said when disaster struck, Māori stepped up.</p>
        
            <p>"We do what we do, which is to manaaki, and to tiaki, which is helping and assisting where needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Not just Māori - Pākeha, and those that were in need, you know, utilising our resources, that's people, connections, networks, and food and supplies."</p>
        
            <p>Iwi had a lot to give in emergency planning and response - and formal recognition of that was vital, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"'Cause with that comes the allocation of resources, with that comes the allocation of mana, really, when it comes to Civil Defence, so that's what we want."</p>

            <p>A new law was high on Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell's to-do list this term, he told RNZ's Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>The draft Emergency Management Bill which was poised to replace the decades-old Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 was insufficient, the inquiry found.</p>
        
            <p>Rather than make changes, Cabinet agreed to throw it out and start again, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't have a bill that goes halfway, or is weak, or just sorta deals with stuff on the fringes. We need a substantive bill that is going to address the issues that have been highlights in these reports," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Make no mistake, this is a priority, and it's urgent."</p>

            <p>But Barber was worried that would take too long, given the current draft bill was before select committee and had already been through a lengthy submissions process.</p>
        
            <p>That sentiment was shared by Labour emergency management spokesperson Camilla Belich.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not consider the case is made in the report for the wholesale abandonment of the Emergency Management Bill," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The report suggested some significant amendments, but also supported aspects of it - so it would have been quicker just to make changes, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned that waiting to bring a new bill to the House this term risks too much of a delay. We don't know when the next disaster will strike and must be prepared."</p>
