            <p>Grimaldi cruised to an easy victory in T47 200-metre final, having time to glimpse at the big screen and smile before crossing the line.</p>
        
            <p>She won in an Oceania record time of 24.72 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>It is Grimaldi's second medal of the Game after she took the bronze in the 100 metres.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Dunedin athlete missed out on a medal in her specialist event, the long jump, on Saturday, finishing fourth.</p>
        
            <p>She rebounded in spectacular fashion in the 200m, rounding the bend strongly to take the lead and clear out from her rivals.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
