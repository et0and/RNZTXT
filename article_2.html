            <p>A lingering low-pressure system is bringing rain or showers to many parts of New Zealand, with thunderstorms, large swells and strong winds affecting the centre of the country.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain warning remains in place for Wairoa District until noon Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said people could expect 150-200mm of rain there, on top of what had already fallen, especially about the Wairoa ranges. Peak rates would be 10-20mm/h.</p>
        
            <p>Strong wind watches remain in force for the following areas:</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned that southerly and south-west winds may approach severe gales in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media, it said large, powerful, four-metre southerly swells were impacting the south and east coasts of the North Island.</p>

            <p>There was a heavy swell warning in place for Wairarapa (Turakirae Head to Mataikona) until 8am Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Big swells - rising to 3-4m - would be accompanied by large wind waves developing on Friday morning, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>These would gradually ease overnight into Saturday morning. The highest risk period would be around high tide on Friday afternoon, the forecaster added.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday, Interislander warned passengers to expect delays on Cook Strait crossings due to the strong winds.</p>
