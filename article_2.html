            <p>Leadership won't be in short supply at the Hurricanes, who have named four captains for their Super Rugby Pacific campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Under a new structure which coach Clark Laidlaw conceded is "different", one of Asafo Aumua, Du'Plessis Kirifi, Billy Proctor or Brad Shields will lead the side in each match, beginning with Friday's season-opener against the Crusaders in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>In a Hurricanes media statement, the four players were named "Ngā Kaitiaki - The Guardians".</p>
        
            <p>"A kaitiaki is a guardian who ensures the protection, growth and vitality of their environment," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"These four men are the kaitiaki of our values and our identity. They will drive who we are on and off the field."</p>

            <p>The approach best suited the personnel in his squad, Laidlaw said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, the approach is a little bit different, but we're not just doing it for the sake of being different," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is what we felt was the best way to structure and provide leadership and guidance within our environment this season.</p>
        
            <p>"We're gonna go with a more collaborative approach. Ngā kaitiaki is the official term that we're going to use within the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It basically means more than one, or more than two actually, so there's going to be four guys that lead the side and work together. We'll name co-captains for the game the same as we often did last year."</p>
        
            <p>Last season, Shields was named as the sole Hurricanes captain, with Aumua and Jordie Barrett named vice-captains.</p>

            <p>However, the Hurricanes ended up having several skippers due to injuries and form, which has shaped their change in approach to leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"When we looked at it last year it chopped and changed the whole season, guys in, guys out," Laidlaw said.</p>
        
            <p>"So when we talked to the leaders and and talked to the coaches, CJ (Hurricanes assistant and former All Black Cory Jane) had a good idea. He loves his American sport and took the idea of multiple captains.</p>
        
            <p>"So Du'Plessis, Asafo, Brad and Billy will be the four players that will really provide well, guardianship is what we're after and we want them to grow the group on and off the field.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a bigger group looking after the game. We just think it fits. Already as an example, Asafo isn't playing at the start of the season, so you're down to the three. Maybe it feels a little bit different in practice, but it's not actually that different to what we've done the last couple of years."</p>

            <p>Hurricanes cultural advisor Te Wehi Wright said the concept of a kaitiaki was chosen for its holistic meaning, "which we thought was a good reflection of the environment and the kaupapa this team has been building over the last couple of years. It also has connections to the kōrero held within our haka".</p>
        
            <p>Laidlaw clarified that a captain and co-captain will be designated each week "based on the make-up of the team and who is available."</p>
        
            <p>All four players have captaincy experience.</p>

            <p>Veteran flanker and former England international Shields led the Hurricanes in 2018 and 2024, centre Proctor and hooker Aumua were the team's captain or co-captain at various times last year, while flanker Kirifi was captain of the victorious Wellington Lions in the NPC last year, before being named skipper of the All Blacks XV on their northern hemisphere tour.</p>
        
            <p>Strong leadership will be of utmost importance for the side after the Hurricanes suffered a spate of pre-season injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Loose forward Devon Flanders has a suspected broken ankle and could miss the entire season.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes are are also without All Blacks Aumua, Tyrel Lomax and Ruben Love this week, along with first five-eighths Brett Cameron and Lucas Cashmore.</p>
