            <p>A kiwi which was part of a project that has brought the native birds to Wellington's hills has drowned in a water trough.</p>
        
            <p>The Capital Kiwi Project has a permit to release 250 birds in the south and west of the city, with 140 released so far.</p>
        
            <p>Capital Kiwi Project posted yesterday on its social media pages, telling followers that one of the birds had died.</p>
        
            <p>It said just before Christmas a landowner contacted them to tell them a kiwi had drowned in a water trough.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a large female kiwi, living not far from her release site. An unmonitored bird, she came from Rotokare, gifted by Ngāti Tupaia."</p>
        
            <p>The post pointed out that these birds were wild, her death had come from misadventure and was no-one's fault.</p>
        
            <p>But it said it was a reminder to keep dogs under control, beware of kiwi when driving, and if people do have a trough they should ensure it is raised off the ground and create a way for a kiwi to get out.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki Whānui chairperson Kara Puketapu-Dentice provided a whakataukī to acknowledge the death.</p>
        
            <p>"Mate atu he tētē kura, ara mai he tētē kura. ('When one fern frond dies, another rises to take its place.')</p>
        
            <p>"This whakataukī reminds us of the cycle of life and the resilience of nature.</p>
        
            <p>"Though we mourn her loss; her life and the work we have done, and continue to do, lays the foundation for the future of kiwi in Te Upoko o te Ika a Māui."</p>
        
            <p>The Capital Kiwi Project also noted in the post that the first egg of this season's second batch of chicks hatched last week.</p>
        
            <p>Project lead Paul Ward told RNZ it had been a "bumper season" in the number of chicks that were coming through the programme.</p>
