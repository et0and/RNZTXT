        <h2>Concerns as teens promote new sunbathing trend</h2>
        <p>
With an exceptionally hot summer on the cards, experts are sounding alarm bells.
</p>
        
            <p>With an exceptionally hot summer on the cards, concerns have been raised about a new sunbathing trend.</p>
        
            <p>Cancer Society prevention policy lead Emma Shields said it was alarming to see teenagers on TikTok promoting the UV Index (UVI) as a tanning guide.</p>
        
            <p>The UVI shown on weather and forecasting apps is intended help people know when to use sun protection.</p>
        
            <p>Several Aucklanders RNZ spoke to at Mission Bay said they had come to the beach after checking the sun was strong.</p>
        
            <p>Eighteen-year-old Anastasia Campos said she made sure to lay in the sun when the UV was high.</p>
        
            <p>"I text the group chat 'UV 9 today let's go to the beach'."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was not worried about skin damage.</p>
        
            <p>
"Any tan is a sign of skin damage and long-term skin damage can accumulate to cause premature ageing and increase the risk of skin cancer," the Cancer Society's Emma Shields says.

            <p>"Tanning gives me a nice summer glow and it makes me happy. I have a competition with my brother and right now he's more tan than me.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been to a dermatologist and I put on sunscreen every morning whether it's sunny or not and re-apply so I don't get burnt.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a different between burning and tanning. You can tan but still be sun safe."</p>
        
            <p>Aimee Clink and Emma Corbett said they learnt about the UV trend at school.</p>
        
            <p>"I always look at the UV because I like getting tan. If it's more than eight I'm heading out," Clink said.</p>
        
            <p>"I wear sunscreen sometimes but I've never really cared about the harm that could happen to me."</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen the trend on TikTok. You look better when you are tan versus pale," Corbett said.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-nine-year-old Manon Diebolt was also excited to tan now the weather was getting warmer.</p>
        
            <p>"I like tanning but I know in New Zealand the sun is quite dangerous so I try to refrain from burning myself."</p>
        
            <p>George Powell, who is 26, said he did not check the UVI but had seen the trend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to get a good tan but if the sun is out we come and if it's not we don't. It's more of an intuitive feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Another beach-goer, 19-year-old Eliza Patton, said she was trying to be more sun safe.</p>
        
            <p>"I normally get burnt so this summer I'm trying hard not too.</p>
        
            <p>"Last summer I got freaked out because I started peeling.</p>
        
            <p>"But I like tanning because it's something fun you can do with your friends that doesn't cost money."</p>
        
            <p>Brooklyn Menzies, who is 18, said she would tan as a social activity, but regularly applied sunscreen.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't make it a routine to tan. But if my friends ask me to go out tanning and swimming I'll do it for fun."</p>
        
            <p>Shields said young people intentionally increasing their sun exposure when UV radiation was high could have devastating long-term effects.</p>
        
            <p>"It's particularly dangerous for New Zealand teens because we can get high levels of ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        
            <p>She asserted there was no such thing as a 'healthy tan'.</p>
        
            <p>"Any tan is a sign of skin damage and long-term skin damage can accumulate to cause premature ageing and increase the risk of skin cancer."</p>
        
            <p>Alongside Australia, she said New Zealand consistently had the highest skin cancer rates in the world.</p>
        
            <p>She said there had been significant cuts to investment in SunSmart messaging in recent years and this had started to show.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to see the government put more money into skin cancer awareness campaigns and education around Slip, Slop, Slap, and Wrap."</p>
