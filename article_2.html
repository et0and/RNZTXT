        <h2>Experts detect growing numbers affected by climate anxiety</h2>
        <p>
For a small portion of the population it causes a level of worry so severe that it interferes with everyday life.

            <p>While more than 80 percent of New Zealanders see climate change as a personal concern, for a small portion of the population it causes a level of worry so severe that it interferes with everyday life.</p>
        
            <p>This is known as climate anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>A clinical psychologist and co-convener of the New Zealand Psychological Society's climate taskforce, Dr Jackie Feather, is encountering more and more people suffering from the mental health condition, which she said made sense.</p>
        
            <p>"You just need to think about what New Zealand's been experiencing recently with floods, slips, and then this summer it's hot.</p>
        
            <p>"It's affecting us personally and I think it has people much more concerned than they were previously when it wasn't so obvious."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Feather said people experiencing climate anxiety often struggled to sleep, concentrate, or complete everyday tasks.</p>
        
            <p>Her daughter, Gabrielle Feather, suffered from climate anxiety while working at an environmental action group.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like I couldn't walk into a supermarket without having a panic attack because I couldn't find anything on the shelves that didn't have plastic covering it, or that was local or ethically sourced or that kind of thing.</p>
        
            <p>"I found it really debilitating for a number of years."</p>
        
            <p>Gabrielle Feather eventually left the world of advocacy to manage her mental health.</p>
        
            <p>She now researches climate anxiety in Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Feather said climate anxiety wasn't common yet, but its prevalence was increasing.</p>
        
            <p>In Australia, a recent survey by a youth mental health organisation found nearly 10 percent of the 19,000 respondents - all aged between 15 and 19 - reported experiencing 'high psychological distress' as a result of climate change.</p>
        
            <p>And in the UK Lorraine Whitmarsh, an environmental psychologist at the University of Bath, led the first detailed study of climate anxiety among the country's adult population.</p>
        
            <p>"We studied a representative sample of the public and we found that about four percent have modest or severe symptoms," adding that the representative sample included people of all ages, genders and ethnicities.</p>
        
            <p>She was not surprised to learn that young people were disproportionately represented.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still only a minority of young people that suffer from climate anxiety, but in that age group we did see a higher proportion at a statistically significant level.</p>
        
            <p>"This was expected because climate change poses a real threat that the future will be worse, but also a feeling of powerlessness."</p>
        
            <p>And there were other traits that appeared to predispose people to climate anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw higher stats in people who already experience generalised anxiety, as well as people who come into frequent contact with media information about climate change," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Media exposure was actually the strongest predictor."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Feather said young people were more likely to present with climate anxiety in New Zealand too.</p>
        
            <p>"They're powerless," she said, echoing Professor Whitmarsh.</p>
        
            <p>"They're looking to governments and people in power to make changes, but change is happening very slowly."</p>
        
            <p>The presence of climate anxiety in society did not come as a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a threat, and the human body is programmed to respond to threats," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We enter fight, flight, or freeze mode, but if we don't help people manage their heightened hypervigilance and hyper-physiological arousal, it can lead to all sorts of mental health problems."</p>
        
            <p>Mental health professionals have a lot to learn about helping people with climate anxiety, Whitmarsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not really equipped to know how to deal with climate anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>"They can deal with generalised anxiety, but that often relates to things the patient has a level of control over.</p>
        
            <p>"Climate anxiety is a bit different because no amount of individual behaviour will have an impact on its trajectory.</p>
        
            <p>"It presents a unique challenge for mental health professionals."</p>
        
            <p>But Dr Feather said there has been some success with acceptance and commitment therapy.</p>
        
            <p>A significant part of that approach involved focusing on the present moment.</p>
        
            <p>"Climate change is a direct threat, and it's an existential threat," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's important to remember that 99 percent of the time we are perfectly safe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's easy to get swept up in the existential crisis, but here I am sitting on Waiheke Island.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beautiful day, I can hear birds and the cicadas, and when I look out the window there's stunning native bush.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to take time to pause and remind ourselves, there's still a lot of peace and beauty."</p>
