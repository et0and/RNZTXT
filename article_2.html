            <p>Longtime Homegrown artists are finishing the Wellington festival on a nostalgic note.</p>
        
            <p>After 18 years the festival is saying its goodbyes to its home on the Wellington Waterfront, with a future venue yet to be confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>It comes at a time when several festivals have been cancelled and promoters speak about the difficulties securing venues or permits.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington band Drax Project started out busking just metres away from the big Homegrown stage they would one day play.</p>

            <p>Lead singer Shaan Singh said playing for thousands of people down the road now was surreal.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were grateful to be a part of the festival's send-off.</p>
        
            <p>The band was heading to the UK and Europe later in the year.</p>

            <p>Band member Sam Thomson said they are writing a lot of music and plan to release some around the time they tour.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said they will play some of these new songs for Homegrown fans during tonight's farewell performance.</p>
        
            <p>Shapeshifter has been a part of Homegrown since the early days, band member Sam Trevethick reckons they have performed at 10 different Homegrown festivals.</p>

            <p>He said one of the great things about the festival was that it showcased only New Zealand artists.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a shame it was ending, and hopes it pops up elsewhere or that another event like it replaced it.</p>
        
            <p>Trevethick said the festival scene was struggling and post-Covid it was a "freaky" landscape</p>
        
            <p>For Shapeshifter's next iteration, he said, the group was heading into a writing phase.</p>
