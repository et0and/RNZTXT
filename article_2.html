        <h2>Driver on SH8 where buses rolled nearly plunged into ditch</h2>
        <p>
A van driver who was travelling on the same highway where two buses rolled in the South Island says it should have been shut.

            <p>A witness to the crashes of two buses carrying tourists in the South Island says he earlier asked police to close it after a near-miss.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen people were taken to hospital by St John after the single-vehicle crashes occurred 100 metres apart on the Tekapo-Twizel Highway in the Mackenzie District about 8.40am on Thursday, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were seriously injured and taken by helicopters to Dunedin and Timaru hospitals. Eight people were in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Consulate-General in Christchurch said staff had visited the seriously injured pair and the embassy had asked travel agencies to accommodate the remainder of Chinese tourists involved.</p>
        
            <p>Among the injured was a group who competed in the World Choir Games in Auckland last week.</p>
        
            <p>Tony McClelland, who was travelling from Christchurch to Omarama on Thursday morning, said the road conditions were the worst he had ever seen.</p>
        
            <p>He hit black ice close to Lake Tekapo Airport, nearly lost control of his van and ended up in a ditch.</p>
        
            <p>He pulled over and called the police, asking them to close the road.</p>
        
            <p>"You're looking -5, -4 [degrees Celsius], foggy conditions - that State Highway 8 should have been closed. No doubt and it wasn't, mate. There's just a big black sign up by the airfield saying 'dangerous conditions, black ice'. That's how people die," McClelland said.</p>
        
            <p>Getting back on the road, he stuck to 60km/h and considered turning back.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after, he saw two buses "flying" out of the fog.</p>
        
            <p>"They were not doing 60[km/h], they were not doing 80. They were doing at least 100, probably a little bit more."</p>
        
            <p>McClelland learnt that two buses had crashed on the highway once he arrived in Omarama.</p>
        
            <p>The popular tourist road often had people tackling it who did not know how to drive to the winter conditions or what to expect, and would sit on 100km/h despite black ice in the area, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Australian nurse Emily, who was driving to Christchurch when she saw the rolled buses, said she used a bystander's first aid kit to bandage two children who had blood gushing out of their foreheads.</p>
        
            <p>"It was something you see out of a movie. Everyone was crying and people were bleeding out of their heads and arms," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just in shock so we all went over and tried to help where we could", including dampening cloths to try to clean wounds, keeping people warm and comforting the passengers who were in shock.</p>

            <p>The bus had its windows smashed, with debris and toys scattered around, and the emergency exit at the top had been popped open, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She did not believe it was the driver's fault because the poor weather and road conditions meant he was "set up to fail".</p>
        
            <p>Emily believed the area should not have been a 100km/h zone with the amount of black ice and fog around.</p>
        
            <p>Grace, who also was travelling along the road when she came upon the scene, said she too gave first aid to some of the shaken passengers for about 25 minutes before fire crews arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"The children were quite lacerated by the glass I believe," Grace said.</p>

            <p>A man had helped to get all the passengers out of the first bus before she arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"But as the temperature was about negative one (degrees), they were just freezing, so everyone was gathering all the blankets and scarves and jumpers that they could to give to these people," Grace said.</p>
        
            <p>The driver appeared to be in shock with a broken arm or wrist, and the children were upset and crying, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She felt shocked to not find more road safety signs and information along the highway.</p>
        
            <p>"We were super scared on the road ourselves cos of the black ice and really poor conditions, so I think something really needs to be done about that.</p>
        
            <p>"Considering it's a 100 [kilometre an hour] zone, we were going about 30 so I think that it's just not at all well equipped, especially for vulnerable tourists who aren't familiar with the conditions."</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to see action so travellers were better informed about the road conditions and the highway was better maintained and able to cope with the conditions.</p>

            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency generally advises drivers to go slower than they normally would to reduce the risk of losing control or skidding when conditions are icy or snowy.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday morning, NZTA put out a black ice and winter driving conditions warning for that stretch of road.</p>
        
            <p>Twizel Community Board member Tracey Gunn said she was not surprised to hear about the crashes near the Hayman Road intersection, which was popular with tourists as it had a car park with toilets and breath-taking views.</p>
        
            <p>"Close to the lake and with the fog, the roads are wet. Sub-zero temperatures means they freeze, black ice, and you can't see black ice. It just looks like a wet road," Gunn said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a perfect storm of conditions for accidents unfortunately."</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit is investigating. NZTA will also be examining the road and its condition as well as the two buses.</p>

            <p>World Choir Games organisers extended their sympathy to those involved and said they were offering members support.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of Part One choirs left the Games after last weekend's Awards Ceremonies, with some choosing to travel around New Zealand in privately arranged tours ... we are devastated that the choir has experienced such a traumatic event while touring New Zealand and are reaching out to provide any support we can.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the choir, as well as their families at home, and we send our gratitude to those caring for the choirs at this time."</p>
        
            <p>Passengers on board the buses who did not required medical attention were taken to Twizel, where a Civil Defence Emergency Management centre had been set up for them.</p>
