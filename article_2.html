            <p>There's a brief lift in the wet weather before Christmas but showers and rain are forecast for much of the country for the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>Showers continued through the night in central parts of North Island but are due to ease with the risk of severe thunderstorms over for most.</p>
        
            <p>But in the South Island, parts of Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago could get severe thunderstorms on Monday afternoon along with downpours of up to 40mm an hour.</p>
        
            <p>The best of the weather in the lead-up to Christmas Day looks to be on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is forecasting dry weather for most of the country, though Fiordland gets rain in the evening.</p>
