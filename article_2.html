            <p>The government is launching a list of roads of regional significance as part of moves to speed up the building of new state highways.</p>
        
            <p>It has also announced two more roads of national significance - at Takatimu in Southland, and between Otaki and Levin in Horowhenua.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland on Monday, Transport Minister Simeon Brown said all decisions around the scope and delivery of the projects has been delegated to the Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>He and the Finance Minister had agreed to the change in ministerial powers because in the past it has led to delays and scope creep, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The projects would come from $6.5 billion in funding already set aside.</p>
        
            <p>The regional projects announced are: Penlink, Waihoehoe Road, State Highway 1 Papakura to Drury, the State Highway 1 and 29 intersection, State Highway 58 improvements, Melling, a Queenstown package and three Canterbury packages.</p>
