        <p>
Waitangi always draws a crowd, but why, this year?

            <p>The pōwhiri for politicians at Waitangi always draws a crowd, but this year, many arrived for a range of different reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Among the thousands gathered, Tangata whenua and Tangata Tiriti stood side by side "to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi."</p>
        
            <p>For Kathleen Kidwell, this was her fifth year at Waitangi, but the first from a different standpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"I was on the other side, under the trees, an occupier."</p>
        
            <p>Now she was helping with traffic control, ensuring commuters didn't block the entrance to Waitangi.</p>

            <p>Kidwell said she was expecting the crowds at Waitangi to be massive.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a massive kotahitanga crew coming through, and that's what I can see, unity coming through."</p>
        
            <p>"The people are standing up, that's what I see. I see that people have had enough. Tangata whenua have had enough. We've had enough."</p>
        
            <p>Kidwell said this year was a stand not only for her own people but to the government to say "we've had enough."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the political weight of the day, many spoke of the peacefulness and the strong sense of unity among those in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Tauiwi from Germany Tania Swhalm, now living in Ōtautahi, carried a haki (flag) covered in signatures - names of Pākehā and Māori who supported the kaupapa but could not be there in person.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm here to support Te Tiriti o Waitangi in these really troubled times. I think as a tauiwi, as a Pākehā, it is very, very important that we show up and support - and not just feel the support, we need to show up.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to show our faces, and we need to stand up for the treaty because it's our treaty, its the fundamental document that allows us to be here."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Reina Te Herata Rua - who became friends with Swhalm while on another hīkoi - carried a haki carved with Moriori designs, representing her journey with te hīkoi mō Te Tiriti from Te Rerenga Wairua all the way to Pōneke.</p>
        
            <p>"My whānau are on here too and my friends. I've got my whānau all around the outside as well. They all came on the journey."</p>
        
            <p>Among the crowd was Michel Mulipola, commonly known as the 'Bloody Samoan' whose "Kill the Bill" art had become a common sight on T-shirts throughout Waitangi and hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really amazing as an artist and as a storyteller to have your art resonate with people all around the motu and to see people today here at Waitangi wearing the shirt too. It's a really cool feeling to be here and see the tautoko from people in regard to the artwork I created."</p>

            <p>He said what he loved most about being at Waitangi was the kotahitanga.</p>
        
            <p>"This is kotahitanga in practice and today is pretty chill but [Waitangi Day] is going to be pretty hectic. So I'm enjoying the quietness of today and just enjoying the sights and sounds and getting to really meet the community and the people here supporting tangata whenua."</p>
        
            <p>One of the guest speakers for the Waitangi Forum, Tania Rauna - known to many as the "Unicorn of Te Tai Rāwhiti" or the "hīkoi unicorn" - was there to uplift the next generation and inspire te iwi Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm letting our whānau know that there's still hope for us - the power resides in all of us - and you can be whoever you want to be, even a unicorn."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Rauna said many tamariki and kaumatua had been coming up to her with aroha; even asking for a hug.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got heaps of nieces and nephews, and mokos now. And yeah, it's cool fun, even older people like hugs from unicorns so there's hope for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Bradley Charles, known by his traditional name Yawhalacha, is First Nations Canadian - Musqueam Indian band.</p>
        
            <p>He was at Waitangi on a cultural exchange to learn more about the te ao Māori, alongside other University students from Canada.</p>

            <p>"Our cultures are so similar, but we're half a world apart. But when we come together, it's like we're one."</p>
        
            <p>Yawhalacha said he would be bringing the stories and knowledge gained from Waitangi back home to Canada.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm taking home happiness."</p>
