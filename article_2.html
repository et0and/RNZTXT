            <p>Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson has provided an update on her cancer journey, saying that she is "in the thick of it".</p>
        
            <p>Davidson posted a photo to Instagram on Sunday night that showed her with no hair, looking straight at the camera.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in the thick of it," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Just popping in briefly to thank everyone for the overwhelming and beautiful aroha that you all keep sending through to my whānau and I. It means EVERYTHING.</p>
        
            <p>"I send my love back to everyone with my full gratitude and appreciation."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson revealed in June that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer following a routine mammogram.</p>
        
            <p>She would undergo a partial mastectomy, followed by further treatment, and be off work for several months, she said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>She urged other wāhine to get their mammograms, saying early detection could save lives.</p>
        
            <p>In her last Instagram post, in July, Davidson said she was "trying my darndest to turn my focus completely to my whānau and whakapapa now. Which means treatment, healing and recovery".</p>
        
            <p>She would be taking a "proper break" from all social media platforms and work emails, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Friends have loaded me up with reading and listening and art and I have a full bag of clothes mending to get onto."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson's fellow Green co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick and party's other MPs have been covering her responsibilities while she undergoes treatment.</p>
