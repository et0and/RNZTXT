        <h2>Go home, stay home: Companies want staff back</h2>
        <p>
The Detail - Four years after the first Covid-19 lockdown, the way we work has changed.
</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 lockdowns closed offices and started a new way of working. Now companies want staff back in the office, but employees - and data - say no. </p>

            <p>During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, working from home became a necessity. Then for many it became the norm.</p>
        
            <p>Now there's a battle playing out between bosses and workers - many employees want to stay put at home, while employers are urging, and even mandating, a return to the office.</p>
        
            <p>Today's episode of The Detail looks at where the 'working from home revolution', as it was often called, stands now.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Keall, the New Zealand Herald's technology editor, has written a lot on the subject.</p>
        
            <p>"The new normal actually looks a lot more like the old normal," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of organisations with a lot of white-collar workers are now saying 'you've been working from home five days a week, or two days a week... we now want you in the office at least three days a week'."</p>
        
            <p>This is playing out in New Zealand at the moment - the highest profile arguably at One NZ, where unions are still in mediation with the company over being in the office for three days a week, instead of two.</p>
        
            <p>This follows a lot of similar debates in the US - with the likes of Zoom and Amazon - and the UK. Keall says the Bank of England did a study with several universities and found working from home can negatively impact employees' remuneration.</p>
        
            <p>"They found that if you worked from home then you were slightly less likely to get a pay rise," he says.</p>
        
            <p>But New Zealand-based research has found that people who work from home some of the time say they're more productive than people who work in the office all the time.</p>
        
            <p>The Detail talks to Massey University professor of management and Māori business Jarrod Haar, who's led this research through his Wellbeing@work study. In December, he asked workers where they felt more productive. Fifty-one percent said they were more productive at home than the office. </p>
        
            <p>"I think that really just captures the fact that I don't have to wake up, have a shower, have a shave, put a suit on, drive for an hour into the city - I can get a coffee and turn on my laptop and start working straight away," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"You're probably more likely to start more productive and you're less likely to be distracted."</p>
        
            <p>But there's still the problem of social isolation. Haar says hybrid working is the key.</p>
        
            <p>"The all-home and all-office [workers] are different - they're less productive than hybrid workers, interestingly enough," he says. </p>
        
            <p>"If you think I'm lying in bed, sleeping in, watching Netflix, put a camera on me for the day in the office and you'll say, 'I notice Jarrod had an hour and a half for lunch and he's had three coffee breaks for half an hour - that guy doesn't do any work in the office either'," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is - and maybe this is a good future focus for organisations - focus on that productivity, not being present in the office for eight hours."</p>
