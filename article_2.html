            <p>Brazil's Gabriel Medina powered through a giant blue barrel for the highest score of the Olympic surfing competition so far, but Tahiti's Teahupo'o stole the show with some of the most incredible waves on Earth.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to hold the surfing competition at the perfect reef pass of Teahupo'o proved inspired as the swell rose and a forecasted storm held off just long enough to complete the men's third round.</p>
        
            <p>After two days of competition in waves that were mostly user-friendly, Teahupo'o, which loosely translates as "Wall of Skulls" after a gruesome local legend, really bared its teeth as a solid southwest swell rose overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Time after time, surfers paddled hard and threw themselves into the waves, which sucked below sea-level as they hit the reef.</p>
        
            <p>Those that got it right were spat out of the fearsome tubes, shrouded in firehose blasts of spray. Horrendous wipeouts, broken boards and jetski rescues followed for those that didn't get it right.</p>

            <p>Brazil's Gabriel Medina got the wave of the event so far in his round five heat against Japan's Tokyo Olympic silver medallist Kanoa Igarashi, a 9.90 out of 10 that was if anything, underscored.</p>
        
            <p>Taking off deep, Medina pumped through an enormous tube and signalled to the judges that he thought it was worth a 10 before flying into the channel. Most of those on the flotilla of boats and jetskis watching metres away screamed in agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Medina backed it up with a 7.5 for a 17.4 points total to cement him as a favourite to win gold.</p>
        
            <p>"I never imagined we could get waves like this in the Olympics," said Medina. "I'm comfortable when the waves are good and as long as it's like this, it's good for everyone... today was a good day for sure."</p>
        
            <p>One heavyweight clash worthy of a final, John John Florence of the United States taking on Australia's Jack Robinson, was brutal and tense rather than spectacular as both tube-riding maestros struggled to get the right waves.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't get it easy. At the start of the heat, I got dragged over the bottom and then almost had a two-wave hold down," said Robinson, coming up from a wipeout just before the next wave smashed him.</p>

            <p>Robinson agreed surfing might be the most dangerous sport in the Olympics in conditions like these.</p>
        
            <p>"Every other sport is in a court or a stadium, and we're in the ocean which is the biggest, most powerful source of life that we have on this planet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The wave just so powerful. It doesn't relate to any other sport, you know what I mean? Maybe an avalanche or something coming down your head on a mountain that's similar... it's so dangerous."</p>
        
            <p>The women's round three was scheduled to follow the men's, but conditions quickly turned with howling winds and pouring rains lashing the lineup, forcing the competition on hold, probably for a couple of days.</p>
