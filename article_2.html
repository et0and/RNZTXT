            <p>Some properties south of a large fire in Amberley are being evacuated, Fire and Emergency Canterbury says.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of several fires in the Canterbury region today, Fire and Emergency says. Crews are also fighting four vegetation fires on Loburn Whiterock Road, near Loburn.</p>
        
            <p>It says multiple tankers and three helicopters are responding to the Amberley fire on Racecourse Road, which was reported early this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Some properties are threatened by the blaze in among vegetation which is being fuelled by tree stumps, tyres, grass and car wrecks.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ says the affected area is about 1km long and 500 metres wide.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurunui District Council has asked those being evacuated to make their way to Hurunui Library on Carters Rd in the town.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be further updates about an evacuation location as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation and patience," it said in a post on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Eight fire trucks, three tankers and three helicopters are attending the Loburn fires which are estimated to cover about a square kilometre.</p>
        
            <p>Police are in the process of evacuating those affected.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby residents who may be affected by smoke should close windows and doors and reduce outdoor exercise, a FENZ spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are advised to call Healthline on 0800 611 116 if they have any concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The council has also appealed to residents in both Amberley and Loburn to limit their water use and not to turn on appliances such as washing machines.</p>
        
            <p>"We have diverted extra water supply to allow the emergency crews to fight the fire."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ has appealed to people to stay away from the scene of the fire so they do not hamper efforts to bring it under control.</p>
