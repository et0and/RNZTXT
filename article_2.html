            <p>The leader of The Opportunities Party is standing down from his role after failing to get into Parliament this election.</p>
        
            <p>Raf Manji posted the announcement to his followers on social media after an annual meeting with the party board and members.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't an easy decision to make but after a great deal of consideration I felt it was the right one for me and it's time to hand it over to the next generation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Opportunities Party received 2.22 percent of the general vote in October's election, not enough for the five percent threshold to enter Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Raf Manji was also bidding for the Christchurch seat of Ilam however came second behind National candidate Hamish Campbell by 7800 votes.</p>
        
            <p>Manji said despite not being successful, the party still made a positive impression with over 63,000 votes.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been fortunate to have a fantastic core team and it has been a pleasure to also work with so many committed volunteers and supporters."</p>
        
            <p>He said the party will hold a meeting early next year to discuss its future.</p>
