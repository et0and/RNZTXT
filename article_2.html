            <p>Champions Trophy Final - New Zealand v India</p>
        
            <p>How prestigious is the Champions Trophy tournament?</p>
        
            <p>The event was first set up in 1998 by the International Cricket Council, with the idea of raising funds for the development of the game in non test-playing countries and has been likened to FIFA's Confederations Cup in football.</p>
        
            <p>The first two tournaments were held in ICC associate member nations - Bangladesh and Kenya - to raise the profile of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>The six editions so far have been moved around the calendar and the trophy actually hasn't been contested since 2017, when Pakistan won the event.</p>
        
            <p>Standing-wise, it is not in the same realm as the World Cup, but winning - as the Black Caps did in 2000 - is certainly an achievement.</p>
        
            <p>Qualification for this year's event was decided on the top eight spots at the last World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Why is the final in Dubai, when Pakistan are the hosts?</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan are the official hosts of the tournament, but India have played all their games in the UAE, not travelling to Pakistan, due to political concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The final would have been in Lahore, had India not qualified for their third straight Champions Trophy final.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps lost to India in pool play in the UAE, so have they experienced conditions there during this tournament and are not unfamiliar with what they will face.</p>
        
            <p>In that match, the Black Caps restricted India to 249/9, with seamer Matt Henry taking 5/42, but India leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy also took 5/42, as New Zealand were dimissed for 205 in reply to lose by 44 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Can the Black Caps win?</p>
        
            <p>They can't be ruled out, as New Zealand continually punch above their weight in ICC tournaments, but India certainly go into the match as favourites, after playing all their games in the UAE and beating New Zealand in poolplay.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty five years ago, when New Zealand won the title, they beat India in the final.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand haven't played many one-dayers against India recently. In fact, the pool match was the first ODI between the Black Caps and India since November 2023.</p>
        
            <p>India have won the previous five games, with New Zealand's last victory coming at Auckland in November 2022.</p>

            <p>Who has performed well for the Black Caps?</p>
        
            <p>Given New Zealand and India are in the final, their bowlers unsurprisingly sit atop the wicket-taking list for the tournament. Henry leads the way with 10, while India's Mohammad Shami is second with eight.</p>
        
            <p>NZ skipper Mitchell Santner is among a group of four with the third most wickets at seven, along with Chakaravarthy.</p>
        
            <p>With 226 runs, Rachin Ravindra sits second on the scoring list, just one run behind England's Ben Duckett. His top score of 112 helped guide New Zealand to victory over South Africa in the semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>An obscure, but interesting stat is most dot balls (no runs conceded) - New Zealand bowlers fill the top three spots, with Michael Bracewell, Santner and Will O'Rourke.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell is also the most economic bowler at the tournament.</p>

            <p>How much do the winners get?</p>
        
            <p>The return of the ICC Men's Champions Trophy for the first time since 2017 will see the winners of the eight-team tournament earn NZ$3.95 million. Runners-up will receive NZ$2.12 million.</p>
        
            <p>The losing semi-finalists walk away with NZ$990 thousand each team.</p>
        
            <p>The total prize pool for the tournament is NZ$12.20 million, a 53 percent increase from the 2017 edition.</p>
        
            <p>The prizemoney the Black Caps win will be shared among the playing group, but not coaching or support staff.</p>

            <p>All the matches in the 2000 tournament were played at Gymkhana Club Ground in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand beat India in the final for their first win in an ICC event.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-five years ago, this was New Zealand's line up in the final: Stephen Fleming (c), Craig Spearman, Nathan Astle, Roger Twose, Chris Cairns, Craig McMillan, Chris Harris, Adam Parore, Scott Styris, Geoff Allott, Shayne O'Connor.</p>
        
            <p>Player of the Match: Chris Cairns, who made 102 not out.</p>

            <p>The tournament will return in 2029, with India as host.</p>
        
            <p>India will also host cricket's next two global ICC events - the Women's 50-over World Cup in October and the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup, alongside Sri Lanka.</p>
