            <p>Auckland Transport has confirmed it will delay changes to overnight on-street parking charges in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>The plans were set to no longer allow free curbside parking in the central city outside peak hours, overnight and at weekends. Instead, vehicle owners will need to stump up between $2 and $3 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>However, Mayor Wayne Brown had said he had no idea the changes were coming.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport chief executive Dean Kimpton said the delay to overnight charges to 1 October allowed for further discussion with key stakeholders and those most affected.</p>
        
            <p>"It also enables us to consider mitigations for those impacted by the changes.</p>
        
            <p>"I have also told the mayor we are sorry and could have done better at keeping him and other important stakeholders sufficiently informed.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the pressure on residents and business, whilst balancing the need to make city centre parking available and in a way that is consistent with the 'Room to Move' parking strategy adopted by Auckland Transport in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to consider possible mitigations for overnight parking changes."</p>
        
            <p>Charges for Sundays and public holidays will begin as planned from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>Wynyard Quarter is exempt from any changes until the Wynyard Crossing pedestrian bridge is operating.</p>
