            <p>Sam Cane was all smiles after his 100th test for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday night's 33-13 win over the Wallabies was the former All Blacks captain's last on New Zealand soil.</p>
        
            <p>After the match, Cane received his silver cap from fellow centurion Beauden Barrett as he became the 13th All Black to reach the 100-test milestone.</p>

            <p>The openside was given a standing ovation from the sold-out Wellington crowd when he was subbed off late in the match.</p>
        
            <p>After the game, the All Blacks performed a stirring haka for Cane and his family in the changing rooms, with the tribute threatening to drown out the Wallabies' press conference in the room next door.</p>
        
            <p>"A big part of rugby is earning your teammates' respect - and the haka is the ultimate sign of respect," Cane said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was awesome and really cool my family was able to be in the changing room. It's pretty rare; it's a pretty special circle in there and for the team to open it up to my mum and dad, my sisters and my wife, it was really cool to be able to share that [with] them.</p>
        
            <p>"You can feel the mana and the emotion that goes into it. The boys don't hold back."</p>
        
            <p>Halfback TJ Perenara, who was also playing his last game in Aotearoa after 87 tests, led the haka.</p>
        
            <p>"Leads a pretty mighty haka," Cane said. "TJ and I have ... played against each other since we were 16 years old, so to be here now as 32-year-olds is pretty remarkable."</p>

            <p>Perenara, a proud Porirua man, was thrilled to have marked his final test at home with a convincing win that snapped the All Blacks six-year winless run in Wellington and meant they finished the Rugby Championship with three wins and three defeats and retained the Bledisloe Cup.</p>
        
            <p>He also received a standing ovation when he was replaced.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really proud. I've played a lot of games here. I've committed a lot of time to the game of rugby. To be able to run off the field and to feel the respect and the appreciation from my home and my people was a really special moment for me," Perenara said.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to play my last test match in New Zealand at home is really special. A lot of family and friends [were] there and to do it in a game when my mate brings up 100 tests as well is pretty cool. It's been a good week and I'm really happy with the performance we put out as well."</p>

            <p>Cane has also had a great week and said some advice from former All Blacks halfback and fellow centurion Aaron Smith helped him make the most of the occasion.</p>
        
            <p>"Aaron Smith messaged me at the start of the week with a few things he was told before his 100th, and one of them was that when people talk about it and do stuff, be grateful and appreciate it, rather than brush it off and stay so focused on the game.</p>
        
            <p>"[It was a] pretty indescribable buzz, running out first in front of your teammates down the tunnel and onto the stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Wellington tonight and throughout game day, in and around town, was the biggest buzz I've felt around the place and I've played a few test matches here.</p>
        
            <p>"Awesome week and I'm hugely appreciative of all the people that have helped along the way. I feel very lucky and privileged to have been able to pull on this special jersey 100 times."</p>

            <p>Cane's and Perenara's test careers may not be over just yet - the pair are heading to Japan at the end of the season - with both keen to be part of the All Blacks' end of year tour to Japan, England, Ireland, France and Italy.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks coach Scott Robertson will name his tour squad on 7 October, with the first game against Japan in Tokyo on 26 October.</p>
