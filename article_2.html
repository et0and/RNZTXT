            <p>Crusaders prop Owen Franks will miss two weeks of Super Rugby after being found guilty of dangerous play in the weekend's game against the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>Franks was sin-binned in the dying moments of their 14-10 loss in Christchurch after he took out Hurricanes forward Justin Sangster with a high shot as he entered a ruck.</p>
        
            <p>His initial yellow card was upgraded to a red on review on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee found Franks guilty of contravening Law 9.20b "Dangerous play in a ruck or maul. A player must not make contact with an opponent above the line of the shoulders."</p>
        
            <p>Franks has been suspended from all forms of the game up to and including 29 March.</p>
        
            <p>He will miss the Crusaders' games against the Blues this weekend and the Chiefs next week.</p>
        
            <p>The entry point for the offence was four weeks but with an early guilty plea the suspension was reduced to two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The player is eligible to apply for the "Head Contact Process - Coaching Intervention" process.</p>
        
            <p>The loss to the Hurricanes leaves the defending champions sitting 11th in the 12 team competition, just above the Western Force with both sides having failed to win any of their four opening games of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Franks' suspension adds to the Crusaders woes after a number of player departures and injuries including having captain Scott Barrett out of action with a broken finger.</p>
