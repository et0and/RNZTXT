            <p>NZ Warriors have kicked off their 2025 NRL campaign with a sloppy 12-12 draw against Cronulla Sharks in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors conceded the first try in the opening minutes, when front-rower Tom Hazelton rumbled over from close range, forcing them to play catch-up.</p>
        
            <p>Fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad levelled the scores with a try, after an offload from forward Demetric Vaimaunga and replacement winger Taine Tuaupiki gave the Warriors the upper hand when he scampered over after halftime.</p>
        
            <p>As both coaches emptied their extending interchange benches in the dying moments, the Sharks levelled with a converted try to Hohepa Puru.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors suffered an early injury blow, when veteran winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak left the game, holding his wrist. He was treated on the sideline but did not return.</p>
        
            <p>They have another pre-season trial against Melbourne Storm in Hamilton next Saturday, before their opening round fixture against Canberra Raiders in Las Vegas on 9 March.</p>
