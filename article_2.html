            <p>A passenger who was burnt when turbulence hit their Air New Zealand flight says a full coffee pot was poured onto her after a massive jolt.</p>
        
            <p>A crew member and a passenger received moderate injuries after flight NZ607 from Wellington to Queenstown on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The passenger who asked to remain anonymous said it was about 15 minutes into the flight when the plane jolted and cabin crew hit the deck during tea service.</p>
        
            <p>"I was able to get a bottle of cold water and start dousing myself and I was able to speak to the hostess who was still lying on the floor and saying, 'Is it alright if I get water everywhere because that's what I will be doing', and she said 'Go for it'.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily for me a paramedic was sitting in the row behind and he helped me for the rest of the flight."</p>
        
            <p>She suffered burns to her arms, abdomen and on her back.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand should reconsider serving hot drinks on short flights and improve the lids on their coffee pots, the passenger said.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the flight told Central Otago media outlet Crux that a crew member said the intense turbulence was the worst she had experienced in her career.</p>
        
            <p>They said another crew member told them they hit the ceiling.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said crew were trained to respond to such situations, and their procedures detail when passengers and crew are required to take their seats during different levels of turbulence.</p>
        
            <p>Chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said clear-air turbulence could happen when rough air was not visible to flight crew.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were always reviewing procedures to ensure customers and the crew's safety were prioritised.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Airport said an ambulance was requested and on standby.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said it was called to Queenstown Airport just before 3pm and took two patients to Lakes District Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
