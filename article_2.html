            <p>Rekha Patel said it didn't look like anything had been taken but but she was really scared.</p>
        
            <p>"I looked at the glass outside and I thought it's something maybe someone broke (a) bottle or something."</p>
        
            <p>She said two customers</p>
        
            <p>came in and helped her get in and check the shop.</p>

            <p>Police said they received a report of wilful damage about 3am on Monday from a passerby who noted a smashed window, and would be following up with the shops.</p>
