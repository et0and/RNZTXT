            <p>It's a year since the coalition of National, ACT, and New Zealand First took the reins of government. In that time, they've passed 46 bills into law.</p>
        
            <p>As often occurs with changes of government, much of the initial period is spent undoing things enacted under the previous holders of office.</p>
        
            <p>Looking down that list of 46 bills, just over 20 percent include the word 'repeal' - a telltale sign of this kind of lawmaking, or rather law-undoing.</p>

            <p>Here are some of those repeal bills.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the doing and undoing from a new government, recycles settings that were in place the last time they had the keys to the Beehive: the three strikes legislation and charter schools are obvious examples of this. It makes for a rather repetitive pattern with changes of government: repeals of repeals of repeals.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister is the chief among the ministers, and ultimately responsible for managing the Cabinet. Christopher Luxon's corporate managerial style wasn't surprising given his resume. The opposition criticised Luxon for wheeling out business jargon like 'KPI's' and 'deliverables'. In any case, the government has stuck with it, and split up its first year of lawmaking into themed quarters.</p>
        
            <p>The third quarter of the year was dubbed 'the law and order quarter', and was the government's busiest portfolio in terms of lawmaking.</p>
        
            <p>Spare a thought though for the Justice Select Committee, who had to trudge through these bills and examine them before they became law. 26 bills were sent to them for consideration in the first year, which is an astronomical number compared to the average - six per committee.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the significant law and order bills that received royal assent this year were:</p>
        
            <p>Other big bills that became law this year have been a combination of proactive and reactive, and have varied in terms of how contentious they were as they passed through the various stages of the legislative process.</p>
