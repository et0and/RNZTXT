            <p>Police say a report of a person with a firearm at the University of Auckland campus was taking part in a planned bird cull and there is no risk to safety.</p>
        
            <p>There was "no cause for concern", they said in statement issued at 9am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland earlier issued an alert to say an armed offender was on its city campus, and police earlier confirmed they were responding to a report of a firearm sighted at the campus.</p>
        
            <p>"A male Offender armed with a long weapon of some description was last located in Sector 100," the university's campus security posted on Facebook initially. "Police are in attendance and are moving through the sector to locate the offender. The last known location was on the Barrack lawn behind the 104 Old Choral Hall construction site."</p>
        
            <p>The university said police had cordoned off the area as they investigated.</p>
