            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said wet weather was forecast in western regions, with the rainfall expected to move up towards Northland at the end of the day, accompanied by strong northwesterly winds.</p>
        
            <p>"Some stronger winds to watch out for through there again in places like Wellington, Marlborough Sounds, Wairarapa - do watch out for those stronger winds, even round parts of Taranaki seeing those winds picking up as well."</p>
        
            <p>Orange level heavy rain warnings are in place for:</p>

            <p>"Even on the South Island there's some decent spells of sunshine places like Canterbury up in towards Nelson and around in towards Marlborough."</p>
        
            <p>But another front would bring rain back into Fiordland and Southland by the end of the day, he said.</p>
