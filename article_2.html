            <p>There are major delays for traffic in both directions on Auckland's Southern Motorway after a crash between Bombay and Ramarama.</p>
        
            <p>A crash there earlier had snarled the traffic, and the back-ups continued as vehicle recovery was being carried out along that section of State Highway 1, Waka Kotahi said.</p>
        
            <p>Northbound and southbound lane closures were in place as crews worked at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists were being warned about delays and major congestion between Bombay and Drury, and were asked to merge carefully.</p>
