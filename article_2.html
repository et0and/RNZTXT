            <p>US President Donald Trump has told NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte that US control of Greenland is necessary to enhance international security, escalating his campaign to annex the strategic Arctic island.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, Mark, we need that for international security, not just security - international - we have a lot of our favorite players cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful," Trump told Rutte as they sat side-by-side in the White House Oval Office for talks on Friday (NZT). "We'll be talking to you."</p>
        
            <p>Asked directly about the prospect of annexation, Trump said: "I think that will happen."</p>
        
            <p>Trump has made US annexation of Greenland a major talking point since he took office on 20 January.</p>

            <p>His comments on Thursday suggested he might want NATO involved in his attempt to take over the island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p>
        
            <p>The comments drew a swift rejection from the outgoing prime minister of Greenland.</p>
        
            <p>"The US president has once again aired the thought of annexing us," Mute Egede said in a Facebook post. "Enough is enough."</p>
        
            <p>NATO and Denmark's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Opinion polls suggest that most Greenlanders oppose joining the US, although a majority favour eventual independence from Denmark.</p>
        
            <p>Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which wants a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday's parliamentary election.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Trump said that election was good for the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Even before starting his second term as president, Trump said he hoped to make Greenland a part of the United States, even though NATO ally Denmark says it is not for sale.</p>
        
            <p>Greenland's strategic location and rich mineral resources could benefit the US It lies along the shortest route from Europe to North America, vital for the US ballistic missile warning system.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has managed to annoy Canadians with his proposal the country become the 51st US state. He also demands the US exert more influence over the Panama canal.</p>
        
            <p>Rutte told Trump that he would leave the question of Greenland's future to others and that, "I don't want to drag NATO" into the debate. He said it should be a topic for countries in the "high north" because the Chinese and Russia are using water routes in the area.</p>

            <p>Trump persisted, saying Denmark was refusing to discuss the topic and that he might send more US troops to bolster the American bases on Greenland.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been dealing with Denmark, we've been dealing with Greenland, and we have to do it. We really need it for national security. I think that's why NATO might have to get involved in a way, because we really need Greenland for national security. It's very important," Trump said.</p>
        
            <p>Trump also sought to undermine Denmark's claim to the island.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, Denmark's very far away, and really has nothing to do. What happens, a boat landed there 200 years ago or something? And they say they have rights to it. I don't know if that's true. I don't think it is," he said.</p>
