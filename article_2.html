            <p>Water storage tanks are in hot demand in Wellington, and the council says deliveries should soon ramp up to meet the need.</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonians were warned they should have emergency water stored at their homes in the case of a shortage during a sizzling summer. The region has been urged to prepare for the possibility of an acute water shortage.</p>
        
            <p>A queue of people waited hours in the hot sun to purchase discounted 200 litre water tanks at the southern landfill's Tip Shop on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>There were 70 tanks available in the latest delivery, and everyone who queued walked away happy, council spokesperson Richard MacLean said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we are now obviously subject to the ability of the manufacturer to build these tanks, or produce these tanks as quickly as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We're expecting a delivery each week, and hopefully if the manufacturer can scale up, then that will become more frequent."</p>

Sales of water storage tanks have jumped in the Wellington region after Wellingtonians were warned to have water stored at their homes in case of a shortage this summer.

            <p>Council would let people know when more were available, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The tanks were significantly cheaper than usual: the Wellington Region Emergency Management Office partnered with manufacturer The Tank Guy to offer them for $115, down from $265.</p>
        
            <p>They were also available at council facilities in Lower Hutt, Porirua, South Wairarapa, Carterton and Masterton. Water tanks are temporarily out of stock at KƒÅpiti and Upper Hutt councils.</p>
        
            <p>It was promising that people seemed to understand how important it was to store water, MacLean said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very pleased that people are showing interest and taking this situation seriously."</p>
        
            <p>But it was not just important during summer, he said.</p>
        
            <p>At-home water storage was also vital in case of natural disasters like earthquakes, when water supplies could be compromised.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, water tank sales in Upper Hutt have increased by more than a 1000 percent compared to two summers ago.</p>
        
            <p>Upper Hutt City Council said it had sold 456 water tanks in the past three months - only 35 were sold during the same period in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it had currently sold out of the tanks, and new stock would not arrive for a couple of weeks.</p>
