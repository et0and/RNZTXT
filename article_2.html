            <p>An orchestra that began playing at Ponsonby's Leys Institute in 1912 is shocked plans to restore its buildings may be halted.</p>
        
            <p>The century-old heritage buildings previously hosted a library and community spaces, but have been closed since 2019, awaiting earthquake strengthening and restoration.</p>
        
            <p>But as part of Auckland Council's Long-Term Plan, Mayor Wayne Brown has proposed halting all seismic upgrades of council properties.</p>
        
            <p>In the past 30 years, the Leys Orchestra had put on more than 90 concerts, mostly at the Leys Institute Hall.</p>
        
            <p>David Britten, who has conducted the orchestra since November 1990, said losing its main rehearsal and performance space had been difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"The orchestra has had a tough time. We have lost our home."</p>
        
            <p>Britten said the community orchestra's membership had dropped significantly since moving to temporary rehearsal spaces in West Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It is difficult for new members to join as we are not central anymore. It has been a big hit and is a constant worry."</p>
        
            <p>The orchestra's heritage music collection was also inside the institute, which the group now could not easily access, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the music was purchased directly by the Leys Institute Orchestra, but most of the collection comprises music donated to the orchestra by orchestras, individuals, and other groups over the decades.</p>
        
            <p>"The music extant in our collection is a valuable legacy of the wealth of music played across the city a century ago."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillor Richard Hills believed Ponsonby's Leys Institute should be restored, despite the mayor's proposal.</p>
        
            <p>He supported reviewing Auckland's seismic requirements to better reflect the city's earthquake risk, but said the Ponsonby buildings were a unique case.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a strong community expectation to get it done."</p>
        
            <p>He said the WaitematƒÅ Local Board planned to sell three properties to contribute to the buildings' restoration costs.</p>
        
            <p>The future of the institute is set to be decided by Auckland Council next month.</p>
