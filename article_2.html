            <p>The search for people trapped in rubble and landslides is continuing to day as the New Zealand Defence Force arrives in Port Vila.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force was delayed arriving into Vanuatu after a fault on one of the older Hercules plane.</p>
        
            <p>Labour said it was embarrassing, but a new Hercules plane has landed in Port Vila and a second is on the way to Noumea.</p>
        
            <p>More than 300 aftershocks have been felt since the big quake on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>And the official death toll was revised down to 9, though it was expected to rise. Two Chinese nationals were among the dead.</p>
