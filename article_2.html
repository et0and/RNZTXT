            <p>An 80-year-old man has been sentenced to four years imprisonment for killing his 78-year-old wife in a retirement village in Mount Maunganui.</p>
        
            <p>John Alfred Salter appeared at Hamilton High Court before Justice Francis Cooke on Thursday after already spending four months in custody.</p>
        
            <p>A minimum period of imprisonment was not imposed, and Salter would be eligible for parole after one third of his sentence.</p>
        
            <p>When Cooke passed his sentence, he told Salter not to give up hope, and to start thinking about his future now.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Metlifecare's Bayswater retirement village at 6.55pm where they found the body of Jean Salter on 8 October.</p>
        
            <p>Salter plead guilty to murdering Jean, 78, in their apartment, strangling her with a neck tie he had hidden behind a cushion.</p>
        
            <p>She gasped, "Oh John" several times as he killed her, according to court documents previously obtained by Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>He then went into his bathroom and tried to kill himself. When that failed, he called a relative, then police.</p>
        
            <p>The documents say the suggestion that Jean go into full-time care "caused John to become stressed and concerned about being separated from his wife".</p>
        
            <p>According to the court summary, Salter claimed he had spoken to Jean in the week leading up to the killing about a suicide pact. She would nod in agreement, before forgetting the arrangement.</p>
        
            <p>In preparation, Salter started taking blood thinners, the documents say. He told police he killed Jean because he could not live without her and planned to kill himself to be with her.</p>
        
            <p>Salter has been in custody since his last court appearance in November.</p>
