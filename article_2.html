            <p>Californian Rick Fleischer did not turn up at the Americarna festival in Taranaki this week to show off a classic car - but to be reunited with one.</p>
        
            <p>From Lake Tahoe, he sold his 1974 AMC Javelin to Aucklander John Campbell about a decade ago.</p>
        
            <p>The car enthusiasts had kept in contact and Fleischer reckoned it was time to be reacquainted with his 'girl'.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year when John was at Americarna, I told him I'm coming next year, I'm going to be your Americana, so here I am."</p>
        
            <p>The reunion was not painless, however.</p>
        
            <p>"I regretted selling it but you know what, John's the right guy to own this car. He's passionate about it. He knows everything about the manufacture and sometimes it's just nice to see that a car goes to a person who really is the right person to own it."</p>
        
            <p>Fleischer had originally bought the Javelin for his son but when he left to go to university he put it up for sale.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said he was glad he had kept in contact with Fleischer after buying the vehicle via an eBay auction and that the Californian could be in New Zealand to enjoy Americarna with him.</p>
        
            <p>"This had been my dream car for years and I'd always wanted to own one and thankfully I was able to buy it off Rick."</p>
        
            <p>He admitted to being a little apprehensive about reuniting the Javelin with Fleischer.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah sure, he's been jiving me a bit that he's come back to repossess it which has been pretty funny."</p>
        
            <p>The Javelin is a two-door hardtop manufactured by American Motors Corporation across two generations: 1968-1970 and 1971-1974.</p>
        
            <p>It was the Trans Am Series winner in 1971, 1972, and 1976 and the second generation variety was used as the standard highway patrol vehicle in the US.</p>

            <p>The annual Americarna event is in its 16th year and pumps more than $4 million into the Taranaki economy.</p>
        
            <p>This year more than 750 classic cars were registered, but the event was not without controversy with Climate Justice Taranaki, Palestine Solidarity Taranaki and the Better Streets Project calling for a boycott of the festival.</p>
        
            <p>Palestine Solidarity Taranaki's Kate Cole said now was not the time for the United States national flag to be seen flying all over the province.</p>
        
            <p>"At a time when we are witnessing the mass slaughter and expulsion of Palestinians in Rafah and the ongoing genocide in Gaza, knowing the complicity of the US sending billions of dollars aiding and arming Israel, I find the brazen display of the American flag and the fossil fuelled Americarna celebration disturbing and distasteful."</p>
        
            <p>The call for a boycott appeared to have little impact with crowds turning out to watch the vehicles as they paraded through Waitara, Inglewood, Hāwera and Ōpunake this week and cruised through the New Plymouth city centre last night.</p>
        
            <p>The event wraps up Saturday with a family fun day in New Plymouth.</p>
