        <h2>Quake strengthening 'waste of money' - Wellington Girls' College principal</h2>
        <p>
The school closed a block after it failed an earthquake assessment, and wants to pull the building down and start from scratch. Audio

            <p>Wellington Girls' College says the Ministry of Education is proposing a building project that is a waste of taxpayers' money.</p>
        
            <p>The school already had a massive shortfall of teaching space before it discovered its biggest classroom block, Brook, with 27 teaching spaces, is rated just 15 percent of new building standard or NBS.</p>
        
            <p>Any building under 34 percent is quake-prone - the risk of dying in such a building in any given year is between a fifth and a half the risk of dying in a car crash.</p>
        
            <p>Brook's two top floors - added in 1994 - are much lighter than the underlying structure, so lack flexibility in a quake.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry is proposing to strengthen Brook block to just 35 percent by early next year as a stopgap measure.</p>

            <p>But principal Julia Davidson said the school wanted it pulled down and that it would be more cost-effective to start from scratch.</p>
        
            <p>"As taxpayers, we think it is a waste of money" to go ahead with short-term strengthening, she said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>School staff and whƒÅnau were due to meet officials on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry told Nine-to-Noon on Tuesday that its recommendation that students keep using Brook in the meantime, was different than it evacuating its own Wellington headquarters for seismic reasons two years ago - because each building was different.</p>
        
            <p>That is true: The school block is rated a more important structure than the headquarters. Brook is an Importance Level 3 (IL3) building, versus just IL2 for the office block housing the Ministry of Education. This is due to the Wellington Girls' block having over 300 children in it on a school day.</p>
        
            <p>It must therefore be assessed against a higher standard.</p>

            <p>When the ministry moved out of its headquarters, it did so after getting a Targeted Seismic Assessment (TSA), which returned a 25-30 percent NBS rating on crucial parts like floors.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, it wanted the school to perform only a TSA, as opposed to a full Detailed Seismic Assessment (DSA), saying the latter would take longer, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>The school board instead paid for a DSA, which it received last week, triggering yesterday's decision to evacuate students.</p>
        
            <p>Paying for a full DSA had been worth it for peace of mind; staff had been full of questions about which parts of the block were weak, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really reassuring to know everything has been looked at."</p>
        
            <p>The ministry's TSA on the building it evacuated recommended it do a DSA on it, "to ensure that all elements are reviewed and assessed prior to any strengthening design".</p>
