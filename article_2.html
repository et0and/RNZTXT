            <p>Freeskiers Luca Harrington and Ben Barclay have finished second and third place respectively at the FIS Freeski Slopestyle World Cup in Canada, making history for New Zealand snow sports.</p>
        
            <p>For both Wānaka freeskiers it was their career-second Men's Freeski Slopestyle World Cup podium and they were thrilled to do it together.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time two Kiwi athletes have shared a Park & Pipe World Cup podium.</p>
        
            <p>"We have put so much work in together - we train together every day, we travel together, so it was amazing to stand together on the podium," Harrington said.</p>
        
            <p>"If there is one person I'm not too fussed bumping me down [from second into third] it is Luca," Barclay said. "Luca has been on a tear this season, so to join him on the podium is a dream come true, it was amazing."</p>
        
            <p>With two jumps at the top of the Stoneham course and then three rail pads providing numerous line options, it was a competition that encouraged creativity.</p>
        
            <p>Barclay opted for a technical run to show off his skills, including back-to-back double corked 1620s on the jumps and a bio 810 out of the first rail feature. Dropping at the start of the field, Barclay was initially positioned in first place, before Matej Svancer of Austria and team-mate Harrington leapfrogged him with their final runs.</p>
        
            <p>Harrington, a big air specialist, made the most of the jumps putting down a switch right double corked 1800 Japan grab into a switch left double 1620 safety grab. The 20-year-old then laced together a technical rail section that included a gravity defying 450 gap between two rail features.</p>
        
            <p>Svancer remained in the lead to take the win, with Harrington in second and Barclay in third with just 0.54 points separating the New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>It was Harrington's best Slopestyle World Cup result and Barclay's first World Cup podium in just over three years.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old was thrilled to be back on the podium.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long time coming and it is amazing to be on the podium in such a strong field," Barclay said.</p>
        
            <p>For Harrington it was a special result.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, this podium had been a huge one for me, I have been super grateful for all the big air results, but I don't want to be known as just a big air skier, slopestyle is harder so today meant a lot to me."</p>
        
            <p>Snow Sports NZ head coach and pathway director, park and pipe Tom Willmott was thrilled but not surprised with the pair's results.</p>
        
            <p>"Luca and Ben both delivered world-class slopestyle runs this morning, and making history for NZ snow sports is the cherry on top. The Snow Sports NZ Park & Pipe programme has been on a tear in 2025 achieving fantastic results in both Freeski and Snowboard across Halfpipe, Slopestyle and Big Air.</p>
        
            <p>"I am stoked to see the boys execute their competition runs so well and to see both Luca and Ben share the podium is something very special. I also want to acknowledge the exceptional work of their lead coach Hamish McDougall, his dedication to all the athletes he works with is second to none."</p>
