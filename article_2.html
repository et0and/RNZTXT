        <h2>Crunching the Numbers: Kiwis spending half their household income on rent</h2>
        <p>
In RNZ's new series, we're out chatting to Kiwis about all things affecting their wallets. First up: renting.
</p>
        
            <p>In RNZ's new series Crunching the Numbers we are out chatting to Kiwis about all things affecting their wallets. Our first story looks at renting, with research showing almost one-in-five New Zealanders are spending more than half of their household income on rent, while home ownership has fallen to below 60 percent. </p>
        
            <p>Hayley Müller lives in Auckland's West Harbour with her husband and their three children.</p>
        
            <p>It is $665 a week to rent their place.</p>
        
            <p>Müller says that is a pretty great price - other rentals they looked at were around $850.</p>
        
            <p>She is taking care of their nine-month-old baby and their six- and three-year-old boys.</p>
        
            <p>In the winter it costs about $250 a month to heat the home, groceries are $300 a week and childcare is $220.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty percent of their weekly household income goes towards rent.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't necessarily look forward to saving a whole lot for buying our own home, so that's something that you struggle with if you're renting," Müller says.</p>
        
            <p>"How much money do you have left to actually save to buy your own place."</p>

            <p>While they are okay with that for now, it is confronting being at the mercy of someone else. This is their sixth home in six years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nerve wracking for us, the last time it was around Christmas and it yeah, it's you have to sort of start manifesting a sense of trust that it's going to be okay because it's really scary not knowing if you're going to have a home to live in.</p>
        
            <p>"We actually moved out of that house on the day we had to."</p>
        
            <p>Müller says they love their rental but being renters meant uncertainty hangs over them - and they never feel fully settled.</p>
        
            <p>"There is always an inherent fear that the landlord, well within their rights, will decide I'm actually selling."</p>
        
            <p>Hayley is part of a growing trend of New Zealanders who do not own their home.</p>
        
            <p>Home ownership in New Zealand has dropped to below 60 percent, according to a recent report by Deloitte that was commissioned by Westpac.</p>
        
            <p>It is now at its lowest rate in almost 80 years.</p>

            <p>The report reflects Müller's reality - outlining how half of renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent.</p>
        
            <p>For communications student Amani Sadique, the Mt Albert five-bedroom flat she has lived in since April last year swallows up almost 40 percent of her income.</p>
        
            <p>She has only just become eligible for the student allowance due to immigrating from the UK. Previously she worked up 20 hours a week to make ends meet.</p>
        
            <p>Now her budget is a bit more flexible.</p>
        
            <p>"I get $100 a week from living costs and then I get $200 from student allowance, which I don't have to pay back and then from the 8 hours that I work at my part time job, I get around $170."</p>
        
            <p>That brings her weekly income to $470 aside from rent, about $20 goes towards bills, $20 on public transport and $80 towards groceries. She also goes to a dance class once a week which costs $25.</p>

            <p>That leaves about $150 left over.</p>
        
            <p>The flat costs $950 a week, and they are happy with that price.</p>
        
            <p>But the house is cold and costs a lot to heat. They also rely on dehumidifiers.</p>
        
            <p>They are not sure whether the flat is fully insulated. In winter they wear their puffer jackets indoors.</p>
        
            <p>"I do buy like just from a dollar store, a little damp rid now and again whenever they get too full.</p>
        
            <p>"I have this specific pair of shoes which are leather and no matter how much I wipe them or like how I store them, they just keep getting mould growing on them.</p>

            <p>"Some of the other flatmates have it worse, the one that's moving out, she said recently she did a clear out and a lot of her clothes had mould on them."</p>
        
            <p>Just a few days after Checkpoint visited, the flat was given notice from their landlord that they needed to move out.</p>
        
            <p>Now Sadique is facing a similar situation to the one she was in just a year ago - trying to find a rental that fits her budget.</p>
        
            <p>"It was basically if I don't have a place within four weeks, I've got nowhere to go.</p>
        
            <p>"I did feel really helpless at one point."</p>
