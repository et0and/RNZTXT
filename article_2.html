        <h2>In pictures: Huge slip tears through street, Dunedin roads flood</h2>
        <p>
Homes have flooded, people have evacuated, roads are closed, and power and water are out in parts of Dunedin and the region.
</p>
        
            <p>Homes have flooded, at least 100 people evacuated, and power and water were out to parts of Dunedin in a deluge.</p>
        
            <p>The downpour, which began on Thursday and continues on Friday, sparked a local state of emergency, and the region's first ever red rain warning.</p>
        
            <p>Slips and water have made many roads in the region impassable and people were urged to stay home where possible. Among them, a major slip has cut across Burkes Drive in the suburb of Maia. A video of the damage is at the top of this page.</p>
