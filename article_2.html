            <p>Three bodies believed to be those of the missing fishers have been found on the shore at Māhia this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police said formal identification was under way but the bodies were believed to be of the fishers who were reported missing on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Police's thoughts are with their families at this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>Tatapouri Fishing Club President Roger Faber was also out fishing on Monday and spoke to the missing fishers.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were lured by some nice blue fin tuna which was caught off Gisborne over the weekend and a weather forecast that was meant to improve.</p>
        
            <p>"We all communicated with each other as we went out and talked about our plans for the day.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately the weather was nothing like forecast, we expected it to get better, it didn't get better, it got worse," Faber told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>He said when he pulled back at 11am because of the weather, they tried to contact the missing boat but could not.</p>
        
            <p>"At the time we didn't think too much of it, we thought 'oh well hopefully they've just decided to go in earlier too'.</p>
        
            <p>"But then when we returned to the boat ramp and saw that their trailer was still there, that's when our concerns rose and we sounded the alarm."</p>
        
            <p>Hearing the bodies had been found, Faber said it was a "terrible day".</p>
        
            <p>The men, particularly the skipper, were experienced and well-respected club members, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole community is suffering ... and whānau and friends will be really suffering."</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre general manager Justin Allan said rescuers went to their limits trying to find the three fishers.</p>
        
            <p>The search and rescue operation was difficult and complex, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Weather conditions in the area were severe ... Responders from the region, as well as rescue aircraft sourced from across the North Island had to battle atrocious conditions; including swells of up to and at times more than six metres, 50 knot winds and low visibility, showing how determined they were to reach the men in the water."</p>
        
            <p>The conditions were just too severe, Allan said.</p>
        
            <p>He extended his thoughts to the families and thanked everyone involved in the search efforts.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne mayor Rehette Stoltz told Morning Report the news the bodies had been found was heartbreaking.</p>
        
            <p>"Our community is in mourning."</p>
        
            <p>She said her love and thoughts were with the families.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is waking up to this news and our community is right behind them."</p>
        
            <p>Stoltz said the region was experiencing some of the worst weather it had seen, which made the search difficult.</p>
        
            <p>The search and rescue operation was suspended at 7pm Tuesday and had been due to resume today.</p>
        
            <p>The boat carrying the three missing fishers was reported overdue on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The bulk carrier ship - the African Tiger - spotted two men in rough seas off Māhia Peninsula on Tuesday but could not reach them. Those on board threw life rings and flotsam into the water.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force's P8 Poseidon also dropped a life raft in the same area.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand suspended the search shortly after 7pm Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Eastland Helicopter Rescue Trust chairperson Patrick Willock said searchers looking for the missing crew in horrendous conditions yesterday were nothing short of heroic.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter from the trust had been helping with the search.</p>
        
            <p>Willock said the missing people were well known in local hunting and fishing circles. He knew two of the missing men through family connections, he said.</p>
