            <p>A slow-moving band of rain is soaking Taranaki, northern Tai Rāwhiti and the Ruahine Range.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth had 20mm of rain in the last six hours.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain warnings are in place for the Ruahine Range and the inland ranges of Hawke's Bay until 4am Tuesday and Tai Rāwhiti Gisborne from Tolaga Bay northwards until 6am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A low-pressure system to the east of the North Island is pulling in warm and wet sub-tropical air.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Jessie Owen told Morning Report there would be another day of rain for the east.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a bit of a wet one for the North Island the last few days and unfortunately we've still got a bit of it to go."</p>
        
            <p>Any heavy rain could cause surface flooding, streams and rivers to rise, slips and hazardous driving.</p>
        
            <p>The rivers could take the heavy rain downstream, Owen said.</p>
        
            <p>"The western parts of the North Island should start to clear up by about overnight tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"It's looking like Thursday is going to be pick of the week for the North Island."</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch for Taranaki was due to be lifted at 10am Monday.</p>
