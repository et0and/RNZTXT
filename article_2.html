            <p>Reports of a firearm that prompted at least a dozen armed police to swarm a central Auckland building has turned out to be a long piece of photographic equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded to reports of a person with a gun entering a building on Hobson Street in the city.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police were seen at Goodview Apartment Hotel and a RNZ reporter was told by police that two men had been arrested on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police warned that members of the public would see an increased police presence in the area but stressed that there was no danger to the public.</p>

            <p>However police said the incident had now been resolved with no ongoing issues.</p>
        
            <p>No firearm was found and officers believed a long piece of photographic equipment was mistaken for a firearm by an observer.</p>
        
            <p>A person was arrested at the apartment for an outstanding warrant to arrest, not related to this incident.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, police said two other people who were taken into custody were released without charge.</p>
        
            <p>In March, armed police went to the same building after reports of a gun sighting.</p>
        
            <p>A resident of the apartment building said officers were called to the area on a daily basis.</p>
        
            <p>They said there were often problems with violence, drugs and alcohol and some residents were on bail or were going through the court system.</p>
