            <p>An ambulance officer has broken down in tears describing trying to treat worshippers who needed surgeons, not paramedics, after being shot in the terror attack at Christchurch's Al Noor Mosque.</p>
        
            <p>Craig Stockdale was one of the first St John ambulance officers at the mosque after the mass shooting on 15 March 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He became emotional answering questions about potentially life-saving treatments for injured people in the Deans Avenue mosque, saying they would not be carried out in a mass casualty situation because of the skill and time involved.</p>
        
            <p>"In my heart, I knew, what these people needed was a surgeon, not a paramedic on the periphery trying to help them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They needed a hospital and we as a group, we knew that and that was our sole aim."</p>
        
            <p>Stockdale said the mosque's hallway was "littered" with bodies and paramedics had to step over people to help those who had survived.</p>
        
            <p>The Coroners Court earlier heard a senior policeman watching a delayed feed of the terrorist's livestream of the massacre relayed the information in error in a panicked transmission over police radio.</p>
        
            <p>For a few minutes, police and paramedics at the scene thought the terrorist was returning to the mosque, but they soon realised it was a mistake.</p>
        
            <p>It was one of the times where Stockdale felt the security situation at the scene changed.</p>
        
            <p>Stockdale told the court police at the scene did not tell him the information was incorrect, which was "unsettling".</p>
        
            <p>There was no debrief about the situation and they all "just ploughed on".</p>
        
            <p>Just minutes later at 2.15pm, the first two St John paramedics entered the mosque with an armed police escort to assess the situation.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after, injured survivors began being taken from the mosque, but Stockdale said he "absolutely" still believed the gunman might come back.</p>
        
            <p>He said if he had been told it was a false alarm, it may have reduced his concern.</p>

            <p>Another St John ambulance officer who attended the scene at Al Noor Mosque said the clinical benefit of getting survivors to hospital quickly outweighed the risk involved.</p>
        
            <p>The ambulance officer, who cannot be named, gave evidence on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was an "unnerving environment" given the areas surrounding the scene where a gunman could be hiding.</p>
        
            <p>He authorised a small team to go into the mosque and extricate those who had survived the massacre.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to only allow six St John staff inside the mosque was made as he did not want to expose more crew than necessary to the risk of danger.</p>
        
            <p>He had the "benefit of an experience and level-headed crew" who would understand how to work swiftly and make the difficult decisions they needed to order to avoid any unnecessary treatment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The officer explained he had emphasised the importance of a "load and go" approach with incoming ambulances so patients would get to hospital as quickly as possible.</p>
        
            <p>He said he believed the response at the scene went well - and Stockdale's decision to declare it a mass casualty event helped get a significant number of resources to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was a "strong sense of danger" throughout the response, but he believed the risk was manageable, or at least the clinical benefits for patients outweighed the risk.</p>
        
            <p>"It was fortunate the risks did not eventuate," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest will examine the following 10 issues over six weeks:</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
