            <p>Once owned by royalty, one of New Zealand's most viewed homes, the historic Clark House in Auckland's Hobsonville, has finally been sold.</p>
        
            <p>The house gained attention in late 2022, due to an unusual listed owner - her Majesty the Queen, who died earlier that year.</p>
        
            <p>With King Charles III having recently ascended the throne the idea that the sovereign owned the West Auckland property made headlines at the time.</p>

            <p>But despite the clever advertising, in reality, neither the King nor Queen had individual ownership of the property.</p>
        
            <p>Instead the title was listed under the Crown, with the New Zealand Defence Force using the property for RNZAF operations from 1950 until 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Previously listed for $5.2m-plus, the 1.9ha estate has a CV of $16.58m and a category 1 Historic Places listing.</p>

            <p>The final sale price hasn't been made public, Harcourts agents told the property news website OneRoof.</p>
        
            <p>Built by English ceramics entrepreneur Rice Owen Clark II in 1902, the Italianate-style villa was a showcase for his company's unique experimental glazed, hollow ceramic blocks.</p>
        
            <p>The residence boasted several other visually striking features, including ornate iron-lace verandas, regarded as among the finest in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Its interior showcased a variety of ceiling designs, including elaborate kauri and intricate decorative tilework.</p>

            <p>Historical accounts show the Clark family lived there until selling to the Crown in 1950 for £8000.</p>
        
            <p>The RNZAF repurposed the prestigious property as a Task Force Headquarters, later hosting high-level Cold War meetings, including a 1955 South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) conference.</p>

            <p>In 1967, it became home to the Aviation Medicine Unit, featuring a newly built annex housing the RNZAF's only decompression chamber.</p>
        
            <p>The house, which needs restoration, includes 10 large rooms, stained glass windows, and a grand staircase.</p>

            <p>Onekiritea, also known as the Hobsonville Peninsula, holds deep significance for Te Kawerau ā Maki, who lived there before European settlement.</p>
        
            <p>The area's cultural and ancestral importance is reflected in place names such as Te Waiarohia o Ngāriki, Tahingamanu, and Te Taungaroa. It was a vital site for fishing, food gathering, and kūmara cultivation.</p>
        
            <p>After the Crown acquired the land in 1853, it was subdivided and sold to European settlers, including Clark.</p>
