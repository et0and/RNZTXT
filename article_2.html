            <p>The Waikato District Council announced the closure after the coastline lost two metres to erosion overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The overnight erosion of a Port Waikato beach carpark was reminiscent of scenes from the Apocalypse Now film, the local Surf Lifesaving president says.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the Waikato District Council announced the closure of the carpark after the coastline lost two metres to erosion overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Sunset Beach Surf Lifesaving Club president Malcolm Beattie told Morning Report  it was like a scene from the movie.</p>
        
            <p>"It was horrific."</p>
        
            <p>There had been a slow erosion over the past decade, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The beach itself, and the road to the beach, remained open, Beattie said.</p>
        
            <p>The Surf Lifesaving Club was putting together a proposal for the Council with three options for saving the carpark.</p>
        
            <p>Beattie said its preferred option was to use untreated poles and rocks.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very optimistic that the council under the circumstances will permit that."</p>
        
            <p>In a post on its Facebook page, the Council said the carpark would remain closed until further notice and beach-goers should avoid the area under the carpark.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working closely with the local community to respond, with a quickly moveable barrier to keep people safe on the car park. We thank them for their assistance," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"200 sand bags will be delivered for the car park to temporarily reduce run off from rain further contributing to erosion."</p>
