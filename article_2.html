            <p>The man inside the costume for South Sydney's mascot has apologised for pushing a nine-year-old Sharks fan on the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>At the Rabbitohs' loss to Cronulla on Saturday, a young fan was shoved by the mascot, named Reggie Rabbit, as he was walking off the field.</p>
        
            <p>Charlie Gallico, who has been inside the costume for over two decades, said on Monday that the fan called him over, then grabbed at him, before the push.</p>
        
            <p>Gallico, 81, told Channel 10 he did not think he did anything wrong, but on Tuesday issued a public apology after reviewing the footage of him pushing Benji Agius.</p>
        
            <p>"My actions were wrong. I should never have pushed Benji, or any child for that matter, the way I did on Saturday," Gallico said in a Souths statement on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"I love children and do a lot of work for charity, in the community and in junior football. I realise Reggie Rabbit is a children's character and my actions were not right.</p>
        
            <p>"After going through the video I now realise I was in the wrong. I realise Benji did nothing wrong and didn't deserve to be pushed, and I take full responsibility for what I did.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope they can forgive me and accept my apology, and I hope he continues to love rugby league and keeps enjoying going to the football on the weekends.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't apologise enough to Benji and his family for what happened."</p>
        
            <p>The club said it had spoken to Benji's parents, the Sharks, event security and the NRL integrity unit about the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Gallico was defended by prime minister and former Rabbitohs board member Anthony Albanese on Monday, although it was unclear if he had seen the video.</p>
        
            <p>"Charlie is a very gentle person â€¦ he has been doing it for a long time and he would never try to hurt anyone," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure if there has been inappropriate behaviour, he would be the first to apologise."</p>
        
            <p>Gallico said his actions had hurt the club and pledged "nothing like this will ever happen again".</p>
