            <p>Nearly 100 live samples of the deadly Hendra virus have been lost in a biosecurity bungle at a state-run Queensland laboratory.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation has been launched after it was revealed 323 virus samples went missing from Virology Laboratory in 2021 in a "major breach" of biosecurity protocol, Health Minister Tim Nicholls announced on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The material, which included samples of Hendra virus, lyssavirus and hantavirus, appears to have gone missing after a freezer storing the samples broke down.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls said the breach was uncovered in August 2023. The lab has been unable to say whether the materials were removed or destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's this part of the transfer of those materials that is causing concern," Nicholls said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were transferred to a functioning freezer without the appropriate paperwork being completed.</p>
        
            <p>"The materials may have been removed from that secure storage and lost, or otherwise unaccounted-for."</p>
        
            <p>There is no suggestion the samples were taken or stolen from the laboratory.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Health Officer Dr John Gerrard said the breach in record keeping was serious, but the risk to the community was very low.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to note that these virus samples would degrade very rapidly outside a low-temperature freezer and become non-infectious," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"No Hendra or lyssavirus cases have been detected among humans in Queensland over the past five years, and there has been no report of hantavirus infections in humans ever in Australia."</p>
        
            <p>Hendra virus is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to people.</p>
        
            <p>In 1994, the virus swept through racing stables in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, killing a trainer and 13 horses.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, there have been 66 known outbreaks across Australia, killing four people and dozens of horses.</p>
        
            <p>The missing materials include 223 fragmented samples of lyssavirus, another potentially deadly disease similar to the rabies virus.</p>
        
            <p>Two full samples of hantavirus, which has never been recorded in humans in Australia, are also missing.</p>
        
            <p>Asked why the public were not made aware of the breach sooner, Nicholls said that would form part of the review.</p>
        
            <p>"These are all matters that I think the investigation will be able to provide us with information on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Former Supreme Court Justice Martin Daubney will lead the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Its terms of reference will consider the "management, administration, or delivery of public sector health services in the laboratory".</p>
        
            <p>Internal policies and guidelines on how virus samples are kept in the lab will be analysed to see if they were correctly followed.</p>
        
            <p>Recommendations will be made in a report to be delivered to the health department by 30 June this year.</p>
        
            <p>The breach comes as thousands of DNA samples are being re-tested after historical flaws were uncovered in the state-run Forensic Science Queensland lab.</p>
        
            <p>More than 40,000 criminal cases were affected by the discovery of systemic failures in the way DNA samples were analysed.</p>
        
            <p>The findings sparked two commissions of inquiry, with the retesting process expected to take years.</p>
