        <h2>New Zealand Winter Games canned after 15 years</h2>
        <p>
The games were considered the largest snow sports event in the Southern Hemisphere.

            <p>The annual Winter Games New Zealand event will no longer be held due to "adverse economic conditions", event administrators have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Known as the largest snow sports event in the Southern Hemisphere, the multi-sport event has been mostly held in the Queenstown-Lakes district since 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the country's most successful ever winter olympians, including snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott and skier Nico Porteous, were regular competitiors.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Thursday, event leaders said delivering its pathway competitons against "escalating event costs had become untenable".</p>
        
            <p>Other factors cited were challenging New Zealand sponsorship and media markets alongside organisers struggling to meet international federation-sanctioned fees and prize money expectations due to the strength of "strong European currencies".</p>
        
            <p>Between 2009 and 2017 the event was held every two years, with it shifting to an annual fixture in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>The late New Zealand philanthropist Sir Eion Edgar led the Winter Games NZ Trust after it was established in 2008, during the time when he was president of the New Zealand Olympic Committee.</p>

            <p>Several venues were utilised during its tenure, including Cardrona Alpine Resort, Coronet Peak, Dunedin Ice Stadium, Maniototo International Curling Rink, Mount Hutt, Snow Farm, the Remarkables, Treble Cone and Queenstown Ice Arena.</p>
        
            <p>Winter Games New Zealand chairperson Sam Hazledine said it was "with a heavy heart" to share the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are immensely proud of what has been achieved over the last 15 years and we are grateful for each and every person who has contributed to the legacy that Winter Games NZ will leave behind," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However Hazledine did not rule out bringing back a "non-pathway" format of the event in future.</p>
        
            <p>"While the Trust will no longer deliver snow sports pathway events, we are still evaluating options for maximising the benefit from the Sir Eion Edgar Legacy Fund."</p>
        
            <p>Winter Games chief executive Marty Toomey said it marked the "end of an era".</p>
        
            <p>"The legacy of Winter Games NZ will live on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many New Zealand athletes have achieved notable firsts at Winter Games NZ over the years through securing their first FIS or FWT points, a first FIS World Cup start, a FIS Australia New Zealand Cup bib, a FIS Junior World Championship title, a FIS World Cup medal or earning points towards the next Olympic or Paralympic Winter Games or Freeride World Tour."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Freeskier Jossi Wells also reflected on the end of the event.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad to see the end of Winter Games NZ as I knew it, as it was a great event for kiwi athletes to show off their skills in front of a raucous kiwi crowd, their friends and family."</p>
