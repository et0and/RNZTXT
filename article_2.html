            <p>Police say the brakes may have failed on a truck that hurtled across the Dunedin's Octagon and crashed.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the central city where the Pioneer Energy truck crashed into a covered pedestrian path at 7.30am on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It narrowly missed the historic Robbie Burns statue, and spilled wood chips across the road.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Anthony Bond said the 32-year-old man was driving the truck down Stuart Street towards the Octagon when his brakes allegedly failed, causing him to lose control.</p>
        
            <p>"The truck was seen flying across the grassed area," he said.</p>
