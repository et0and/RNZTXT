        <h2>The Kiwis on Forbes' billionaire list</h2>
        <p>
We've all heard of Peter Jackson and Graeme Hart, but a few lesser known names have appeared on the global rich list.

            <p>New Zealanders have made a token appearance on this year's just-released Forbes Billionaires list.</p>
        
            <p>Graeme Hart, as usual, stands out by far as the richest New Zealander, with an estimated US$10.6 billion (NZ$17.7b) from his large packaging interests.</p>
        
            <p>The publicity-shy Hart is ranked 1152 on the list, and has long held the title of New Zealand's richest man, along with a back story of his rise from tow truck driver to billionaire through a series of debt funded corporate deals.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Hart took delivery of a 102-metre super yacht, Ulysses, fitted out with a hangar, helipad and glass stairways, among much else.</p>

            <p>Trailing nearly a thousand places below him with US$2.9b is Singapore based Richard Chandler, with interests in Indian business finance, Vietnamese healthcare, and an Israeli electric plane maker.</p>
        
            <p>The highest profile Kiwi billionaire is film maker Sir Peter Jackson, ranked 2124, with an estimated $1.5b, started with box office takings from the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies, and topped up with the $1.6b sale of Weta Digital to US interests in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>A new entrant to the rich list is Australian-based Charles Gibbon, ranked 2601, with $1.1b.</p>
        
            <p>Educated in the South Island, Gibbon worked in the UK and Australia in investment banking, but his $1.1b worth came from an investment in Australian software firm, Wise Tech, which he chaired and has remained a director.</p>
