            <p>An orange heavy rain warning has been issued for Northland, north of Whangārei, with as much as 250 millimetres of rain possible in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>A slow-moving trough over Northland was expected to bring periods of heavy rain, possibly with downpours and thunderstorms, a MetService spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 150mm of rainfall is forecast in 24 hours until 10am on Thursday, but it could peak at 250m in some places.</p>

            <p>The worst of the rain is expected on the hills east and north of the Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>People in those areas are urged to clear their drains and gutters, be wary of rapidly rising streams, avoid low-lying areas and drive cautiously.</p>
        
            <p>The rainfall rate is likely to peak around 15 to 25mm/h - anything over 6mm/h is classed as heavy rain - but rates as high as 40 to 50 mm/h are possible during localised downpours.</p>
        
            <p>Rainfall of that intensity could cause surface or flash flooding, especially near streams or in narrow valleys, and could lead to slips.</p>
        
            <p>Driving conditions could be hazardous due to surface flooding and poor visibility.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch had also been issued for the same area.</p>
