            <p>A pod of false killer whales has been refloated after stranding at a beach near Māhia on the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A whale conservation group said it understood that all 40 whales had refloated during the high tide at 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah manager Daren Grover said the concern going into the evening was that the whales would not swim out to sea and strand themselves again as the tide went out.</p>
        
            <p>He said a team of people at the beach would create a "human chain" in the shallows, splashing and making noise to stop the whales from running aground.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to create disturbance. Obviously we don't want to distress the whales, but without understanding the underlying reasons why the whales came to shore in the first place, while we know [a human chain] can work and it has worked in the past, we've still got concerns these whales may eventually strand [again]."</p>

            <p>Grover said ideally people would be in the water, following the tide as it receded, to maintain that human barrier.</p>
        
            <p>"We always put human health and safety as one of our concerns and considerations at a stranding. We never want anyone to become exhausted and to become a pull on resources for us to look after them."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this afternoon, a video was posted on a Facebook community page showing the whales thrashing in the shallows of a rocky beach and waving their tales, surrounded by white water.</p>
        
            <p>Whale conservation group Project Jonah and the Department of Conservation mobilised a team to attempt to save the animals.</p>
        
            <p>Grover said the beach was isolated and this was a major stranding for an area where there were not many people nearby to help.</p>
        
            <p>But Grover said any locals wanting to help should not get in the water with the stranded whales because they could be unpredictable and dangerous.</p>
