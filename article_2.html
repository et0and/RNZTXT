        <h2>Watch: Truck tips on its end in Upper Hutt</h2>
        <p>
A truck has ended up in an unusual position while trying to lift a concrete slab.
</p>
        
            <p>A truck has tipped up on its end outside the New Zealand Campus of Innovation and Sport in Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>A witness said it was trying to lift a slab of concrete at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"The back hoist was lifting up a big slab of concrete and it was too much weight for it, and it flipped it up, straight in the air, and that was it."</p>
