            <p>Two men have been arrested in relation to the death of a man in Grey Lynn Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they arrested a 19-year-old in South Auckland Saturday afternoon, and charged him with murder and three counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>He will appear in Auckland District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A fight broke out between two groups on Tuarangi Road on Thursday night during an ongoing dispute in the Auckland neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>Shots were fired and 18-year-old Maxwel-Dee Repia was killed. Three people were injured, two seriously.</p>
        
            <p>A second man, 18, has also been arrested in West Auckland and will face a charge of being an accessory after the fact to murder and three counts of being an accessory after the fact to wounding.</p>

            <p>Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said police cannot rule out further charges.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation is very much ongoing, and is still in the early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"There is still much to do as we piece together a full account of what occurred on Thursday and the events leading up to this tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>"The community has responded very positively and we are grateful for their support."</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said police will continue to work in the community, going go door to door seeking witnesses and CCTV.</p>
        
            <p>"Please, if you have information, contact us, rather than waiting for us to find you.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there are others involved in the offending on Thursday. The right for them to do is contact police and talk with us.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we know having made arrests and laying a murder charge will be a relief for Mr Repia's family and the wider community.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to thank residents for their ongoing patience, co-operation and assistance."</p>
