            <p>Flares and shelling have hit border towns within Lebanon, strikes hit suburbs in Lebanon's capital Beirut, and one hit a building in the large Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh, near the Lebanese city of Sidon, sources have told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>In the Syrian capital of Damascus a well-known Syrian television anchor was among three people killed by Israeli strikes, the country's state news agency said.</p>
        
            <p>The US has been told "limited" raids on Hezbollah over the border have begun, in what may be the beginning of a widely expected ground invasion.</p>
        
            <p>The Israel military said in a statement that its targets were in villages close to the border that posed "an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel." It said the air force and artillery were supporting ground forces with "precise strikes."</p>
        
            <p>It comes days after Israel killed the head of the Lebanese armed group, Hassan Nasrallah.</p>
        
            <p>The ground invasion represents an escalating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed militants, which now threatens to suck in the US and Iran.</p>
