            <p>Police have arrested a man and seized a car after a 22-year-old was found dead in a car outside an Auckland vape store.</p>
        
            <p>But they say they are still looking for the main suspect in the case.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called to Penrose Road in Mount Wellington about 10.40pm on Saturday after reports of gun fire.</p>
        
            <p>They found a man - who they have named as Texas Jack Doctor - dead in a car.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Chris Allan said police had searched a Panmure address on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A 26-year-old man was arrested and charged with accessory after the fact to murder.</p>
        
            <p>Police were still looking for the main offender in the homicide case, and would maintain a high presence in east Auckland as enquiries continued, Allan said.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear in Auckland District Court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A "vehicle of interest" was found during the search and was seized as part of the investigation.</p>
