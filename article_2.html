            <p>Kiwi tennis player Lulu Sun has turned on a brilliant display to win her fourth round match against Britain's Emma Raducanu.</p>
        
            <p>Sun won 6-2 5-7 6-2 in two hours 45 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Sun took the first set 6-2 easily enough, but Raducanu fought back strongly to win the second 7-5.</p>
        
            <p>Early in the third set Raducanu slipped on the grass and had a brief time out.</p>
        
            <p>Sun broke the Briton twice in the third set and looked in control throughout.</p>
        
            <p>She is guaranteed $782,000 for reaching the last eight.</p>

            <p>In her post-match interview Sun was in tears before composing herself with the help of a generous ovation from the British fans, the BBC is reporting.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really have the words right now..."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi qualifier went on to say her superb grass-court game has been aided by watching Roger Federer coming to the net and watched YouTube videos of Steffi Graf versus Martina Navratilova from back in the day.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just so amazing to watch them. Of course I couldn't watch them live but I was taking it it all in from the pros, and trying to do that for my game," Sun said.</p>
        
            <p>Her sister and her mum were also in tears in the player box at Wimbledon.</p>
        
            <p>Former world No 1 Ash Barty who is now a BBC commentator said Sun's performance showed her intent, bravery and courage.</p>
        
            <p>Sun will play Donna Vekic from Croatia in the quarter-finals.</p>

            <p>The president of her home club in Te Anau Greg Sheppard told Morning Report it was a nerve-wracking watch but "she's just on absolute fire".</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of that first set, I thought it started to look like the matches just kept getting easier and easier for her as she got through the draw and that's not how it's supposed to happen."</p>
        
            <p>At just 23, Sheppard said Sun was "just warming up" and he always knew she would be a bit of a "super star".</p>
        
            <p>He said she was an aggressive player with an incredible amount of power, and knew how to hit a ball.</p>
        
            <p>"I want her to bring that Wimbledon trophy and an Olympic gold medal to show us, that would be quite cool."</p>
        
            <p>Sun is the first New Zealand woman to make the fourth round since Dame Ruia Morrison in 1959.</p>
        
            <p>Sun had announced her arrival at the UK's Grand Slam tournament by ousting world number eight Qinwen Zheng in the first round before beating fellow qualifier Yuliia Starodubtseva of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>She has caused a major surprise with her progress at Wimbledon, beating China's Zhu Lin early on Saturday in their third round match.</p>
        
            <p>Sun has also been named in the Olympic team for Paris later this month. She will play doubles with Grand Slam winner Erin Routliffe.</p>
