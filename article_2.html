            <p>RNZ Music 101 host Charlotte Ryan has a soft spot for Christmas songs of all genres. She shares her favourites.</p>
        
            <p>I love Christmas songs, but ONLY when they are played in December. Any earlier (or past 26 December) is sacrilege in my books.</p>
        
            <p>I think these songs can really help us all on Christmas Day. Put a playlist on (ideally a compilation or playlist of sorts) and you'll find that everyone will relax, have something to talk about, and if you're lucky, you may get some family members singing along. It will help crack the ice.</p>
        
            <p>My favourite festive songs bring me warmth, make me smile and bring strong memories of Christmas trees, Christmas Eve cooking and wrapping presents, and of driving to Christmas lunch in the car with platters of food on our laps.</p>
        
            <p>I also completely understand the horror that Christmas songs can be for some people. For the rest of you, here are 10 of my favourites (rest assured, there is no WHAM).</p>
        
            <p>Local musician Reb Fountain has just released a poignant version of 'Happy Xmas (War is Over)' by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Fountain recorded this classic Christmas song as a reminder and encouragement for us to foster compassion and love for one another.</p>

            <p>German Euro-Caribbean group Boney M only played together for 10 years but made a huge impact. Their band photos, costumes, dancing and energy was huge and bringing that same energy to Christmas Day is a must.</p>
        
            <p>This tune - a mash-up of 'Mary's Boy Child' and 'Oh My Lord' - is the stand-out hit from the band's 1981 Christmas album.</p>
        
            <p>A fun fact to share with your whānau on Christmas Day: the man who wrote all of Boney M's music and controlled everything behind the scenes was German producer Frank Farian, who was also the mastermind behind Milli Vanilli.</p>
        
            <p>They might also like to know that earlier this week a fellow RNZ radio host told me Boney M was one of their favourite bands. Top prize to anyone who guessed that it was Sunday Morning host Jim Mora.</p>
        
            <p>Local artist Erny Belle, who has just released her second album Not Your Cupid (Flying Nun) is one of my favourites. Last year she surprised us with a Christmas song full of relatable and tongue-in-cheek lyrics like "It's been a hell of a year" and "Put your hands up in the air for Jesus". This is also a fantastic song to sing along with and to practice saying Meri Kirihimete (Merry Christmas) in te reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>This song was criticised by some in the music industry for being "too suggestive" when it was first released in 1953. Eartha Kitt was always known for being a spicy musician; believe it or not, some of her songs were banned from airplay on RNZ for being too risky back in the day.</p>
        
            <p>I like this one for its cheekiness. Kylie Minogue, Madonna and all sorts of people have covered this song, but Eartha's version is the best by far.</p>
        
            <p>Neil Finn has recorded a new Christmas song on comedian Neil Hamburger's concept album Seasonal Depression Suite.</p>
        
            <p>The concept of this album (which will make you smile) is based on a "look through the lens of various guests stuck in an average chain-hotel during the holiday season, wallowing in self-pity and paranoia, re-living personal catastrophes both real and imagined, or simply trying to use the hotel vending machine."</p>
        
            <p>Finn sings his lyrics so well. Could this be from experience of spending Christmas in a depressing hotel? This isn't his first festive tune - SPLIT ENZ released a special Christmas B-side medley for their fan club in 1983.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland-based band The Beths are well-known for their heartfelt alternative pop songs, so their cover of this Christmas classic is a dream come true. This is the best sing-along song too, because everyone knows the lyrics.</p>
        
            <p>Please note: this music video involving a fluffy dog may bring a tear to the eye.</p>
        
            <p>This one has always been a Christmas classic in our house and it often gets multiple plays, especially once the evening rolls around and people are keen to sing along. Originally released in 1988, radio stations around the world stopped playing it a few years ago due to its dated lyrics.</p>
        
            <p>Hearing the song this Christmas will hit differently after the recent death of frontman Shane MacGowan. Glen Hansard and Lisa O'Neill performed it at his funeral and this emotional, joyful version is perfect to play this year.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi pop artist Theia released her own traditional Māori Christmas hymn with the hope of spreading love and peace at Christmas. It's one of only a few Christmas waiata composed in Māori (most are translated from English). The song's lyrics are traditional, and unlike most Christmas songs the mood is solemn and contemplative.</p>
        
            <p>There are no Christmas bells, instead 'Te Kaiwhakaora O Te Ao' is a waiata to transcend generations and weave together the past and present with the hope it is sung and performed in marae, churches and schools for many years to come.</p>
        
            <p>Theia recorded a live version at RNZ last year and brought in singers from Auckland's Maungawhau School.</p>
        
            <p>I have a soft spot for the kind of old-school Christmas songs that often appear in Christmas movies and compilations. Home Alone is a great example, with songs like 'Rockin around the Christmas Tree', 'Carol of the Bells' and Chuck Berry's 'Run Rudolph Run'.</p>
        
            <p>The Drifters 1954 recording of 'White Christmas' is a stand out for me - the harmonies - and the 'doop doop, doop do do's'.</p>
        
            <p>I'm still obsessed with Dolly Parton after I had the (pinch me) experience of interviewing her last month about her new rock album.</p>
        
            <p>Parton has released multiple Christmas movies and albums. This year I'll be playing 'A Holly Dolly Christmas' (2020) - her 47th studio album, and her third Christmas album. With guests like Michael Buble, Jimmy Fallon and Willy Nelson singing duets with her, it's an album that will bring joy to all, especially Dolly fans.</p>
