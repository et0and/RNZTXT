            <p>Police investigating concerns around burials at Waikumete Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Glen Eden have made an arrest.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's Criminal Investigation Branch has been investigating the matter since the beginning of August.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin, of Auckland City CIB, said a 48-year-old woman was taken into custody on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The woman was arrested in Favona and has since been charged with misconduct in respect of human remains and nine counts of obtaining by deception."</p>
        
            <p>The woman is due to appear in the Auckland District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Baldwin said the arrest was a significant development in the investigation, which would continue.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot rule out further charges and hope this arrest brings some reassurance to those affected by this woman's offending."</p>
