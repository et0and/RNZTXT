            <p>A man whose young son allegedly shot and killed a hunter has been charged with manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>The 39-year-old man appeared in Gisborne District Court on Monday where the new charge of manslaughter was added to existing charges of unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of cannabis.</p>
        
            <p>He did not enter a plea and was remanded without plea to appear in the High Court at Gisborne later this month.</p>
        
            <p>The man was with his son, aged under 13, inland of Tolaga Bay on 26 August, when the boy allegedly fired a shot that hit John Atkins, 44, who had been hunting with friends.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred about 10.40pm on Tauwhareparae Road, where the man and his son had been spotlighting with a .22 calibre rifle.</p>
        
            <p>Atkins was flown to hospital in a critical condition, but died several hours later.</p>
        
            <p>Atkins, a father-of-three, was born and raised in Tolaga Bay where he was known as a passionate hunter.</p>
