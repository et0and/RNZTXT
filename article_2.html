            <p>Wet weather is forecast for several parts of the country on New Year's Eve, while one community has cancelled some of its planned celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain is on the cards for the west of the South Island, and an orange rain warning is in place for parts of the Westland ranges from midnight tonight.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said showers could move over the Canterbury area too.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll also find a band of rain sweeping across the North Island as we head into the afternoon and into the evening as well, so it's well worth keeping an eye on the forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the best spots looks like Nelson so we'll see that clearing away in the afternoon, and a good place to be to welcome in 2024."</p>
        
            <p>Strong wind warnings have been issued for parts of Marlborough and Canterbury from early tomorrow morning.</p>
        
            <p>The Marlborough Sounds, Wellington and parts of Wairarapa are under a wind warning from 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Ô∏è More thunderstorms on the cards to see 2023 out. Thunder, lightning, heavy rain and hail all possible for parts of New Zealand during Sunday. Find the full forecast here https://t.co/grZ6Hp7uMi pic.twitter.com/WaWbgyDicC</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council said Saturday it has made the tough call to cancel its New Year's Eve community celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>It said a heavy band of rain with possible thunderstorms and lightning is forecast to sweep through between 6 to 9.30pm, when events are due to take place at five locations.</p>
        
            <p>The council said while it is disappointed to have to cancel, it plans to go ahead with firework displays between 9.30pm and midnight.</p>
        
            <p>An update will be made Sunday if that plan changes due to weather conditions.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the Love Your Ways Music Festival in Auckland was cancelled, with organisers saying they were "devastated" on social media, but "the event has been deemed unsafe to proceed."</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel campers appear to be toughing it out for New Year's Eve despite heavy downpours last night and more rain forecast tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Campers in Cooks Beach have shared video footage showing water pooling around tents and caravan awnings around 8pm Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Flaxmill Campground relief manager Chris Goldsbury said her campground is on higher ground but it was still very wet underfoot this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a very heavy downpour probably about 7.30, 8 o'clock? And noticed we had 40mm measured in the rain gauge this morning ... but no, everybody was happy, we didn't have any problems."</p>
        
            <p>In Whitianga, Harbourside Holiday Park manager Jane Deadman said they are booked out for New Year's Eve and no one has cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Deadman said a couple of groups left early afternoon Friday thinking it was going to be worse than it was, but everyone else stayed on and enjoyed themselves.</p>
