        <h2>Freeze chicken, remove skin: Expert's top tips for avoiding deadly campylobacter</h2>
        <p>
Chicken is riskier than other meats - but why? And how well does it really need to be cooked? Here are the answers. Audio

Removing the skin from raw chicken can help reduce your risk of campylobacteriosis.

            <p>Freezing raw chicken and removing its skin are two simple ways to avoid contracting a nasty stomach bug, an expert says.</p>
        
            <p>Massey University professor of food safety and microbiology Steve Flint told Nights that chicken was riskier than other meats because of campylobacter.</p>
        
            <p>The bacteria lives in a chicken's gastrointestinal tract and can contaminate the meat when the animal is slaughtered and dressed.</p>
        
            <p>Campylobacter is the most commonly reported cause of foodborne illness in New Zealand and can be deadly.</p>
        
            <p>About four in every five cases are caused by poultry.</p>
        
            <p>Freezing chicken could significantly reduce any campylobacter bacteria present in the meat, Flint said.</p>
        
            <p>Removing the skin also removed some of the risk.</p>
        
            <p>"The skin is something that's readily contaminated - the campylobacter actually lock on to the skin surface very readily."</p>
        
            <p>Another way to reduce the risk of food poisoning was to buy a whole chicken in a bag, to avoid bacteria transferring to hands, utensils and kitchen surfaces, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very hard for a lot of people to avoid cross-contamination with other food.</p>
        
            <p>"Simple packaging - a sealed pack where you can just put the package with the chicken in the oven - has been great in terms of food safety."</p>
        
            <p>Chicken should always be cooked until it was no longer pink, Flint said.</p>
        
            <p>"The safest thing to assume is that if there is pink meat there, there is a risk."</p>
        
            <p>Cooked meat should be refrigerated as soon as practical and always within a couple of hours, and should only be stored in the fridge for a maximum of three days.</p>
