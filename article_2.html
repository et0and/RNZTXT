        <h2>Stricter driver licence rules would save young lives - AA</h2>
        <p>
Doubling the learner licence period to a year and requiring supervised driving hours would cut the risk of crashes, the AA says.

            <p>Changes are desperately needed, the Automobile Association says.</p>
        
            <p>New research has revealed New Zealand has far more relaxed licence requirements than other countries, and tightening them could save lives.</p>
        
            <p>report, funded by the AA Research Foundation and carried out by Adelaide University's Centre for Automotive Safety Research, detailed a number of improvements that would reduce the risk of crashes, like doubling the learner licence period from six months to a year, and requiring supervised driving hours.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly a third of all road deaths in New Zealand are people aged between 18 and 24 years old, and New Zealanders in that age group are nearly three times more likely to die on the roads than young Australians, which was "horrific", said AA road safety spokesperson Dylan Thomsen.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there's any reason at all that our young people should have such a higher rate of road deaths than Australia," Thomsen said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can just make some changes that lower our crash rate to Australia's, that would be dozens of families every year in New Zealand that don't have to say farewell to a loved one in their twenties."</p>
        
            <p>The government's road safety plan was due out in the next few months, and Thomsen wanted driver licence changes to be part of that.</p>
        
            <p>The way young people are being prepared to drive solo desperately needed to be improved, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love to see a really serious look taken, over the next few years in New Zealand, at how we do driver licensing."</p>
        
            <p>The study's lead author, Dr Lisa Wundersitz, was surprised to learn novice drivers in New Zealand were so young and had so little experience.</p>
        
            <p>Extending the learner licence period and introducing compulsory supervised driving hours would be particularly effective in keeping them safe, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's good evidence behind that, showing crash reductions in a number of jurisdictions internationally," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're definitely two stand outs New Zealand should consider."</p>
        
            <p>The recommended changes included:</p>
