            <p>Police believe Tauranga man Harley Shrimpton was a victim of foul play after he went missing mid-November. A 21-year-old man has been charged with kidnapping and was due in court today.</p>
        
            <p>Shrimpton was reported missing by family on 17 November.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Lindsay Pilbrow said the 28-year-old was last seen getting into a blue Toyota Prius in the McDonald's carpark in Mount Maunganui on the afternoon of 3 November.</p>
        
            <p>"This car was unlawfully taken the day before, 2 November, from the Bellevue area in Tauranga and has since been recovered by police.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to these circumstances, and a lack of other sightings, police believe Mr Shrimpton may have been the victim of foul play."</p>
        
            <p>Police are seeking sightings of the blue Prius from 2 November until 5 November.</p>

            <p>He said several people would know what happened, including Shrimpton's current location.</p>
