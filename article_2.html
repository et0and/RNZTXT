            <p>The mayor of Ruapehu District says incidents along the detour around the closed Desert Road could "paralyse" transport networks through the central North Island.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 between Waiouru and Turangi is now closed for two months as up to 16 kilometres of the road is rebuilt and the deck of the Mangatoetoenui Bridge replaced.</p>
        
            <p>The detour from north to south is via SH41, SH47, SH4, SH49 and then back to SH1 in Waiouru, and it adds 30 to 40 minutes to the journey.</p>

            <p>Mayor Weston Kirton said the narrow lanes and limited passing opportunities along the route could pose risks if drivers became frustrated.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have a huge volume of traffic going through a network of roading that is not up to the same specifications as State Highway 1 then you're going to have a few incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm conscious of the fact that if you have a major accident there is no alternative route. If we're now getting down to only State Highway 4 as an alternative then what other options have you got if there is an incident?</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to have the infrastructure up and running as well. You've got to have the emergency services, breakdowns [assistance] and the policing... making sure the road management's up to spec," Kirton said.</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said he hoped motorists would take care along the route and stop to enjoy some of the local attractions in the area.</p>

            <p>"Take it easy on the roads, stop, have a rest, have a coffee break. Take time out and enjoy the landscape that is very picturesque this time of the year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said Turoa skifield was lining up summer activities to capitalise on the influx and he was sure that other businesses in the area would follow suit.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as Ohakune, National Park [and] Taumarunui is concerned - the benefits to the community - it's huge. We're hoping that people will not only fill up with gas or electricity and stop for a pie or a chocolate eclair [but] also see some of the benefits of stopping over and enjoying some of the activities we have got going," Kirton said.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said the speed limit near and through Ohakune would be reduced to 50km/h while the detour was in place and there would be additional billboards, signage and police patrols along the route.</p>
