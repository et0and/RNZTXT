            <p>Nine people, including two children, were injured in an incident involving a "corrosive substance" in Clapham, London's Metropolitan police said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Three victims - a woman and her two young children - have been taken to hospital for treatment," the police said in a statement, adding that three other people - all adults - were taken to hospital for injuries sustained.</p>
        
            <p>Three police officers were also taken to hospital with minor injuries, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>There have been no arrests at this stage, the police said.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC reported three police officers, who responded to the incident, sustained what were believed to be minor injuries. The Met said police helicopters were being used in the search for the assailant.</p>
        
            <p>London Assembly Member Marina Ahmad said on X (formerly Twitter) that there had been a traffic collision "with a man assaulting occupants in a car".</p>
