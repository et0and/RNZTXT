            <p>Western Bay of Plenty District Council's chief executive John Holyoake has quit.</p>
        
            <p>No reason for Holyoake's resignation was given in a five-sentence statement released by mayor James Denyer on Wednesday, following a Local Democracy Reporting request.</p>
        
            <p>Denyer said he had valued Holyoake's insight and advice over the last four years, and wished him well in his "future endeavours".</p>
        
            <p>"He has guided our council during a time of significant change, and I thank him for what he has achieved."</p>
        
            <p>The council intended to appoint an interim chief executive "in the near term" and ensure a smooth transition, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>It did not say when Holyoake would leave the role.</p>
        
            <p>The process would come as the council prepared for the local government elections in October.</p>
        
            <p>Holyoake joined the council in July 2021 replacing Miriam Taris, who had held the chief executive role from 2014.</p>
        
            <p>He took on the council's top job after six years as chief executive at Tamaki Regeneration Company - the largest urban regeneration project in New Zealand.</p>

            <p>At his welcome pōwhiri, he acknowledged the need to work with local iwi and Māori representatives.</p>
        
            <p>"I truly believe that partnership with Māori is the true way forward," he told the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>In May 2022, Holyoake and his team launched the Generation Change/He panoni ā reanga campaign aimed at increasing representation around the council table ahead of the October council elections.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to look like, sound like, be like, the people that we're representing - the people we're making decisions for," he told Local Democracy Reporting.</p>
        
            <p>While the 2022 elections resulted in less diversity among council members, Holyoake said the campaign was still a win and was "much bigger than elections".</p>
        
            <p>"We [the council] connected with a diverse range of people from our communities, with different lived experiences, and that has been fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, councillors were faced with the decision of whether to establish a Māori ward for the 2025 election.</p>
        
            <p>The ward was adopted after a nine-to-12 vote, which was celebrated by the council and iwi.</p>

            <p>Te Kāhui Mana o Tauranga Moana forum chair Reon Tuanau told LDR the ward had been a long time coming.</p>
        
            <p>The council had to reaffirm this decision after a change in government policy in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Tuanau said the vote to keep the ward showed the work Māori had been doing with the council had value.</p>
        
            <p>"The relationship is alive and well."</p>
        
            <p>Originally from Rotorua, Holyoake has family ties to Te Puke and Welcome Bay, and being closer to his family was a key reason behind him taking on the leadership role, he previously told SunLive.</p>
