            <p>Wellington Water has confirmed an employee is being investigated after they posted a video online claiming to have spent the work day "slacking off".</p>
        
            <p>This comes as the beleaguered agency is desperately urging residents to conserve water this summer, while up to 45-percent of the region's water is leaking from ageing pipes.</p>
        
            <p>The "day-in-the-life" style video was posted to video sharing website Vimeo and shows the woman going into work at the Wellington Water building in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking in Mandarin, the woman said she had been working at home for two days "half lying down", which she explained was "actually doing nothing".</p>

            <p>On her third day back after the new year, her partner made her go to the office because he was worried she would be fired, she said.</p>
        
            <p>But the woman said she did not feel sorry for doing nothing at work so she took an hour coffee break and left early to open her mail at home.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it was undertaking an internal staff investigation with the employee as part of the organisation's code of conduct principles.</p>
        
            <p>The region's water provider says the video is not representative of Wellington Water staff who are a dedicated team.</p>
