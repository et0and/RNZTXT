            <p>TVNZ will start talks from Friday with staff who will lose their jobs in the state broadcaster's bid to stay "sustainable".</p>
        
            <p>It is proposed that up to 68 jobs will be cut which equates to 9 percent of its staff.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ chief executive Jodi O'Donnell told staff on Thursday that "tough economic conditions and structural challenges within the media sector" have hit the company's revenue.</p>
        
            <p>She said "difficult choices need to be made" to ensure the broadcaster remained "sustainable".</p>
        
            <p>Changes like those proposed today were incredibly hard, but TVNZ needed to ensure it was in a stronger position to transform the business to meet the needs of viewers in a digital world.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands a hui for all TVNZ news and current affairs staff will be held at 1pm on Friday. This follows separate morning meetings for Re: News, Fair Go, and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A TVNZ staffer told RNZ it was not yet clear what the meetings meant for those programmes - whether they were to be fully cut or face significant redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ also understands 1News Tonight might also be affected.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday presenter Miriama Kamo said the news of jobs possibly being axed was awful.</p>
        
            <p>"It's devastating not just for our business, it's devastating for what it means for our wider society."</p>
        
            <p>She said with the likely demise of Newshub it has "dire implications for our democracy".</p>
        
            <p>When cuts were being made in news programmes at the state broadcaster that indicated how dire things had become.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very very concerned about what the landscape looks like going forward."</p>

            <p>Last week, TVNZ flagged further cost cutting as it posted a first half-year loss linked to reduced revenue and asset write offs.</p>
        
            <p>The state owned broadcaster's interim financial results showed total revenue had fallen 13.5 percent from last year to $155.9 million.</p>
        
            <p>Its net loss for the six months ended December was $16.8m compared to a profit of $4.8m the year before.</p>
        
            <p>O'Donnell said the broadcaster's management had tried to cut operating costs over the last year but there was now no option than to look at job losses.</p>
        
            <p>"There are no easy answers, and media organisations locally and globally are grappling with the same issues. Our priority is to support our people through the change process - we'll take the next few weeks to collect, consider and respond to feedback from TVNZers before making any final decisions."</p>
        
            <p>A confirmed structure is expected to be finalised by early April.</p>

            <p>The layoffs at TVNZ have come one week after the shock announcement by Warner Bros Discovery that it intended closing its Newshub operation by the end of June.</p>
        
            <p>It means up to 300 people will lose their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Broadcasting Minister Melissa Lee told Checkpoint on Wednesday she had spoken to TVNZ bosses last week but it was not up to her to reveal details of the conversation.</p>
        
            <p>She declined to comment on Newshub's offer to TVNZ to team up in some ways to cut costs, nor suggestions TVNZ could cut its 6pm news to half-an-hour or cancel current affairs programming.</p>
