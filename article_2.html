            <p>Hundreds of people are queuing at Wellington Airport to rebook their flights after mass cancellations.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand has confirmed that more than 50 flights in and out of the city have been cancelled due to low-lying cloud.</p>
        
            <p>Drizzle and foggy conditions have reduced visibility to 2km.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the cloud at the airport was expected to remain for the next few hours but could improve slightly later on Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Wellington Airport said larger jets had been unable to land for the past few hours, causing a slowdown in aircraft activity.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third day in a row that passengers have faced disruption at Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand chief integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said customers were being rebooked on the next available flights.</p>
