            <p>A Wairoa resident at an evacuation centre says she and her partner would have kayaked out of their property if emergency services had not been able to pick them up.</p>
        
            <p>Marcella Reedy and her partner evacuated in knee-deep water after not at first realising people were evacuating.</p>
        
            <p>"On Wednesday morning I heard knocks at my door and didn't think anything of it but I never got an emergency text, phone must have been playing up, and then next minute well, looked out the window and then saw that the flood was coming."</p>
        
            <p>Reedy said they were now waiting for the all-clear to return home and were very anxious about what state they would find their house in.</p>
