            <p>A popular koala sanctuary in Queensland, Australia is no longer allowing visitors to cuddle its koalas.</p>
        
            <p>The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane announced that it had ended its koala-holding experience from 1 July after "increasingly strong visitor feedback".</p>
        
            <p>The sanctuary will replace it with a new experience, which will focus on meaningful connections and extended time in the presence of the iconic Australian animal.</p>
        
            <p>General manager Lyndon Discombe said there was a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal.</p>
        
            <p>They wanted to see what the animals do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space.</p>
        
            <p>"We have absolutely seen an increase in demand for educational programs and guided experiences, focussing on the ability to witness the natural behaviours of koalas," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report that visitors wanted to have more time with its koalas, have a more immersive experience and learn more about them and their keepers.</p>
        
            <p>"This is just purely a business decision from our sanctuary to change the offering that we provide," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In other Australian states, including New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, it is illegal to hold a koala.</p>
        
            <p>Discombe said people will still be able to hold them at other sanctuaries in Queensland.</p>
