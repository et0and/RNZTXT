        <h2>Luxon: 'We expect the churches to face up to their responsibility'</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister says the churches behind the faith-based care institutions need to be "fully responsible and accountable", and destruction of records "doesn't sound right".

            <p>The prime minister says the churches behind the faith-based care institutions need to be "fully responsible and accountable", and destruction of records "doesn't sound right".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was answering questions after hitting the street with the newly expanded Beat Patrol team in Auckland CBD.</p>
        
            <p>The standup also follows the release of the Royal Commission's report into abuse in care this week, a massive 16-volume report still being digested by the survivors and the public.</p>
        
            <p>That included evidence the president of the Law Society advised the head of Presbyterian Support Otago to destroy records of children in its care to protect the organisation's reputation.</p>
        
            <p>Frazer Barton told Morning Report he had advised Gillian Bremner to "destroy them at an appropriate time - that's not 'go ahead and destroy them now'".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he had not been briefed on that but the government wanted to ensure records were available - including being available to survivors.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't seen what he's specifically briefed or asked," Luxon said, but "it doesn't sound good, it doesn't sound right."</p>
        
            <p>He said the churches should front up and be held accountable.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect the churches to face up to their responsibility," Luxon said. "We're asking for them to be fully responsible and accountable."</p>
        
            <p>He is joined by Police Minister Mark Mitchell, and Associate Police Minister Casey Costello, answering reporters' questions at a supermarket after touring around lower Queen Street.</p>
        
            <p>Police added another 21 officers to their CBD beat teams this month, bringing the team to 51.</p>
        
            <p>It is part of a drive to expand the number of police visible on city streets, with the Auckland team expected to increase to 63, another 17 officers joining the Wellington team, and 18 more in Christchurch.</p>

            <p>It also follows revelations on Thursday the government had quietly lowered child poverty targets, and an announcement of its plans to legislate to override a Court of Appeal finding to set a higher bar for MƒÅori seeking recognition of Customary Marine Title.</p>
