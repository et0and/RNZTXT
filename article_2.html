            <p>The sister of Hawkes Bay teenager Ariki Rigby shouted "justice for Ariki" as the man charged with her murder made his first appearance in court.</p>
        
            <p>The accused man stood silently in the dock as Anahera Rigby called out.</p>
        
            <p>Rigby's body was found in a burned out car in a Havelock North reserve in September 2022, during an unplanned holiday to see her father and stepmother.</p>
        
            <p>Police failed to realise there was a dead body in the car when they first checked on it.</p>
        
            <p>Officers visited the car after a caller told police on 3 September 2022 they thought they had seen the body of an animal on the floor in the back of the vehicle, but the body was not discovered until 5 September.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man, living in Auckland, was arrested and charged with her murder on Tuesday, police announced.</p>
        
            <p>He was also charged with intentionally damaging a car with fire.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the arrested man, who had been living in Hawkes Bay at the time of the 18-year-old's death, was arrested in Favona, South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The man has interim name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in Manukau District Court in front of Judge Quentin Hix on Wednesday and was remanded in prison, to next appear in the High Court in Napier on 11 October. Name suppression was granted until then.</p>
        
            <p>Rigby's loved ones were in the courtroom for his appearance, with one woman sobbing as the accused was in the dock.</p>
        
            <p>The man did not make eye contact with anyone in the public gallery, and stood quietly wearing a red t shirt and red socks with jandals.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of Rigby's funeral, a family spokesperson said she was a beautiful, passionate person, who lived life at "full throttle".</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the family released a fresh plea for information, saying in a statement that they were still hurting.</p>
        
            <p>"She had her whole life ahead of her and was taken from us far too soon.</p>
        
            <p>"Ariki would have turned 21 later this month and instead of celebrating with her, we are left holding onto the memory of our beautiful girl who we wish dearly was still with us today."</p>
