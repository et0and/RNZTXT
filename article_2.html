            <p>Ashburton's recycling habits are improving, but one rogue household has been labelled the "extreme worst end of the scale" for breaking the rules.</p>
        
            <p>The household was accused of putting out multiple yellow and red bins to dump 480 kilograms of rubbish, then acting "extremely abusive" when approached over the incident, councillors heard during a recent meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Recycling audits have been carried out since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>In this case, a property had been using its yellow recycling bin as a rubbish bin for two consecutive weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The property also had three red bins as well as the yellow bin out for kerbside collection, councillors heard.</p>
        
            <p>It was estimated they had presented around 480kg of waste on collection day.</p>
        
            <p>When approached, the resident was "extremely abusive to the audit team and collection contractor", the councillors were told during an update on audit results.</p>
        
            <p>Council infrastructure and open spaces group manager Neil McCann said the usual education approach for incorrect recycling practices was deemed to be unachievable.</p>
        
            <p>Any bins presented by the property were now treated as waste by the contractor, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The property's yellow bin had been confiscated but they acquired another one, as well as the two additional red bins. The extra bins had been confiscated, McCann said.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was at the "extreme worst end of the scale".</p>
        
            <p>However, McCann said ongoing kerbside auditing has improved results in Ashburton. This saved ratepayers the $1000 additional cost of a contaminated recycling load being diverted to landfill.</p>
        
            <p>"The observations of our audit team on the ground is that people are generally recycling well, though there are odd cases of larger non-compliance as has been highlighted.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest issue is finding rubbish in recycling bins and this is most commonly soft plastics, food, clothing and soiled nappies."</p>
        
            <p>Since auditing began in 2021, Ashburton has only had four contaminated loads.</p>
        
            <p>As a comparison Christchurch City Council reported that in May it had 2 percent (11) of its recycling loads diverted to landfill, at a total cost of $11,000 - its best month of the year to date.</p>
        
            <p>In terms of general waste, the latest figures showed that there were 1169 tonnes of waste sent to the Kate Valley landfill in April, bringing the total for the 2023/24 year to 12,595 - with about 14,800 tonnes sent in the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>The council plans to hold a workshop to decide on the green waste bin size options ahead of the kerbside rollout in September 2026.</p>
        
            <p>This will be included in the next waste management contract, which is due to go out for tender in September.</p>
