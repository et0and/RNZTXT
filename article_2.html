            <p>Comedian and advocate Mike King says he had no idea the chairperson of his charity had links to the National Party.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government this week announced $24m in funding for Gumboot Friday charity I Am Hope.</p>
        
            <p>Questions have been raised about donations made by the charity's chair Naomi Ballantyne to the National Party.</p>
        
            <p>Founder, Mike King, told Morning Report he hadn't known Ballantyne had donated to National but said she was entitled to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"She's a private individual, she can donate to who she wants to, what I can tell you is this organisation, or myself, have never donated any money to any political group."</p>
        
            <p>The government funding was offered before Ballantyne was involved with the charity, he said.</p>
        
            <p>King said he hadn't asked for it, but would put the entire $24m towards counselling services.</p>
        
            <p>"I never applied for the money, but it was offered to us and we're gratefully accepting it.</p>
        
            <p>"I stand by what we're doing, I'm grateful for the money, and if Labour had offered us the money, I would have taken it."</p>
        
            <p>He said the former government, under then prime minister Jacinda Ardern, gave the charity $600,000 in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"This isn't the first time that a government has thrown money at a charity."</p>
        
            <p>I Am Hope and Gumboot Friday was not the solution but took care of a need, King said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not an instead of approach, it is an as well as approach."</p>
