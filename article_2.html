            <p>Ashburton's mayor hopes the promotion of a local MP will help provide his region with a strong link to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon promoted Rangitata MP James Meager in his cabinet reshuffle over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Meager is now a minister outside of cabinet after being given the new title of Minister for the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>He also takes on the youth and hunting and fishing portfolios, and associate transport role.</p>
        
            <p>Ashburton mayor Neil Brown said South Island councils have told the government they felt their voice wasn't being heard.</p>
        
            <p>Introducing the South Island Minister was a good move, while having the local MP promoted to minister outside of cabinet will provide a "more direct connection with Wellington", Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have close relationships with other Ministers but having our local MP closer to cabinet might prove another port of call to help champion our cause."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he has been impressed by Meager in his first term.</p>
        
            <p>"The Prime Minister must be seeing what we are from James and rewarded him."</p>

            <p>The first term MP was attending the Black Clash cricket match in Christchurch on Saturday night when he got the call from Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>"[I was] a little bit surprised but very excited to take on the new roles," Meager said.</p>
        
            <p>"I see it as a vote of confidence."</p>
        
            <p>Meager said he had initially discussed with Luxon and National's deputy leader Nicola Willis about the new South Island post.</p>
        
            <p>Two major priorities were to ensure the South Island has a voice in government decisions and supporting Willis' economic growth plan, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm always going to wear my colours on my sleeve as a parochial advocate for Mid and South Canterbury, but it is a South Island-wide focus."</p>
        
            <p>The South Island was critical to any economic growth plan, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meager plans to meet with the local government leaders from across the South Island to establish what their priorities are.</p>
        
            <p>As Youth Minister he is keen to focus on youth employment, mental health and "what children are leaving our education system with to operate in the real world".</p>
        
            <p>He is yet to discuss the associate transport role with new Transport Minister Chris Bishop around "what it is he wants me to focus on".</p>
        
            <p>With all these new roles he will also continue his work as the justice select committee chairman which is dealing with the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>The committee will listen to 80 hours of oral submissions over a month after the bill received over 300,000 submissions.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has repeatedly said it will not pass a second reading, but the committee has to follow the process, Meager said.</p>
        
            <p>"The committee just has to deal with what's in front of it and the house can decide whether it passes or not."</p>
