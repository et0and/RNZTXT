            <p>Lauren Dickason is appealing her conviction for murdering her three young daughters.</p>
        
            <p>Dickason was in June sentenced to 18 years in prison for the 2021 murders of her three girls in their Timaru home.</p>
        
            <p>She smothered 6-year-old Lian√® and 2-year-old twins Karla and Maya in their beds on 16 September, 2021, three weeks after the family had arrived to New Zealand from South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old had pleaded not guilty to all three murder charges, her legal team mounting a defence based on insanity and infanticide.</p>
        
            <p>But on 16 August, 2023, and after more than 14 hours of deliberations, a jury found Lauren had murdered her daughters.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Mander imposed no minimum non-parole period, saying her severe mental illness was not only a contributing factor to her actions, but the cause.</p>
        
            <p>Dickason will be eligible for parole after she has served a third of her sentence.</p>
        
            <p>She was initially sentenced to an in-patient care and treatment unit as a special patient because of her mental condition, in accordance with the Mental Health Compulsory Assessment and Treatment Act.</p>
        
            <p>No date has been set for the appeal.</p>
        
            <p>Dickason's lawyer has been approached for comment.</p>
