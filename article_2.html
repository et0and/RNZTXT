        <h2>'Drastically unfair': The landowner facing a 500 percent rates hike</h2>
        <p>
The owner pointed out there had been zero increase to the value of their section in that time, and lacks access to key council services.

            <p>A Stewart Island/Rakiura land owner is staring down the barrel of a 500 percent increase to their rates, despite their section lacking key council services.</p>
        
            <p>The person - who is unnamed in a recently-released Southland District Council report - contacted the organisation in October 2023 querying why their rates had ballooned from $348.68 to $1743.95 in the space of one year.</p>
        
            <p>Labelling the increase "drastically unfair and unjust", they pointed out there had been zero increase to the value of their section in that time.</p>
        
            <p>"No services have been added to the section in the ratable period," they wrote to the council.</p>
        
            <p>"Rata St still remains the only road within 1km of the city centre that is in its disgraceful gravel state.</p>
        
            <p>"Every other road on the island with the same vicinity to the city centre as mine has been sealed. So close to the centre and not sealed is abhorrent."</p>
        
            <p>The person also informed the council that they did not use Southland roads due to living in Christchurch and did not own a car on the island.</p>
        
            <p>According to a staff report prepared for a full council meeting this Wednesday, the main reason for the increase was due to a change in ownership in June 2023.</p>
        
            <p>That alteration moved the property from paying partial rates as an adjoining property to fully rated, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>It also confirmed the property was without amenities.</p>
        
            <p>"The section has no services - no water, no sewage, no stormwater retention, no power, a gravel/muddy road with no footpath or streetlighting."</p>

            <p>Despite a rates reduction request from the owner for the current period, staff recommended no rate remission be applied to the property.</p>
        
            <p>It said the new owner could have discovered what was at stake if they obtained a LIM report prior to purchase, and feared the granting of a remission would set a precedent for other properties.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors will vote on two options at Wednesday's meeting - to confirm that no remission be applied, or to agree to a partial remission of 40 percent for the 2023/24 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>If the latter was approved, the property owner would pay a total $697.91 for the 2023-24 financial year, with full rates to apply from July 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was escalated to elected members following a request from the person to speak to a higher authority on the matter, the report said.</p>
