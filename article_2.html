            <p>Lawson has quickly built a Formula One rivalry with Red Bull senior driver Sergio Perez, who qualified 16th, the latest in a string of disappointing performances by the struggling Mexican.</p>
        
            <p>Yuki Tsunoda joined Perez in the bottom five and will start 17th.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson and Japanese driver Tsunoda are challenging Perez for his seat in the top Red Bull line-up.</p>

            <p>McLaren's Lando Norris took pole position for the Qatar Grand Prix sprint with Mercedes' George Russell denying the Formula One leaders a front row lockout by pushing Oscar Piastri down to third.</p>
        
            <p>McLaren are leading Ferrari in the championship by 24 points with two rounds remaining and a first constructor's title since 1998 tantalisingly close.</p>
        
            <p>Ferrari's Carlos Sainz qualified fourth with team mate Charles Leclerc fifth and world champion Max Verstappen sixth for Red Bull and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton seventh.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's final attempt was invalidated for exceeding track limits.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi scraped into Q3 with a buffer of just 0.004 seconds over Fernando Alonso in Q2 and survived Q1 by a mere 0.013 seconds at the expense of Perez.</p>
        
            <p>Alonso was knocked out of Q2 in 11th, joining Alex Albon, Valtteri Bottas, Lance Stroll and Kevin Magnussen, respectively, as the eliminated drivers.</p>
        
            <p>In Q1, Lawson and Albon set identical times, which relegated Perez to yet another early exit from qualifying.</p>
        
            <p>The Qatar Grand Prix Sprint Race begins at 3am NZST on Sunday, before Grand Prix qualifying at 7am.</p>
