            <p>Cyclists and kayakers will be serving up some thrilling competition as day nine of the Paris Olympics gets underway.</p>
        
            <p>Those in New Zealand can watch on Sky Sport, stream on Sky Sport Now, or watch free-to-air on Sky Open (available on Freeview Channel 15 or stream free via Sky Go).</p>
        
            <p>Due to the time difference, day nine of the Games starts on Sunday evening and stretches into Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Here's who to look out for. All times are in NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Lauren Bruce set an Oceania record of 74.61m in Tucson, Arizona in 2021 and came 13th at the 2022 World Championships.</p>
        
            <p>This is the second Olympics for Bruce, who is from Timaru but is now based in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>She came 23rd at Tokyo 2020 - can she improve on that this time?</p>

            <p>This is Kim Cadzow's first Olympics, but she's already proving to be one to watch.</p>
        
            <p>She came seventh in the women's time trial last week, but held the third-place position for a solid chunk of the race.</p>
        
            <p>Cadzow's existing accomplishments include a second in the road race at the New Zealand Championships and a win at Trofeo Ponente in Rosa, with top-10 finishes at a handful of other international championships.</p>
        
            <p>It's expected she will again finish in the top 10 in the road race on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Kayak cross is a new addition to the Olympic Games - and Luuka Jones is the reigning world champion.</p>
        
            <p>We've already had a kayak cross time trial for seeding, then round one on Saturday night to eliminate some of the field. The heats are where the competition begins in earnest.</p>
        
            <p>The event, also referred to as 'boatercross', sees kayakers fight their way down the course, bumping each other out of the way.</p>
        
            <p>For those staying up late, it should make for thrilling viewing.</p>
