        <h2>Watch live: Luxon speaks from Thailand</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is taking questions ahead of a meeting with his Thai counterpart.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking to media in Bangkok, ahead of a meeting with Thai counterpart Srettha Thavisin.</p>
        
            <p>Thailand is the region's second largest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse with plenty of opportunity for trade, and New Zealand's 10th-largest trading partner.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will be hoping to "raise the energy" and reboot this international relationship as part of his trade and tourism-focused charm offensive throughout the region.</p>
        
            <p>This second leg of Luxon's Southeast Asia trip is the first dedicated trip by a New Zealand prime minister to Thailand in more than a decade. Centre for Strategic Studies director David Capie told RNZ Deputy Political Editor Craig McCulloch that Luxon turning up would be enough to make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>Like Luxon, Thavisin is a relatively new leader with a business background - having worked for Proctor & Gamble.</p>
        
            <p>He was dubbed the Salesman PM after taking power last year.</p>
