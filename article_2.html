        <p>

            <p>Hospital admin staff are losing their jobs or not being replaced, forcing stressed doctors and nurses to pick up their workload on top of their own.</p>
        
            <p>Angry health workers have told RNZ that the short-sighted cuts are already hurting patients, and will cost the health system more in the long-run.</p>
        
            <p>One admin worker - who has just lost her job with a hospital service in the Wellington region - said patients' wait times had already blown out by 14-16 months.</p>
        
            <p>The service manager was "completely blindsided" to be told the fixed-term position could not be renewed or made permanent, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our service is in a staffing crisis, the wait times are unacceptable, its causing distress for both our patients and clinicians.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't understand why my role has been affected. I am patient-facing, I manage a relatively significant workload for the clinicians, so they can put their resources into seeing patients, as well as providing administrative support."</p>
        
            <p>The woman has managed to find another job but for lower pay, which had "dire" financial implications for her family, she said.</p>

            <p>A frustrated senior doctor - who works in another busy hospital department - said they had just lost their only "phenomenally hard-working superstar" booking clerk.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-five weeks' pregnant, she had to be hospitalised herself due to stress.</p>
        
            <p>"We are all upset and worried about her and her baby. We are worried about the future of our service and our patients."</p>
        
            <p>There was now "no-one" to book clinics, load, complete and waitlist referrals, answer patient queries, fill cancellation slots, or help patients navigate their appointment times, the doctor said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall, who was contacted by this doctor and many other worried healthworkers, said the government was making a false distinction between "back-office" and front-line.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not true that the health system has enough money. There are vital roles in our health system that are going unfilled."</p>
        
            <p>A Christchurch nurse, who spoke to RNZ anonymously, said senior clinicians had pleaded with management to replace their booking clerk, who was also going on maternity leave shortly.</p>
        
            <p>"[They're saying] 'We need this because it's clinical admin'. And it's just defiantly met with 'No, it isn't. It's an admin role'. So that's it."</p>
        
            <p>The extra admin would probably fall to doctors, leaving them less time to spend with patients, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only that, if that doctor is booking their own patients, that doctor is costing the system $100 an hour, and doing it a lot less efficiently than the admin person who is costing $35 an hour and has the ability to do that with a lot more expertise."</p>
        
            <p>The nurse said she was not opposed to "strategic" restructuring if needed, to get the health system out of financial strife.</p>
        
            <p>"But that's not what's happening. This is a sledgehammer approach with basically no recognition of the way that the hospital machine runs.</p>
        
            <p>"For every front-line staff member there are non-clinical, non-patient facing staff members who are working really hard to make sure that every person gets good quality care."</p>
        
            <p>Northland Hospital emergency specialist Gary Payinda said it was "insulting" to hear the Prime Minister talk about the need to focus resources on the front line.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a front-line emergency doctor. Who do you think supports everything I do within the hospital?</p>
        
            <p>"And those people - people like the ED PAs - keep our department running and keep it together.</p>
        
            <p>"And those folks are doing things beyond their job description."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora chief people officer Andrew Slater said the "temporary pause" on recruitment for non-frontline roles was to allow it time to "realign budgets to continue prioritising ongoing funding for front-line services".</p>
        
            <p>"Decisions around covering maternity leave - as opposed to vacancies - for non-frontline roles are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        
            <p>"This does not relate to, or affect, front-line roles as we remain focussed on ensuring that our front-line kaimahi retain the ability to continue caring for patients."</p>
