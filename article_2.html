            <p>Analysis: Take stock and move on is all the Black Caps can do following their humbling at the hands of Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were well beaten in the two-test series in Sri Lanka, which ended with an innings and 154 run loss in the second game in Galle - their heaviest-ever test defeat to Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>The result moved Sri Lanka to third place in the World Test Championship standings, behind India and Australia, while 2021 champions New Zealand slipped to seventh.</p>
        
            <p>It was the fourth successive test loss for the Black Caps, who now prepare to take on India in three tests.</p>
        
            <p>The situation does not get any easier, with New Zealand facing similar conditions against a side that is currently top of WTC standings.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Tim Southee had no hesitation admitting they had been thoroughly outplayed in Sri Lanka, and that they faced a similar force in India.</p>
        
            <p>"We know it's going to be tough in India as well," he said after the conclusion of the Sri Lankan series.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously conditions will favour spin there as well so I think [we] learn as much as we can from these two [tests], but still believing and being a confident side moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka's new run-scoring machine Kamindu Mendis dominated the batting statistics, scoring 309 runs in three innings to take his career average to 91.27 after eight tests.</p>
        
            <p>Left arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya took 18 wickets across the series at an average of 21.</p>
        
            <p>Compare that to New Zealand, who had Rachin Ravindra topping the batting with 153 runs, while quick bowler Will O'Rourke and spinner Ajaz Patel took eight wickets each.</p>

            <p>New Zealand's knock of 360 in the second innings of the second test was their best effort of the series, and Southee said they could take some positives from it.</p>
        
            <p>"When conditions are doing plenty and spin was doing a lot, the guys were able to absorb it at times and put pressure back on the bowlers as well."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand did manage to bowl Sri Lanka out twice in the first test, while the home side managed 602 for five declared in their only bat in the second test.</p>
        
            <p>As expected, spinners Patel, Mitchell Santner, Glenn Phillips and Ravindra bowled the majority of the overs.</p>
        
            <p>Southee said the bowling attack will have also benefited from the Sri Lankan series.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting overs into the spinners, but I think all the guys will learn from the experience here and we'll look to learn from it and move forward as we head to India."</p>
        
            <p>The majority of the squad now return home, with the touring party for India expected to be named in the next 48 hours.</p>
