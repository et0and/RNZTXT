            <p>Historical drama Shōgun and restaurant tale The Bear are set to dominate at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards, which is set to start in Los Angeles about noon (NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi-born actor Anna Sawai, who played a leading role in Shōgun, has been nominated for Best Leading Actress in a Drama Series. The show has made history by winning 14 trophies at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys.</p>
        
            <p>Actor and comedian Jemaine Clement and director Taika Waititi's mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows is up for the Outstanding Comedy Series Award. The show has received 29 Emmy nominations since it was created.</p>
        
            <p>Waititi also has another show in the running for two awards - Reservation Dogs, co-created with Sterlin Harjo.</p>
        
            <p>Today's ceremony takes place just eight months after the last Emmys, which aired in January because of disruptions caused by Hollywood labour strikes.</p>
        
            <p>The show will be hosted by Schitt's Creek father/son duo Eugene and Dan Levy from downtown Los Angeles. Producers have promised cast reunions from shows past, such as Happy Days, to celebrate the history of television.</p>
        
            <p>While the show will initially air on Disney's ABC, a delayed screening is available for New Zealanders to watch on Rialto, starting from 5.30pm with the red carpet pre-show and the ceremony at 6.30pm.</p>
