            <p>A police spokesperson said they were working to figure out the circumstances surrounding the assault.</p>
        
            <p>A resident on nearby Victoria Street, who lives in a block of units, said police searched his home looking for the attacker.</p>
        
            <p>The man said police told him they had been told someone had been seen running down the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know what was going on at that stage, they just asked if I consented to my house being searched because their dog wouldn't leave the area so I let them in."</p>
        
            <p>The man said there were between 15 to 20 officers, outside his home, who were mostly armed.</p>
        
            <p>"It was scary - I don't know why they pin-pointed my house, but they didn't find anything here."</p>
        
            <p>Police left his driveway shortly after 5pm, he said, but were still patrolling nearby hours later.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said parts of Captain Springs Road and Church Road remain closed while emergency services respond.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists are asked to avoid the area and expect delays while the incident is resolved."</p>
