        <h2>Watch: Dramatic rescue as boat runs aground in Otago</h2>
        <p>
Two crew members were rescued by helicopter and the skipper taken to Dunedin Hospital after the fishing boat hit trouble.
</p>
        
            <p>It's not yet clear how a commercial fishing boat ran aground on Otago Peninsula, the harbour master says.</p>
        
            <p>The 16-metre boat was heading out for the day when it ran aground near Taiaroa Heads around 6.45am on Tuesday, Harbour Master Steve Rushbrook said.</p>
        
            <p>Two crew were rescued by helicopter, and the skipper had been taken to Dunedin Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>The boat had now mostly sunk and was on rocks on the shoreline, being pushed around by the breaking waves below the Tairoa Heads albatross colony's lookout, Rushbrook said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's in a location which is not going to interfere with anybody's safe navigation in and out of the harbour here. It shouldn't affect anybody going about their normal business, or normal shipping or fishing conditions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Really, it's just about keeping eyes out for any debris or pollution...There's one or two bits that have already broken off or started to come loose."</p>
        
            <p>Rushbrook said the boat was being monitored by the Coastguard and regional council but rough sea conditions had made it too dangerous to reach.</p>
        
            <p>There was a high chance it would break up in its current position if the swell remained about 1.5 to 2 metres, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The swells could ease in the next 24 hours, and the crews will continue assessing if and what salvage can be done, Rushbrook said.</p>
        
            <p>The amount of fuel on board was unknown.</p>
        
            <p>"These boats tend to carry a few tonnes of fuel onboard for their day to day operations...We're just trying to understand what may be onboard or may not be, but it's usually a diesel fuel of some description," he said.</p>

            <p>No pollution had been reported or found yet, Rushbrook said.</p>
        
            <p>If anyone out on the harbour spotted any oil, fuel or debris, they should contact the Harbour Master straight away, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The boat was owned and operated by a local family who "had a lot of fishing history and knowledge" and lived on the heads.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not sure what's gone wrong at this moment in time, but no doubt Maritime NZ will lead an investigation and find out in due course," Rushbrook said.</p>
        
            <p>He thanked the local fishers who came to the boat's aid for their quick and clear communication, and to emergency and rescue staff for doing a great job of a complex rescue.</p>
        
            <p>St John said three units responded and assessed both people.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Maritime New Zealand said it was aware of the grounding and was investigating.</p>
