            <p>Transport NZ has said it will hold NZTA to account if the work on the Desert Rd took substantially longer than the estimated two month timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive of Transport NZ Dom Kalasih, said the closure was agreed upon on the basis of "short term pain for long term gain".</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a lot of spend, a lot of cost blow-outs and it's almost accepted. This is all government spend and road user monies. It should be incumbent on NZTA that they spend the money responsibly," Kalasih said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the 30 - 40 minute detour about the Desert Rd would add up to $160 on top of drivers operating costs - which would inevitably have to be passed on to transport company's clients.</p>
        
            <p>"Our advice for members has been make sure your clients understand there is going to be additional costs. Make sure those costs are passed on and make sure you plan for the extra journey time," Kalasih said.</p>
        
            <p>He said issues with NZTA's journey planner were also creating some headaches for truckies.</p>

            <p>On Monday the agency's website was indicating a westward diversion between Waiouru and Taihape that would take drivers off state highway roads and add even more delays to the their journey.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spent quite some time trying to get an answer from NZTA. I guess not all of their people are back at work. But we have had someone confirm with one of the NZTA journey managers the road south of Waiouru is open," Kalasih said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he understood a glitch from Google Maps had led to the incorrect route showing up on the agency's system.</p>
        
            <p>An NZTA spokesperson said they had learned of their site problem Monday morning and it was resolved shortly after 3.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>"We share information between ourselves and Google Maps and - in this case - the info that was on there came from Google Maps. We apologise for any inconvenience the fault may have caused."</p>
        
            <p>Resident of Turoa Ski Field Kat McKenzie said - at a meeting for local businesses in early December - council staff had estimated there would be an additional 8000 vehicles coming through the town each day.</p>
        
            <p>She said business owners were welcoming the added exposure and the opportunity to prove the area was more than a winter destination.</p>
        
            <p>"Local businesses are thinking it's a positive. People are prepared for it. I know there are some businesses in town who haven't historically done lunch [service] who are opening up for lunch.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's going to be a few more food trucks who are setting up along the way. People have been expecting this now for two months to six weeks. It's not been suddenly sprung up on them.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely some of the operators that are doing mountain biking, canoeing and kayaking are excited about the fact people might be looking for more things to do and spending some more time out here," McKenzie said.</p>
        
            <p>An Ohakune resident - who did not want to be named - said she was concerned trucks being diverted through the town would not keep within the speed limit and could endanger pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>"[You'll] take your life into your own hands to get across the road. We don't have over passes and stuff like that.</p>
        
            <p>"You notice it when there's an accident [on the Desert Road]. Trucks do not do fifty km/h through our township," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kalasih said he would be issuing a safety message to members of the organisation in response to the closure.</p>
        
            <p>"These drivers, they risk losing their livelihood if they get tickets. So by and large drivers do their best to stay within the law.</p>
        
            <p>"I won't be so naive as to say that everybody does but we will be doing our best to communicate to our members that they take extra care and vigilance when they travel through these local communities."</p>
        
            <p>Owner of Kune Bikes Max Carling said the community was taking a wait and see attitude to any benefits or problems the influx of traffic could bring.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's the first day the road's closed and definitely noticed a lot more traffic out there on the road. Mainly big trucks at the moment but it should do town a lot of good.</p>
        
            <p>"I've heard both sides of the story really. There are some worries about road quality and the amount of people coming through town. With all the extra traffic there's no zebra crossings or anything like that. I haven't noticed any major issue today but we'll have to hold fire and see what happens over time."</p>
