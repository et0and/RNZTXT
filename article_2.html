        <h2>Residents warned to shut windows as fire strikes industrial building</h2>
        <p>
The building has been reduced to its frame, a witness says, as crews battle the third fire in the Kāpiti town this past week.

            <p>Fire crews are battling a blaze at a factory that manufactures rubber and PVC playground safety mats in the Kāpiti town of Ōtaki.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency was called to the scene at the factory's Titoki Street site at 6.20am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Matta factory manager Tim Scott said he was alerted early this morning, and was driving back to Ōtaki from Auckland to assess the damage.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is not yet under control, and seven crews are working on it, with support from an aerial appliance, command unit and operational support.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of a business near the factory on fire said it looked like the building had been reduced to its frame.</p>
        
            <p>The business owner, who did not want to be named, said it was a hive of activity.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ from nearby the scene on Riverbank Road, she said fire trucks and firefighters were everywhere, including one on a tall ladder hosing down the building.</p>
        
            <p>All she could see of the building was its steel frame.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said there was no risk of the fire spreading to other properties.</p>
        
            <p>The smoke would be noticeable from a distance, so people should keep their doors and windows shut to keep out the smell, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The public is asked to stay well away from the area.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is not currently being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third fire reported in Ōtaki in the past week.</p>
        
            <p>Two 17-year-olds were referred to Youth Services in relation to a bush fire at Ōtaki Beach last Saturday, 23 March.</p>
        
            <p>And crews rushed to a large blaze at a workshop at Swamp Road and found a single-storey complex well-alight on Friday, 22 March.</p>
