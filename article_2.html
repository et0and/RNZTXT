            <p>Parts of central Auckland are without power after a mass outage struck on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Lines company Vector said outages were affecting some properties between Albert Street and Elliot Street, as well as buildings in the vicinity of Khyber Pass Road, Grafton Road and Newton Road.</p>
        
            <p>It is investigating the cause, and whether power could be re-routed to the area as a temporary measure. All properties were expected to have power back by 6.30pm on Friday, its website said.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff reported residents on Cockburn St in Grey Lynn heard a loud bang before the electricity went off.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Aucklanders heading away this afternoon for the region's long Anniversary weekend can expect a slow exit from the city.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA's website warned of congestion and delays on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>For people heading south, by late afternoon it was taking about an about longer than usual to get from the city to Bombay. While a breakdown on State Highway 1 at Manurewa meant one southbound lane was blocked.</p>
        
            <p>For people heading north, holiday congestion that had built up to noticeable levels shortly before noon on Friday, meant it was taking longer than usual to get from the city to Wellsford, NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>North of Gisborne, State Highway 2 was closed at Ormond, near Waipaoa Road, after a serious crash about 1.10pm, but had reopened by 4.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>One person was critically injured, while three others were also taken to hospital in serious or moderate conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy traffic was also expected in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty during the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>And several large music events were planned for Tauranga, Taupō and Whitianga, which were likely to add to congestion on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>In Waikato, regular closures of a section of State Highway 1 to allow asphalting work to be carried out between Tīrau and Putaruru were paused for the long weekend, and would begin again on Tuesday 28 January.</p>
