        <h2>Iconic view of Japan's Mount Fuji to be blocked to deter tourists</h2>
        <p>
Residents of a small town are at their wits' end over tourists' behaviour, as some park illegally and climb on roofs to get the perfect photo.

            <p>One of Japan's most iconic photo spots is to be blocked by authorities exasperated by badly behaved tourists.</p>
        
            <p>A big black barrier is to be erected to obscure views of Mount Fuji.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of Fujikawaguchiko accuse mainly foreign tourists of dropping rubbish and parking illegally as they search for the perfect photo.</p>
        
            <p>The shot in question features a convenience store in the foreground, with Japan's most famous landmark rising behind it.</p>
        
            <p>The juxtaposition of the soaring volcano and the banal sight of one of Japan's most ubiquitous shops have made Fujikawaguchiko a popular location for photos, with a local official telling AFP that the place had gained a "reputation that this spot is very Japanese".</p>
        
            <p>They added that the town in Yamanashi region was at its wits' end over the behaviour, with some tourists even climbing on to roofs to get the perfect snap.</p>
        
            <p>Construction of the mesh net which will be 2.5m and 20m - or the same length as a cricket pitch - will begin as early as next week, the official told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>"It's regrettable we have to do this, because of some tourists who can't respect rules," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Before taking the rather drastic measure of the screen, officials had put up road signs and said repeated warnings from security guards were ignored.</p>
        
            <p>The official said the net was also being put up to protect a nearby dental practice, which was suffering from visitors parking in its spaces without permission and even climbing on the building's roof to clinch the best picture.</p>
        
            <p>Japan is currently enjoying a tourism boom following the lifting of post-pandemic travel restrictions and a push by the government to attract more foreign visitors. For the first time ever in March, visitor numbers to the nation of islands passed three million.</p>
        
            <p>However, soaring numbers of tourists have caused some issues.</p>
        
            <p>Congestion on Mount Fuji caused by climbers means that from this summer hikers will have to pay a Â£10 (NZ$21) charge as authorities try to limit the numbers scaling to the summit.</p>
        
            <p>The congestion on the route up Japan's highest mountain was leading to increasing injuries and rubbish littering the trail - not to mention inappropriately dressed hikers, officials said.</p>
        
            <p>Numbers of people hiking up the Yoshida Trail will also be capped at 4,000 people a day. They will also not be allowed to set off between 4pm and 2am - part of a bid to stop so-called "bullet climbs", when people try to scale the 3,776-metre summit without breaks.</p>
        
            <p>While in Kyoto in 2019, officials started handing out leaflets and paper lanterns in an attempt to remind tourists how to behave in its historic Gion quarter.</p>
