            <p>A crowd of about two dozen have waited outside Wellington District Court morning in support of a former Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora employee accused of leaking Covid-19 vaccine data.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Young pleaded not guilty in December to a charge of accessing computer systems for a dishonest purpose. He appeared in court on Friday morning ahead of his jury trial.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd held signs thanking the 56-year-old IT worker for his alleged actions, which they described as "whistleblowing". Young stopped and spoke to them before entering the court for his brief procedural hearing.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared before a packed public gallery, in front of Judge Tania Warburton.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Kevin Preston told the court police had not provided the defence with the information required in time for the hearing, although he noted a USB was delivered to his office on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"It's encrypted and I can't access it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Young was bailed until his next hearing in April. A trial date is yet to be set.</p>
        
            <p>He said "freedom" as he exited the courtroom, once again spoke to his supporters and blew into a whistle.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand last week revealed at least 12,000 people had their personal information posted in a downloadable file on a United States website.</p>
        
            <p>It had begun notifying the individuals whose data had been published, but said information about other people may come to light.</p>
