            <p>Three people have been charged in Argentina for crimes related to the death of Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, according to the public prosecutor's office.</p>
        
            <p>The British pop star, who was 31, died on 16 October after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
        
            <p>The three people charged include an employee of the hotel where Payne died, according to the newspaper La Nacion.</p>
        
            <p>The employee was charged with two counts of supplying Payne with cocaine while he was staying at the hotel.</p>
        
            <p>Another person was also charged with two counts of supplying cocaine.</p>
        
            <p>A third person was said to have been with Payne daily throughout his time in Buenos Aires and was charged with abandoning a person followed by death, as well as supplying narcotics, according to prosecution court documents quoted by the paper.</p>
        
            <p>"The results of analyses - already communicated to his family - revealed that, in the moments before his death and in his last 72 hours, Payne had consumed alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant," the autopsy document said.</p>
        
            <p>It concluded that Payne was not fully conscious at the time of his fall.</p>
