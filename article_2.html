        <h2>Ally Wollaston wins bronze to bring curtain down on Paris Olympics</h2>
        <p>
Going into the final race of the Games, the cyclist was sitting in eighth - but a herculean effort saw her climb onto the podium.

            <p>Cyclist Ally Wollaston has come from behind to win a bronze medal in the women's omnium - the last race of the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Her win came just hours after fellow cyclist Ellesse Andrews bagged the gold in the women's team sprints - her second gold and third medal of the Games.</p>
        
            <p>Wollaston, who already held a silver from the women's team pursuit earlier in the week, finished fifth in the scratch race - the first of the omnium's four races.</p>
        
            <p>She was sitting in seventh after the tempo and elimination races, but briefly dropped to eighth in the points race - the final one of the night - after being lapped.</p>
        
            <p>However, she fought back and onto the podium, lapping the field twice to rack up an extra 40 points, then holding on for dear life over the last 10 laps of the 20km race.</p>
        
            <p>She finished in third, behind Jennifer Valente of the United States and Daria Pikulik of Poland.</p>
        
            <p>Valente had 144 points, Pikulik 131 and Wollaston 125.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
