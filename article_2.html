            <p>Hundreds of Rotorua dog owners face $300 fines as the council cracks down on residents "unwilling" to register their pets.</p>
        
            <p>The district has more than 12,000 known dogs, Rotorua Lakes Council community and regulatory services manager Kurt Williams reported to a community and district development committee meeting last week.</p>
        
            <p>The district's resident canine population typically grew by about 2 percent each year, and every dog needed to be registered with the council by 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said despite two extensions to the payment deadline, the number of registrations decreased this year.</p>
        
            <p>About 1660 dogs remained unregistered, up to 1000 more than at the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>The cost-of-living crisis, a 5 percent increase in annual dog registration fees, high deprivation levels and previous registration extensions provided through the Covid response, were all considered to be contributing factors, according to a report presented to the council.</p>
        
            <p>Council officers could conduct door-to-door checks to make sure dogs were registered.</p>
        
            <p>If owners were "unwilling", infringement notices were handed out and dogs could be seized as a last resort, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>The high number of unregistered dogs this year meant there were not enough resources to check each property individually, elected members were told.</p>
        
            <p>After seeking legal advice, council staff would instead mail owners infringement notices of $300 per unregistered dog.</p>
        
            <p>Owners would be offered 28 days to pay their outstanding registration and penalty instead, in which case the infringement notice would be cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Penalties normally applied after 1 August each year and cost the registration fee plus 50 percent.</p>
        
            <p>An urban dog cost $115.50 to register, or $173.25 with the late penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said staff had tried to contact as many owners as possible to tell them to register.</p>
        
            <p>To reduce the issue in the future, he said the council was looking at having only one tag for a dog's life and investigating direct debit options including part-pay options for the year ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Dog registration covered the cost of 90 to 95 percent of animal control services, with the rest covered by general rates.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesman told the Rotorua Daily Post this week the organisation was in the process of preparing infringement notices, which would be sent out in the next one-and-a-half weeks.</p>
        
            <p>He said the number of unregistered dogs whose owners would face fines may be lower than was presented in the meeting due to some being registered before the mail-out date.</p>
