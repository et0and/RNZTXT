            <p>Kiwi marathon runner Stefan Ozich has achieved a significant feat, running the length of New Zealand twice, all for a noble cause.</p>
        
            <p>Ozich set out on the incredible journey in efforts to raise $1 million for The Last Chance Project, a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the health and well-being of men in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He chose to tackle the tough task because of his own brother, who took his own life, who he said was a huge motivation for him.</p>
        
            <p>And just 114 days later since he set out on monumental challenge, Ozich completed the 6000km journey in Cape Reinga on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The 29-year-old has been running almost every day since 1 October, only taking a few days off in unfit weather conditions.</p>
        
            <p>His support crew followed him throughout his journey, helping with more than just logistics, but with cooking and cleaning as well.</p>
        
            <p>Ozich posted to social media on Tuesday in anticipation of reaching the finish line.</p>

            <p>He said it "felt more like a long lost memory than a forthcoming reality", and that despite "broken" feet and Achilles, his spirit and mind remained strong.</p>
        
            <p>Ozich previously share with Summer Weekends of the physical pain he has endured, and how it compares to the typical marathon.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sort of like if you run a marathon, it's like the last 5-10km, some days it feels like that the whole day, like I'm battling that last 5km.</p>
        
            <p>"That's probably the best way I can describe the sensation and the pain that you ensure in the day-to-day grind of this mission."</p>
        
            <p>But Ozich said what kept him placing one foot in front of the other was his values.</p>
        
            <p>"I've set up to do this thing bigger than me and I realise that I've told myself I can do this, that's been a really main anchor."</p>
        
            <p>Ozich has raised $210,621 as of Wednesday.</p>
