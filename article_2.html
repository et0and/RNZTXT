            <p>The new government has confirmed its plan for its first 100 days, with 49 items Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says are "ambitious for New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>The new Cabinet met today for its second meeting to discuss the plan, and how that would work considering the 100-day plan National campaigned on, combined with the priorities of the two partner parties ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Announcing the plan, Luxon said New Zealanders voted for a change of government, a change of policies and a change of approach.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be a government that gets things done for New Zealand and we will start straight away, with a 100-day plan that includes a range of actions we will take to improve the lives of New Zealanders," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government is starting the way we mean to go on - ambitious for New Zealand. With 49 actions to deliver in the next 100 days, this plan is hugely ambitious but we will be working as hard as we can."</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop told media at Wednesday's post-Cabinet media briefing: "The first bill that we will introduce and move through all stages will be a bill to return the Reserve bank of new Zealand to a single mandate, a single focus on fighting inflation.</p>
        
            <p>"We intend to move a bill to repeal the Labour government's Fair Pay - or so-called fair pay - legislation to repeal that through all stages. We will remove and repeal the Natural and Built Environment Act, and the Spatial Planning Act - Labour's RMA 2.0 Acts - through all stages.</p>
        
            <p>"We will repeal the ute tax - the clean car discount - through all stages, and we will introduce and refer to select committee a bill to extend 90-day trial periods for all businesses."</p>
        
            <p>At the same briefing, Luxon said "I think we're going to do more in 100 days than the (last) government did in the last six years".</p>
        
            <p>Asked about his confidence in getting through all the items on the plan, Luxon said the way they went through negotiations was working through the policy programmes from all three parties.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there's a lot in it, we know we've got a massive amount of ambition, we know we're biting off a lot in order to get it done, but we're determined to do so. So frankly, hitting the country with a lot more intensity than we've observed in the last six years, to say 'we are going to get things done'."</p>
        
            <p>The plan revolves around three focus areas: The economy, law and order, and public services.</p>
