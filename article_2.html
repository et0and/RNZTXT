            <p>The central health agency is asking hospitals to save more than $80m by July as part of a nationwide cost-cutting drive, according to figures sourced by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked Te Whatu Ora to confirm the figures, which range from a savings goal of $15.5m at Auckland to between $7m and $9m for four other districts, and a clutch of smaller districts at $3m or less.</p>
        
            <p>It has told hospitals they must "live within our means" and clamp down on staffing costs because other cost-cutting measures have not gone far enough, as RNZ revealed a week ago.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti has said this would not take away from the front line for medical care.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, a leaked document published by Newsroom showed Canterbury hospitals had been ordered to slash $13.3m in the next two months.</p>
        
            <p>The latest figures cited to RNZ are for savings ordered at another 11 health districts:</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked Te Whatu Ora what savings it has ordered at the other eight medium-to-small districts.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ was funded almost $23 billion for 2023-24.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said, in a statement: "Health NZ is not subject to the same government directive for savings as some other departments. These are operational decisions made by Health NZ, not the government.</p>
        
            <p>"What Health NZ is doing is finding ways to reduce spending by making day-to-day operational practices as efficient as possible so they can re-invest in the frontline.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been assured that managing clinical risk and sustaining services is always Health NZ's top priority. None of these cost-saving measures will impact the level of care patients receive."</p>
        
            <p>When asked to supply the document or advice confirming that cost-cutting would not impact patient care, a spokesperson for the minister said: The minister meets with officials often and received this assurance from Health NZ verbally.</p>
