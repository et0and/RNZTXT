            <p>Transpower is erecting a temporary tower and says it is on track to deliver more power to Northland by Saturday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of people had their power cut on Thursday after a pylon fell over.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower said on Friday full power would only be restored over the weekend, after the temporary tower was put in place.</p>

            <p>Posting on its Facebook page on Saturday, Transpower said its crews planned to move one of the lines from the fallen tower across to the temporary tower.</p>
        
            <p>"Our crews have been working hard to get additional power through the Northland."</p>
        
            <p>A Transpower spokesperson said it was aiming to have the temporary pylon running by Saturday afternoon, but the process was complex and challenging.</p>
        
            <p>Both the local power companies - Top Energy and Transpower - said they managed to get through Friday night thanks to households conserving power and hot water.</p>

Transpower says a pylon falling over is the cause of the outage.
