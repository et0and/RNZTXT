            <p>Popular beaches in holiday hotspots in both islands have been forced to close this afternoon after separate shark sightings, prompting evacuations by lifeguards.</p>
        
            <p>Lifeguards at Ōhope near the Top 10 Holiday Park in the Eastern Bay of Plenty evacuated the beach after a shark was spotted in the surf about 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>People could be seen standing on the shoreline looking for the shark before leaving the beach soon after.</p>
        
            <p>Lifeguards took down the flags at Ōhope and blew a whistle to alert swimmers of the shark.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua mother and daughter Mary and Brittany Eriksen, who are staying at their family bach nearby, had just got out of the water and were drying off when they heard a lifeguard blow a loud whistle.</p>
        
            <p>One of the lifeguards then carried a sign above his head that read "shark" to show swimmers what had been spotted.</p>
        
            <p>"At that moment, dozens of people raced out of the water," Brittany said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was more exciting than scary with everyone trying to spot the fin. He proved pretty elusive though."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in the South Island, Swimsafe has red-flagged Christchurch's New Brighton Beach today due to a shark sighting.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after holidaymakers were warned not to swim at Whiritoa Beach on the Coromandel Peninsula yesterday after reports of multiple shark sightings.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesman for the Whiritoa Lifeguard Service told the Herald there had been three separate shark sightings close to the shore on Friday and the beach had been closed intermittently.</p>
        
            <p>He said they didn't get a good look at the sharks, but thought they may have been bronze whalers - considering how shallow the water was they came into - and said they were "on the smaller side". He didn't know if the separate sightings were of the same shark.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving NZ earlier said a shark sighting near the flagged area of Waihī Beach, just down the coast from Whiritoa Beach, forced its temporary closure on Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>Shark scientist Riley Elliott told RNZ earlier this week the risk of shark attacks was pretty low.</p>
        
            <p>Over summer, sharks headed inshore to drop off their pups in nursery habitats, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Those areas were usually warm, calm, shallow and had lots of small fish, and generally happened to be the nice places people liked to swim in.</p>
        
            <p>"But what that does mean is we don our Speedos and we go to the beach and we see sharks."</p>
        
            <p>The most common shark people would see in the North Island and Upper South Island was the bronze whaler, Elliott said.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, they could encounter the sevengill shark and the great white shark.</p>
