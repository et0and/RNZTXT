        <p>
The news today that the Chief Ombudsman must hang up his hat at the ripe age of 72 has sparked debate - how old is too old to still be working?

            <p>These days it's hardly unusual to hear older people say they plan to work well into their retirement years. In New Zealand, the age of eligibility for superannuation is 65, but there's no compulsory age to stop you from working - that is, unless you're Peter Boshier.</p>
        
            <p>The news today that the Chief Ombudsman must hang up his hat at the ripe age of 72 has sparked some interesting debate about how old is too old to still be working?</p>

            <p>Marian Lawrence, 72, says it should depend on the physicality of the job and the health of the person, rather than a firm rule.</p>
        
            <p>As a retired teacher, she says "the brain would still be up to it, but the body isn't".</p>
        
            <p>Sixty-seven-year-old Daryl Gardner, who happens to be a gardener, says working keeps him agile and healthy, and he hopes to do it "till the day I die".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm as fit as I was in '85 and I love working. Getting fresh air, being amongst nature, I'm very lucky. Who would give that up?"</p>
        
            <p>While many older people are keen to keep working, some are ready to put their feet up - and deservedly so.</p>

            <p>Annette Hayes, 64, has worked in healthcare for 40 years and is very much looking forward to her milestone birthday in May.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait to retire. I've been half-retired since 50 - just the tired part."</p>
        
            <p>While wellbeing and reduced mobility play strong roles in people's decisions to keep working, financial circumstances leave many without the opportunity to choose.</p>
        
            <p>Theresa Iosefa, 59, works the graveyard shift at Denny's. She doesn't see herself stopping any time soon.</p>
        
            <p>"I have the kids and grandkids and house to pay off. Life is too expensive for me."</p>
        
            <p>Most jobs don't have age limit laws, but there are some exceptions to the rule.</p>
        
            <p>Employment New Zealand says there are some occupations in which retirement age is set out in legislation - like coroners and judges - and in some case, pilots-in-command over the age of 60, may be part of the list.</p>
        
            <p>Employers can also apply the exception to non-New Zealand crews of ships and aircraft, and domestic employment in a private household.</p>
        
            <p>This then begs the question - at what point does age become a genuine occupational hazard?</p>

            <p>A Thomson Reuters study by Workbase suggests illness and injury statistics are generally higher for older employees.</p>
        
            <p>"As people age, they can experience gradual vision impairment, reduced concentration spans and more rapid fatigue. Older employees are also more likely to experience chronic, long-term health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis."</p>
        
            <p>For those performing hazardous tasks like driving, operating machinery, heavy lifting or working at heights, this presents a real risk.</p>
        
            <p>But physical decline isn't the only gamble.</p>
        
            <p>Just this week, a New York Times poll revealed a majority of voters in the US believe Joe Biden is just too old to be an effective president, citing concerns about the 81-year-old president's mental competency.</p>
        
            <p>Donald Trump, only four years his junior, is believed to be an unfit challenger for that reason among many more.</p>
        
            <p>There are, however, plenty of notable figures aged 70 and above still cranking it out at work.</p>
        
            <p>Goddess of pop Cher is still churning out albums at 77; 78-year-old Winston Peters is still shaking things up in the political sphere; and Dame Judi Dench is still on screen at 89. Closer to home, national treasure Sam Neill says he's only got better with age. This year, the 76-year-old is set to appear in Peacock's dramatic new mystery series 'Apples Never Fall'.</p>
        
            <p>Maybe age is just a number.</p>
