            <p>The censured former chairman of the West Coast Regional Council has been allowed to return to a council committee.</p>
        
            <p>However, Councillor Allan Birchfield's censure for allegedly leaking a legal document remains "unresolved" and he continues to be excluded from other committees.</p>
        
            <p>Birchfield, the longest serving council member and chairman from 2019 until his sacking in March 2023, was reinstated on Monday to the Resource Management Committee (RMC) following a closed door discussion at council's first full meeting of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Birchfield arrived for the RMC at the start of the day, despite being removed from all council committees after an independent investigation and a code of conduct hearing by his fellow councillors in May 2023. He was found to have breached the council's code of conduct.</p>
        
            <p>At the start of proceedings, council chairman Peter Haddock asked Birchfield "for a word" outside the room, but he declined.</p>
        
            <p>A short while later, Haddock told staff and media to leave while council had an informal discussion. When the RMC got underway, Birchfield remained at the table.</p>
        
            <p>The matter was then revisited at the end of the subsequent formal council meeting, in the public excluded section.</p>
        
            <p>Birchfield left at that stage, telling LDR there had been "an exchange of unpleasantries" early in the day.</p>
        
            <p>The recommendation to reinstate Birchfield to the RMC was proposed by Frank Dooley and seconded by fellow Westport councillor Mark McIntyre, with the vote unanimous.</p>
        
            <p>There was no further comment when the open council meeting resumed.</p>
        
            <p>Birchfield said it was good to be able to return to the Resource Management Committee given he was an elected member representing a constituency.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll see how things go from there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Birchfield said while he did not want "to get in a scrap" and wanted to move forward, he believed he had done nothing wrong in the events leading to his censure.</p>
        
            <p>In May 2023, council's investigator found that "on the balance of probabilities" he had leaked privileged legal information about the employment of former chief executive Heather Mabin.</p>
        
            <p>"I have definitely not apologisedâ€¦ and I don't intend to. If anything, I want an apology from council for what I have put up with," Birchfield said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The people elected me, and I'm paid to represent them and they really haven't been getting value for money, in the fact I really haven't been able to do my job.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't been able to carry out my functions because I haven't had the information."</p>
        
            <p>Haddock said he was pleased to see Birchfield back on the RMC.</p>

            <p>"That was a unanimous decision by councillors to alter the terms of the censure to allow Birchfield to the public section of the Resource Management Committee," Haddock said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to have him back at the table - it will be good to have his input."</p>
        
            <p>He had attempted to contact Birchfield since the meeting and the decision would be sent formally.</p>
        
            <p>Of the ongoing censure, Haddock said: "We need a resolution."</p>
        
            <p>Birchfield remained excluded from the public-excluded sections of the RMC, the full council, and from the other council committees at this point.</p>
        
            <p>In recent months Birchfield has used the pen to express his concerns in the public forum.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month he told LDR that he needed to represent his constituency even if he was to be excluded from much of the council's business.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, he recently penned an opinion piece in the Greymouth Star about what the proposed West Coast combined district plan, the Te Tai o Poutini Plan, poses for land use in the region including the implications of Significant Natural Areas for farming and mining.</p>
