            <p>Armed police are out again in the tiny King Country settlement of Marokopa as they hunt for the children of fugitive Tom Phillips.</p>
        
            <p>He and the three children have been missing for two-and-a-half years.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrived on Wednesday after issuing an $80,000 reward for information that could lead them to the children, now aged eight, nine and 10.</p>
        
            <p>Officers have set up four cordons and are checking everyone entering and leaving the community.</p>

            <p>Tip-offs about the family have been coming in since the reward was announced on Tuesday but police have not yet revealed how useful it is.</p>
        
            <p>The offer, which includes considering immunity against prosecution for anyone assisting Phillips, lasts for two weeks.</p>

            <p>Ember, eight, Maverick, nine, and Jayda, 10, have been missing since December 2021, when they were taken by Phillips to an unknown location - though police believe it was in Western Waikato within Marokopa or the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Phillips does not have legal custody of the children. He is sought by police and there is a warrant for his arrest," acting detective inspector Andrew Saunders said on Tuesday.</p>
