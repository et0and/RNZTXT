            <p>Drug use in New Zealand is on the rise and it's costing the country millions of dollars a week in social harm.</p>
        
            <p>Every region in the country, except Waikato, has recorded above average meth use while the number of people consuming cocaine is up in every district.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis are getting through 17.5 kilos of methamphetamine a week and 3.3 kilos of cocaine a week, new figures by police show.</p>
        
            <p>Drug use is monitored through wastewater results.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tim Chao, manager of the National Drug Intelligence Bureau told Checkpoint it was hard to pinpoint one precise cause for the rise.</p>
        
            <p>"Global availability as demonstrated by massive international and domestic seizures are likely to be a big factor."</p>
        
            <p>It is estimated the levels of meth use are costing the country $19.4 million every week.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis are using "a lot" of meth, Chao said.</p>
        
            <p>"In Q1 of this year, meth consumption averaged an estimated 17.5kgs a week."</p>
        
            <p>"Wastewater testing shows that many of our regional towns are actually consuming the highest amounts of methamphetamine per capita.</p>

            <p>"These locations also tend to face higher rates of deprivation and lack of access to social services and ongoing support."</p>
        
            <p>Chao would not be drawn on naming specific towns or regions.</p>
        
            <p>"The big centres are consuming the most in terms of actual volume but again it's some of our rural communities that are suffering the most harm from drug use."</p>
        
            <p>Drugs were easier to access now, Chao said, and the global economy playedd a big part.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of illicit drugs consumed in New Zealand are imported, and in simple terms they're coming from everywhere."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Only a small percent of meth consumed in New Zealand was actually manufactured here, he said.</p>
        
            <p>On other drugs, Chao said MDMA use had remained relatively stable over the last couple of years.</p>
        
            <p>"It has a reputation as being a low risk drug but there's no such things as a safe drug."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>There are dangers in dosage amounts or fake drugs mixed with harmful ingredients.</p>
        
            <p>"What we'd like to say, with all drugs no use is best use. I'll say that again because it's important, no use is best use.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are going to use, stay safe."</p>
        
            <p>Chao referred to drug testing services such as Know Your Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"Get your drugs tested, and don't use them alone."</p>

            <p>Cocaine is also on the rise.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know particularly why cocaine is on the increase," Chao said.</p>
        
            <p>"Again I think this is due to global availability. There's just so much of it around internationally and domestically.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a global economy, not just for legitimate business but also for illegitimate business."</p>
        
            <p>The National Drug Intelligence Bureau uses the Drug Harm Index published by the Ministry of Health to estimate the impacts of drug use.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost of drug use to New Zealand is considerable," Chao said.</p>
        
            <p>"For methamphetamine, this equates to $19.4 million a week; MDMA, $857,000 a week, and cocaine, $990,000 per week.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the social harm cost of using those drugs."</p>
        
            <p>Social harm includes things like hospital admissions, deaths and other factors, Chao said.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll definitely be costing us way more than the figures I've been giving you."</p>
