            <p>The improvement in the economy is looking set to be a bit of a slog, according to ANZ Bank's March survey.</p>
        
            <p>The survey's headline measure showed sentiment steady with a net 58 percent of firms expecting an improvement in the year ahead, while the more closely followed measure of businesses' own outlooks improved four points to 49 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Chief economist Sharon Zollner said firms showed that conditions were getting better, but it was not easy.</p>
        
            <p>"Firms remain confident that better times lie ahead and are positioning themselves to take advantage of that as best they can, but many remain hampered by poor cash-flow."</p>
        
            <p>She said a broad based improvement in activity and employment had been noted, while profits were expected to head higher, and export and investment intentions were steady and positive.</p>
        
            <p>But firms expected higher costs and to have to raise their prices, while inflation expectations edged higher to 2.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The lift in inflation indicators is becoming a little disconcerting," Zollner said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the bank had downplayed the warnings from such figures in 2021, although conditions then much different with people and goods turning scarce all over the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's flurry of inflation pressure is much more likely to reflect raw material prices, energy prices, and the weaker currency."</p>
        
            <p>"That's not comfortable for firms, but it's much less likely to become persistent," Zollner said.</p>
        
            <p>She said inflation indicators would influence the Reserve Bank's enthusiasm for continued cuts in the Official Cash Rate.</p>
        
            <p>"A cut next month looks assured and a follow-up in May looks highly likely, but a third in July is more of a coin toss at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>The ANZ's questions on what worried firms showed problems of competition and low turnover remained dominant while interest rates were fading as a problem, while the outlook for tariffs was a minority issue, as was the weakness in the currency.</p>
