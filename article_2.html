        <h2>Cheaper raised pedestrian crossings for Auckland</h2>
        <p>
Auckland Transport is rolling out a new, cheaper approach to raised pedestrian crossings after facing heavy criticism over costly installations.

            <p>Auckland Transport is rolling out a new, cheaper approach to raised pedestrian crossings after facing heavy criticism over costly installations.</p>
        
            <p>The AT board, at its first meeting last month, heard that a recent review of pedestrian safety found that a previous one-sized-fits all approach had dominated, and was costing ratepayers too much.</p>
        
            <p>This was despite having a range of other affordable solutions available.</p>

            <p>AT had come under fire for spending too much on raised pedestrian crossings, including from Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown.</p>
        
            <p>AT infrastructure and place director Murray Burt said they were now looking at more affordable measures.</p>
        
            <p>"This year we started investigating a new approach [at the end of January] and undertook a review into raised crossings," Burt said.</p>
        
            <p>AT was now adopting new practises to deliver raised crossings at a lower cost, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A recent project at Kumeū, where pre-cast units were used, cost ratepayers $35,000 - approximately 10 percent cheaper than the old way.</p>
        
            <p>The crossing was part of the State Highway 16 access road upgrade project, at the car park of the Main Rd shops.</p>
        
            <p>The pre-cast unit was installed in one night, rather than over several days.</p>
        
            <p>"We saved money due to the speed at which it was installed. The installation was just one night, versus the usual raised crossing which would take a week or two to install."</p>
        
            <p>Burt said the pre-casts were laid out from 9pm, and work was completed by 5am. It opened to traffic that morning.</p>
        
            <p>"AT is now investigating opportunities to roll out this approach more broadly wherever possible."</p>
        
            <p>He said 22 other crossings have been identified as suitable for the same approach.</p>
        
            <p>Fulton Hogan's national innovation lead Beaudene Pumipi, in a social media post about the Kumeū project, said pre-casting had health and safety benefits in construction.</p>
        
            <p>It had lower carbon emissions and largely negated the vagaries of the weather, being manufactured in a controlled environment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's growing interest in how New Zealand can produce speed tables and other concrete road structures more efficiently and effectively."</p>
        
            <p>Burt said their review of raised crossings estimated a reduction of around 30 percent these were required, compared to the current pipeline of projects.</p>
        
            <p>"In all cases alternative safety measures will be considered to achieve the same outcomes and be monitored closely.</p>
        
            <p>"Examples of this may include signalised crossings and other speed calming measures."</p>
        
            <p>AT's priority was to keep people safe as they move across Auckland, balanced against the cost of work to do so, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past five years, 2035 pedestrians have been killed or seriously injured trying to cross the road or walking on footpaths.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that raised crossing facilities reduce the likelihood of a death or serious injury."</p>
