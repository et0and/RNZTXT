        <p>
One pair of boots languished at Greg Fox's shop for four years before the owner came to collect. Audio

            <p>A Dunedin cobbler is counting down the days to when he hangs up his tools one last time.</p>
        
            <p>Greg Fox has been repairing shoes, bags, belts and even motorcycle leathers at Country Cobbler in Dunedin's Mornington for the past 25 years.</p>
        
            <p>He has been looking for a buyer for his business and also hoping the owners of the mountain of unclaimed shoes make it back to collect them in time before his door closes.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan is if I can't sell it I'll just pack up and take everything home with me, and that's the sort of finish really of the Country Cobbler."</p>
        
            <p>Fox said he was closing the business because he was 67 and wanted to retire to spend more time with his grandchildren and do some travelling.</p>
        
            <p>"Time to go, time to go and enjoy you know the rest of what we've got left and enjoy life."</p>
        
            <p>There were still a few other cobblers in Dunedin, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a dying breed really, there used to be a lot of us years ago but now there's only about three [cobblers in Dunedin] I can count."</p>
        
            <p>One pair of boots belonging to a woman named Talia had been waiting to be collected from the shop for about four years, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He had tried to contact her several times to no avail, but Talia got in touch after spotting an Otago Daily Times story about the shop on the internet, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Talia contacted us and she's coming in next Wednesday to pick her boots up so it's a good ending to the story."</p>
        
            <p>The boots are knee-high and Talia told Fox she had bought them at an op shop and brought them in to get the heels done.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who bought the shop would not necessarily have to be experienced from the get-go, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Someone who got a bit of tuition, had steady hands and good eyesight would be able to pick up some of the basic skills reasonably easily, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If someone had an interest in having a little shop, and they weren't quite sure what to do, you could learn some of the basics you know, it would take a couple of weeks of practice and that and you could sort of offer a limited service, I mean sewing and things like that are a wee bit more involved."</p>
