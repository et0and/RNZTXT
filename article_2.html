            <p>Aged care workers rallying against potential roster changes say Bupa, which runs retirement homes across the country, needs to focus on care instead of money.</p>
        
            <p>Bupa has proposed a new roster system it said will ensure the delivery of care and services to residents at their homes, better matching staff skills to the needs of their residents.</p>
        
            <p>Union members rallied outside Bupa's headquarters in Auckland on Tuesday, chanting and waving signs calling for safe staffing.</p>
        
            <p>Former Bupa employee Ngahuia said patients needed to be put first.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop being about the money, be about the person," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're there for our kaumātua... What I want, I want change, I want Bupa to start looking at the person, making them the priority, forget about the money."</p>

            <p>Another protester Epenessa Mutimuti said workers were burnt out.</p>
        
            <p>"The care-givers and the nurses are looking [for] somewhere better than this," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Mutimuti said the situation was getting difficult.</p>
        
            <p>Bupa told RNZ the proposal would increase total rostered care hours available.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect most people to be able to pick up shifts to work additional hours if they wish, and our preference is to retain our people. We will continue to work closely with our team when we announce a final decision tomorrow," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge that change is challenging and we are supporting our people, including providing an extended period of time to submit feedback as part of the consultation process."</p>
