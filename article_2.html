            <p>Cast your mind back to 2022 when New Zealand was gripped by a game called Wordle.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa was even given special credit by creator Josh Wardle for being among its earliest adopters.</p>
        
            <p>"I should really do the maths because it's astounding," Wardle told RNZ of the game's Kiwi playerbase.</p>
        
            <p>In February 2022, Wordle was purchased by The New York Times for more than $1 million.</p>
