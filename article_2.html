            <p>Novak Djokovic has retired injured after losing the first set 7-6(5) against Alex Zverev on Friday to put the German through to his first Australian Open final.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev will meet the winner of the Jannik Sinner and Ben Shelton match in Sunday's decider as he bids for his first Grand Slam title.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic's long wait for a record 25th major title will go on, a year after he exited Melbourne Park with a semi-final loss to Sinner.</p>
        
            <p>There were doubts about his fitness ahead of the match and he came out at Rod Laver Arena with his left thigh strapped.</p>
        
            <p>But there was little indication Djokovic was struggling until late in the set when he noticeably began trudging slowly between points and muttering in frustration at his players' box.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the set, he promptly informed Zverev that he could not go on and shook hands with the chair umpire before exiting to a chorus of boos from the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"The very first thing I want to say is, please guys, don't boo a player when he goes out with injury," Zverev said in his on-court interview.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that everybody paid for tickets and wants to see hopefully a five-set match.</p>
        
            <p>"He has won this tournament with an abdominal tear, won this tournament with a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>"So please show some respect."</p>
