            <p>New Zealand-born actress Anna Sawai has won an Emmy for her lead role in the critically acclaimed historical drama Shōgun.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old actress made history by becoming the first Japanese actress to win an Emmy in her category, alongside her co-star Hiroyuki Sanada, who took out the best leading actor in a drama award.</p>
        
            <p>She beat out Carrie Coon (The Gilded Age), Imelda Staunton (The Crown), Jennifer Aniston (The Morning Show), Maya Erskine (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) and Reese Witherspoon (The Morning Show).</p>
        
            <p>Tearful as she took to the stage, she paid tribute to her mother.</p>
        
            <p>"I was crying before my name was announced, I am a mess today," Sawai said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to my family, Mom. I love you. You are the reason I'm here. You showed me stoicism, and that's how I was able to portray Mariko. This is to all the women who expect nothing and continue to be an example for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>She also thanked fellow nominees, her co-stars, and the show's crew.</p>

            <p>Shōgun, an adaptation of James Clavell's bestselling novel, follows a British sailor after his ship washes ashore a Japanese fishing village in the year 1600. It was reportedly Disney-owned FX's most expensive series to create.</p>
        
            <p>Sawai played the role of Toda Mariko, a poised and mysterious woman who serves as the translator for Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada).</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if I've seen anything that, as a Japanese person,  could say, 'That is accurate'," she told Town and Country. "Reading Mariko's story just really spoke to me so much, and I knew that she was the character that I needed to play."</p>
        
            <p>She told Billboard, before the ceremony, that it was one of the most mentally challenging roles she has had to play.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just the stunts, it's wearing the costumes, that's already physically tough ... I was dreaming nightmares, so yeah, it was a lot."</p>
        
            <p>The show had the most nominations, 25, this year and was poised to be the frontrunner since the announcement of the candidates. It had already won 14 Emmys at the Creative Arts Awards the night before and took out the coveted best drama series title today.</p>
        
            <p>Sawai - a first-time nominee - told Seth Meyers in July that she was excited ahead of the nomination announcements but didn't think she would be in the list.</p>

            <p>The Pachinko actress had spent two years in New Zealand after being born here in 1992.</p>
        
            <p>Her father's electronics company job saw the family move around the Pacific during her childhood, before settling in Japan at the age of 10. She previously told Stuff that she still identifies as a Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>She was also in a Japanese pop girl group before she got into acting.</p>
