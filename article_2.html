            <p>New Zealand's first AI-generated television advertisement has aired, but is the country ready to handle the legal implications of artificial intelligence in advertising?</p>
        
            <p>The advertisement is for Bremworth Wool Carpets New Zealand, and featured a woman with dark hair intertwined with cloud-like tufts of wool and images of sweeping landscapes that could be Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"We are proud to share our new TV commercial, believed to be the first time a complete TVC has been created visually by AI for broadcast in NZ," Bremworth chief brand and product officer Rochelle Flint wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"The use of AI has opened up new possibilities, allowing us to experiment with more innovative and interesting campaign content while reducing both time and cost.</p>
        
            <p>"For our Crafted Feels Different campaign, it has allowed us to develop a beautiful video asset without real world creative constraints, within less time and for less money vs if we had created it via a traditional method.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost savings from the production have been reinvested into local media platforms, extending our reach by an estimated 1.7 million views.</p>
        
            <p>"The new campaign is live on NZ television networks, TV on demand and digital media platforms."</p>
        
            <p>But is New Zealand law ready for this new world of completely AI-generated TV commercials?</p>
        
            <p>While intellectual property lawyer Narly Kalupahana told Checkpoint the legislation had not kept up with the technology, there was enough in New Zealand law to clarify some aspects.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Copyright Law does provide for a computer-generated work to have copyright, as long as a person is effectively instructing it properly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, art that is computer-generated belonged to "the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken would be the author", Kalupahana added.</p>
        
            <p>He said most people would say that was the person that fed in the prompts to the AI model or the AI engine.</p>
        
            <p>He also said it was a matter of time before it was tested in the courts.</p>
        
            <p>The Fair Trading Act, Section 13, also covered misleading representations as to endorsement.</p>
        
            <p>"So if you're creating an ad that's got a fake Brad Pitt, and someone would be confused into thinking, actually, that looks like Brad Pitt probably endorsed that or he's behind it, then it's quite likely that's a breach of the Fair Trading Act."</p>
        
            <p>But in terms of general personality rights, "New Zealand doesn't have great laws to protect individual personality rights", Kalupahana said.</p>
        
            <p>"The US is much further ahead than us. The US has actually codified personality rights, so a person has very clear rights to their image and the representation."</p>
        
            <p>Kalupahana said there was also no requirement to declare whether something is AI-generated.</p>
