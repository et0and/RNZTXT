            <p>The coalition has announced Roads of Regional Significance and all decisions around the scope and delivery of the projects has been delegated to the Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland on Monday, Transport Minister Simeon Brown said he and the Finance Minister had agreed to the change in ministerial powers because in the past it has led to delays and scope creep.</p>

            <p>Brown said there would be no additional Crown funding.</p>
        
            <p>The regional projects announced are: Penlink, Waihoehoe Road, State Highway 1 Papakura to Drury, the State Highway 1 and 29 intersection, State Highway 58 improvements, Melling, a Queenstown package and three Canterbury packages.</p>
