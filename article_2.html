            <p>A public memorial service will be held on the banks of the Ōtākaro Avon River to mark the 14th anniversary of Christchurch's deadly 2011 earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>A minute's silence will be held at 12.51pm - the moment the magnitude 6.3 quake struck on 22 February - to remember the 185 people who lost their lives.</p>
        
            <p>Each of their names will be read aloud as the HMNZS Canterbury bell tolls, at the Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Phil Mauger will lay a wreath at the memorial wall, with members of the public invited to lay floral tributes at the ceremony's conclusion.</p>
        
            <p>People have been urged to plan ahead when visiting the area, with central city road closures in place for a Navy parade and the Electric Avenue music festival.</p>
