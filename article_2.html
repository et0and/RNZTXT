            <p>The small West Australian town of Paraburdoo hit its highest recorded temperature of 47.9C on Saturday, passing a record previously set in 1998.</p>
        
            <p>It comes amid an extreme heatwave in parts of the Pilbara region, with some areas forecast to get close to 50C.</p>
        
            <p>The heatwave is expected to continue until Tuesday and residents throughout the Shire of Ashburton, north Gascoyne and Midwest have been urged to take necessary precautions.</p>

            <p>A Bureau of Meteorology map showing the three-day heatwave situation for Western Australia, issued on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>With a forecast for 48C today, Paraburdoo, which sits 1500km north of Perth and has a population of 1300, could break its record twice in one weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Shire of Ashburton president Audra Smith said it was troubling the town's heat record could be broken multiple times within a couple of days.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a concern because with what's happening with global warming," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned about this heatwave but we are constantly monitoring the weather and keeping people up to date with our webpage."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said residents of Paraburdoo were familiar with extreme heat but urged people to be mindful.</p>
        
            <p>"I've spoken to a few businesses the last couple days," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What they do, especially the businesses with outdoor workers, they talk to them about the dangers of being out in the heatwave.</p>
        
            <p>"They monitor all their staff and if they are outdoors they give them cool breaks, so they'll have cars running with air-conditioning so the staff can cool."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said other strategies included rotating staff and doing physical work earlier in the day when the weather was cooler.</p>
        
            <p>While 50C had not yet been officially recorded, a Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) spokesperson said it was possible it could occur in areas that did not have measuring stations.</p>
        
            <p>Francis Khong has lived in Paraburdoo for 24 years and said he was used to dealing with the heat.</p>
        
            <p>"When you know that it's going to be hot, you stay indoors," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"For me it feels the same but maybe I've been here too long.</p>
        
            <p>"People go to the pool or they just stay home. You don't go out unless you are working."</p>
        
            <p>Khong said it was likely to be hotter in areas where officially BOM measurements were not taken.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe the mine is 10 degrees hotter in the open pit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever it is now, it's 10 degrees hotter in the open pit."</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, the Pilbara town of Onslow equalled the highest ever official temperature record of 50.7C, which was also recorded in Oodnadatta, South Australia, in January 1960.</p>
