            <p>A second person has died after being rescued from a house fire in Ōtaki on the Kāpiti Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A blaze broke out at a property on State Highway 1 just north of the town on Sunday night and firefighters arrived to find a bedroom alight.</p>
        
            <p>A whānau member, Evey Keefe-Torea, announced on Facebook "with deep sadness" that those who died were her uncle and aunty.</p>
        
            <p>Her uncle, Earl Robert Stuart, died on Monday, and her aunty, Ngamata-A-Tumu Stuart, "passed peacefully in the presence of her family" on Tuesday, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask that you please be patient whanau as we navigate through this mamae."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said crews pulled both occupants out of the house, and they were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, police confirmed one person had since died, while the other was in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, police said the second person had also died.</p>
        
            <p>"The scene examination has been completed and the initial report from fire investigators indicates the fire was not suspicious," police said.</p>
        
            <p>On hearing the news of the first person's death, Kāpiti mayor Janet Holborow said the community would be hurting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a tragic loss of life, and such a traumatic event," she said. "Ōtaki is a tight-knit community, so this will have an impact on neighbours, the wider community."</p>
        
            <p>The community would come together to support the affected whānau, Holborow said.</p>
        
            <p>She commended the firefighters who acted quickly to pull the pair out of the burning house.</p>
