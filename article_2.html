            <p>After a night of heavy rain in much of the country, Thursday is promising another day of severe weather with thunderstorms, wind and snow forecast.</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty had the worst of the weather overnight, MetService Duty forecaster Heath Gullery said.</p>
        
            <p>Taranki had 100-150mm of rain while Tasman had up to 250mm in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>MetService's rain radar showed the rain band moving across the upper North Island and the centre of the country early Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In the afternoon, up to two months' worth of rainfall could hit in parts of the South Island, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said .</p>
        
            <p>NIWA forecaster Seth Carrier said Thursday would see "a plume of moisture coming down from the north", carrying heavy rain that could impact the Bay of Plenty and East Cape, before the heavier rain crops up in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>The MetService has issued a swath of warnings and watches.</p>
