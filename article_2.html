            <p>A British political stoush has erupted over the "great British institution" of sandwiches.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with Spectator magazine, Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch suggested sandwiches were not real food.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking of taking a lunch break she said: "lunch is for wimps".</p>
        
            <p>"I have food brought in and I work and eat at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes I will get a steak... I'm not a sandwich person, I don't think sandwiches are a real food, it's what you have for breakfast."</p>
        
            <p>Badenoch was particularly against soggy bread.</p>
        
            <p>"I will not touch bread if it's moist," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In response, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told media the sandwich was a "great British institution".</p>
        
            <p>"I think he was surprised to hear that the leader of the opposition has a steak brought in for lunch.</p>
        
            <p>"The prime minister is quite happy with a sandwich lunch."</p>
        
            <p>Starmer enjoys a tuna sandwich and occasionally a cheese toastie, the spokesperson was reported as saying by Sky News.</p>
        
            <p>Reform leader Nigel Farage took to social media to weigh in on the debate.</p>
        
            <p>Appearing in a restaurant drinking a glass of red wine, Farage said he enjoyed lunch.</p>
        
            <p>But when he was short on time a sandwich in the office would do, he said.</p>
