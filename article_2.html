        <h2>Aussie takeover bid for The Warehouse falls through</h2>
        <p>
An Australian private equity group's takeover pitch for The Warehouse Group has fallen through, despite backing from the retail giant's founder Stephen Tindall.

Not enough of The Warehouse shareholders have supported a buyout attempt by an Australian firm, and the sale will not go ahead.

            <p>New Zealand's biggest listed retailer is not going ahead with a proposed takeover from an Australian private equity group.</p>
        
            <p>The Warehouse Group said the proposed $590 million takeover bid, which had backing from the retailer's founder Sir Stephen Tindall, did not have the required shareholder support.</p>
        
            <p>It said a key shareholder told the company it did not support the current terms by Adamantem Capital, meaning it would not have the required 75 percent approval from shareholders for the deal.</p>
        
            <p>The group, which is the owner of The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery and Noel Leeming, did not name the shareholder.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Stephen and the Tindall Foundation owned 48 percent of the Warehouse Group, while the James Pascoe Group (owner of Pascoes), owned nearly 20 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The current scheme of arrangement doesn't have the critical shareholder backing it needs to proceed," the group's chair Dame Joan Withers said.</p>
        
            <p>"With that in mind, the board has decided to defer further talks until such time as the proposal receives wider shareholder support."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Joan acknowledged the takeover interest from Adamantem Capital.</p>
        
            <p>"However, without broader shareholder support, it is not prudent for us to pursue this proposal further," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're committed to acting in the best interest of all our shareholders. While the board has not yet formed a view on value, we're open to continue discussions if a further proposal generates shareholder support sufficient to make its execution viable."</p>
