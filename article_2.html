            <p>Two park benches at a South Auckland park will be removed as planned, despite mixed reactions from residents and criticism over the lack of consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the Manurewa Local Board, on advice from Auckland Transport (AT), decided to remove two benches at Randwick Park after nearby residents raised concerns about anti-social behaviour by some users.</p>
        
            <p>A resident told Local Democracy Reporting she had complained to council after witnessing indecent acts at the benches.</p>
        
            <p>However, the decision to remove the benches faced criticism from the community, who complained about the lack of consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Local board chairperson Matt Winiata said there was a lack of clear information given to them from AT.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to trust that advice we receive relating to delivery, removal or destruction of assets is based on thorough investigation and consultation with the community this is taking place within," Winiata said.</p>
        
            <p>"The situation presented to the board seemed straightforward and direction was given in September, leading to the resolution in October."</p>
        
            <p>Winiata said it wasn't the first time AT had presented the board with a project based on little to no consultation.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it brings to light the troubles we face when a resident is distraught with a situation that requires action and the greater community disagrees with the outcome."</p>
        
            <p>During a local board workshop last week, Winiata said the removal would go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not prepared to go and undo that resolution, because I don't like to set a precedence for going backwards and forwards on things.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it sets the precedence for AT to do more consultation and due diligence around these things, to ensure if its being done, its being done right."</p>

            <p>An AT spokesperson said whether the benches would be removed or not was a decision for the local board.</p>
        
            <p>"We have provided the local board with thorough information and will continue to work with them closely to ensure that they can make a well-informed decision."</p>
        
            <p>The benches, on Magic Way, faced away from the park and directly into the roadway and into residential properties.</p>
        
            <p>A resident, who didn't want to be named for safety reasons, said she's complained to council for years about the inappropriate behaviour by some users.</p>
        
            <p>She said at one time, boys sitting on the bench touched themselves inappropriately and made suggestive gestures and remarks to her while she was cleaning her home.</p>
        
            <p>"I was so embarrassed ... they were my kid's age," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Randwick Park Residents Association's Dave Tims spoke out about the removal, saying the benches' removal wouldn't stop the anti-social behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"These park benches are frequently used by our elderly community members, who enjoy sitting together and chatting. They often greet me warmly as I walk by," Tims said.</p>
        
            <p>"Contrary to being a source of disruptive behaviour, these benches foster a positive and welcoming environment."</p>
