        <h2>China ship saga a 'failure' in China-NZ relationship, Peters says after talks</h2>
        <p>
Live-fire naval exercises in the Tasman sea dominated talks between Foreign Minister Winston Peters and his counterpart in Beijing.
</p>
        
            <p>A lack of a sufficient warning from China about its live-fire naval exercises in the Tasman sea has been labelled a failure in the New Zealand-China relationship, by the Foreign Minister Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>The issue of China's three navy ships being in the Tasman Sea and conducting live exercises, has dominated talks between Peters and his counterpart in Beijing overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Peters says while he didn't seek any assurances or explanations about what China was doing in the Tasman, noting it had a right to be there under the laws of the sea, concern about a lack of notice was raised with his counterpart Wang Yi, particularly as the exercises prompted civil aviation flights to be changed.</p>

            <p>"We placed it in the context of, look, we've had this special relationship which has first begun in 2008 and expanded upon. We are now [in the] second decade of this arrangement and this is a failure in it at this time and we'd like to have it corrected into the future."</p>
        
            <p>When asked exactly what the failure was, Peters replied: "The failure to give us adequate notice".</p>
        
            <p>Peters says for two countries with a serious partnership New Zealand would have expected to have notice.</p>
        
            <p>He says New Zealand believes China is considering doing that in future.</p>

            <p>In response to the concerns raised in Australia earlier this week China had claimed the ships issue was being deliberately hyped and it had issued warnings for aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the issue of the Cook Island signing agreements China was also raised, with New Zealand focusing on reminding China that the Cooks as a realm country has a different constitutional arrangement than other Pacific countries China might be dealing with.</p>
        
            <p>Other issues that were raised included future trade opportunities, China's possible entry into the CPTPP trade agreement, the impact of the Trump White House on global affairs, Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
