            <p>Dame Lydia Ko has raced back into contention at the halfway mark of the LPGA Tournament of Champions in Orlando, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand golfer yesterday finished her opening round eight shots off the lead after a one-over-par 73, which left her 28th equal on the leaderboard in her first start for the year.</p>
        
            <p>But Ko has gained 21 places to sit at seventh on the leaderboard after firing 67 in the second round, six shots back from leader A Lim Kim of South Korea.</p>
        
            <p>Kim maintained her lead after firing a second-round 69 to be 10 under for the tournament. Linn Grant of Sweden is three shots off the pace, in second.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday marked 20 years since 17-year-old Ko became the youngest golfer in men's or women's golf history to be ranked No. 1 in the world.</p>
        
            <p>As an amateur, she was the top-ranked woman amateur golfer in the world for 130 weeks and never missed a cut in 25 professional tournaments.</p>
        
            <p>Ko is currently ranked number two in the world off the back of a stunning 2024, which included a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, earning her a place in golf's Hall of Fame and the British Open title.</p>
