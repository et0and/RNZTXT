            <p>New Zealand chef de mission Nigel Avery says they are extremely disappointed following the spying controversy involving the Football Ferns at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened on Monday in France, but the scandal erupted on Wednesday when it was revealed Canada were caught flying a drone over the Ferns' training session in Saint Etienne.</p>
        
            <p>A Canadian non-accredited support staff member who operated the drone was detained by police after New Zealand management reported the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Olympic Committee (NZOC) formally lodged the incident with the IOC integrity unit and has asked Canada for a full review.</p>
        
            <p>"We're shocked and this is an incident that goes against everything we stand for," Avery told a media conference in Paris today.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not a topic we want to be talking about."</p>
        
            <p>Avery said the Football Ferns were concerned what information may have been gained by the drone coverage.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns play the defending champion Canadians in their opening game in Saint Etienne on Friday morning (3am NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't had a smooth build-up and this is something they have to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>"To say it's an unwanted distraction is an understatement."</p>
        
            <p>Avery said they had been working with the Canada Olympic Committee who told him they were "shocked and deeply embarrassed".</p>
        
            <p>He said both the Football Ferns and the Canadian team are "victims".</p>
        
            <p>"We can't take that back for what should be a momentous occasion for them, particularly the first time Olympians, it is going to be a different experience for them and we're very sad for that as well."</p>
        
            <p>Team Canada has issued an apology and confirmed they have started an investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about any potential sanctions, Avery said:</p>
        
            <p>"Clearly New Zealand Football are very invested in this and they will have some wishes, but it's quite complex, it's about jurisdiction and clearly it wasn't in the field of play so we've asked Canada to investigate further. I think it would be wrong for us to speculate on what sanctions might be."</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns know of five minutes of footage which is with the police.</p>
        
            <p>Avery said the NZOC had not considered looking into security around any of the teams' training venues due to the incident, "but I believe once there is a wider awareness of this, the team sports [rugby sevens, hockey] will be considering looking at what they do".</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns have also been dealt another blow, with the loss of their captain to injury on the eve of their first game of the Olympics. Football Ferns captain Ali Riley won't play at a fifth Olympic Games after being withdrawn on medical grounds.</p>
