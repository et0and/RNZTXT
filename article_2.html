        <h2>Fast-track Bill could boost resilience to natural disasters - insurers</h2>
        <p>
Insurance Council New Zealand chief executive Kris Faafoi said the council "especially support the establishment of a fast-track pathway for projects which bolster adaptation, resilience and recovery…

            <p>The Fast-Track Approvals process has the potential to boost resilience to natural disasters - but at the same time, projects must not increase that risk, insurers say.</p>
        
            <p>But it was "critical" that such initiatives did not "inadvertently exacerbate risks to communities", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The sector wants insurance to stay affordable and accessible in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Under the Fast-track Approvals Bill, companies would be able to apply to bypass consent processes, with three ministers - Shane Jones, Chris Bishop and Simeon Brown - having the final say over their projects.</p>
        
            <p>Faafoi said if the bill was passed, the consideration of "natural hazard risk reduction and the resilience of communities" would need to be central to the decision-making process.</p>
        
            <p>The Insurance Council made a submission to the bill and appeared at a select committee hearing on the matter last week.</p>
        
            <p>Faafoi said the sector had made some suggestions about certain information that should be part of developers' applications.</p>
        
            <p>It should be feasible for applications to be declined if the three ministers "see fit, if the natural hazard risk is too high", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We really want to make sure this is done in a wise way."</p>
        
            <p>The Fast-track Approvals Bill has been described as a "one stop shop" to gain quick approval for nationally or regionally important infrastructure or developments. It would sit above 10 different Acts and regulations, including the Resource Management Act.</p>
        
            <p>The bill has been met with mixed reactions, and last weekend, thousands marched against it in protest. Forest and Bird chief executive Nicola Toki has called it an "environmental nightmare".</p>
        
            <p>However, Eden Park's operators have welcomed it, saying it could be used to "streamline" consent for the stadium to host more concerts and events.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Ngāi Tahu has asked for amendments to the bill to recognise the iwi's rangatiratanga and avoid costly legal battles with the Crown.</p>
