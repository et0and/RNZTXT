            <p>Auckland's Lex Revell-Lewis has finally taken down the longstanding 400m national record, becoming the first Kiwi to dip under 46 seconds for one circuit of a standard athletics track.</p>
        
            <p>After several close calls throughout the NZ summer, Revell-Lewis finally achieved the feat at an Athletics Victoria meet in Melbourne, clocking 45.88 seconds, as he won his division by almost a full second from three-time Sri Lankan champion Aruna Dharshana, who has a personal best time below 45 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The previous national record stood at 46.09 seconds, set by Cantabrian Shaun Farrell in 1998, and the Waitākere speedster had six previous attempts within three-tenths of a second this season, including a 46.10 seconds at the Sydney Track Classic two weeks ago and 46.11 seconds at Wellington's Capital Classic in January.</p>
        
            <p>Revell-Lewis, 21, crossed the Tasman in the hope of competing at the prestigious Maurie Plant Meet on Saturday night, but was edged out of the field by the arrival of a high-powered Botswanan contingent, including Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, he fronted for a club event the next day and delivered his groundbreaking performance in more modest circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>The two-time national champion will now tailor his training towards races in Europe and the World University Games at Rhine-Ruhr, Germany in July.</p>
