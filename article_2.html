            <p>A charity providing counselling helplines and support for families, said funding cuts to social services this year will be particularly felt over Christmas, when there is a uptick in needs.</p>
        
            <p>Presbyterian Support Northern, which runs Lifeline, and Shine (a helpline for victims of family violence), said it was expecting a 30 percent surge in women seeking refuge over the holiday season.</p>
        
            <p>Its general manager of social services Grenville Hendricks said the number of people seeking help from Lifeline is also expected to increase by 10 to 20 percent over Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Hendricks said the holiday period can be a stressful time, particularly this year when many are facing financial pressure and unemployment.</p>
        
            <p>He said the charity's social services arm, which mostly relies on government funding, has had its funding cut by $1.5 million this year - with the biggest cuts coming from Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>This means 800 fewer whƒÅnau will be served, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hendricks said Lifeline will continue to provide a 24/7 service over Christmas, however he was wary that the sector is stretched as many charities like theirs are struggling.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of services have had cuts, or reductions in the services they can afford... so people would be experiencing those services, either they're not available or they're in a reduced capacity, and so people would be feeling more worried, more anxious, more concerned about how they can provide for themselves and their children, and that's a very real issue around Christmas time."</p>
        
            <p>In August, Oranga Tamariki announced funding cuts to service providers supporting vulnerable children, youth and families.</p>
        
            <p>The contracts of 190 providers were set to be discontinued and more than 142 providers would have their funding reduced.</p>
