        <h2>Canterbury hospitals on notice to cut spending by $13m by June</h2>
        <p>
The senior leadership team has already held a workshop "to identify local opportunities", leaked documents show.
</p>
        
            <p>Leaked documents reveal hospital services in Canterbury have been ordered to slash more than $13m in spending in the next two months as part of a nationwide cost-cutting drive.</p>
        
            <p>Last week RNZ revealed Health New Zealand / Te Whatu Ora has directed hospitals to make a range of cost-cutting moves before the end of the financial year, including banning overtime and not replacing sick staff.</p>
        
            <p>The documents, sent anonymously to health researcher Dr Michael Gousmett, showed Waitaha Canterbury had been allocated a "financial sustainability target" of $13.3 million before 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>The senior leadership team had already held a workshop "to identify local opportunities" and was meeting with several teams to "identify future opportunities".</p>

            <p>"Only so much can be achieved in the next two months, we will be establishing a district focus on continuous performance improvement."</p>
        
            <p>A weekly steering group would be accountable for delivering "Continuous Improvement and Financial Sustainability".</p>
        
            <p>Dr Gousmett was told the project was being led by the consultancy firm, PwC.</p>
        
            <p>The Association of Salaried Medical Specialists - which represents senior hospital doctors - said similar directives had gone to every region.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, Te Whatu Ora said there had been no cuts to budgets while confirming PWC has been contracted nationally on a temporary basis, "around best operational practice and delivering efficiencies where possible".</p>
        
            <p>"This includes providing additional capacity in the local finance function at Waitaha while its restructure is underway," national director of hospital and specialist services Fionnagh Dougan said.</p>
        
            <p>The Waitaha document refers to the national directive, including a focus on reducing overtime and allowances, improving leave management and clinical supply practices, limiting the use of outsourced personnel and resources, stopping or delaying "non-critical projects" and improving revenue generation, such as invoicing ACC promptly.</p>
        
            <p>It has also been instructed:</p>
        
            <p>Potential areas for saving include implementing "standardised clinical pathways" for discharging patients, using AI to reduce administration and employing telemedicine and remote monitoring where possible.</p>
        
            <p>Dougan told RNZ clinicians and managers in Waitaha were also working collaboratively on financial sustainability initiatives to ensure money was spent where it was most needed on delivering healthcare services.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect local managers to use their judgement to make decisions in their own settings. All Health NZ areas are being asked to do the same."</p>
