            <p>Street dining in Tauranga will soon cost businesses across the city instead of just some in the centre of town.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses on The Strand and Wharf Street pay between $100-$160 per square metre each year to use the street. This has been reduced by 80 percent because of the disruption caused by construction and redevelopment of the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>This 20 percent fee of $30 to $32 per square metre will be applied to all businesses using the footpath for street dining from July 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The decision was made at a Tauranga City Council strategy finance and risk committee meeting on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Stephen Selwood said street dining constrained footpath use but added "fantastic vibrancy".</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of value that is brought by having ground dining.</p>
        
            <p>"Businesses who are raising a commercial return out of using a facility should pay for it."</p>
        
            <p>He said the city centre paying but Mount Maunganui being free was "a bit skew-whiff".</p>
        
            <p>The 20 percent fee should be introduced to the Mount and then all areas be phased up to 100 percent fees from 2025, Selwood said.</p>
        
            <p>"That would mean the main areas of the city are paying the same amount, which I think is fair and equitable."</p>
        
            <p>Current revenue from the business paying the discounted fees was around 18,000 a year or $700 per business.</p>
        
            <p>Business representatives expressed their concerns about the policy during hearings in November.</p>

            <p>Downtown Tauranga chair Ashleigh Gee said they should be focusing on how to make it easier for businesses, not adding extra charges.</p>
        
            <p>"Considering the overall goal of increasing arts, culture and vibrancy for our region, [this] needs to be considered between developing further regulations on the hospitality industry.</p>
        
            <p>"This industry is one of the main drawcards for our tourists."</p>
        
            <p>Mount Business Association representative Claudia West said if the charges were high business would need to reconsider what they offered or pass the charge on to customers.</p>
        
            <p>"If higher charges come in for businesses, this would have a massive impact on the look and feel of our main street."</p>
        
            <p>The Mount shopping area was also seasonal and weather dependent but businesses would have to pay to use the footpath year round, said West.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff recommended the Street Use Policy also charged businesses for using balcony space for dining but this was opposed by the committee.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Shadrach Rolleston said there were two or three businesses around the city that used balcony space so it wasn't a "big issue".</p>
        
            <p>Selwood said he did not want to proceed with it because it would make almost no contribution to ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>The committee opted to make balcony dining free for businesses throughout Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>They also chose to promote smoke and vape-free street dining as opposed to requiring new businesses be smoke-free from 1 March 2024 like the staff recommended.</p>

            <p>Commission chair Anne Tolley said: "I'm an ex-smoker and I can't stand it when I'm eating to have someone blowing smoke across the front of me and they tend to be out on the street. So I understand people wanting, not wanting to have that."</p>
        
            <p>She questioned if they wanted to prohibit it.</p>
        
            <p>Committee member Rohario Murray said she was all for smoke-free dining facilities but her preference was for restaurants to display if they were smoke-free.</p>
        
            <p>"Then patrons have the opportunity to decide whether they would like to eat there based on the fact that it is smoke-free."</p>
        
            <p>The policy also looked at whether artificial grass should be used on berms. The committee decided to decline applications for new artificial grass on berms.</p>
        
            <p>Tolley said this was so it would not affect those who already had it.</p>
        
            <p>"There may well be some elderly people for whom it's just not practical to go and put grass down."</p>
        
            <p>The street dining charges will come into effect from July 2024 and the committee made provision for the charges to be reduced or increased when required.</p>
