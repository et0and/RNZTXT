        <h2>Man who has spent half his life locked cleared to make Supreme Court appeal</h2>
        <p>
The man has never stood trial, but has been detained for 18 years because he is considered too dangerous to release.

The Supreme Court says the man's mother can appeal an earlier decision by the Court of Appeal.

            <p>An autistic and intellectually disabled man who has spent half his life locked away has been granted leave to take his case to the Supreme Court.</p>
        
            <p>The man, whose name is suppressed, has been detained under the Intellectual Disability Compulsory Care and Rehabilitation Act for 18 years because he is considered too dangerous to release.</p>
        
            <p>The Court of Appeal last year called the man's offending minor but ruled his detention was justified because multiple experts say he poses a very high risk to the public if released.</p>
        
            <p>Now the Supreme Court says his mother may appeal that decision.</p>
        
            <p>His mother's lawyer Tony Ellis argues his detention is arbitrary and breaches human rights.</p>
