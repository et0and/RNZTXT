            <p>The Health and Disability Commissioner has criticised a pharmacist for not providing enough information to Rory Nairn before he received the Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old Dunedin plumber died on 17 November 2021, 12 days after he was vaccinated against the virus.</p>
        
            <p>A coronial inquest into the death in 2022 found his death was caused by myocarditis, defined as inflammation of the heart muscle.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Morag McDowell said he should have been told about the rare but serious risk of myocarditis and to watch out for any symptoms as part of safety-netting advice.</p>
        
            <p>While there was a breach of his right to be informed about the risks, she did not find the code had been breached.</p>
        
            <p>"She considered that there were significant mitigating factors in this case, including that official information sources did not make it adequately clear to vaccinators that consumers needed to be told about myocarditis prior to receiving the vaccination," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>But she noted that official guidance explicitly stated consumers must be advised about the symptoms, criticising the pharmacy for not picking this up and amending its processes.</p>
        
            <p>"The commissioner was also critical that the vaccinating pharmacist did not inform the consumer about myocarditis, and, in particular, the symptoms of myocarditis, as part of safety-netting advice," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>McDowell noted the pharmacy had changed its practice since his death so the risk of myocarditis was specifically discussed.</p>
        
            <p>She recommended that the pharmacy updated their informed consent processes and safety-netting advice for Covid-19 vaccines, sending their updated procedures to the commission within three months of the report.</p>
        
            <p>She recommended Te Whatu Ora considered updating its guidelines to clarify when providers should discuss the risks and symptoms of myocarditis along with other side-effects.</p>
        
            <p>"Lessons can be learned from this case about the fundamental importance, in the context of new vaccines and emerging risks, of explicit guidance to vaccinators about what information they must give to consumers."</p>
