        <h2>Watch: Founder of former govt lunch provider on Checkpoint</h2>
        <p>
Claire Kelly said her company had provided lunches to nine west Auckland schools, until the government switched to Compass this year.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expecting Associate Education Minister David Seymour to give the school lunch programme his "full attention" after Checkpoint revealed concerns from west Auckland schools about the lunches being late, inedible, repetitive, or failing to meet dietary restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Massey Primary school said Tuesday was the ninth day of having Pita Pit wraps, while Lincoln Heights Primary School said it had had butter chicken for the eleventh day in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon described these as teething problems.</p>
        
            <p>"David Seymour will work his way through those issues and he's minister responsible for it and I expect he will and I know that he's well aware of the challenges and working his way through what have been some teething issues up front but he will work his way through that."</p>
        
            <p>He said Seymour was "accountable for delivering" and Luxon had no doubt he would be able to.</p>

            <p>The two had discussed the problems, Luxon said. "I think he knows exactly what needs to happen."</p>
        
            <p>While parts of the programme were being delivered well there had been problems with being on time and meeting the contract, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"David will be giving it his full court and full attention and I expect him to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Compass Group boss Paul Harvey told Checkpoint it was "mission critical" to meet their key performance indicators.</p>
        
            <p>The founder of Lunch with Crunch, Claire Kelly, said her company had provided lunches to nine west Auckland schools - including Lincoln Heights and Massey - until the government had switched to Compass this year.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly will be speaking to Susana Lei'ataua in the Auckland studio.</p>
