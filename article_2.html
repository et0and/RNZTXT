            <p>More information about the case of Alexandra's mysteriously appearing milk has come to light, with in-depth analysis of security camera footage revealing who the flavoured milk fanatic could be.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ on Thursday reported on the strange happenings in the small South Island community where, every few days, flavoured milk is left on top of a particular pump at an unattended self-service fuel stop.</p>
        
            <p>Since RNZ's exclusive report, RD Petroleum has reviewed CCTV footage from the MacLean Road site.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Craig Fitzgerald said it revealed one likely suspect.</p>
        
            <p>"The main culprit, I believe, is a delivery driver. So he rocks up early in the morning, and later in the evening ... and gets his diesel and leaves his two bottles on top of the pump."</p>
        
            <p>However, the mystery milk man's motive was still unclear.</p>

            <p>"We don't know why yet, we've got to talk to him about that," Fitzgerald said</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to say, because it's not like he's leaving full bottles as a gift, they're sort of half-drunk so I really don't know why he leaves them. Whether he drinks half a bottle of each one and then leaves them there because he doesn't want to take them home for rubbish or whatever, I don't know. It's a bit bizarre."</p>
        
            <p>Fitzgerald would not disclose which company the driver worked for, but said the footage also revealed other possible contenders.</p>
        
            <p>"Some young guys in a car pulled up and got out and put a bottle on the roof of the kiosk," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we trawled through the camera footage we'd probably find others, but I think that's probably what's happened - it's started and once word's got out, people are going down and adding theirs to it."</p>
        
            <p>However, he had a stern message for would-be copycats.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been funny and it is a bit of a laugh but just bear in mind that someone's got to get rid of the rubbish, so it'd be good if it could stop."</p>
        
            <p>That someone was a local contractor who kept the fuel stop tidy.</p>
        
            <p>Alexandra resident Poppy Prendergast earlier told RNZ the bottles disappeared within "anywhere from a couple of hours to a full day".</p>
        
            <p>
The bottles left included a range of different brands and some were full, while others were half empty.
