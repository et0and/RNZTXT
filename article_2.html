            <p>Incoming Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says a deal with New Zealand First and ACT is "very close".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he had a good meeting with NZ First and its leader Winston Peters today.</p>
        
            <p>He also spoke to ACT leader David Seymour on the phone.</p>
        
            <p>A deal was very close, he said.</p>
        
            <p>There were only a handful of issues left to work through, including showing ACT and NZ First the deals National had with them, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>He also signalled that all three party leaders intended to get together again this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Friday, Peters said coalition talks may be closer to the finish line than you may think, but a decision by the end of today would likely be a bit premature.</p>

            <p>"We are to form a long-term, stable, enduring government. And that's going to take a few more hours. I don't quite know when ... we're probably closer to the finish line than you guys think," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>However, a decision by the end of today would likely be "a bit premature".</p>
        
            <p>"We're still working on things," he said, and confirmed the discussions with National had not yet progressed to talking about portfolios.</p>
        
            <p>"Not quite, no ... I said so yesterday, and I'm saying it again today. One more time: Policy is the most important thing here."</p>
        
            <p>He said he had not thought about how the deal would be announced when it was complete, including whether that would come from all three leaders and the location of the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't discussed that and I wouldn't think I should be answering that anyway.</p>
        
            <p>"I know I should be able to answer that question but I haven't even thought about it. The main critical thing is what's in the deal ... some of the media don't seem to understand that in Germany these things can take months and months and months."</p>
        
            <p>A mini-budget would be able to be achieved before Christmas, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I can say that, yes. Not a mini-budget but an announcement that's related to it. I won't be a full Budget, that'll be in May next year."</p>
