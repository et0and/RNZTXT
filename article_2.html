        <h2>Inflation drops to 4 percent</h2>
        <p>
The annual inflation rate has fallen to its lowest in nearly three years.

            <p>
The Reserve Bank is confident inflation will be back in the 1-3 percent target band by the end of the year.

            <p>Stats NZ figures showed consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in the three months ended March, taking the annual inflation rate down to 4 percent from 4.7 percent - the lowest since June 2021.</p>
        
            <p>It is still above the Reserve Bank's February expectation of 3.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>However, domestic inflation pressures were stubborn and RBNZ made it clear inflation remained too high.</p>
        
            <p>It said last week it was confident inflation would be back in the 1-3 percent target band by the end of the year, but it would need to keep interest rates high in the meantime.</p>
        
            <p>For now, RBNZ has left its official cash rate unchanged at 5.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Economists had predicted a slight increase in the quarterly consumer price index of 0.6 percent, and the annual rate falling to 4 percent.</p>
