            <p>An insurance surveyor has completed their work on the HMNZS Manawanui, which sank two weeks ago off the south coast of Upolo, Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's Marine Pollution Advisory Committee said a contractor would now be selected to remove the remaining fuel from the vessel.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Navy ship was carrying 950 tonnes -- the equivalent of 950,000 litres - of fuel when it ran aground on the Tafitoala Reef on 6 October and sank the following day.</p>
        
            <p>Committee chair Fui Tupai Mau Simanu said salvaging the fuel was expected to start in mid-November and take about 20 days, depending on the weather.</p>
        
            <p>The committee reported up to 200,000 litres of diesel leaked from three places on the ship in the first week after it sank.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the New Zealand Defence Force said Kiwi and Samoan teams had worked from early Saturday late into the night to salvage an empty shipping container that came off the Manawanui.</p>
        
            <p>"This is challenging work, and yesterday the teams did a great job," NZDF senior national representative Commodore Andrew Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing with the container removal over the next few days, making sure that we are keeping people safe and with the protection of the environment in mind."</p>
        
            <p>Two other shipping containers came off the Manawanui when it sank. One was empty and one was carrying 3000kg of food.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said they would be floated, then towed to shore over the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>However, other salvage efforts around the Manawanui were being scaled back during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Samoa, which would get into full swing on Monday.</p>
