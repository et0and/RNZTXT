            <p>Staff at a reptile park are shell-ebrating after the return of their stolen tortoise.</p>
        
            <p>The 17-year-old male leopard tortoise was stolen - along with a green iguana - from Ti Point Reptile Point, near Leigh in north Auckland, between 19 and 20 March.</p>
        
            <p>Police appealed to the public for information, saying they had fears for the welfare of the stolen animals.</p>
        
            <p>There were concerns they would be sold illegally, police said.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, a Northland mother called the reptile park after her daughter was given a tortoise for her birthday.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was "reluctant to say who had made the gift", police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police were called and worked with DOC for the handover of the tortoise in Kaitaia's main street."</p>
        
            <p>The tortoise - identified as the one stolen from the reptile park - then made the nearly-300km journey home.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Dan McDermott said the stolen iguana was yet to be found and police were still trying to work out how the tortoise ended up in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>It is thought there is a black market breeding programme involving leopard tortoises, which are the fourth-largest tortoise in the world.</p>
        
            <p>They can reach weights of up to 40kg, but generally weigh between 10kg and 15kg.</p>
