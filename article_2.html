        <h2>Efeso Collins mural 'a source of healing and joy', wife says</h2>
        <p>
The community continues to mourn his loss, remembering him as a dedicated advocate and compassionate leader.
</p>
        
            <p>Vasa Fia Collins, widow of the late Green Party MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins, says that a newly created mural in her husband's memory has "become a source of healing and joy" for her and their daughters.</p>
        
            <p>The mural which was unveiled on Monday, is displayed prominently on the wall of the Auckland Transport Ronwood Ave car park building in Manukau City, facing Amersham Way.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative, spearheaded by EkePanuku Development Auckland, was presented to the Otara Local Board last month in conjunction with the one-year anniversary of Fa'anānā's untimely passing, which occurred during a charity run supporting local Pacific communities.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā is survived by his wife, Vasa, and their two daughters.</p>
        
            <p>The community continues to mourn his loss, remembering him as a dedicated advocate and compassionate leader who served as chairperson of the Otara Local Board.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ Pacific, Vasa expressed her gratitude for the mural, stating, "We are honoured, and this mural represents a blessing for our family.</p>
        
            <p>"We are deeply moved by the gift from Charles and Janine Williams (artists who painted the mural)," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their willingness to share their talents in such a meaningful way amazes me.</p>
        
            <p>"Beyond that, the mural has significantly impacted our daughters, becoming a source of healing and joy for my beloved girls. I can't thank Charles and Janine enough," she said.</p>

            <p>Local artists Charles and Janine, known for their distinctive style, brought the mural to life in collaboration with EkePanuku.</p>
        
            <p>The project took over a week to complete.</p>
        
            <p>Janine shared her reflections on their connection to the Collins family, saying, "We've felt overwhelmed, especially as artists.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't really understand the impact of the work you are doing.</p>
        
            <p>"To be able to join Vasa and process what mourning feels like, and to do that with art is a privilege; to allow someone to trust us to do that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The mural is designed to last for ten years, with the Williams committed to its upkeep.</p>
        
            <p>The Otara-Papatoetoe Local Board chairman Apulu Reece Autagavai said that EkePanuku had offered to undertake this project at no cost.</p>
        
            <p>"Fa'anānā had a heart for everyone, so of course, Otara would be special for him," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The mural, which is in a prominent position in Manukau, is a tribute to show that his heart was big enough for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"The saying that's on the mural is E Lē tū faamauga se tagata (meaning that 'No one succeeds alone, and no one suffers alone') is relevant to our people and his legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that every time you go through Manukau you see his beautiful smile, as we go into times when there's division, that message is needed more than ever," Apulu said.</p>

            <p>Vasa said Fa'anānā dedicated his life to serving the community, particularly young people, residents of South Auckland, Pacific peoples, and the most vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>"This mural project was crafted, driven, and led by the community, making it all the more special," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beautiful reciprocation of love that resonates with me because Efeso was truly a man 'for the people."</p>
        
            <p>The mural's location in Manukau recognises Fa'anānā's extensive work in the area, commemorating his generous spirit.</p>
        
            <p>During the mural's blessing, community leaders joined the ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Labour caucus member Barbara Edmonds said, "Looking at the mural takes your breath away and reminds us of the man he was.</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful to see people from all political stripes come together here, acknowledging that despite our differences, we worked towards the same goal for the aspirations of our Pacific people."</p>
        
            <p>Vasa said her husband's dedication to serving those in need, highlighted his love for the community.</p>
        
            <p>Vasa's sister, Jodie Asafo, praised her sister for her resilience, who she said is "amazing and is doing well" since Fa'anānā's passing.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all proud of her," Asafo said.</p>
        
            <p>Vasa and her children plan to launch a foundation in Fa'anānā's memory that embodies his values and passions, continuing his legacy through community service.</p>
