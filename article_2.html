            <p>Police have met with Alan Hall, who spent 19 years after being wrongly convicted of murder, and apologised.</p>
        
            <p>Hall was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1985 for the murder of Arthur Easton, but acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2022 and paid $5 million in compensation.</p>
        
            <p>A key witness statement in the case was changed to remove the description of a man seen fleeing the scene as Māori, while Hall is pākehā.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said on Tuesday he had met with Hall and his family "and apologised on behalf of NZ Police for the shortcomings in our original investigation that led to his wrong conviction".</p>
        
            <p>"I am grateful to Alan and his family, who have been a great support to him, for meeting with me and accepting our apology."</p>
        
            <p>Police in August said two former staff members who were involved in the original homicide investigation and a former prosecutor involved in the subsequent trial have been charged over the miscarriage of justice. All three have pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>Coster said police were continuing to investigate the case.</p>
        
            <p>"As matters pertaining to this case are still before the court it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further."</p>
        
            <p>Geoff Hall said his brother appreciated being visited in person.</p>
        
            <p>"His apology marks another milestone for Alan and our family in acknowledging the injustices of the past. Our family appreciates the work the Police have committed to these investigations."</p>
        
            <p>The trio charged over the wrongful conviction will next appear in court on 29 November.</p>
