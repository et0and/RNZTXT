        <h2>Watch: Hīkoi arrives at Ihumātao</h2>
        <p>
The hīkoi protesting the Treaty Principles Bill made its way from Auckland's North Shore to Ihumātao on Wednesday.
</p>
        
            <p>On day three of the hīkoi making its way to Parliament in protest of the Treaty Principles Bill, thousands crossed the Auckland Harbour Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Supporters cheered as the hīkoi crossed, with RNZ reporters at the scene saying the bridge began to rock under their feet as the wind picked up.</p>
        
            <p>The kaupapa behind the march is as much about kotahitanga as the bill itself, organisers say.</p>
        
            <p>After the bridge crossing, the hīkoi travelled to Bastion Point, before journeying to Ihumātao.</p>
        
            <p>They will stay overnight at Rangiriri Paa.</p>
