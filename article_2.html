            <p>Indigenous senator Lidia Thorpe shouted anti-colonial slogans at King Charles during his visit to the Australian parliament on Monday, shocking assembled lawmakers and other dignitaries.</p>
        
            <p>"Give us our land back! Give us what you stole from us!" Thorpe screamed in an almost minute-long diatribe, after the 75-year-old king's speech.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not your land, you are not my king," the independent lawmaker said, decrying what she described as a "genocide" of Indigenous Australians by European settlers.</p>
        
            <p>Australia was a British colony for more than 100 years, during which time thousands of Aboriginal Australians were killed and entire communities displaced.</p>
        
            <p>The country gained de facto independence in 1901, but has never become a fully fledged republic. King Charles is the current head of state.</p>

            <p>Charles is on a nine-day jaunt through Australia and Samoa, the first major foreign tour since his life-changing cancer diagnosis earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Thorpe is known for her attention-grabbing political stunts and fierce opposition to the monarchy.</p>
        
            <p>When she was sworn into office in 2022, Thorpe raised her right fist as she begrudgingly swore to serve Queen Elisabeth II, who was then Australia's head of state.</p>
        
            <p>"I sovereign, Lidia Thorpe, do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will be faithful and I bear true allegiance to the colonising Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II," she said before being rebuked by a Senate official.</p>
        
            <p>"Senator Thorpe, Senator Thorpe, you are required to recite the oath as printed on the card," said the chamber's president Sue Lines.</p>
        
            <p>In 1999, Australians narrowly voted against removing the queen, amid a row over whether her replacement would be chosen by members of parliament, not the public.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023 Australians overwhelmingly rejected measures to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution and to create an Indigenous consultative assembly.</p>
