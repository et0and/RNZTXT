            <p>Invercargill residents living at a remote village inside a city reserve can remain in their homes - but there's a catch.</p>
        
            <p>Once 35 years is up, those who call Coopers Creek home must pack up and leave, ending what will be more than 100 years of residence by that point.</p>
        
            <p>The cribs in the village, located about 15km from Invercargill, next to Whalers Bay, are "non-conforming" due to the reserve status of the land.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the council moved that annual licences at Coopers Creek be replaced by a 21-year licence with rights of renewal to a maximum of 35 years.</p>
        
            <p>In doing so, it looks to have landed on a solution to an issue which has hung over its head since 1992 when Sandy Point Domain gained reserve status.</p>
        
            <p>Cribs have inhabited the area since about 1950 but were allowed to stay on under an annual licence.</p>
        
            <p>There are currently 17 licence holders in the area, and the council met with 15 of those in July to gauge support for proposed changes.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Tom Campbell said the residents he spoke to were resolute in their desire for a renewable licence in perpetuity.</p>
        
            <p>"In my view, having read everything and listened to people, I don't think that is deliverable so long as there is a reserve."</p>
        
            <p>Mana whenua representative Evelyn Cook spoke strongly about the fact a condition of occupancy at Coopers Creek was for short-term stays, saying leaseholders should be aware of limitations to living in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Cook said the council was not only being asked to close its eyes to "non-compliant permanent living arrangements", but also issue longer leases with a right of renewal.</p>
        
            <p>That did not sit well with her because of mana whenua's vested interest in the area and the fact that 35 years was longer than one generation.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committing our mokopuna's mokopuna to something over which they have absolutely no input," she said.</p>

The area is home to some unique structures, including this miniature stone house.

            <p>Discussion on the topic lasted almost three hours and included verbal submissions from some residents.</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately, the council landed on the 21-year option with two seven-year rights of renewal.</p>
        
            <p>The recommended approach will be consulted on as part of the Sandy Point Domain Management Plan and requires final sign off by the Minister of Conservation.</p>
        
            <p>A baseline annual licence fee of $1058 was also set, effective from July 2024 with an annual increase from July 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Should licence holders reject the proposed 21-year option, they will default to the status quo of an annual licence.</p>
        
            <p>Coopers Creek got its name from a cooper named Owen McShane who settled there in 1836, making whale oil barrels and cabbage tree rum.</p>
