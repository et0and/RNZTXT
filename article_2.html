            <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to meet with disaster crisis coordination teams as Tropical Cyclone Alfred tracks closer towards the Queensland and New South Wales coast.</p>
        
            <p>The category 2 cyclone is expected to make landfall between the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast tomorrow, with damaging wind gusts, storms, and heavy rainfall expected to impact a large warning zone spanning both states.</p>
        
            <p>The current warning zone extends from Double Island Point in Queensland to Grafton in New South Wales, including Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Byron Bay and Ballina.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC understands Anthony Albanese travelled to Brisbane on Tuesday evening, as the Australian Government Disaster Response Plan was activated.</p>
        
            <p>An emergency meeting will be held with industry stakeholders, which includes supermarkets, banking and freight companies.</p>
        
            <p>The federal government has pre-positioned heavy-lifting helicopters from the National Aerial Firefighting Fleet to support the NSW and Queensland governments.</p>
        
            <p>The Sikorsky S-61 is set to be deployed to Coffs Harbour and a UH-60 Black Hawk will be stationed in Bundaberg, the ABC understands.</p>

            <p>Mapping from the Gold Coast City Council shows 6000 properties could be impacted by heavy rainfall and storm surges associated with the system in the worst-case scenario.</p>
        
            <p>Tammie Fogarty said the cyclone news was "quite triggering" after her Gold Coast hinterland home was destroyed by a tornado on Christmas Day in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We're waiting for the house to be rebuilt, insurance has put us up in a rental in Guanaba," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She will prepare to evacuate with her 91-year-old father who has Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, we're at a dead-end road on a very low-lying area, so we really get impacted by heavy rain," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got three causeways that we have to cross to get in and out of the property, which go under if we have a decent amount of rain."</p>
        
            <p>About 20,000 homes in Brisbane are also at risk of storm surge and flooding impacts, according to the latest modelling by Brisbane City Council.</p>
        
            <p>Areas most at risk include Brighton, Windsor, Ashgrove, Morningside, Rocklea, Coopers Plains, Carina, Sandgate, Hemmant, Lota, Tingalpa, Indooroopilly, Albion, Bardon and Wynnum West.</p>
        
            <p>The council said residents should consider evacuating.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the severity of the cyclone and its impact would change depending on when it makes landfall.</p>
        
            <p>"If it crosses at high tide, it's a far more challenging prospect," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said some isolated areas could see three-day rainfall totals exceeding 700 millimetres.</p>
        
            <p>A flood watch remains in place from the Mary River all the way down to the NSW border.</p>
        
            <p>Tropical Cyclone Alfred is the first system to make landfall in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales since 1974.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland government has made an emergency planning declaration to allow essential businesses like supermarkets and warehouses to restock their supplies around the clock.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie said it was the first time the declaration had been made in Queensland before a natural disaster.</p>
        
            <p>"Our primary goal is to supercharge the food and essential supply chains that are set to be affected by Cyclone Alfred," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will enable supermarkets to have more supply hit the shelves faster and empower supermarkets to continue to do all they can to meet the demand."</p>
