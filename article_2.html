            <p>The Fiji men's sevens team is aiming to defend its Olympic Games gold medal this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff is 5:45am, Fiji time.</p>
        
            <p>It has not all come easy, despite an unbeaten run through the group stage.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday morning they beat Ireland 19-15 in the quarterfinal, but Ireland led a lot of the match and pushed for a winning try after time had run out.</p>
        
            <p>But the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 gold medal winners held on to win.</p>
        
            <p>In the semifinal against Australia earlier this morning, it was 7 - 7 at halftime before Fij pulled away in the seond half to win 31 - 7.</p>
