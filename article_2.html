            <p>Israel's ambassador to the United Nations issued what he called a final warning to Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militants to halt their missile attacks on Israel, saying they risked the same "miserable fate" as Hamas, Hezbollah and Syria's Bashar al-Assad if they persisted.</p>
        
            <p>The ambassador, Danny Danon, also warned Tehran that Israel has the ability to strike any target in the Middle East, including in Iran. He added that Israel would not tolerate attacks by Iranian proxies.</p>
        
            <p>But hours later the Israeli military announced that it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, prompting sirens to sound across the country, and a top Houthi leader said the group would not end its attacks on Israel.</p>
        
            <p>"The pounding of the entity (Israel) continues and the support to Gaza continues," Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthis' supreme revolutionary committee, said in a post on X after the Israeli military announced the missile interception.</p>
        
            <p>The Houthis repeatedly have fired drones and missiles towards Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli fire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Danon, in addressing the UN Security Council, said that Israel would not tolerate further Houthi attacks.</p>
        
            <p>"To the Houthis, perhaps you have not been paying attention to what has happened to the Middle East over the past year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, allow me to remind you what has happened to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to Assad, to all those who have attempted to destroy us. Let this be your final warning. This is not a threat. It is a promise. You will share the same miserable fate," Danon said.</p>
        
            <p>Before the meeting, Danon told reporters: "Israel will defend its people. If 2000 kilometres is not enough to separate our children from the terror, let me assure you, it will not be enough to protect their terror from our strengths."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Houthis that Israel was "just getting started" following Israeli strikes on multiple Houthi-linked targets in Yemen, including Sanaa airport, ports on the country's west coast and two power plants.</p>
        
            <p>The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under attack by Israel. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's elimination of the top leaders of the Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah and the destruction of their military structure along with Assad's collapse represents a succession of monumental wins for Netanyahu.</p>
        
            <p>Briefing the Security Council meeting, Assistant UN Secretary General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari reiterated grave concern about the escalation in violence, calling on the Houthis to halt attacks on Israel and for international and humanitarian law to be respected.</p>
        
            <p>"Further military escalation could jeopardize regional stability with adverse political, security, economic and humanitarian repercussions," Khiari said.</p>
        
            <p>"Millions in Yemen, Israel and throughout the region, would continue to bear the brunt of escalation with no end."</p>
        
            <p>Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, while condemning Houthi missile attacks on Israel, also criticized Israel's retaliatory strikes on Yemen, as well those by what he called the "Anglo-Saxon coalition" of US and British warships in the Red Sea, saying they were "clearly not proportional."</p>
