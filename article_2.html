            <p>Residents in a West Auckland neighbourhood are frustrated Auckland Transport (AT) took more than two months to paint markings on a main road, despite the job only taking a few days to complete.</p>
        
            <p>The Craigs Way Extension in Hobsonville's Scott Point was set to open in November 2024 after several months of construction.</p>
        
            <p>But the opening of the new section of road which links to a roundabout with Joshua Carder Drive kept being delayed, despite construction work being finished.</p>
        
            <p>Locals pushed AT to get on with it, drawing their own road markings with chalk and using the road anyway.</p>
        
            <p>Residents told RNZ motorists started driving on the road in early January, after an unknown individual the community dubbed "Batman", moved the water-filled barriers blocking the road.</p>
        
            <p>Local, Fleur Pepperell, said the road was used for four days without AT noticing.</p>
        
            <p>"We could see everyone using the road so we thought sick the road is open!"</p>
        
            <p>"I guess Batman came along and opened the road and everyone thought AT had done it."</p>

            <p>Pepperell said in response to being told not to use the road, people started protesting by drawing road markings and writing messages like "Open the road" and "Sick of looking at it" with chalk.</p>
        
            <p>She said people also continued to drive around the barriers.</p>
        
            <p>"People were going around them [road barriers] and doing burnouts at 1am which was obviously a safety issue and a concern to residents."</p>
        
            <p>She said the barriers were eventually replaced with concrete ones.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook, several residents called on AT and the council to give more certainty on when the road would open to the public.</p>
        
            <p>In January, AT told RNZ that it was working with its contractor to install road markings and signs on Craigs Way by March.</p>
        
            <p>"Before a road is open for public use it must go through compliance checks and a legal resolution process. These steps are essential to ensure the safety of the road and its compliance with regulations.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Council and AT are working with the contractor to complete these final steps, which will include road markings and signage. We are working with the teams to ensure this process is fast-tracked where possible."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>AT said it was aware that the bollards had been moved, but said they did not know who was responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"We would strongly discourage anyone from removing or modifying the traffic management barriers that are in place."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport later contacted RNZ to confirm the road would be open by 10 February, earlier than expected.</p>
        
            <p>"AT is working hard to make sure Craigs Way Extension in Scott Point, Hobsonville, will be open to motorists by next week.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge that not having the road in a finished state for the last several months has been frustrating for Scott Point residents.</p>
        
            <p>"Road markings, pedestrian crossings, and the removal of concrete road barriers are expected to be completed in the coming days."</p>
        
            <p>AT acknowledged construction on the nearby Scott Road during January, reducing the busy road to one lane of traffic, had also been frustrating for the community.</p>
        
            <p>With both Craigs Way and Scott Road bordering Scott Point Primary School, parents and residents had expressed concern on social media about increased traffic during drop off and pick up times.</p>
        
            <p>AT confirmed the road was fully open allowing two lanes of traffic to flow by the beginning of this month.</p>

Concrete Barriers were brought in to stop people drivers from entering the Craigs Way Extension.

            <p>While the roads opening were a relief, it was unacceptable it had taken AT this long, Pepperell said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's really concerning it took a whole community getting involved, posting on Facebook, sending in complaints, and pressuring AT for something to actually happen.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels like we ended up at the bottom of someone's desk and were not prioritised when it was very much affecting the community."</p>
        
            <p>She said the neighbourhood was also without a close-by bus stop, because the construction of residential accommodation on Joshua Carder Drive where a bus stop had been built had come to a halt.</p>
        
            <p>Workers on site had told locals the developer involved was broke, she said.</p>
        
            <p>AT would not confirm the allegation but said it was not responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware that the developer was unable to complete the construction works on Craigs Way Extension due to matters outside our control."</p>
        
            <p>The community deserved better than that, Pepperell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We just want what we are entitled to as ratepayers."</p>
