            <p>A man who snapped and stabbed his elderly neighbour to death in a fit of rage says he has learned the art of patience.</p>
        
            <p>Colin Hoani stabbed Valmai McFie 17 times with a boning knife after the 67-year-old allegedly made a racist remark towards him. He then turned himself into police in July 2013.</p>
        
            <p>"Using your own words, you totally lost it - anger took over, and... this was the angriest you'd ever felt," Judge Graham Panckhurst said before sentencing him to life in prison, with a minimum non-parole period of 10 years later the same year.</p>
        
            <p>However, this week that sentence was given an end date as the New Zealand Parole Board agreed to release Hoani in August.</p>
        
            <p>"I've learnt patience, which was my worst enemy for carrying on in life," Hoani told the board. "Everything is not done in a flash."</p>
        
            <p>Hoani will be released into the care of a rehabilitation centre which will help him reintegrate into the community.</p>
        
            <p>McFie's niece, Louise Wegner-Parker, told NZME that she found it hard to believe that Hoani had learnt patience behind bars.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a very, very angry man," she said. "How can he be so different to how he was before he went to jail?"</p>
        
            <p>Wegner-Parker said overall she wasn't surprised that Hoani had been released because "10 years is just what you get for murder in New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>"It's still impossible to understand that a 10-year sentence is appropriate for a murder that our family believes was preconceived."</p>
        
            <p>Following McFie's death, the Christchurch City Council conducted an independent review of its social housing and made changes to the way risks to its tenants and staff were identified.</p>
        
            <p>In 2013 at Hoani's sentencing, the court was told that there had been a "history of disharmony" between McFie and Hoani.</p>
        
            <p>McFie made a complaint to the council and steps were taken to try and resolve the differences, including unsuccessful mediation.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, July 20 at about 6.20pm, Hoani was sitting outside his flat drinking a cup of coffee and smoking a cigarette.</p>
        
            <p>He claims that when McFie returned home, she fired a racial comment at him, which he later said was the last straw.</p>
        
            <p>He then took up a boning knife and stabbed her repeatedly in the upper torso where she collapsed and died on the spot.</p>
        
            <p>Hoani's defence counsel initially asked for him to be assessed as a mentally impaired person, but a report found he had no mental health problems that in any way mitigated or explained the killing.</p>

            <p>At a brief hearing before the parole board earlier this week, Hoani was asked about his health. He said he had "packed on a few pounds" but was otherwise hale.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm 70 now, and I'll be past my used-by date in five years time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's my family history. Everyone in my family has passed away before they were 70."</p>
        
            <p>Following his first hearing after becoming eligible for early release a year ago, the board's chair Sir Ron Young described Hoani as "bombastic" and gruff and impatient.</p>
        
            <p>At his hearing on Thursday, panel member Professor Phil Brinded noted that Hoani seemed more open and in good spirits.</p>
        
            <p>"They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, perhaps that's not true."</p>
