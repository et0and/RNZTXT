        <h2>David Seymour skipping Rātana 'absolute ignorance' - Opposition MPs</h2>
        <p>
Opposition MPs from the Green and Labour parties have called out ACT leader David Seymour's no-show at Rātana today, saying it is a display of ignorance about the Māori world.

            <p>Greens' co-leader Marama Davidson has labelled ACT's no-show at Rātana today a display of "absolute ignorance" and a dishonour to the Māori world.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has never attended Rātana festivities, describing it as a religious event, but will be at Waitangi next month.</p>
        
            <p>Opposition MPs were welcomed onto the pā this morning, followed by a contingent from National and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>ACT's absence was an abdication of responsibility, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It dismisses the mana and the importance of Ratana, of Wiremu Pōtiki Ratana, and te ao Māori and their political voice."</p>

            <p>She accused ACT leader David Seymour of playing to fear, ignorance, and division by "appealing to the worst of us" through his efforts to redefine Treaty principles.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson challenged Prime Minister Christopher Luxon to use the day to listen to Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"He shouldn't say much at all. He should listen, he should receive and then he should ensure his government continues to uphold ... Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop using Māori as your racist drawcard."</p>
        
            <p>Senior Labour MP Kelvin Davis also took a serve at Seymour when speaking to reporters at Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>"It really annoys me when David Seymour says things like 'we've never had an adult conversation about the principles and the Treaty of Waitangi'. I don't know where he's been for the last 184 years.</p>
        
            <p>"David Seymour is a Johnny Come Lately who has never engaged in the Māori world, on those issues that are important to Māori. And all of a sudden he thinks that he knows it all. It's just ignorance playing out."</p>

            <p>Davis said he was sure the government representatives would get a respectful reception at Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a peaceful, respectful hui, it always has been, and I don't expect that to change. But I think people will still take the opportunity to express how they're feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Several of the speakers on the hau kāinga side at Rātana referred to the "three-headed taniwha" government, and noted Seymour's absence, despite the presence of leaders from all the other parties in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking from the Beehive in Wellington, Seymour defended his non-attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"Why would you be there? There are thousands of events up and down New Zealand every day, you needn't go to all of them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is a guy came out as a prophet of his own religious movement in the 1870s. And politicians feel a strange obligation to be there every year. I've never felt that."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he would instead be up at Waitangi for "the country's most important national holiday".</p>
        
            <p>"When people say that somehow Rātana is the sine qua non (essential ingredient) of political discussion in New Zealand, they might be jumping a few sharks.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an annual event to commemorate the Treaty of Waitangi, our founding document, and I'm looking forward to being up there in a week or two."</p>
