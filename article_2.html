            <p>You want a fun, frisky vibe to bring in the New Year, says Music 101 host, Charlotte Ryan.</p>
        
            <p>It's got to have a beat that pumps you up, makes you move your feet and sends off the final hours of the year. We asked RNZ music hosts to pick the bangers they have on their playlist to get the party started.</p>
        
            <p>Music 101 Charlotte Ryan's picks:</p>
        
            <p>This song will create a fun, frisky vibe to kick off your party and help ease you into the New Year. It comes from NZ musician Nathan Haines latest album Notes and mixes jazz, late 90s house music and Brazilian instruments and samples.</p>
        
            <p>This iconic song was released in 1990 but is timeless and still sounds great at any party. I think it suits mid-party - 9pm-10pm - as it'll lift the energy and prepare us to party.</p>
        
            <p>Scottish band Primal Scream are still making great music - their most recent album Come Ahead is one of my favourites from the year.</p>
        
            <p>Jamie XX released his much-anticipated second album this year - and for me, it lived up to the hype.</p>
        
            <p>This song was co-written with Australian band The Avalanches. It samples a Nikki Giovanni poetry album - originally released in 1976 - that Jamie told me he found in an old record store many years ago.</p>
        
            <p>This is the song to play leading up to the midnight hour - it's got great energy and will get everyone on the dance floor.</p>
        
            <p>Extra picks: Deee-Lite - "Groove is in the Heart", Salt n Pepper - "Shoop"</p>
        
            <p>The Tahi team's picks:</p>
        
            <p>Famously appearing in the intro to the 1998 Hype Williams classic "Belly", this has always felt like a song that would be playing at a party full of famous people. It makes me feel important and most of all, it makes me feel like celebrating. - So'omalo</p>
        
            <p>This head banger will fit any party vibe no matter the demographic of your company and will help make sure there's "no worries in the party tonight". - Janay</p>
        
            <p>Brat Summer but it's six months later because it's a different hemisphere - Harry</p>
        
            <p>The Sampler host Tony Stamp's picks:</p>
        
            <p>It's good to ease into the night with a classic, and this one from the Thin White Duke always hits the spot, sitting alongside Talking Heads 'This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)' as an all-time early evening head-nodder.</p>
        
            <p>You could substitute any number of tracks involving Big Boi here, ('Bowtie' and 'Shutterbugg' also spring to mind), but it's hard to go past the horn arrangements on this one, building excitement as they work their way up the scale. This song sounds like the start of a big night, even before the rapper compels you to "throw your back out".</p>
        
            <p>A friend hit play on this song at just the right point of the night recently, and I was instantly compelled to move. A meeting of British-Pakistani and American production with chopped-up Swiss vocals, it's only going to aid your efforts to get your friends onto the dance floor. "We're feeling OK," sings Ragu, and it's hard to imagine anyone disagreeing.</p>
