            <p>A popular Wellington bakery has announced its closure one week after winning a hospitality award, while another has been put into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>Myrtle Bakery on Kent Terrace in Mount Victoria won outstanding bakery at the 'unofficial' Welly Hospo Awards, which were hurriedly organised after the Felix Wellington Hospitality Awards were postponed after a challenging year in the industry.</p>
        
            <p>Owners Sarah Bullock and Jacob Brown posted news of the closure on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with a very heavy heart that we announce the closure of Myrtle Bakery, as our cherished site is no longer available to house us," they wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"The character of the building, its unique position, and the warmth and support of the people who visit us, are not just part of our story - they are our story ... Without them, we feel it is impossible to simply relocate and remain true to who we are."</p>
        
            <p>The bakery had been open for three years, and its last day will be 21 December, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Myrtle regularly had queues out the door. Patrons commented on the post saying they were devastated, and that the cafe was adored.</p>
        
            <p>But the owners hinted they could be on to a new project.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not necessarily the last you'll see of us. Having some downtime will undoubtedly inspire new ideas and who knows where that might lead."</p>
        
            <p>The pair also own The Larder in Miramar, where they live.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Alamir Bakery - also based in Miramar - was put into liquidation on 3 December, according to the Companies Office.</p>
        
            <p>The company had been making pita, hummus, falafel, tahini and other Lebanese food for three decades.</p>
        
            <p>It began as The Delicious Lebanese Snack Co in a small commercial kitchen supplying local eateries, and grew to be stocked by supermarkets across the country from 2017, its website said.</p>
        
            <p>Heath Gair from Palliser Insolvency Limited is the appointed liquidator.</p>
        
            <p>Another Wellington store on Ghuznee Street, design, homeware and clothing boutique Kaukau, also announced its closure on social media on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"After almost a decade on the street, this will be our final kirihimete, closing our doors to these purple walls in early 2025," said owners Nadya France-White and Prak Sritharan.</p>
        
            <p>The Ghuznee Street community meant a lot to them and had shaped their lives, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We still believe so much in retail and people's desire to experience something special. But as a young whānau this feels like the right time for us to step away."</p>
        
            <p>They had some "special projects" planned before the closure, they said.</p>
        
            <p>All three businesses have been approached for comment.</p>
