        <h2>Invercargill wizard feels city rejected him</h2>
        <p>
A wizard with a history of dabbling in local politics has had an epiphany - Invercargill doesn't deserve him.

            <p>Noel Peterson is the "green wizard" of Bluff, a man with a reputation of championing environmental causes and bringing good cheer to community events.</p>
        
            <p>But in recent years, Peterson has taken a step back from his wizardly duties following a bitter local election defeat.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, Peterson tried his hand for Invercargill City Council and finished a disappointing 33rd of 34 candidates.</p>

            <p>He garnered just 91 votes in his mayoral bid, less than half of one percent of total votes.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, after the election . . . I actually became quite disappointed and whakamƒÅ and reclusive for quite some time," Peterson says of the experience.</p>
        
            <p>"And then about three, four months ago, I'd been going out a lot more. But I thought 'you know, the community doesn't really deserve a wizard'."</p>
        
            <p>Peterson feels Invercargill has rejected his message of taking care of the planet and fears the region is being run by people who only pay lip service to environmental issues.</p>
        
            <p>One of his main disappointments was a feeling his message about the climate crisis had been overlooked.</p>
        
            <p>"I do wish and hope that more people in the community realise that we need to change. That the world is changing and we need to change with it," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't just keep our sloven ways and carry on business as usual."</p>

            <p>Good news for those fearing Peterson may have hung up the robes for good though: the man who has called Southland home for about a decade reassures he will "always be a wizard".</p>
        
            <p>The garb is worn less these days, he admits, as wizard-wear is both impractical and hot, and heatstroke has proven an issue in the past.</p>
        
            <p>Peterson also hasn't ruled out standing in the next election, saying it's something he would like to do again.</p>
        
            <p>One of the main barriers is the cost, with the last campaign totaling about $3500 including new clothes and a haircut.</p>
        
            <p>Some of those expenses would be transferable, however.</p>
        
            <p>"I've still got the clothes, so I don't have to buy them again a second time," he says.</p>
