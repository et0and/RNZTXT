            <p>Police are calling for sightings of a car after a man was found dead on a suburban Christchurch street.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called about 2.30am on Thursday, and a 38-year-old man was found dead on Carisbrooke Street near Portchester Street, Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves told reporters at the scene neighbours had called to report an "unusual noise", but would not comment further on what it was.</p>
        
            <p>She said police were now asking for sightings of a White 2006 Toyota Crown sedan (licence plate LEQ895), which may have been driven by the victim.</p>
        
            <p>Police have launched a homicide probe but Reeves would not comment on the man's injuries.</p>

            <p>"Local residents can expect to see a large police presence in the area as a scene examination and area enquiries will commence this [Thursday] morning."</p>
        
            <p>Cordons were expected to be up in the area for some time and Carisbrooke Street was blocked.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus is now on establishing the circumstances surrounding the incident and notifying and supporting the victim's family at this difficult time," Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>While she would not confirm the man's identity, she said he was a Christchurch man.</p>
        
            <p>A community leader said there was a social stigma about the neighbourhood where the body was found.</p>
        
            <p>Local community board (Waitai Coastal-Burwood-Linwood Community Board) member Tim Baker lived in Aranui for more than 50 years. He told RNZ he was saddened by what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always been the odd ratbag living in the area, but overall it's been a great place to live for me and my family. Crime like that doesn't happen very often in the Aranui area. It does happen occasionally, but not very often."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they wanted to hear from anyone who heard or saw anything unusual in the area about 2am or from anyone who may have CCTV footage.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have heard any unusual sounds or noticed anything unusual in Carisbrook Street around 2am this morning, we would very much like to hear from you," Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>A post mortem will be held on Friday.</p>
