            <p>With her pink cheeks and natural charisma, two-month-old pygmy hippo Moo Deng is drawing large crowds to the Thai zoo where she lives.</p>
        
            <p>Moo Deng, which roughly translates to 'bouncy pig' in Thai, has been a social media hit since her keepers started uploading snippets of her life online.</p>
        
            <p>Born in July to parents Jonah and Tony, Moo Deng has two siblings, who are also called variations of pork dishes.</p>
        
            <p>Her half-sisters are called Moo Tun, meaning stewed pork, and Moo Wan, meaning sweet pork.</p>
        
            <p>Moo Deng's name was chosen by a popular vote held by the zoo.</p>
        
            <p>Since her birth, visitor numbers have almost doubled, according to Khao Kheow Open Zoo.</p>
        
            <p>But not all the attention Moo Deng is receiving is welcome.</p>

            <p>Moo Deng's popularity has also resulted in zoo patrons mistreating the animal.</p>
        
            <p>Videos posted online show some visitors throwing shellfish and even splashing water on the hippo to try to coax her out of sleep.</p>
        
            <p>Zoo manager Narongwit Chodchoi condemned these behaviours in an online statement.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not only cruel but also dangerous," Chodchoi said.</p>
        
            <p>"We must protect these animals and ensure that they have a safe and comfortable environment."</p>
        
            <p>The zoo has installed CCTV cameras around the enclosure and threatened legal action against those who mistreat the baby hippo.</p>
        
            <p>Crowd management strategies have also been implemented.</p>
        
            <p>Khao Kheow Open Zoo is limiting groups to 50 people and allowing them five minutes to take a look at Moo Deng and the other pygmy hippopotamuses.</p>
        
            <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), experts believe there are fewer than 3000 left in the wild.</p>
        
            <p>Moo Deng's miniature frame and adorable nature have gone wildly viral.</p>
        
            <p>One particular video posted on Facebook - showing her yawning - has garnered 5.8 million views and counting.</p>
        
            <p>"Moo Deng is a lifestyle icon and i need all of yall to get onboard," one user wrote on X.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm obsessed with Moo Deng - I've been thinking about this queen all day long," another said.</p>
        
            <p>The zoo, which is located about 100km southeast of Bangkok, has capitalised on the baby hippo's celebrity status.</p>
        
            <p>A range of merchandise, including a hippo-inspired shirt and trouser combo, is now available to purchase in-person and online.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, retail makeup brand Sephora Thailand put out an advertisement on Instagram with a line of Moo Deng inspired blushes.</p>
        
            <p>It allows customers to "wear your blush like a baby hippo".</p>
