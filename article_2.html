            <p>Whaikaha, the Ministry of Disabled People, has commissioned an independent investigation into the deaths of four people while in care.</p>
        
            <p>The move was welcomed by one disability advocate who says she is concerned about all deaths in disability support homes.</p>
        
            <p>Between 1 January and the end of July this year, 87 people with disabilities died while living in a residential service house, according to information released to RNZ under the Official Information Act.</p>
        
            <p>That compares with 90 for the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>Whaikaha refused to release any detail about the deaths, including names of the providers or locations where the deaths occurred - citing privacy and commercial reasons.</p>
        
            <p>The total number of disabled people in residential services is about 7500.</p>
        
            <p>Whaikaha ministerial and executive services manager Emma Williams said the 87 deaths were reported to the ministry by service providers.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of these deaths were from natural causes, disease, or illness and were not unexpected," she said in the response.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to note that many of the individuals in residential services settings have underlying conditions that contribute to increased risk of premature death, compared to that of the general population."</p>
        
            <p>The 87 deaths were reported by 27 providers, with one provider reporting 32 deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Another single provider reported seven deaths, while 11 providers reported one death.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said of the 87 deaths, 20 were referred to the coroner by the providers, whose responsibility it is to determine whether to report a death.</p>
        
            <p>Coroners can investigate deaths without known cause or those that may be self-inflicted, unnatural or violent.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear whether any of the deaths are being investigated by the Health and Disability Commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>However, the ministry collects information from its contracted providers on whether they have undertaken an internal investigation following a death, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"Each provider has their own policies and procedures to follow in the event of a death.</p>
        
            <p>"Whaikaha reviews the information supplied by providers and can commission an investigation if it has concerns that there may be potential quality issues associated with the death."</p>
        
            <p>Of the 87 deaths, 63 were not internally reviewed by the provider and 21 were, and Whaikaha was seeking answers over whether three deaths were reviewed.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining four were now the subject of an independent investigation ordered by Whaikaha.</p>
        
            <p>Whaikaha would not elaborate on why it ordered the investigation and only said it was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Disability advocate Jane Carrigan baulked at the 32 deaths at a single provider and said they should ring alarm bells.</p>
        
            <p>She welcomed the investigation of the four deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"My guess would be they are taken from that 32 as representative of the sort of issues that are so concerning not even Whaikaha can turn a blind eye to it."</p>
        
            <p>She said those issues included neglect, abuse and over-restraint.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, the Ombudsman criticised the Ministry of Health, at the time responsible for disability care, for its reporting about the deaths of people with intellectual disabilities receiving residential support.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier said his investigation revealed 10 people whose deaths the ministry had been unaware of.</p>
        
            <p>He said its systems for the collection, use and reporting of information about the deaths of intellectually disabled people in residential care were inadequate.</p>
        
            <p>Boshier said New Zealanders with intellectual disabilities had overall poorer health outcomes and a shorter life expectancy by up to 24 years.</p>
        
            <p>"There is concern that the deaths of some people with intellectual disabilities may be premature or avoidable."</p>
