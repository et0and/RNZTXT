            <p>Former Media and Communications minister Melissa Lee says she may have been "a little slow" in reacting to dramatic changes in the media landscape.</p>
        
            <p>Lee was last week stripped of her media portfolio and demoted from Cabinet - following criticism of her performance by industry voices and the opposition.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters at Parliament for the first time since, Lee said she had tried her best in the role - but accepted Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's judgement.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had been very focused on the media role. However, the sector was going through very difficult times.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually come about quite suddenly and I think although we were thinking there need to be some changes, it just came about really too fast and I was trying and things in government actually take time."</p>
        
            <p>She added: "Perhaps I was a little slow, what I can say is I tried my very best ... and I respect the prime minister's decision."</p>
        
            <p>She said she remained "very passionate about media and communications" and was disappointed to lose the portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>She had been opposition spokesperson on media for six years before taking up the role as Minister.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if she hoped she could win it back in the future, she said she did, but at present she was focused on her other responsibilities, which include Economic Development.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if her demotion had contributed to National's loss of support in Monday night's 1News Verian poll, she repeated her support for Luxon's decision.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time as Lee was demoted, Penny Simmons lost the disability portfolio.</p>
