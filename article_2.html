        <h2>'A task in itself': Country's largest solar power station built in Kaitāia</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand's biggest solar power station to date has started producing electricity in the Far North.

            <p>New Zealand's biggest solar power station to date has started producing electricity in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>With a connection capacity of 23MW, Lodestone Energy's solar farm, just outside Kaitāia, eclipses any other completed so far around Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>The next biggest is a 5.2MW solar farm in Gisborne, which started operating just this month.</p>
        
            <p>Lodestone's general manager of development Daniel Cunningham said commissioning started late last week with the first of six power inverters now supplying power to the national grid.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining inverters would be hooked up gradually with the process due to be completed by late January.</p>
        
            <p>Cunningham said the project was on budget and only a few weeks behind schedule.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's pretty well on time, which we think is quite an achievement. It hasn't been an easy year to be constructing a solar farm with that massive rainfall early in the year. It was a task in itself to build New Zealand's first grid-scale solar farm."</p>
        
            <p>The Kaitāia solar farm was the first in the country big enough to be required to "bid" into the power market.</p>
        
            <p>That meant the company had to tell the electricity market operator how much power it was going to generate each half hour, allowing supply to be matched with demand.</p>

            <p>The 60,000-panel solar farm had been built on 80 hectares of farmland on Gill Road, just north-west of Kaitāia.</p>
        
            <p>The exact cost has not been disclosed but Cunningham said it was about $60 million.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike most solar farms built so far in New Zealand, the panels were mounted on motorised trackers which followed the sun for maximum power generation.</p>
        
            <p>The panels were raised on two metre high poles so farming could continue underneath.</p>
        
            <p>Cunningham said sheep would be brought on site "any day now".</p>
        
            <p>The company would then explore other ways of maximising agricultural production. That could include grazing cattle, growing crops, or horticulture.</p>
        
            <p>A formal "switching on" and naming ceremony would be held once the solar farm was fully operational.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the plant's power output, estimated to total 55GWh a year, had been contracted to the Warehouse Group and to electricity retailer Pulse Energy.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Lodestone was planning another, even bigger solar farm just north of Dargaville, as well as projects in Edgecumbe, Waiotahe (near Ōpōtiki) and Whitianga.</p>
        
            <p>Cunningham said the company had yet to make a final decision on the Dargaville project but he hoped construction would start by the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>That would mean power could start flowing in late 2025.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's current second-biggest solar power plant, the 5.2MW Te Ihi o te Rā, was switched on this month by Eastland Generation on 6ha of previously unused land at Gisborne Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to that the nation's biggest was a 2.1MW solar farm built at Kapuni, in Taranaki, in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Work is also underway on a 12ha solar farm at Pukenui, about 50 kilometres north of Kaitāia.</p>

            <p>That project, by Far North Solar Farms, was launched by then prime minister Jacinda Ardern in 2021 but appeared to have stalled for the past two years.</p>
        
            <p>Earthworks have, however, started in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The peak generation capacity of Lodestone's Kaitāia farm is similar to that of Top Energy's 32MW geothermal power plant at Ngāwhā, near Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>However, the geothermal plant runs at full capacity 24 hours a day and not just when the sun shines.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, commissioners for Environment Canterbury rejected a resource consent application for a solar power station in the Mackenzie Basin even bigger than Lodestone's in Kaitāia.</p>
        
            <p>If it had gone ahead that solar farm would have covered about 110ha.</p>
        
            <p>It was refused on ecological grounds.</p>
