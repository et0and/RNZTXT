            <p>Three New Zealand judges have passed away within a week, and colleagues have praised the trio for their humble and hard-working contributions to law and order in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua acting warranted judge Jocelyn Munro, 73, died on Monday, Invercargill judge Bernadette Farnan, 67, died on Wednesday and former Auckland judge Philip Recordon, 75, died on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The three District Court judges worked in a wide range of areas, from general court and jury trials to family court.</p>
        
            <p>Chief District Court Judge Heemi Taumaunu said it was "an immensely sad week".</p>
        
            <p>Former judge Recordon served in the Manukau District Court, with his last judgment being in March last year.</p>
        
            <p>He was sworn in as a judge in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>Taumaunu had previously paid tribute to Recordon as someone who strove to ensure all who came to court seeking justice were treated in a respectful, fair and just manner.</p>
        
            <p>He was remembered by judges, staff, lawyers and others at Manukau District Court on Thursday with a karakia and waiata (prayer and song).</p>

            <p>Munro, who served at Rotorua District Court, was praised as "greatly admired and respected".</p>
        
            <p>She was sworn in in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"She was known for her warm and empathetic approach to her work in the court and her loss will be sorely felt," Taumaunu said.</p>
        
            <p>Farnan's Invercargill colleague Judge Russell Walker said she had been a powerhouse whose workload was the stuff of legends, but that she was also humble and kind.</p>
        
            <p>Taumaunu said all three had served their communities well.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Justice Dame Helen Winkelmann said the trio were valued colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>"Each was a faithful servant of a society and country they loved. They will be greatly missed."</p>
