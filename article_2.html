            <p>TVNZ's just released interim financial results show that its total revenue has fallen 13.5 percent from last year to $155.9 million.</p>
        
            <p>It says it is facing a "challenging trading environment" and a "significant reduction in television advertising revenue".</p>
        
            <p>The results come in the wake of a shock proposal by Newshub to close its newsroom on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>Warner Bros Discovery ANZ senior vice president head of networks Glen Kyne said the company had to keep looking at ways of reducing costs.</p>
        
            <p>"We've now reached a stage where any further reduction in costs means proposing major changes. This is why we are proposing to shut down the newsroom. This would mean stopping all news production including the Newshub website from June 30," he said in the statement.</p>
        
            <p>The company made a $34.8 million loss in New Zealand for the 2022 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>More to come....</p>
