            <p>What happens when you fund 10 artists a part time wage - a universal basic income - for an entire year, to help facilitate change within their community across an entire region? </p>
        
            <p>Over 2022 and 2023 arts agency Creative Waikato trialled such a project. Whiria Te Tāngata was given $630,000 from the Manatū Taonga Ministry of Culture and Heritage’s Innovating Aotearoa fund.</p>
        
            <p>A documentary exploring a region’s worth of wellbeing by Dan Inglis premieres in Kirikiriroa Hamilton on Monday night and Whiria te Tāngata has also been the subject of a positive Social Impact Report by Australian specialist consultants Huber Social. </p>
        
            <p>“When people are heard and seen, their attitudes to everything changes, and I mean everything,” says project lead Leafā Wilson in the documentary.</p>
        
            <p>“I would be so bold as to say that Whiria te Tāngata is more than just artists working in community, I think it’s a model for rehabilitation of the whole of society."</p>

            <p>The country’s first multi-community artists in residency scheme, Whiria Te Tāngata paired its 10 artists with mentors whom they met monthly.</p>
        
            <p>Those artists ranged from playwrights and puppeteers to visual artists and musicians working in truly diverse communities. They ranged from Port Waikato to Coromandel Town and Tokoroa to Huntly.</p>
        
            <p>They were also brought together with a raft of mentors nationally, and Wilson was responsible for visiting them and their communities and buddying them up with mentors.</p>
        
            <p>It's a role she equates with being “an aunty”.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato-born and raised, Wilson has herself been making, curating or writing about art for over 40 years.</p>
        
            <p>She was previously, for 17 years, curator of art at Waikato Museum. </p>
        
            <p>She spoke with Mark Amery from RNZ’s Culture 101 to share some of the powerful artist and community stories that made up the project.</p>
