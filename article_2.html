            <p>From Invercargill to Tauranga, people were able to see Aurora Australis overnight after a major geomagnetic storm hit Earth.</p>
        
            <p>Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin told Midday Report it was the best storm in about seven years.</p>
        
            <p>"This time of the year is a really great time for auroras because the earth's magnetic field and the sun's magnetic field are lined up," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Griffin said the geomagnetic storm was caused by the sun throwing some material at the Earth a couple of days ago, which then interacted with our magnetic fields and made our atmosphere glow.</p>
        
            <p>Geomagnetic storms are normally caused by sustained periods of high-speed solar winds, and importantly a southward directed solar wind magnetic field, according to the US Space Weather Prediction Center.</p>
        
            <p>The storm was also timed perfectly with a full moon, which Griffin said brightened up the sky even further.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a phenomenal morning, as the sky lit up with green and red colours in the early hours of the morning in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>A Severe Geomagnetic Storm has been observed today, and will continue into Monday. Please see the Key Messages below from the Space Weather Prediction Center. https://t.co/EkwZuG44UC</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a wonderful sight," he said</p>
        
            <p>"As the sky brightened, you could see the aurora in the background, and the moon setting."</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged people to go out on Monday night to see Aurora Australis.</p>
        
            <p>"Although the storm seems to be fading a bit, there may well be some auroras out there tonight," Griffin said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've got a clear sky, and a good view to the south, wherever you are in the country - why not go out this evening and try to see if you can see an aurora?"</p>
