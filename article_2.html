            <p>A controversy over a waterfall has cascaded into a social media storm in China, even prompting an explanation from the water body itself.</p>
        
            <p>A hiker posted a video that showed the flow of water from Yuntai Mountain Waterfall - billed as China's tallest uninterrupted waterfall - was coming from a pipe built high into the rock face.</p>
        
            <p>The clip has been liked more than 70,000 times since it was first posted on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Operators of the Yuntai tourism park said that they made the "small enhancement" during the dry season so visitors would feel that their trip had been worthwhile.</p>
        
            <p>"The one about how I went through all the hardship to the source of Yuntai Waterfall only to see a pipe," the caption of the video posted by user "Farisvov" reads.</p>
        
            <p>The topic "the origin of Yuntai Waterfall is just some pipes" began trending all over social media.</p>
        
            <p>It received more than 14 million views on Weibo and nearly 10 million views on Douyin - causing such an uproar that local government officials were sent to the park to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>They asked the operators to learn a lesson from the incident and explain the enhancements to tourists ahead of time, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

            <p>The park later posted on behalf of the waterfall saying, "I didn't expect to meet everyone this way".</p>
        
            <p>"As a seasonal scenery I can't guarantee that I will be in my most beautiful form everytime you come to see me," it adds.</p>
        
            <p>"I made a small enhancement during the dry season only so I would look my best to meet my friends."</p>
        
            <p>Located in central Henan province, the 312-metre Yuntai falls is located inside the Yuntai Mountain Geopark, a UNESCO Global Geopark.</p>
        
            <p>Millions of visitors travel there every year, drawn by geological formations that date back more than a billion years.</p>

            <p>Park officials told CCTV that the water they used to pump water into the falls was spring water, adding that it would not damage the natural landscape.</p>
        
            <p>Many social media users appeared to be understanding of the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Yuntai park: Does this person not have better things to do?" a comment liked nearly 40,000 times on Douyin reads.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a good thing to do. Otherwise people would be disappointed if they end up seeing nothing there," a user on Weibo said.</p>
        
            <p>But there is also criticism.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not respecting the natural order, and not respecting the tourists," a Weibo user wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"How could it be called the No 1 waterfall anymore," another user commented on Douyin.</p>
        
            <p>This is not the first time artificial measures have been used to "help" famous waterfalls in China.</p>
        
            <p>Huangguoshu Waterfall, a famous tourist destination in the southwestern Guizhou province, has been helped by a water diversion project from a nearby dam since 2006 to maintain its flow during the dry season.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
