Making the 76-year-old's feat even more special is the fact that he is still recovering from shoulder surgery.

            <p>Many golfers never hit a hole-in-one, but a one-armed Queenstown man has just picked up his second.</p>
        
            <p>South African Erasmus "Ras" Theron, 76, scored a 76 metre hole-in-one last Friday at the Frankton Golf Centre's driving range - a super-sized hole on an old trailer.</p>
        
            <p>Theron first achieved the feat on Arrowtown's 12th hole when he was 65, 55 years after first taking up the sport.</p>
        
            <p>The former right-hander had his right arm amputated when he was 19 after it was badly burnt while he was training to be a fighter pilot - his instructor failed to pull out of a dive.</p>
        
            <p>"I was advised I wouldn't be able to do sport again."</p>
        
            <p>Making Friday's feat even more special is the fact that he is still recovering from shoulder surgery.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't go the distance any more, but I did hit a perfect shot.</p>
        
            <p>"Holes-in-one are unbelievable. You know some golfers play their whole life and don't get one."</p>
        
            <p>Theron gained his private pilot's licence in 1990 and has flown three modified types of aircraft with one arm.</p>
