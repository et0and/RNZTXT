            <p>[LI[ South Korean prosecutors have indicted the impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection over his imposition of martial law.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors in South Korea have indicted the impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, the main opposition party said.</p>
        
            <p>"The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection," Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally."</p>
        
            <p>Yonhap news agency reported that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office indicted Yoon over rebellion in connection with his 3 December decree that plunged the country into massive political turmoil.</p>
        
            <p>There was no immediate comment from the prosecutors' office.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon's lawyers had urged the prosecutors to immediately release him from what they call illegal custody.</p>

            <p>Under criminal investigation, Yoon has been in custody since 15 January after becoming the first sitting president to be arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity.</p>
        
            <p>It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon and his lawyers argued at a Constitutional Court hearing last week that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.</p>
        
            <p>In parallel with his criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers.</p>
        
            <p>They have 180 days to decide.</p>
        
            <p>South Korea's opposition-led parliament impeached Yoon on 14 December, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon rescinded his martial law after about six hours after lawmakers from the main opposition party, confronting soldiers in parliament, voted down the decree.</p>
        
            <p>Soldiers equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows during the dramatic confrontation.</p>
