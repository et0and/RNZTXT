            <p>The coalition would return to government, but both Christophers - Luxon and Hipkins - have lost popularity, according to the latest 1News-Verian poll.</p>
        
            <p>For parties outside Parliament, The Opportunities Party was up 2 to 3 percentage points, New Zeal was up 1, and Freedoms NZ was up 1 point to 1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Undecided voters accounted for 9 percent of respondents, steady compared to the previous poll in August.</p>
        
            <p>The results assume Te Pāti Māori would win at least one electorate seat, returning them to Parliament. Parties that do not hold an electorate seat must have at least 5 percent of the vote to win seats.</p>
        
            <p>It would leave the coalition parties with 63 seats to the opposition parties' 58.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps the biggest changes in the poll were on the preferred prime minister ratings, with National's Christopher Luxon and Labour's Chris Hipkins both dropping 3 points - although Luxon as the incumbent retains superiority at 25 percentage points.</p>
        
            <p>Preferred prime minister:</p>
        
            <p>The poll surveyed 1000 eligible voters and was weighted for demographics, with a margin of error of 3.1 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval. It was conducted between 5 and 9 October.</p>
        
            <p>All changes in the numbers over the three-month period since the last poll were within the margin of error.</p>
        
            <p>Polls compare to the most recent poll by the same polling company, as different polls can use different methologies. They are intended to track trends in voting preferences, showing a snapshot in time, rather than be a completely accurate predictor of the final election result.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the morning, 1News also released the results of another poll question which showed 40 percent of people believed the country was worse off than before the election, and a further 26 percent said there was no difference since then.</p>
        
            <p>It's interesting, then, that the trends reported in Curia's latest poll released on Friday - showing a stark drop for National and Luxon alike - were not replicated here. Curia's polling is also done more frequently.</p>
