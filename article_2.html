            <p>Auckland's Polyfest, a cultural festival celebrating Māori and Pacific Island nations is underway at the Manukau Sports Bowl.</p>
        
            <p>The festival kicked off on Wednesday and will be continuing until Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 teams from 69 schools across Aotearoa were in attendance to represent their ethnic backgrounds.</p>
        
            <p>Festival director Terri Leo-Mauu said Polyfest provides a pathway for people to connect with their cultural backgrounds.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important for them to carry on the tradition, a rite of passage almost.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's also important to them because they get to belong to something; they get to meet friends along the way and get to share this journey with other people."</p>
        
            <p>Minsiter for Pacific Peoples Dr Shane Reti said the government would continue to support Auckland's Polyfest by giving it a $60,000 funding boost in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said the government's sponsorship of the festival recognises the value and role languages play in building confidence for Pacific youth.</p>
        
            <p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the festival. An additonal $60,0000 funding boost will also be given to the festival in 2030 to mark its 55th year.</p>
        
            <p>Manukau Ward councillor Alf Filipaina told Local Democracy Reporting people should get behind it and experience the wonderful atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing, it brings our communities together," Filipaina said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has been at the festival, capturing the best of what it has to offer.</p>
