            <p>An off-duty police officer who died after being hit by a car is being remembered as a "genuine soul" and the "greatest grandmother".</p>
        
            <p>Houhora constable Gail Shepherd was walking her dogs on Saturday afternoon when she was struck in Helena Bay, north of Whang훮rei.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the intersection of Webb Road and Russell Road about 3.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the car left the road and crashed into a power pole before hitting a pedestrian, who died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The driver sustained minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Shepherd, who had worked at Kohukohu in the Hokianga before transferring to Houhora, has been remembered by wh훮nau and workmates as "instrumental" in the Te Tai Tokerau community.</p>
        
            <p>"A person who was true to herself and stood up for what she believed in and loved her family more than anything in the world," her police colleague John Larkin said.</p>
        
            <p>"A genuine soul that will be sadly missed by us, the Neighbourhood Policing Team Otangarei and all those who worked with her."</p>
        
            <p>Shepherd was a loving mother and grandmother, her wh훮nau said.</p>
        
            <p>A message posted online on behalf of her daughter described Shepherd as her best friend and "the greatest grandmother to my babies". Her daughter's name is Tyme</p>
        
            <p>"I will love you and will miss you forever and always," it continued.</p>
        
            <p>Broadwood Rural Voluntary Fire Brigade also posted on social media saying it was saddened to hear of Shepherd's death.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a pleasure working with you during your time in North Hokianga. You will be missed."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said their hearts went out to the officer's family and friends, who were receiving support.</p>
        
            <p>"Their passing is a tragic loss for our community and the impact will be keenly felt.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working to ensure our staff can access the support they need at this difficult time."</p>
