        <h2>CIA now says Covid-19 'more likely' to have come from lab</h2>
        <p>
The CIA says it has "low confidence" in its assessment that a "research-related origin of the Covid-19 pandemic is more likely".

            <p>The Central Intelligence Agency has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic is "more likely" to have emerged from a lab rather than from nature, an agency spokesperson said on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The agency had for years said it could not conclude whether Covid-19 was the result of a lab incident or it originated in nature. But in the final weeks of the Biden administration, former CIA director William Burns asked CIA analysts and scientists to make a clear determination, stressing the pandemic's historical significance, according to a senior US official.</p>
        
            <p>The CIA says it has "low confidence" in its assessment that a "research-related origin of the Covid-19 pandemic is more likely" and notes in its statement that both scenarios - lab origin and natural origin - remain plausible.</p>
        
            <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear the extent to which the agency has collected new intelligence on Covid-19's origins and whether that new evidence was used to formulate the latest assessment.</p>
        
            <p>China's government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine Covid-19's origin, and has accused Washington of politicising the matter, especially because of efforts by US intelligence agencies to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>Beijing has said claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic have no credibility.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with Breitbart following his confirmation by the US Senate on Friday, CIA director John Ratcliffe said one of his first priorities was getting his agency to make a public assessment on the pandemic's origins.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a day-one thing for me," he said. "I've been on record as you know in saying I think our intelligence, our science, and our common sense all really dictate that the origins of Covid was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology."</p>
