            <p>Former Black Cap Doug Bracewell received a one-month ban from cricket earlier this year, after testing postive for cocaine.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell, 34, tested positive for cocaine after playing a T20 match for Central Districts in January, the Sport Integrity Commission has revealed in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said "it was accepted that he had used the cocaine out of competition and for reasons unrelated to sport performance".</p>
        
            <p>Cocaine is banned in sport under the substances of abuse category in the sports anti-doping rules.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell was given a one-month suspension, backdated to 11 April 2024 and reduced from three months, on the condition that he completed a treatment programme to address his substance use.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell had completed the programme and the suspension had been served, meaning he can resume playing.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket chief executive Scott Weenink said Bracewell had let himself down and NZC is "frustrated at this latest turn of events".</p>
        
            <p>"Doug accepts full responsibility for his error of judgement; the consequences of his behaviour, and the penalty imposed.</p>
        
            <p>"As an organisation, we will continue to provide support for Doug - who is fully aware of our expectations moving forward," Weenink said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket Players Association chief executive Heath Mills said "while in no way attempting to gain any performance enhancement, his decision has nevertheless resulted in him missing several playing opportunities whilst this matter has been dealt with, and it reflects poorly on our environment".</p>

            <p>Sport Integrity Commission chief executive Rebecca Rolls called on athletes to act responsibly and be mindful of their influence on others.</p>
        
            <p>"Athletes have a responsibility to set a positive example ... their actions, both on and off the field, influence the next generation of athletes, and it's essential that they act as role models by making healthy, responsible choices.</p>
        
            <p>"Recreational drugs, including cocaine, are illegal and can pose a real threat to the health and safety of athletes and their team-mates. It's not always known what's in these substances or their strength, which makes them unpredictable and dangerous."</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell has played 28 tests for New Zealand, 21 ODIs and 20 T20 internationals.</p>
        
            <p>His last international match was a test against Sri Lanka in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Bracewell has a history of off-field issues, including drink-driving convictions.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017 he was sentenced to 100 hours of community work and disqualified from driving for 12 months after driving at more than three times the legal limit.</p>
        
            <p>In 2010 Bracewell he was convicted for driving with excess breath-alcohol when he was 20 years old and was sentenced to six months' supervision and disqualified from driving for eight months.</p>
        
            <p>He was first convicted of drink-driving in 2008, fined $500 and disqualified from driving for six months.</p>
