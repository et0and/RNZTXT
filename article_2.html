        <h2>Woman and child escape house fire, gang at scene</h2>
        <p>
Armed officers went to the scene of the blaze, which is being treated as "unexplained".
</p>
        
            <p>A woman and her three-year-old have escaped a fire in Auckland, while armed police went to the scene due to a gang presence.</p>
        
            <p>"[They] managed to escape the fire's wrath in the nick of time, but they were left with nothing more than the clothes on their backs," a Givealittle page set up on Friday morning said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire didn't just take their material possessions; it took away their sense of security, their comfort, the walls that housed them, their home."</p>
        
            <p>Armed police were at the scene of a blaze that tore through the home on Red Hills Road in Massey.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they attended a gang-related incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to a number of people at the cordon, including gang members, specialist police were in attendance to ensure everyone's safety.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, the fire is being treated as unexplained and enquiries by emergency services will continue this morning to determine the full circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>A man was detained for entering the scene earlier on Friday, but was released shortly after, police said.</p>
        
            <p>No arrests had been made.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were called to the fire at the two-storey home about 8.30pm on Thursday and found it well alight.</p>
        
            <p>A witness told the NZ Herald the house was "utterly destroyed".</p>
        
            <p>The fire was extinguished a few hours later.</p>
