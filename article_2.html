            <p>MPs have been told staff at national skills institute, Te Pūkenga, are "pissed off" by constant change and some polytechnics are unlikely to be financially viable.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's Education and Workforce Select Committee conducted its annual review of the institute on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>They were told the organisation, which brought together polytechnics and industry training organisations in a single entity at the start of 2023, was financially viable and expected to make a deficit of about $16 million this year, following last year's $38m loss.</p>
        
            <p>The government is disestablishing the institute and consulting on options for re-establishing polytechnics.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pūkenga chief executive Gus Gilmore said near constant change in recent years was tiring for the organisation's staff and attrition rates were unusually high.</p>
        
            <p>"This hasn't been going for six months, this has been going for five years so our people are a bit change-fatigued and a bit, frankly, pissed off," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Gilmore said supporting staff was important and through it all they had continued teaching more than 240,000 learners each year and had improved student achievement rates.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if a return to separate, local polytechnics would allow more innovation, Gilmore said he agreed but he had caveats.</p>
        
            <p>"As long as we're not duplicating across the country, as long as we're not competing like crazy with each other across the country. It's just a race to the bottom. And the old world, 10 years ago, was exactly that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Gilmore said reform of the vocational education sector should include reduced compliance with the Tertiary Education Commission .</p>
        
            <p>"The compliance workload is massive," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can find a way to work with our funder to reduce some of that compliance burden it would be a massive step forward ... you could comfortably strip out a reasonable chunk of it and you wouldn't notice a difference."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pūkenga council member Jeremy Morley said a lot of compliance related to polytechnics' $2 billion asset base and campus directors and managers were not necessarily trained in asset management.</p>
        
            <p>"There needs to be some thought go into that. How do you manage a $2b property base and the onus it puts on people on the ground who are educators," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The institute's interim chief financial officer Phil O'Callaghan said financial modelling showed only two polytechnics would be financially viable as stand-alone organisations once Te Pūkenga was disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>"Open Polytechnic and Ara were basically deemed as financially viable at this point. There were a number of other former polytechnics that are on a path to viability but work is required," he said.</p>
        
            <p>O'Callaghan said work was underway to figure out what changes institutions must make in order to ensure they could operate successfully.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unlikely that every former ITP [institute of technology and polytechnic] can be made viable," he said.</p>
