            <p>Māhia's police officer is warning beachgoers about the possibility of shark attacks after a suspected great white ripped a whale from a rescuer who was trying to refloat it.</p>
        
            <p>A mother and baby pygmy sperm whale washed up at Māhia beach on Sunday, but the shark attack ended the rescue in dramatic fashion.</p>
        
            <p>Constable Chad Prentice says while sharks are common, this kind of story is not.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly not every day that something like this happens," he told RNZ"s Midday Report on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"And, you know, I guess a lot of people would perceive it as a bit of a tall yarn because it is certainly something that's quite unheard of, especially when you're trying to refloat a whale and save it and something like that happens."</p>
        
            <p>The rescuer had the 3m-long mother pygmy sperm whale in water about belly-button deep, Prentice said, when the shark intervened.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst holding it and trying to kind of give it the breath of life, if you like, a shark has come in and hit the front end of the whale whilst he's been holding it. The shark when it's hit the front end, it's created quite a bit of damage and it's actually killed the whale instantly and created a pretty unpleasant scene.</p>
        
            <p>"The guy trying to rescue the whale has obviously had a bit of a fright, and he's let the whale go and receded back towards the beach, and within 30 seconds, the shark has come back and hit the mid region of the whale."</p>
        
            <p>The shark - approximately 5m long, according to a witness who spoke to the Hawke's Bay Today - took the entire carcass out to sea. No remains have been found, despite two days of searching, Prentice said.</p>
        
            <p>"Three metres of whale, just gone."</p>
        
            <p>In January, a pod of more than 40 whales stranded on the beach. Some of them were buried, and Prentice suspects this might have attracted the shark to the area, which is under a current shark warning from the Department of Conservation.</p>
        
            <p>A rāhui on the area had not deterred swimmers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think this is a timely reminder that it's a very real risk and it probably shouldn't be taken for granted, because for a 3m whale to just disappear, probably gives you an insight to the size of the shark that would have to do that," Prentice said, despite Sunday's event sounding like a freak incident.</p>
        
            <p>"I think as far as trying to release a whale goes and a shark hitting the whale, think that's pretty rare. But I think as far as whales and our waters in Māhia, I think that's pretty common. There's a lot of sharks in our waters and they're regularly sighted, but nothing like this has ever happened, that I'm aware of."</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Today reported the calf, left without a mother, was euthanised and frozen for scientific study.</p>
