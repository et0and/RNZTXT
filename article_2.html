            <p>In an emotional and tearful ceremony, close to 60kg of pounamu has returned to its rightful guardians, Poutini Ngāi Tahu.</p>
        
            <p>The seized pounamu, including twelve pieces taken from a passenger at Auckland Airport in 2016 and two stones seized at the International Mail Centre in 2022 were returned to manawhenua at Arahura Marae in Hokitika on 1 November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Customs Service and 'Ngāi Tahu Pounamu' said this return was a part of an ongoing joint commitment to stop the illegal trade of New Zealand taonga.</p>
        
            <p>Francois Tumahai, Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Waewae chair, said he was pleased to have their pounamu returned home.</p>
        
            <p>"Pounamu is part of who we are as Poutini Ngāi Tahu. Our tamariki are raised with an understanding of its significance and the knowledge of how to find and protect this taonga."</p>
        
            <p>While Tumahai thanked Customs for their efforts in stopping the illegal trade, he said there was an ongoing concern about attempts to unlawfully export pounamu for sale overseas.</p>

Customs has returned close to 60kg of pounamu seized at the border to its rightful guardians, Poutini Ngāi Tahu (West Coast hapū), in a special ceremony held at Arahura Marae in Hokitika.

            <p>In Aotearoa, it has been illegal to export pounamu for over 70 years, unless authorised by the Minister of Customs with written approval from Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, and support from Poutini Ngāi Tahu.</p>
        
            <p>Christine Stevenson, Comptroller of Customs said this law did not apply to smaller pieces of jewellery or souvenirs.</p>
        
            <p>"Once Customs intercepts pounamu, we go through a robust and time-consuming process to establish the legality of the export, which can result in an official seizure and forfeiture to the Crown."</p>
        
            <p>Stevenson said it had been a privilege to be a part of the ceremony of returning home pounamu taonga.</p>
        
            <p>"Customs' focus is not just on law enforcement, but also respecting pounamu as important taonga or treasure that must be protected."</p>

            <p>For centuries, pounamu has held a special place as a treasured taonga for Ngāi Tahu and their tīpuna.</p>
        
            <p>As pounamu can only be found in the South Island, the name 'Te Wai Pounamu,' meaning the greenstone waters, has deep historical roots in Aotearoa. It has been one of the traditional Māori names for the South Island, alongside Te Wāhi Pounamu (the place of pounamu), Te Waka-a-Māui (the canoe of Māui), and Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki).</p>
        
            <p>In 1997, the ownership of pounamu was officially restored to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu through the Ngāi Tahu (Pounamu Vesting) Act.</p>
        
            <p>However, Tumahai said while the Crown did give them back pounamu in 1997, "there was no compliance or any powers to go with it".</p>
        
            <p>"We're at the mercy of government departments, police, customs, and similar entities to ensure they intercept pounamu when it leaves the country or to handle compliance on our behalf."</p>
        
            <p>He said that more needed to be done, to ensure iwi had compliance over their taonga.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of it seems really easy, but for some reason, bureaucracy gets in the way and makes it more challenging than it should be."</p>
        
            <p>Tumahai said it could be as simple as granting iwi and hapū compliance powers around accessing mine sites, similar to how regional councils have enforcement officers checking on farms etc.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, it seems straightforward; however, it often feels ignored or placed in the 'too hard' basket."</p>
        
            <p>Tumahai also said carvers and purchasers of pounamu had a responsibility to ensure its authenticity.</p>
        
            <p>"Together, we can stop the illegal trade of pounamu. Please check to make sure any pounamu you buy carries a mark of authenticity and a unique traceability code from Ngāi Tahu Pounamu."</p>
        
            <p>"This guarantees the seller is licensed and the stone has not been stolen."</p>
        
            <p>Tumahai said when you enter this unique traceability code on the Ngāi Tahu Pounamu website it will identify the origin and whakapapa of the stone, alongside the name of the artist who carved it.</p>
        
            <p>"With this knowledge you can be reassured the stone has been treated according to our customs and carved with care."</p>
