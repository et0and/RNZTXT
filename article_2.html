            <p>Three large vegetation fires that broke out in North Canterbury on Friday and Saturday have been kept contained by firefighters.</p>
        
            <p>But crews are still tackling a scrub fire in Swannanoa, near Christchurch, Fire and Emergency said.</p>
        
            <p>The fire broke out about 3pm on Saturday on the side of the Waimakariri River, in deep scrub making for challenging conditions.</p>
        
            <p>By Sunday, it had been contained within an area of about 12 hectares around the river bed.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, overnight fire crews extinguished a number of hotspots at a fire in Amberley, where residents were earlier evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>The vegetation fire broke out on Friday on Racecourse Road, where it had burned through grass, tree stumps and car wrecks.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were back at work dampening the site down on Sunday using a digger and tankers.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere in Canterbury, four fires had broken out on Friday on one road at Loburn, northwest of Rangiora. They burned through about ten hectares, destroying three houses and a church.</p>
        
            <p>The fires had been contained by Saturday, and on Sunday, firefighters were in the final stages of putting out hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Hot and dry conditions, as well as wind, had contributed to a high fire risk for the region, which had been working against firefighters battling the blazes, FENZ earlier said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire restrictions or total bans were in place for most of the South Island, and any fire permits that had been issued were suspended for the rest of Canterbury until Monday because of the ongoing risk.</p>
