            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters is expressing grave concern at the unrest in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>Four people have been confirmed dead so far, there are reports of hundreds injured, numerous fires and mass looting after massive riots and armed clashes between indigenous Kanak pro-independence protesters and security forces in New Caledonia's capital Nouméa, since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>All international flights are grounded, and a state of emergency has been declared by the French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Peters said the escalating situation was of serious concern across the Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>"The immediate priority must be for all sides to take steps to de-escalate the situation, so that there can be dialogue and calm.</p>
        
            <p>"No matter your views on the political arrangements in New Caledonia, everyone should agree that violence is harmful to every community there."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was in close contact with local authorities in Nouméa and Paris, as well as Australia and Japan, Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The safety of the 170 New Zealanders registered as being in New Caledonia was of "utmost concern" to the government, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge all New Zealanders in New Caledonia to register on SafeTravel, if they have not already. New Zealanders in need of immediate consular assistance can contact the 24/7 Consular Emergency line on +64 99 20 20 20.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in regular contact with all New Zealanders registered on SafeTravel. In addition, our Consulate-General in Nouméa has been in contact with a number of New Zealanders in New Caledonia who have sought advice about the current unrest, and will continue to provide guidance to those Kiwis who need it.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders in New Caledonia are advised to avoid all protests and demonstrations. Local authorities have recommended that individuals stay in place and limit their movements wherever possible."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders in New Caledonia are being told to ask their airline for updates on travel bookings.</p>
