            <p>Outspoken Dunedin city councillor Lee Vandervis is facing a code of conduct complaint for allegedly "anti-Māori" comments.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesman confirmed an investigator's report, together with a report from the chief executive, would be considered in the public part of the council meeting on 31 July.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesman could not confirm whether the report had been shared among councillors yet, but said costs associated with the investigation totalled more than $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>Vandervis had previously revealed the existence of the complaint himself and posted a copy of it, as well as related material, on his website.</p>
        
            <p>The material showed he objected to marae protocol "compliance requirements", a hui agenda that was "not understandable" by non-Māori speakers and to an expectation he sing waiata.</p>
        
            <p>Vandervis also took issue with Claude Monet's La Debacle work being accompanied by "irrelevant Māorified text" at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.</p>
        
            <p>The complaint has been laid by councillor Marie Laufiso.</p>
        
            <p>Laufiso confirmed she had received the report, but said she would wait until it was officially released before commenting on the findings.</p>
        
            <p>In lodging her complaint in November, Laufiso wrote: "In the wake of the March 15th (2019) terror attacks in which 51 Ōtautahi Christchurch Muslims were murdered and 40 injured, council adopted a position of 'zero tolerance' towards racism."</p>
        
            <p>She raised concerns about what she said was an enduring pattern of behaviour from Vandervis, including mispronouncing the word "Māori".</p>
        
            <p>The council had a forum called Te Pae Māori.</p>
        
            <p>By refusing to participate, Vandervis was failing in his duty to be available to listen and respond openly and honestly to community concerns, she said.</p>
        
            <p>A key point of disharmony goes back to meetings of Te Pae Māori in July and October and commentary from Vandervis in the leadup, the Otago Daily Times has previously reported.</p>
        
            <p>Vandervis could not be reached for comment on Friday.</p>
