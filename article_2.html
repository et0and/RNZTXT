            <p>Incoming prime minister Christopher Luxon says it is "highly unlikely" he will attend APEC in San Francisco this week.</p>
        
            <p>But someone from the caretaker government would be attending the summit</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Morning Report progress was being made as coalition talks with ACT and New Zealand First entered the second week after confirmation of the final election result.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be nice to go, but the must-do is actually forming a strong and stable government, that is really my job.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be opportunities for me to build bilateral relationships and also to signal to the business community around the world that we're open for business again in New Zealand, but ... that's a 'nice to do', the 'must do' is actually forming a government."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins and his government ministers have been re-sworn into their roles as caretakers and Luxon said it would be up to Hipkins who represented New Zealand at APEC.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a decision for the government and there'll be someone from the caretaker government representing."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was "very comfortable" the outgoing government could represent New Zealand well at APEC.</p>
        
            <p>"By-and-large ... we have a pretty bilateral approach to foreign affairs."</p>
        
            <p>Had he been able to attend himself, Luxon said his key messages would have been around New Zealand being "open for business again".</p>
        
            <p>"There's obviously a big economic and business focus to APEC and I wanted to signal very strongly that we are open for business again and that we want to hustle in the world and we want to drive trade much harder."</p>
        
            <p>The ongoing discussions between National, ACT and New Zealand First had been held in a "very constructive, very productive way", Luxon said, and trade-offs were required from "everybody, at some level".</p>

            <p>"The good news is that we have very good alignment around our big goals - around how we strengthen the economy, law and order, deliver better public services, strengthen democracy in New Zealand and more unity and so those are all good things."</p>
        
            <p>Each party had a slightly different take on how best to deliver those things, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pleased with the progress and the direction of travel, but we do now need go get things closed out."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon repeated his party's commitment to delivering tax relief to lower and middle-income New Zealanders but would not be drawn on how they would be funded.</p>
        
            <p>"That is a key thing that we campaigned on - we will deliver tax relief to low and middle-income New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>However he was not prepared to discuss anything that was talked about by the parties' leaders in coalition discussions.</p>
        
            <p>"We're acting in good faith and with goodwill with each other."</p>
