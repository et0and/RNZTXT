            <p>UK DJ Fred again .. has arrived in Wellington and confirmed he will be playing a show in the city.</p>
        
            <p>There had been wide speculation that he will play a gig in the Capital on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The British music artist has been touring Australia for the past few weeks performing in cities such as Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Ever since he started performing across the ditch speculation had been building of whether he would perform shows in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Fred again .. (yes, that's his artist name) or Fred Gibson is a popular DJ, producer, singer and multi-instrumentalist that has been making waves in the music scene over the past few years - particularly through his Actual Life series of albums.</p>
        
            <p>Songs from these albums often see footage or songs from other artists remixed into new tunes for the album.</p>
        
            <p>Popular songs from this series include Delilah (pull me out of this) and Marea (we've lost dancing). </p>
        
            <p>He has won two Grammys, Best Dance/Electronic Music Album for his record Actual Life 3 and Best Dance/Electronic Recording for the song Rumble.</p>
        
            <p>He has also collaborated with other famous artists such as US rappers Baby Keem and Lil Yachty.</p>
        
            <p>Notable shows for the 30-year-old have been his Boiler Room show (Boiler Room is a popular promoter for electronic music) and his Coachella performance of 2023 where he performed alongside DJs Skrillex and Four Tet.</p>
        
            <p>He did two shows in Wellington last year - one of which was a surprise performance at a small venue.</p>
        
            <p>At that surprise show he told Wellingtonians in the crowd that he could not wait to come back.</p>
        
            <p>He was meant to perform at Auckland's Laneway Festival as part of that tour, but it did not go ahead due to the Auckland Anniversary Floods.</p>
        
            <p>Fred again.. is known for his seemingly impromptu shows when on tour and often likes to play at small gigs alongside the big shows.</p>
        
            <p>He recently posted on social media that he wanted to do more this year to support small venues.</p>
        
            <p>Rumours of New Zealand shows intensified when a stage from last week's Homegrown festival on the Wellington Waterfront was left standing at Waitangi Park when the rest of the event was packed down.</p>
