            <p>Heavy rain and thunderstorms hit much of the North Island overnight, but the bad weather receded as dawn broke.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, the heavy rain stopped about 5am.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said all weather watches and warnings associated with the front - which brought heavy rain and strong winds overnight - had been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>But strong westerlies persisted, with embedded fronts bringing rain to the lower South Island.</p>
        
            <p>From midday, the Westland District, Fiordland and Otago could expect heavy rain, with a high chance of upgrading to warning level. There will also be northwest winds, which may approach severe gale in exposed places in Otago.</p>
        
            <p>In Northland, about 290 homes in the Raupo and Pouto areas were without power after lightning strikes. Northpower said engineers were working on the fault.</p>
        
            <p>Vector's outage map showed unplanned cuts in the far north of the Auckland region, around Pakiri and Wellsford, and in eastern parts of Waiheke Island.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington there was surface flooding in the central city on Saturday night, but the rain had since stopped.</p>
        
            <p>Fallen trees across State Highway 6 between Inangahua and Lower Buller Gorge on the West Coast forced it to close.</p>
        
            <p>A power outage was planned for Westport around 11am to carry out emergency repairs after a lightning storm.</p>
