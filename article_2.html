        <h2>False dawn? Another unwanted Crusaders milestone in Super Rugby Pacific</h2>
        <p>
Things were supposed to get better for the defending champs, while the Highlanders go for a swim and TJ claims a record. Video

            <p>They have a tradition at Apollo Projects Stadium of cheering whenever a ball from the field of play is kicked into the stands and a spectator catches it. You can hear on the TV feed, they usually cut to a shot of the proudly beaming Crusaders fan getting pats on the back, all while the ground announcer gets ready to fire up another rendition of 'Sweet Caroline'.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland Reds replacement Lawson Creighton had the distinction of being the first player in a long time to not have that happen when he slammed the ball into the fifteenth row, though.</p>
        
            <p>His kick tumbled out of the sky and landed in someone's hands, a feat this time met with stunned silence. That's because the clock had just ticked past 80 minutes and his side had held on for a 32-28 win, their first in Christchurch in 25 years. Creighton wasn't even a year old when that happened, and more than a few of his teammates hadn't even been born.</p>
        
            <p>All of them, most notably Harry Wilson, Fraser McReight and 'Junkyard Dawg' Tim Ryan, played their part in not only a landmark victory, but another thoroughly entertaining game of Super Rugby Pacific. Unfortunately for the home side, a few of their key men weren't able to in return and that's ultimately what made the difference.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Barrett and Brodie McAlister retired from the game early in the first half and Ethan Blackadder never even made it onto the field. That meant that Rob Penney's side resembled the one that had dropped their first six games in a row, rather than the one that had come back with a vengeance last weekend against the Rebels. There was one exception with David Havili playing first five, a positional switch requested by Scott Robertson, but that experiment was best summed up when his second half clearing kick was turned into a crucial Reds try when it was charged down by Wilson.</p>
        
            <p>What now? The loss leaves the defending champions 10th on the ladder, with away games to the Highlanders and Brumbies followed by two games at home against the Blues and Moana Pasifika. They will need to win all of them, because it's not just about scraping into the top eight anymore - you'd think if they don't accumulate enough points to get into the middle of the pack, the Crusaders' participation in the playoffs is only going to last one weekend anyway.</p>

            <p>The good news for South Island rugby is that the Highlanders have now won two in a row, so their derby match against the Crusaders next weekend in Dunedin will have more of a hopeful feel about it. The Highlanders haven't beaten their neighbours at Forsyth Barr Stadium since 2018, so the reversal of fortunes should see a decent crowd get in to see what transpires.</p>
        
            <p>They had to battle the elements as well as Moana Pasifika for their 28-17 win in Nuku'alofa, the second game held in the islands this year to be struck by a torrential downpour. At least it looked like fun, although the similarity of the jerseys did make things difficult to watch at times. But hey, it was the Highlanders' heritage jersey and kit clashes are very much a part of Super Rugby's heritage, so maybe it was fitting.</p>
        
            <p>The Chiefs laid waste to the Force 56-7 in Hamilton. It came at a cost with</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie not returning from an HIA and Samipeni Finau leaving with an arm injury, but the slight positive is that McKenzie likely would have skipped next Friday's game with Moana Pasifika anyway. Josh Ioane has had a career that you'd have to say hasn't gone according to plan since his one appearance as an All Black in 2019, so it will be interesting to see if Clayton McMillan gives him the responsibility of starting at 10.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, regular transmission resumed (at least regular for 2024) in Wellington, where the Canes flogged the Waratahs 41-12. Perhaps Tahs coach Darren Coleman could try hypnotherapy for his team to make them think they're playing the Crusaders every weekend - so far their two meetings are the only wins the Tahs have had so far this season.</p>
        
            <p>TJ Perenara finally claimed the Super Rugby all time record when he scored his 62nd career try to overtake former teammate Julian Savea. Once again, it is worth mentioning how many less matches Israel Folau took to set the previous record of 60 (96 to Perenara's 158), however it's astounding that Perenara has managed to even get anywhere near it playing at halfback.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara's form has brought forth serious talk of a recall to the All Blacks, but for now attention turns to a mammoth clash next weekend at Eden Park. The Blues and Canes will play out a game with serious ramifications for home advantage at the very end in a weekend of intriguing derbies, a key match-up will be up in the coaches' box where rookie Clark Laidlaw takes on wily veteran Vern Cotter.</p>
