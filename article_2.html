            <p>A police officer has been praised for saving lives by approaching and shooting an alleged armed attacker in a Sydney shopping mall.</p>
        
            <p>A critical incident has been declared after a man entered Westfield Bondi Junction Shopping Centre after 3pm (local time) on Saturday and began stabbing people.</p>
        
            <p>Five victims and the alleged attacker are dead. More victims have been taken to hospital in serious or critical conditions.</p>
        
            <p>A small child, reported to be nine months old, was one of the injured.</p>
        
            <p>In a press conference, New South Wales Police assistant commissioner Anthony Cooke said a "single unit officer" attended the scene after multiple reports.</p>
        
            <p>The inspector, who had been nearby, immediately approached the alleged offender, after being directed by members of the public inside the centre, he said.</p>

            <p>"She confronted the offender who had moved by this stage to level five, as she continued to walk quickly behind him to catch up with him, he turned, faced her, raised a knife, she discharged a firearm and that person is now deceased."</p>
        
            <p>Cooke said the actions she took saved "a range of people's lives".</p>
        
            <p>Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese also praised the "bravery" of the officer.</p>
        
            <p>"She is certainly a hero," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no doubt that she saved lives through her actions."</p>
        
            <p>Cooke told media he did not have any information about the man's identity and they did not yet know who he was.</p>
        
            <p>There was no indication at the scene of the offender's motive but police had not ruled anything out, including terrorism.</p>
