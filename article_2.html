            <p>An earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Vanuatu's capital Port Vila at a depth of 10km on Tuesday, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.</p>
        
            <p>Footage posted on social media showed buckled windows and collapsed concrete pillars on a building hosting foreign embassies in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>One showed damage to a building containing embassies for the US, UK, France and New Zealand. A sign on the front of the building matched that listed on the New Zealand High Commission to Vanuatu's website. French news agency AFP reported it had verified the video as legitimate.</p>
        
            <p>Another video showed a building on the city's main street had partially collapsed and crushed vehicles underneath, ABC News reported.</p>
        
            <p>An image posted to social media appeared to show a landslide had buried part of Port Vila's wharf, ABC said, and witnesses have reported major landslides near the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu government websites were offline in the aftermath of the quake, CNN reported.</p>
        
            <p>Dan McGarry, a local journalist in Port Vila, said it was a "violent, high-frequency shake" that lasted for about 30 seconds, ABC reported. He said there were sirens being heard around the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Following the earthquake, the US Tsunami Warning System issued a warning, which it later cancelled, CNN said. There were no tsunami threats reported in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The MInistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was "monitoring the developing situation in Vanuatu".</p>
        
            <p>"There are 37 New Zealanders registered on SafeTravel as being in Vanuatu," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders there should follow the advice of authorities. Anyone in need of consular assistance should contact the 24/7 emergency consular line on +64 99 202020."</p>
        
            <p>Director of the NZ National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) John Price said if there are aftershocks, the tsunami threat would be re-assessed.</p>
        
            <p>"We also have our dart buoy network that will trigger if there is any activity at sea, which would indicate a possible tsunami wave. There is no indication that there will be any land threat, that means any threat of tsunami hitting New Zealand land."</p>
        
            <p>He said marine and beach areas were still being assessed for unusual currents.</p>
