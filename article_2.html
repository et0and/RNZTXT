            <p>Before forming the instrumental rock trio Dirty Three in the early '90s, Australian musician Warren Ellis was feeling lost and in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>Then the former teacher, street busker and addict started playing his violin with Mick Turner and Jim White - "pretty single-minded musicians" who, like him, valued their freedom.</p>
        
            <p>"When we came together it was so incredibly exciting and so good for the soul… I found some peace which I hadn't found I hadn't felt before. I guess my heart was opened up to something that I never thought I would experience."</p>
        
            <p>Warren Ellis talks to Maggie Tweedie about his spiritual connection to music and Dirty Three's expansive new record Love Changes Everything.</p>
        
            <p>Ellis says when he went to church as a kid, he always hoped God would appear.</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to see something, you know, I wanted to believe and that didn't happen … Music presented itself as some sort of spiritual voice for me and helped me navigate the world. I could find peace and I could find violence and I could find sadness, I could find what I needed.</p>
        
            <p>When Ellis gave up alcohol and heroin, he found it hard to accept a higher power but he could accept music and even use it to find the strength to stop drinking.</p>
        
            <p>"Music for me was the thing that allowed me to feel like I was tapping into something greater than the physical world."</p>

            <p>As a young man, he says it wasnt always clear music was his path.</p>
        
            <p>He trained and worked as a teacher briefly, busked around Europe, and often found himself wondering 'What am I going to do with my life?'</p>
        
            <p>"When I started playing music in a band, I didn't ask that question anymore. That was a great relief to not be wondering what I was doing."</p>
        
            <p>In the late '80s, as a violinist "making a loud noise" Ellis attracted attention from fellow musicians who wanted to play with him.</p>
        
            <p>Very quickly he found myself in five or six bands including, early on, Dirty Three.</p>
        
            <p>Playing with Turner and White was "just so exciting" because all three band members did literally whatever they wanted to do, Ellis says.</p>
        
            <p>This spirit continues now, as the bandmates understand each other's need step out and do other things.</p>
        
            <p>For Ellis that's playing with Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds and composing film scores, for White it's playing with different bands and for Turner that's painting.</p>
        
            <p>None of Dirty Three live in the same country, Ellis says, so It has became harder to get together, but they always find a way to get together and do what they do.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit like leaving home or something. You know, it's nice to know you can come back."</p>
