        <h2>'No new guns' added to NZ, Luxon says on anniversary of attack</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister spoke on the mosque attack anniversary, and defended the government's plan to rewrite the Arms Act.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has spoken from Christchurch on the five-year anniversary of the terror attacks against the city's mosques.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the government will continue its review of the Arms Act, but the government has said there "will be no new guns added into New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon called today a day for remembering and reflecting, but the government will also soon come together to make final recommendations from the inquiry into the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury's Muslim community were expected to commemorate the events, with the date this year falling on a Friday - the day of the mandatory Jumu'ah prayer targeted by the gunman.</p>
        
            <p>The attacks in 2019 left 51 worshippers at Masjid Annur and the Linwood Islamic Centre dead or motally wounded.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon met with Muslim leaders on Tuesday, after they sought assurances any changes to gun laws would not put their safety at risk.</p>
