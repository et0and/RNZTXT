            <p>A pregnant woman's doctor should not have sent her home with abdominal pain and signs of infection, an investigation has found.</p>
        
            <p>The consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist breached the woman's rights when he sent her home despite showing red-flag symptoms, Deputy Health and Disability Commissioner Rose Wall said.</p>
        
            <p>The woman who was 33 weeks pregnant went to a public hospital in 2021 with abdominal pain and her waters broken. She then received treatment and medication before being discharged.</p>
        
            <p>When she went to a scheduled scan four days later, her discharge had turned green and her pain remained. Instead, she was sent home with an induction booked two weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>She returned the next day as contractions had started, but her baby died in utero and she delivered them vaginally.</p>
        
            <p>Wall said she was critical that the woman was discharged with ongoing abdominal pain and green discharge.</p>
        
            <p>"Chorioamnionitis can present subtly and develop rapidly. This would have placed the wellbeing of her foetus at risk," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"For this reason, I would have expected Dr C to arrange for [the woman] to be admitted to the maternity unit for full investigations to be undertaken.</p>
        
            <p>"This did not occur."</p>
        
            <p>In the commissioner's report, the woman's doctor said she should not have been discharged and should have been sent to the Maternity Unit for further assessment.</p>
        
            <p>"I still cannot think of any human factors that might be relevant as, although they would not have excused my mistake, they might have explained why it occurred. Their absence is a concern to me, as I really would like to understand why I made such a basic mistake," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot reverse it but would like to have better confidence that I wouldn't make such a mistake again."</p>
        
            <p>Wall recommended that he used this report as a basis for a case study presentation at Health NZ Te Whatu Ora, focusing on the breach identified, the decision or actions taken, the result and the action that should have been taken.</p>
        
            <p>She also recommended that Health NZ update its obstetric orientation to stress the importance of assessing patients who might have an infection.</p>
