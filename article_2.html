            <p>The director of the Gaza Strip's main hospital raided by Israeli soldiers says the facility has now run out of oxygen and water, and patients "are screaming from thirst".</p>
        
            <p>Muhammad Abu Salmiya said the conditions were "tragic" in Al-Shifa, where there were more than 650 patients, 500 medical staff and 5000 displaced people.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli tanks were surrounding the hospital in Gaza City, he said, with drones buzzing overhead and Israeli soldiers still moving around inside, as their search of the complex lasted a second day.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's army said its operation against Hamas was proceeding in a "discreet, methodical and thorough manner". However a journalist trapped inside the hospital, Khader, told the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf by phone that Israeli troops were "everywhere, shooting in all directions".</p>
        
            <p>The BBC has not been able to independently verify either of the reports.</p>
        
            <p>Since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched their raid on Al-Shifa early on Wednesday, they have released several photos and videos of what they say are Hamas weapons and equipment.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday they said they had found an "operational tunnel shaft and a vehicle containing a large number of weapons".</p>
        
            <p>Abu Salmiya said Israeli troops had blown up Al-Shifa's main water line.</p>
        
            <p>"Sniping operations continue, no-one can move from one building to another, and we have lost communication with our colleagues," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Thursday, Khader told the BBC that Israeli troops had "stormed all departments", destroying the southern part of the building's wall and dozens of cars.</p>
        
            <p>Before Khader's phone line cut off, he also said that armoured bulldozers had been brought in.</p>
        
            <p>Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry reports that Israeli bulldozers "destroyed parts of the southern entrance" of the medical complex.</p>
        
            <p>Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group, as does the UK, US and European Union.</p>
        
            <p>At least 1200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage.</p>
        
            <p>Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the UN has warned of a "humanitarian disaster".</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday evening, the IDF announced that the body of one of the hostages had been found near Al-Shifa.</p>
        
            <p>The IDF identified the victim as Yehudit Weiss, saying she had been kidnapped from her home in Be'eri - a kibbutz in southern Israel.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, there have been reports of a major phone and internet outage in Gaza believed to have been caused by telecom companies running out of fuel supplies.</p>
        
            <p>The IDF said their soldiers were continuing their "complex" operation against Hamas at the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Soldiers are proceeding one building at a time, searching each floor, all while hundreds of patients and medical staff remain in the complex," an official said in an update on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The official reiterated the IDF's claim that there was a "well-hidden terrorist infrastructure in the complex".</p>
        
            <p>Hamas has repeatedly denied that its fighters have been operating inside the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Osama Hamdan, the most senior Hamas leader in Lebanon, ridiculed the Israeli weapons claims, saying that all the arms had been brought in and planted in the hospital by Israelis.</p>
        
            <p>Asked by the BBC why progress on talks to release hostages had failed, he said that on three occasions they had been close to a deal but each time it had been stopped by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
        
            <p>The Israeli government has not commented on Hamdan's allegation.</p>
        
            <p>In a separate development, Israel has dropped dropped leaflets in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza, warning people in four towns to evacuate their homes and head to shelters.</p>
        
            <p>If that is an indication of an upcoming military operation around the southern city of Khan Younis, it could be a real concern to the hundreds of thousands now sheltering there.</p>
        
            <p>Before the war, Khan Younis was home to about 300,000 people - a number that has now grown to one million after Israel urged civilians to move south for their safety.</p>
