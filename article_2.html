            <p>The Whanganui motor sport community is paying tribute to Eugene Robbemond who, according to media reports, has been killed during a robbery in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>Local media outlet The Daily Voice reported a man was trying to stop a robbery in Monte Vista and shot dead.</p>
        
            <p>Police spokesman Malcolm Pojie confirmed to The Daily Voice the man was 49-years-old and died around 1.30pm on Friday on Mostert Street in Monte Vista.</p>
        
            <p>"We have reason to believe that it was a bank-following-robbery as the motive, even though the suspects fled the scene without any loot," the outlet reported Pojie as saying.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicles of the suspects were traced and recovered in a parking lot in Parow."</p>
        
            <p>The Daily Voice reported the dead man's parents were the intended victims of the robbery - having returned from shopping mall N1 City with a large amount of money and followed by the offenders.</p>
        
            <p>A local resident told the media outlet the offenders shot the man after he threw a large sledgehammer at their vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said consular officials were "providing advice to the family of a New Zealander who died in South Africa".</p>
        
            <p>"For privacy reasons, no further information will be provided."</p>
        
            <p>Reon Greaves, who ran the Whanganui Superstock Team Racing's Facebook page, said he had known Robbemond for 16 years.</p>
        
            <p>"Eugene was a truly one-of-a-kind person who could brighten even the toughest days with his smile and laughter.</p>
        
            <p>"He was the heart of our team, always refusing to give up and fighting to the end, both on and off the racing track. I feel honoured to have had him by my side in countless battles, and I'll always cherish the memories of our time together."</p>
        
            <p>An announcement on the group's Facebook page acknowledged Robbemond's family.</p>
        
            <p>"Eugene was a beloved dad to Landon but also a very special friend, buddy, teammate and partner whose kindness, generosity, and laughter touched the lives of all who knew him."</p>
        
            <p>Greaves said the South African - who's race number was 33 - would not be forgotten.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll deeply miss my brother Eugene's warm welcomes, our long conversations, and our problem-solving sessions together. Rest easy, buddy."</p>
        
            <p>He said he would personally see that a memorial trophy was created so his mate's legacy would live on into the future.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Dixon also posted on the page.</p>
        
            <p>"Eugene Robbemond gone to soon buddy I will miss our long calls, our small arguments about who gets to smash who on the track. All the jokes that sometimes none of us really understood because of your wicked sense of humour</p>
        
            <p>"At least you can be reunited with our mate Darren Stephens and I'm sure the both of you will be up to no good upstairs at the big race track in the sky I hope they have enough beer and Camrys for you. Until we meet again, buddy. RIP 33."</p>
