            <p>A total solar eclipse was seen by millions of people across North America.</p>
        
            <p>Where there were clear skies, stargazers the direct path of the eclipse were treated to the rare spectacle of the moon appearing as a dark orb creeping in front of the sun, briefly blocking out all but a brilliant halo of light, or corona, around, the sun's outer edge.</p>
        
            <p>The period of total eclipse lasted up to four-and-a-half minutes depending the observer's location.</p>
        
            <p>The Mexican beachside resort town of Mazatlan was the first major viewing spot along the "path of totality", which included New York City and Niagra Falls.</p>
