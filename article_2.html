        <h2>Kiwi Olympian to take on 'one of the scariest waves in the world'</h2>
        <p>
Billy Stairmand is heading to Tahiti as part of the two-athlete NZ team.
</p>
        
            <p>Eight-time national surf champion Billy Stairmand will have his work cut out for him when he takes on one of the most feared surf breaks at the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>A strong crowd of family, friends and locals were out at Manu Bay in Raglan on Thursday morning to cheer Stairmand on, following his selection to represent New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Stairmand and Saffi Vette have both been named for the surfing competition to be held at the infamous Teahupo'o in Tahiti.</p>
        
            <p>"So cool to have my dad and my family here. The Surf Academy too - I went to the Raglan Area School Surf Academy here when I was a grommet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I got pretty emotional up there earlier, and it means a lot to me representing New Zealand on the world stage - as an Olympian as well."</p>

            <p>Stairmand described the wave as "a totally different beast".</p>
        
            <p>"On its day it gets pretty big - it's one of the scariest waves in the world."</p>
        
            <p>This is not his first time competing at the Olympic level, having represented New Zealand at the Tokyo 2020 games, but he felt this time was different.</p>
        
            <p>"Being part of the Olympics for the first time was a pretty special moment - but I think this is a bit more special."</p>
        
            <p>As he prepared to face some stiff competition, Stairmand said he had to keep working hard.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously I'm getting a little bit older and there's some really good younger competitors," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tahiti is quite close for us here in New Zealand. For me, I'm going to spend more time at the wave itself; get used to the conditions, the people, the scenery.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully it will give me a little bit of an advantage and give me that confidence to get that medal."</p>
        
            <p>The competition takes place over nine days from 27 July to 4 August.</p>
