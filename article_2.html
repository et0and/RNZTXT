        <h2>Canada should become part of US, Trump says as Trudeau resigns</h2>

            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that he intends to step down as leader of the ruling Liberals after nine years in office but will stay on in his post until the party chooses a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March.</p>
        
            <p>That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on 20 January when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy.</p>
        
            <p>"I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process," Trudeau said.</p>
        
            <p>"This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election."</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 and won re-election twice, becoming one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers.</p>
        
            <p>But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered.</p>
        
            <p>Polls show the Liberals will badly lose to the official opposition Conservatives in an election that must be held by late October, regardless of who the leader is.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament was due to resume on 27 January and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March.</p>

            <p>But if Parliament does not return until 24 March, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau made his remarks in a live address a short time ago.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau had until recently been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the poor showing in polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections last year.</p>
        
            <p>But calls for him to step aside have soared since last month, when he tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending.</p>
        
            <p>Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of "political gimmicks" rather than focusing on what was best for the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal Party should also decrease the level of polarisation that we're seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics," Trudeau said.</p>
        
            <p>The Conservatives are led by Pierre Poilievre, a career politician who rose to prominence in early 2022 when he supported truck drivers who took over the centre of Ottawa as part of a protest against Covid-19 vaccine mandates.</p>

            <p>Among reactions to Trudeau's resignation was this one from US President-elect Donald Trump:</p>
        
            <p>"Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned. If Canada merged with the US, there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them. Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!"</p>
        
            <p>Canada's Conservative Party oppostion leader Pierre Poilievre said nothing had changed.</p>
        
            <p>"Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin.</p>
        
            <p>"The only way to fix what Liberals broke is a carbon tax election to elect common sense Conservatives who will bring home Canada's promise."</p>
        
            <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford said: "President-elect Trump continues to make real threats about imposing sweeping tariffs that would devastate Canada's economy.</p>
        
            <p>"Canada needs to demonstrate stability and strength at this critical moment, and the federal government must urgently explain to Canadians how they will avoid tariffs that could have devastating effects on our economy."</p>
        
            <p>Former Finance minister Chrystia Freeland said: "I thank Justin Trudeau for his years of service to Canada and Canadians. I wish him and his family the very best."</p>
        
            <p>Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: "Thank you Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for your leadership, for your many contributions to Canada, and for the sacrifices you and your family have made for public service.</p>
        
            <p>"Wishing you the best for your next chapters."</p>
