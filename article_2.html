            <p>Buckingham Palace published a new photograph of King Charles wearing a kilt made of a tartan named in his honour to mark the birthday of Scotland's national poet Robert Burns on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Burns Night is an annual celebration of the poet, who was born in 1759 and died in 1796.</p>

            <p>In the photograph, taken last autumn, the 76-year-old king appears standing in the library at Balmoral Castle, the royal family's summer retreat in the Scottish Highlands.</p>
        
            <p>The monarch is seen wearing a kilt in the King Charles III tartan, which was designed by the Scottish Tartans Authority in May 2023, and a tie in matching colours.</p>
        
            <p>The palace revealed in February 2024 that Charles, who became king in 2022, had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer detected in tests after a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate.</p>
        
            <p>His treatment has been progressing well and would continue this year, a palace source said late last year.</p>
