            <p>The Ministry of Education is failing to meet its obligations to find alternative roles for staff it is making redundant, the Public Service Association (PSA) says.</p>
        
            <p>The union says the ministry has identified at least 605 roles to be cut so far, as part of the government's plan to downsize the public service.</p>
        
            <p>As of December, the ministry employed 4509 total staff, and it was initially reported that 755 jobs were on the line.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA said the cuts extended to regional offices, the curriculum centre, central services, and staff who worked directly with the education sector.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said the ministry had a history of relying on contractors to plug gaps, and the collective agreement set out expectations for redeploying staff.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry hasn't set up the required processes and systems to identify redeployment opportunities, either within the ministry or outside it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said there were more decisions to be made regarding further cuts, and was expecting more roles to go.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA would be requiring strict compliance with the collective agreement from the ministry around helping its staff into new roles.</p>
        
            <p>"The provisions in the collective agreement are humane provisions designed to make the best use of talented education experts, and to recognise the traumatic consequences that a loss of livelihood has on people."</p>
        
            <p>"Some of these people are former teachers, others are curriculum experts," Fitzsimons said. "Work is available, and people should be supported into it."</p>
        
            <p>The ministry would not confirm the number of jobs it was cutting at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Education corporate leader Zoe Griffiths said: "We are at different stages of the change process across the ministry with some decision documents released to staff today.</p>
        
            <p>"Our initial proposal was for 755 FTE positions across the ministry, with 316 of these roles currently vacant and when the process is completed we will know the final number."</p>
        
            <p>Griffiths confirmed they were engaging with the PSA regarding obligations under the collective agreement.</p>
