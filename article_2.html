        <h2>Watch: Auckland's Gulf Harbour Country Club building on fire</h2>
        <p>
A local resident saw the blaze from his bedroom window says the flames kept "getting bigger and bigger".
</p>
        
            <p>A golf shop at the vacant Gulf Harbour Country Club caught fire overnight, and was extinguished by six crews.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said they sent four engines just before 3am after receiving multiple calls.</p>
        
            <p>Those crews called for back-up while en route.</p>
        
            <p>A total of six crews worked on the blaze at the golf shop which was about 10sqm in size. It was put out just after 4am.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would be returning to the scene this morning.</p>

            <p>Local resident Greg Taylor, whose home was about 400 metres from the scene of the fire, said he woke to see the blaze from his bedroom window.</p>
        
            <p>"It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he wasn't too surprised given the buildings had been empty since the middle of last year.</p>
        
            <p>He feared the main country club building would be next.</p>
        
            <p>"The building itself is completely abandoned, just about every window's been smashed."</p>
        
            <p>Residents had reported it to police and the council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>The club, a former training ground of world champion Lydia Ko, was abruptly closed last July.</p>
        
            <p>Plans to redevelop the golf course and country club have been off and on, and an application was made to put it's owners into liquidation in April.</p>
        
            <p>The club and its redevelopment has sparked a strong reaction from local residents who formed a society to challenge any possible redevelopment into housing.</p>
