        <h2>More snow forecast before frosty start for the south</h2>
        <p>
New snowfall warnings have been issued for overnight, but sunshine on Wednesday should bring short reprieve.

            <p>Major roads affected by the wild weather will remain closed overnight, while snow warnings continue through to Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy snow watch is in place for Central Otago for six hours from 9pm Monday to 3am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Snowfall could approach warning criteria in places above about 300 metres, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple snowfall road warnings have also been issued.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, widespread frost was forecast across much of the South Island and the central and eastern North Island on Tuesday morning, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Even those in urban areas should prepare to rug up warm with temperatures dipping well below zero, like the -4°C start to the day expected in Christchurch.</p>

            <p>State Highway 2 between Waiotahi Valley Back Road and Paerata Ridge Road near Ōpōtiki was closed due to a large slip at Waiotahe Beach.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency said the slip was still moving on Monday afternoon, making it unsafe for any repairs beyond a geotechnical risk assessment.</p>
        
            <p>Pōhutukawa trees above the slip face were very precarious and needed to be removed before any slip clearance could begin, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Arborists were set to start removing the dangerous trees on Tuesday morning allowing NZTA contractors to begin clearing the earth and debris as soon as it was safe to do so.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 56 between Tane Road and Alve Road in Ōpiki will also remain closed overnight due to flooding, until at least late Tuesday afternoon when it will be reassessed.</p>
        
            <p>River levels above threshold levels around the Waihenga Bridge in the Wairarapa is also forcing the closure of State Highway 53 overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, wind gusts reached 141kmph at Nugget Point in Otago and 105kmph at Cape Reinga at the top of the country on Monday.</p>
        
            <p> Where is the wind windiest? Well, look no further, because here are the stats up to 3pm Strong, blustery winds are forecast to ease overnight in affected areasℹ More details on the forecast at https://t.co/hnwmGxCYeR pic.twitter.com/JHRQS4fLWV</p>
        
            <p>The Moutoa floodgates also remained open overnight to continue relieving pressure on the Manawatū River.</p>
        
            <p>Horizons Regional Council incident controller Sarah Carswell said rainfall across the region has eased since the weekend, with no rain warnings currently in place and scattered showers forecast for the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking at current river levels and forecast rain, we expect the gates to remain open overnight," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Sunshine on Wednesday would provide a welcome break from the cold with a ridge of high pressure bringing settled weather and double-digit daytime temperatures for most regions.</p>
        
            <p>But winds and wet weather were forecast to increase over the South Island on Thursday, gradually spreading to the North Island by Friday and Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"To go from snow to sunshine back to blustery winds all in a matter of days? It's yo-yo weather at its finest," MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said.</p>
