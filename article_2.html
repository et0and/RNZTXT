            <p>A Bluebridge ferry passenger says people were plunged into darkness when a ship briefly lost power coming into Wellington Harbour on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Harbourmaster Grant Nalder said the ferry had a problem on board which caused it to lose power about 4.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>"They passed that on, assistance was called, there was a tug heading out towards them. They actually resolved it themselves, got power on, carried on up towards the berth and used the tug as a precaution getting into the berth," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They [Bluebridge] are now looking into it themselves to assess what happened and why it happened."</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on board told RNZ the ferry gave a "great shudder" and stopped, and all the lights went off.</p>
        
            <p>They said passengers were told the ferry had lost control of the engine, and it was resolved after about 10 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, StraitNZ Bluebridge spokesperson Will Dady confirmed the Strait Feronia ship briefly lost power in Wellington Harbour, before being restarted minutes later and continuing on to port.</p>
        
            <p>Dady said the power outage was caused by a minor electrical fault which had since been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>The Harbourmaster requested a tug to accompany the ship in to berth as a precaution, which was standard procedure, he said.</p>
