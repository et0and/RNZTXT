            <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has warned of the possibility fires raging towards Gallipoli may reach the graves of Australian soldiers at Anzac Cove.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts today are also with our friends in Türkiye. We understand there are efforts underway to control fires that are burning on the Gallipoli Peninsula," Albanese said in a press conference on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Gallipoli is, of course, sacred ground to both of our countries.</p>
        
            <p>"Some 60,000 Australians served at Gallipoli during the eight-month campaign, and 8700 Australians lost their lives," he said, referring to the Gallipoli campaign of World War I.</p>
        
            <p>"Eighteen thousand were wounded during the campaign. And there were more than 7200 Australians buried in cemeteries or listed as missing there.</p>
        
            <p>"So our thoughts today are with those who continue to care for those cemeteries, and welcome thousands of Australians who visit Anzacheadstones each year, as they endure these difficult times."</p>
        
            <p>About one in six New Zealanders who landed on the peninsula - 2779 people - also died.</p>
        
            <p>Drone video posted by the Turkish news agency IHA showed much of the area had been scorched, with large swathes of blackened scrub visible.</p>
        
            <p>IHA said the fire began near the village of Büyükanafarta on Thursday morning (local time) and grew with the wind, before spreading into the forest of the Gallipoli peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>The flames had crossed Chunuk Bair and affected a wide part of the peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>Video posted by 7 News appeared to show the Canterbury Cemetery, which contains the graves of 20 men from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, burnt out.</p>
        
            <p>Lone Pine Cemetery - the location of the Memorial to the Missing, which commemorates 4228 Australians and 753 New Zealanders who died at Gallipoli and have no known grave - was also within the fireground, 7 News reported.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's embassy in Ankara is trying to gauge the impact of the wildfires on Anzac gravesites and memorials on Gallipoli.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement it was monitoring the situation closely.</p>
        
            <p>The Ankara embassy was in contact with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to understand the impact, the ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the general manager for Türkiye's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Bekir Karacabey, said firefighters were managing the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>"We are intervening non-stop from land and air with the guardians of #GreenHomeland to bring the forest fire in Eceabat, Çanakkale under control," Karacabey wrote in a Facebook post, referencing the area where Anzac Cove is located.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's be careful to prevent other fires in these days when the risk of fire increases due to extraordinary weather conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Fires have also sparked in other regions of Türkiye, with Karacabey reporting a "superhuman effort" to bring a blaze in Göynük - over 400 kilometres from Gallipoli - under control.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry İbrahim Yumaklı said 1,413 firefighters - supported by 14 planes, 31 helicopters and 265 land vehicles - had been dispatched to control another fire in Manisa, 300 kilometres from the Gallipoli site.</p>
