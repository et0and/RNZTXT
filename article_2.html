            <p>New Zealand sent the largest police contingent in support of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa, with Luxon saying nearly 120 officers - mostly of Samoan heritage - have been providing security and safety.</p>
        
            <p>Other Pacific countries also provided police in support of CHOGM, including Australia, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and Fiji.</p>

            <p>Reverend Siaosi Salesulu opened the event with a prayer - noting his nephew Patrick Tuipulotu is set to lead the All Blacks for the first time tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"I think all the Samoans who know my last name, Salu from Apolima, know that Patrick Tuipulotu is from Apolima, so that's a big thing for our family.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone knows that Samoans love rugby, the Manu Samoa is our A team, and we affectionately called the All Blacks our B team - but we have a development squad, and we call them the Wallabies," he said, to laughter and applause.</p>
        
            <p>"I can see Will Robinson saying you'll never be invited to another function in your lifetime."</p>
        
            <p>He said that for a country without an army, Samoa's police keep the peace.</p>

            <p>"I would like to echo the sentiments of Bishop Desmond Tutu when he says the price of peace is eternal vigilance and that we pay tribute to every police officer who offers his or her life in service," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I watched the BBC when they covered the arrival of King Charles and Queen Camilla and the commentator noted Samoa does not have an army, so the police were there. And I laughed, and I went 'yeah, we don't have an army in Samoa, we have the police, and they are our shepherds, like they are in all countries."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon went on to speak of how well Samoa has managed the event.</p>
        
            <p>"It is no mean feat. You've got 56 world leaders with all of their delegations, with all of their media, with all of their entourage here hosting a world-class event, and you've done an exceptionally good job. And I hope everyone feels incredibly proud about it."</p>
        
            <p>He also praised the police.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that you protect and serve and care about our people and the way that you go about doing that job is absolutely incredible, and it's a great honour and a great privilege for us to be able to say thank you, thank you, thank you for the work that you do, thank you for the sacrifices that you make. I got to meet all of our great Kiwi contingent before the Chiefs arrived."</p>
        
            <p>He also took a good-humoured potshot at Anthony Albanese, saying a Samoan village had promised the Australian Prime Minister a chiefly title, "and I just think that's something that might have needed a bit more thought".</p>
        
            <p>Samoan Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa spoke in celebration of the initiative.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not only celebrating but acknowledging the commitment of Pacific police personnel to support the objective of peace and security in our region.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very pleased to welcome more than 200 police from across the Pacific to assist the Samoa police, prisons and corrections services in delivering a safe and secure CHOGM as a region."</p>
        
            <p>The deployment for CHOGM included police from Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, New Zealand, Northern Mariana Islands, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>"We face many shared challenges that are exacerbated by the continuing impacts of climate change," Fiamē said.</p>
        
            <p>She also welcomed the first Pacific police support group deployment, which was a key part of the Pacific Policing Initiative agreed at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga, in August.</p>
        
            <p>The foreign minister of Ghana has been named as the next Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.</p>
        
            <p>Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey was selected by the 65 member countries in Apia, Samoa this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on her website she said her vision for the grouping was to reposition it for all members, especially developing countries.</p>
        
            <p>"As your Secretary-General, I will use my well-known passion for accountable governance, and my extensive experience working with global leaders on interventions involving diplomacy, trade, youth, gender and democracy, to reposition the Commonwealth, fulfil our aspirations, and improve the lives of our people."</p>
        
            <p>She takes over from Baroness Patricia Scotland, a Dominican-born British diplomat and former MP who has served in the role since 2016.</p>
