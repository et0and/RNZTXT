        <h2>Fonterra adopts emissions 'intensity' reduction target, against UN advice</h2>
        <p>
Fonterra has announced plans for a 30 percent intensity reduction in on-farm emissions by 2030 - but not an absolute reduction.

            <p>Fonterra has announced plans for a 30 percent intensity reduction in on-farm emissions from 2018 levels by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>It is a collective target, so not all farms need to have a 30 percent intensity reduction.</p>
        
            <p>And it is an intensity target - not an overall reduction target - so the company has not actually committed to reducing the heating it is causing, only the heating per kilo of product.</p>
        
            <p>Setting an intensity-based target goes against the recommendations of a high level UN expert group.</p>
        
            <p>Last year the chair of the group, Catherine McKenna, said companies that wanted to say they were doing what was needed "cannot focus on reducing the intensity of their emissions rather than their absolute emissions or tackling only a part of their emissions rather than their full value chain (scopes 1, 2 and 3)".</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra's scope 1 and 2 targets, which cover things like coal burning at its plants and tanker fuel, were absolute - the goal for those was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>But 86 percent of the dairy's company's emissions come from on-farm, so are covered by the new scope 3 intensity targets.</p>
        
            <p>Announcing the plan at its general annual meeting in Methven on Thursday, the co-op expected to achieve the target through four different ways:</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra chairman Peter McBride said the on-farm emissions target would affect each farm differently.</p>
        
            <p>"There is significant variation within and across farming systems when it comes to emissions intensity. We are confident that we can make solid progress towards our target by working together and sharing information farmer-to-farmer.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no one solution to reducing on-farm emissions. It will require a combination of sharing best farming practices and technology to reduce emissions - it's both our biggest opportunity and our biggest challenge."</p>
        
            <p>McBride said Fonterra had deep empathy for the challenges farmers were already dealing with.</p>

            <p>"The co-op's approach will be to work alongside farmers, not against them, as we collectively make progress towards our target, including investing in methane reduction technologies."</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Miles Hurrell said there was a lot of activity to reduce emissions across other markets and the co-op needed to keep making progress to make sure it did not fall behind.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand farmers are some of the most emissions efficient suppliers of dairy at scale, but work needs to continue to maintain this position.</p>

            <p>"As a dairy partner to many of the world's leading food companies, we're responding to growing sustainability ambitions from our customers and financial institutions, along with increasing market access, legal and reporting obligations."</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra's collective efforts to reduce emissions from on-farm, across operations and by research and development teams would help future profit the company, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra's biggest customer welcomes the move</p>
        
            <p>Food industry giant Nestle, Fonterra's biggest customer, welcomed the scope 3 target saying it sent a positive signal to the New Zealand dairy industry, and supported Nestlé's own ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
            <p>Nestlé New Zealand chief executive Jennifer Chappell said the company had sourced dairy from New Zealand for over 100 years.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue supporting farmers alongside our partners to develop new economic opportunities and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
            <p>"We do this by prioritising our sourcing from farmers engaged in lowering emissions, by providing technical support, and by paying a premium for their products."</p>
