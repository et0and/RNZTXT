            <p>Gisborne and Hawke's Bay can expect more rainfall over the next day and a half than the regions have seen for the the whole month of June.</p>
        
            <p>Orange heavy rain warnings are in place from 10am Tuesday until 12pm Wednesday for Gisborne and from 10am Tuesday until 9pm Wednesday for Hawke's Bay, north of SH5.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay about and south of SH5 had a orange heavy rain warning in place from 11am Tuesday until 3pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Clare O'Connor said current models predict the heaviest rainfall will hit this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne could see peak rainfall at a rate of 25 millimetres per hour, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Orange strong wind warnings were also in place there, with severe gale southerlies gusting at 120 kilometres an hour in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a strong wind watch for Bay of Plenty, east of Whakatane, from 3pm on Tuesday until 6am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Further periods of rain or showers were forecast through the remainder of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, but MetService said intensities and amounts were expected to be much lower.</p>
        
            <p>People were advised to clear drains and gutters ahead of heavy rain, avoid low-lying areas and drive with caution.</p>
