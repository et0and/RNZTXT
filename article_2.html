            <p>New Zealanders were among the first in the world to celebrate the arrival of 2024 with fireworks displays around the country last night.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland the fireworks illuminated the cloudy night sky and were accompanied by a laser light and animation show.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington went ahead with its waterfront concert and fireworks, despite high winds that forced the cancellation or delay of flights through the city earlier yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Crowds gathered on the waterfront throughout the evening.</p>
        
            <p>But rain, thunder and high winds dampened celebrations in many centres.</p>
        
            <p>The Grey District Business Association on the West Coast cancelled last night's party in the town square and fireworks display because it was too dangerous to set up electrical equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga District Council also pulled the pin on five community events and one fireworks display.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were "generally pleased" with New Year's Eve behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Mike Johnson said officers across Aotearoa described it as "being like a busy Saturday night, with some alcohol-related disorder but no significant issues".</p>
        
            <p>He said a number of youths were arrested in Whangamatā, Ōhope and Tauranga arrested for disorderly behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"While this kind of behaviour is always disappointing, it's really pleasing to see the vast majority of people in communities right across the country had a safe and enjoyable night seeing in the new year."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Sydney hailed 2024 with a dazzling fireworks display featuring silver and gold pyrotechnics to mark the 50th anniversary of its the Opera House.</p>
        
            <p>And at his Sunday prayers at the Vatican, Pope Francis said he wished everyone a peaceful end of the year.</p>
