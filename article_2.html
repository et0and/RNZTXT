            <p>A lockdown at Onslow College in Wellington was sparked by a motorcyclist who had a water pistol that was mistaken for a firearm, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a street near the school in the suburb of Johnsonville after a person on a motorbike was believed to be carrying a gun.</p>
        
            <p>As a precaution Onslow College went into lockdown with its website posting that it was in lockdown due to an incident outside of the school at 1.52pm.</p>
        
            <p>About half an hour later Onslow College's Facebook page said it was out of lockdown and thanked people for their patience.</p>
        
            <p>The lockdown was lifted after police found a motorbike bike and recovered a water pistol.</p>
        
            <p>Once the lockdown was over Onslow sent an email to parents of children at the college saying all students, staff and persons on-site were safely accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>The email said a notice would go out tonight giving parents and caregivers more information about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>Police are speaking with the motorcyclist.</p>
