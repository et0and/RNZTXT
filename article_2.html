            <p>Auckland's Downtown Carpark looks set to be sold for $122 million, with plans to demolish and redevelop the site.</p>
        
            <p>Property developer Precinct Properties has made a conditional offer to buy Auckland's Downtown Car Park.</p>
        
            <p>The company plans to demolish and redevelop the site, which is located adjacent to the city's waterfront, Precinct chief executive Scott Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport would continue to operate the carpark until the end of April 2025, while redevelopment plans get underway, including feasibility and consent processes.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an incredible, once in a generation, opportunity to enhance the vibrancy of Auckland's city centre, and to create a seamless connection along the waterfront," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>Precinct was selected as the preferred development partner in October 2022 and has since been progressing commercial negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ambition is to deliver a true mixed-use precinct, encompassing office, residential, and hospitality as well as new urban spaces for residents and the public," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>Initial designs for the 6442 square-metre site feature a central podium beneath two high-rise towers. Retail, hospitality and new public spaces would be offered.</p>
        
            <p>Precinct's existing properties include Commercial Bay and Wynyard Quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The company was working with Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei on the development of the site, Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"There continues to be strong demand from occupiers for high quality, city centre office accommodation - as evidenced by our portfolio being 99 percent leased.</p>
        
            <p>"We have already received leasing enquiries from businesses looking to establish themselves on the waterfront."</p>
        
            <p>The scheme also includes a significant residential component which market research shows will be in high demand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have high levels of confidence in this offer, which will provide a level of quality and opportunity to live in the city centre not previously seen in Auckland."</p>
