            <p>The government's fast-track legislation is being labelled by opposition parties an anti-environment approach that will make New Zealand a "banana republic".</p>
        
            <p>Environmental groups warn it is an "unprecedented assault on nature and democracy".</p>
        
            <p>Four government ministers unveiled the plan for a fast-track regime on Thursday morning - one of the final commitments in the government's 100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>It gives ministers the final call on whether to approve projects, after recommendations from an expert panel, with no requirement to seek comment from the public or hold a hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Environment spokesperson Rachel Brooking, in a statement, said the decision showed the government's "ears are well and truly taken by lobbyists".</p>
        
            <p>"This Bill hands lobbyists and ministers the keys to our country without transparency when it comes to our resources. The greed of corporations both foreign and local could reshape New Zealand," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will make New Zealand a banana republic where a minister can be lobbied to make a decision and can disregard the interests of the public. We should not decide what happens in New Zealand via lobbyists with fat wallets."</p>
        
            <p>She said the idea of Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop having the final say without the input of experts and communities was frightening.</p>
        
            <p>"Labour had appropriate legislation and processes for both fast track consents and longer-term Resource Management Act reform. Pitching this as a solution for red - or green - tape helps no one except lobby groups. It is not the way forward for New Zealanders, it does not help infrastructure and will not be effective."</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader James Shaw said what was proposed was "one of the most significant assaults on the environment undertaken by any government in my lifetime".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, he said the government was giving big industry a free pass to bulldoze New Zealand's precious native wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers are handing themselves extraordinary powers to approve projects that could include new coal mines, mining on parts of our precious conservation estate, and the destruction of the seabed.</p>

            <p>"Our understanding is that this could even include projects previously rejected by the Environment Court on the basis that they were far too harmful to have any place in Aotearoa."</p>
        
            <p>"It is hard to see this as anything other than a shadowy, anti-democratic way of fast-tracking projects that will increase climate pollution and trash our environment."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking earlier ahead of the announcement, he told Morning Report  he had serious concerns the legislation would override the environmental protections that had been in place for decades.</p>
        
            <p>"That is an extraordinary level of executive overreach and overriding all of the frankly very weak environmental protections that this country has had in place for decades."</p>
        
            <p>Two bills that helped fast-track housing and infrastructure projects - the Natural and Built Environments and Spatial Planning Acts - had been passed under the previous government already, he said. Those were repealed by the incoming government in December.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw said he understood today's legislation would come with a list of pre-approved projects, including one that had already been turned down by the Environment Court, and would allow ministers to approve projects which an expert panel would not be able to overturn.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea that minister can personally say this project is going ahead no matter what, and the only thing that an expert panel can do is to apply conditions, is dramatically different to anything we've had since the Muldoon era."</p>
        
            <p>World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)'s NZ chief executive Kayla Kingdon-Bebb said the bill would give Ministers "unprecedented sweeping powers to green-light new infrastructure projects such as coal mines and fish farms".</p>
        
            <p>She said it was an unprecedented assault on nature and democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders didn't vote to trash our iconic landscapes and consign our threatened species to extinction simply for a boost in export revenue and a few expedited developments," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's astonishing that this government would choose to prioritise lining the pockets of private developers at the expense of the environment we all depend on, particularly at a time when climate change and nature loss pose unprecedented risk."</p>
        
            <p>She said it would pave the way for ministers to approve pet projects without proper scrutiny or environmental checks and balances.</p>

            <p>"It's placing unbridled power in the hands of a handful of development-focussed Ministers, cutting the public out of decision-making, undermining the rights and interests of tangata whenua, and running roughshod over New Zealand's Treaty obligations."</p>
        
            <p>Forest & Bird chief executive Nicola Toki said the law was flinging open a back door to let destructive industries and special interests bypass protections laws that had been based on science.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand already has the highest proportion of threatened species in the world, and this will put more on a fast track to extinction."</p>
        
            <p>"This is giving ministers unbridled personal power to singlehandedly approve or decline any damaging development they want. It's anti-nature, anti-climate, and anti-democratic. It's powers not seen since the days of Think Big by Muldoon's government in the 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>"The Fast Track Approvals Bill will override the Conservation Act, Reserves Act, and Wildlife Act, as well as the RMA and law governing the Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
        
            <p>"It would also allow Ministers to refer developments - ranging from aquaculture, dams and mining as well as roading and housing - to an expert panel which only has the ability to make recommendations to the Minister. Ministers have the power to greenlight projects and ignore the panel as they see fit.</p>
        
            <p>"In a climate and biodiversity crisis, environmental impacts need to be considered front and centre, and New Zealanders have a right to have a say about what goes on in their community."</p>
