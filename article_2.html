            <p>Rallies to protest against government plans to repeal Smokefree legislation are underway at Parliament and in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>About 1000 people have gathered in front of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The amendment to the Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products Act was due to ban the sale of tobacco to anyone born from January 1 2009, cut the number of retailers allowed and restrict the amount of nicotine allowed in cigarettes.</p>
        
            <p>Māori public health group Hāpai Te Hauora presented a petition signed by about 47,000 people, urging the government not to go through with the repeal, to Labour's health spokesperson Dr Ayesha Verrall.</p>
        
            <p>Interim chief executive Jason Alexander said most of the country was united in this issue.</p>
        
            <p>The government was repealing laws which would help protect future generations, he said.</p>

            <p>There are expected to be speeches from Hone Harawira, who heads an anti-smoking taskforce, former health minister Ayesha Verrall, as well as nurses, medical students and other health groups.</p>
        
            <p>MPs from Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori have come out to meet the protesters.</p>
        
            <p>Former MP Hone Harawira has addressed the crowd, decrying the "bunch of arseholes" inside government for trying to repeal the laws.</p>
        
            <p>The petition called Put our People Over Profit - Stop the Repeal of the Smokefree Legislation was launched just two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Its preamble accused the coalition government of pandering to "Big Tobacco" at the expense of the health of New Zealanders.</p>

            <p>Organisers said the number of signatures showed the strength of feeling, with smoking harm disproportionately affecting Māori and Pacific people.</p>
        
            <p>They were calling on Health Minister Shane Reti to meet them on the steps of Parliament.</p>

            <p>A protest was planned start at the same time in Auckland, with doctors leaving Auckland City Hospital to lead a march to ACT leader David Seymour's electorate office.</p>
        
            <p>There were about 150 people at the rally at 1.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>Doctors organising the Auckland rally said they were aghast at the plans to ditch the law.</p>
        
            <p>The harms from smoking everyday included stokes, heart attack and cancer, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Jim Buckton, 9, and his brother Abe, 11, are at the march telling the government to leave the law alone.</p>
        
            <p>They say they want kids like them to be safe and that was more important than tax revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Former Middlemore Hospital intensive care doctor and advisor to four governments David Galler spoke to the crowd saying the plans to repeal were "bizarre, shocking, embarrassing and disgraceful".</p>
