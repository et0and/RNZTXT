            <p>Wellington Rugby is mourning the death of player Pakaitore Turia, who has been described as a gifted player and exciting player.</p>
        
            <p>The club shared the news of his death via a Facebook post on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Our heartfelt condolences go out to Pakaitore's family, friends, and all who had the privilege of knowing him. Pakaitore was a cherished member of our community, and his presence will be deeply missed.</p>
        
            <p>"Rest in Peace, Pakaitore."</p>
        
            <p>The website ClubRugby said Turia, known as Pakai, was an extremely gifted and exciting player, highlighting some of his career achievements which included playing in the 2021 Hardham Cup final where he scored 17 points and his team won 24-17 over Pētone in extra time.</p>
        
            <p>The grandson of the late Tariana Turia, he was one of the leading players in the Wellington College First XV.</p>
        
            <p>Pakaitore spent eight seasons playing first-five and fullback for Pōneke between 2014 and 2022, with one additional season in 2020 for Hutt Old Boys Marist, and for the Wellington Lions in the NPC and Horowhenua-Kapiti in the Heartland Championship, according to the website.</p>
        
            <p>He was the leading player in the Wellington College First XV and led his school to winning the Wellington Premiership title against St Pat's Silverstream.</p>
        
            <p>In the final, he scored seven goals from seven attempts and the last penalty was from a mile out, where he won the match for his team 25-22.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2016 - 2018 he played 10 matches for the Wellington Lions while playing numerous matches for other Wellington representative teams such as the Centurions, Wellington Development and Wellington Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Club Rugby data shows he played 136 games, and scored 901 points for 78 wins.</p>
        
            <p>Turia moved to Brisbane in 2023 to join the Sunnybank Cup in the Queensland Premier Hospital Cup competition.</p>
        
            <p>ClubRugby understood he passed away in Brisbane, where he had been living while playing in the Queensland Premier Rugby from 2023 to 2024.</p>
        
            <p>He was the grandson of former Te Pāti Māori founder and co-leader Tariana Turia who also died earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Former Te Pāti Māori press secretary Helen Leahy paid tribute to his death on social media saying their hearts have fallen together again at his loss.</p>
        
            <p>"As I browsed without end I couldn't ignore the 28153 views you attracted back in 2018 in a video of Poneke highlights! Yes 28 thousand!!!"</p>
        
            <p>"Made me laugh thinking that it was probably all your devoted grandparents watching and re-watching you in action."</p>
        
            <p>"Amongst them, your Koro George and Nanny Tari were unstoppable - VIP drivers; parliament security; Cabinet Ministers; the lady in the shop, the man at the door - no-one was spared! We all had to listen to the many stories of your wonderful performances / matches/ play of the day / your moves/ your moments. (And of course we loved it all!!!)," Leahy said.</p>
        
            <p>Pakaitore grew up in Whanganui, eventually moving to Wellington to attend Wellington College.</p>
        
            <p>His death was announced Monday afternoon.</p>
