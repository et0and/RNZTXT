            <p>"The ministry and High Commission of Malaysia stand ready to assist should the next-of-kin decide to repatriate the remains to Malaysia."</p>
        
            <p>The University of Canterbury said it was "deeply saddened by the passing of two of our students at Pūkaki this weekend".</p>
