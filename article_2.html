            <p>You couldn't script it.</p>
        
            <p>With the final play of his glittering 14-year career, Shaun Johnson pulled out one last piece of magic.</p>
        
            <p>Adding one more highlight to his unrivalled reel, Johnson sent a superb wide pass to Dallin Watene-Zalezniak to score and steal a famous victory, closing the curtain on the Warrior's greatest showman in fitting fashion.</p>
        
            <p>It was a spectacular comeback from the Warriors, who rallied from a four-try assault in the first half to stun the Sharks with 22 unanswered points after oranges.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson was at his influential best for his swansong, mesmerising the defence and astutely driving his troops around the park.</p>
        
            <p>It was an appropriate finale for the 'Prince of Penrose' - thrilling, unpredictable, and unforgettable.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson wound back the clock for the opening try as he bamboozled the Sharks' defence with a jinking dart before throwing a beautiful ball to his halves partner Luke Metcalf to streak away and score.</p>
        
            <p>The Sharks struck back as Braydon Trindall put it on a platter for Teig Wilton to bust though a gaping hole without a hand laid on him.</p>
        
            <p>A Sharks scoring frenzy then ensued.</p>
        
            <p>Kayal Iro, Sam Stonestreet and Tom Hazleton all crossed the chalk in quick succession. As the hosts roared out to a 22-6 lead at halftime, the Warriors were staring down the barrel of another hiding.</p>
        
            <p>However, the visitors would find a spark in the sheds.</p>
        
            <p>Following the blitz, the Warriors managed to open the scoring in the second, some slick hands through the backs to put Dallin Watene-Zalezniak away in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>It was back to back for Watene-Zalezniak as Johnson sent a delightful nudge across to his winger who outgassed his opposite to bag a double and 100 career tries.</p>

            <p>Tensions threatened to boil over as both Watene Zalezniak and Jazz Tevga were on the receiving end of high and late shots respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Watene-Zalezniak wore yet another high shot which caused a scuffle, and was sent to the bin for the indiscretion.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors immediately plugged Iro's corner on the left and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad crashed over to bring his side within two.</p>
        
            <p>At one point down 18 points, the Warriors staggeringly then took the lead as Marcello Montoya powered over in the left corner as the one man advantage was dearly costing the Sharks.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson nailed another sideline conversion as the Warriors went ahead 26-22.</p>
        
            <p>The Sharks clicked back into gear through Stonestreet, the winger strolling in unmarked to square the ledger with ten to play before Trindall slotted the extras from wide out as the hosts reclaimed the advantage 28-26.</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf had a two-point field goal attempt, and though the distance was good, the direction was not.</p>
        
            <p>As time ticked away, a Sharks error left the door open for an exhilarating crescendo.</p>
        
            <p>On the fifth play, with just seconds remaining, the Warriors' wizard stepped up to conjure one last piece of brilliance.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson threw a pinpoint wide pass to his winger as Watene-Zalezniak dotted down to complete his hat-trick and a stunning victory.</p>
        
            <p>Teammates enveloped him to celebrate not only a dazzling last dance, but a generational career.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson bows out as one of the most exciting players to ever grace a rugby league field.</p>
        
            <p>For the Warriors, though, it ends a disappointing season which fell well short of the lofty expectations set during the 'Up the Wah's craze of 2023.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Saturday night barnburner will have plenty aboard the bandwagon ahead of the 2025 season.</p>
        
            <p>Next stop, Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 30 (Watene-Zalezniak 3, Metcalf, Nicoll-Klokstad, Montoya, tries, Johnson 3 goals)</p>
        
            <p>Sharks 28 (Stonestreet 2, Wilton, Iro, Hazelton, tries, Trindall, 4 goals)</p>
