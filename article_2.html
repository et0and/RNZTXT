            <p>Three new research projects aim to boost the chances of survival of New Zealand's rarest bird.</p>
        
            <p>Tara iti, also known as fairy terns, were once widespread around Aotearoa but now fewer than 35 adult birds remain, confined to just four nesting sites.</p>
        
            <p>Those sites are Papakānui on the Kaipara Harbour, and Pākiri, Mangawhai and Waipū on the east coast north of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation technical advisor Ilse Corkery said the projects would address "key knowledge gaps" by working out how to best raise tara iti in captivity, reduce the effects of climate change, and enhance genetic health.</p>
        
            <p>Insights gained from the research were expected to improve management strategies, and ultimately boost the birds' population and resilience.</p>

            <p>Starting in October, a PhD student, supported by the Shorebirds Trust, would research optimal captive-rearing methods while a Master's project would focus on improving nest site protection strategies.</p>
        
            <p>In December 2024, a Master's student would study the behaviour and habitat use of captive-reared versus wild tara iti, while in March 2025, another Master's student would start exploring better predator control measures.</p>
        
            <p>Other ongoing projects included studies of hatching failure and the vulnerability of nesting sites to rising sea levels.</p>
        
            <p>Corkery said each project had the potential to improve conservation strategies for the critically endangered shore bird.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement of the new research projects followed a spectacular 2023-24 breeding season, with 22 eggs laid and 13 chicks surviving to fledging.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing such a significant increase in fledging rates is incredibly encouraging and underscores the importance of our ongoing work," Corkery said.</p>
        
            <p>Last season's success was a remarkable turnaround from the disaster of 2022-23, when Cyclone Gabrielle killed five adults and all but one chick.</p>
