            <p>A homicide investigation has begun after a woman was found dead, and two other people were found at a different address in a critical condition, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Both properties are in Rotorua and the incidents are thought to be connected, a police spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>In the first, emergency services were called to an address in the suburb of Western Heights about 5am on Monday morning, where the caller said two people were being seriously assaulted.</p>
        
            <p>Both were found in critical condition, and were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Then at 2:35pm on Monday, police were called to an address in the suburb of Utuhina to check on a woman's welfare.</p>
        
            <p>Officers found her body at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Police believe the incidents are linked, and one person is assisting us with our enquiries," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently not seeking anyone else in relation to this matter."</p>
        
            <p>Both properties were being examined, as officers worked to find out exactly what had happened, they said.</p>
        
            <p>They urged anyone with information about either incident to come forward to talk to police, by calling 105 and quoting the reference number 240923/0552. Information could also be provided through the anonymous reporting website: Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
