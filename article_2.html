            <p>Police say they aren't ruling out further charges for a former Auckland funeral director accused of interfering with human remains.</p>
        
            <p>Fiona Bakulich, 48, lost name suppression in the Auckland District Court in October.</p>
        
            <p>She was charged with mishandling human remains and nine counts of obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>The charges related to bodies disinterred at Waikumete Cemetery during flooding last year.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had so far investigated two complaints relating to two bodies.</p>
        
            <p>Eight other bodies disinterred at the same time also raised concerns, but police said were unrelated.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently awaiting further information, which will inform the next stages of our investigation in respect of these remains," police said.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge these matters are difficult for families involved, after already losing loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>"Further arrests and charges cannot be ruled out at this point in time."</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin encouraged anyone with concerns to contact police.</p>
        
            <p>He said they should use the reference number 240808/8008 when reporting online or calling the police 105 number.</p>
