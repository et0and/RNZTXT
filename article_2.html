            <p>A man in his 70s has been arrested in relation to a $1.7 million fake investment scam, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police had been searching a South Auckland address linked to the scam, Detective Senior Sergeant Ryan Bunting of the WaitematƒÅ CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police making inquiries at the address located and seized a number of documents and computer equipment believed to be linked to the alleged offending.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of these inquiries, a 72-year-old male was arrested at the address and charged."</p>
        
            <p>Bunting said the arrest was a "significant" development in the "complex" investigation which stemmed from Kiwis being duped out of their savings.</p>
        
            <p>"The male will face ten counts of money laundering, which is alleged to involve around $1.775 million dollars' worth of money changing hands," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Bunting said the investigation was ongoing and other charges could not be ruled out.</p>
        
            <p>"We have previously engaged with our overseas counterparts and will continue to do so as our inquiries progress."</p>
        
            <p>Bunting said it was not uncommon for police to be made aware of such scams.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, there are a number of esurient people both here in New Zealand and abroad who seek to cause harm to vulnerable members of our community by scamming them out of their earnings."</p>
        
            <p>The man was expected to appear in Manukau District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>As the matter was before the court, Bunting said police were limited in providing further comment.</p>
        
            <p>But police said if anyone believed they were a victim of fraud, they were urged to call 105 or report in on the police website.</p>
        
            <p>"Additionally, a number of resources are also available to those who believe they may or could be the victim of this type of offending."</p>
