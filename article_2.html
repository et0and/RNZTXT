        <h2>Olympic organisers apologise to Catholics over opening ceremony</h2>
        <p>
A sketch that saw drag queens and a naked singer interpret a biblical scene was never meant to disrespect, organisers say.

            <p>Paris 2024 organisers have apologised to Catholics and other Christian groups angered by a kitsch tableau in the Olympic Games opening ceremony that parodied Leonardo Da Vinci's famous The Last Supper painting.</p>
        
            <p>The segment, which resembled the biblical scene of Jesus Christ and his apostles sharing a last meal before crucifixion and featured drag queens, a transgender model and a naked singer made up as the Greek god of wine Dionysus, drew dismay from the Catholic Church and the religious right in America.</p>
        
            <p>"Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. (The opening ceremony) tried to celebrate community tolerance," Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps told a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offence we are really sorry."</p>
        
            <p>France, while proud of its rich Catholic heritage, also has a long tradition of secularism and anti-clericalism. Blasphemy is not only legal, but also considered by many as an essential pillar of freedom of speech.</p>
        
            <p>Supporters of the tableau praised its message of inclusivity and tolerance.</p>
        
            <p>The Catholic church in France said it deplored a ceremony that "included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity".</p>
        
            <p>In Germany, the Bishop of Passau, Stefan Oster, said: "An impressive opening to hopefully peaceful games. The queer Last Supper was a low point, however, and wholly superfluous in the context."</p>
        
            <p>Some commentators said the controversy was another example of 21st century culture wars turbocharged by a 24-hour news cycle and social media.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas Jolly, the artistic director and mastermind behind the flamboyant opening ceremony, said religious subversion had never been his intention.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that," he told reporters on Saturday.</p>
