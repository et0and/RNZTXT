            <p>Patrick Cooper may be on a playground, but he is not fooling around with his goal to break the record for the longest time swinging on a swing.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper kicked off the ground at 1.30pm on Friday afternoon at Waitangi Park in Wellington with a goal to swing non-stop for 48 hours.</p>
        
            <p>The current Guinness World Record for the challenge is 36 hours, 32 minutes clocked by a British man.</p>
        
            <p>It is not just the world record that Cooper is after, as he has taken his record breaking opportunity to raise funds for mental health charity I Am Hope.</p>
        
            <p>But Guinness World Record requirements are tight. Cooper must have at least two new witnesses every four hours.</p>
        
            <p>While some may want to help him out, words of encouragement will be the only way people are able to give Cooper a push, who must complete the challenge without physical assistance.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited for people to come down," said Cooper.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had quite a few people say they're down for the cause and want to come support me".</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, Cooper swung for a then-record 36 hours, according to news reports of the time.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper said it was "childhood wonder" that sparked an interest in a world record.</p>
        
            <p>"Growing up in primary school we had Guinness World Record books," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The swing record is a lot easier for me to set up. It's one of those simple tasks where you can really see how far you can go for it. I don't think I could quite crack it at running or walking."</p>
        
            <p>While Guinness World Records kept record attempts strict, there would be some allowances.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people do ask the toilet question, Guinness do give me five minutes for every hour of swinging."</p>
        
            <p>Cooper was set to finish this Sunday.</p>
