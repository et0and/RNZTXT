            <p>Ukrainian soldiers will be warmer in the trenches next northern winter thanks to Christchurch-made merino wool clothing.</p>
        
            <p>Knitwear manufacturer Weft Knitting is sending more than 1000 woollen undergarments, as well as sewing machines and fabric, to the war-torn country to provide comfort to soldiers.</p>
        
            <p>Weft Knitting founder Hugh Douglas said it was a cause he cared deeply about.</p>
        
            <p>"I decided early on that I wouldn't sit back and do nothing when my company has the ability to make a tangible difference to the soldiers on the front line defending their country," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Weft Knitting had been donating clothing to Ukraine since late 2022, and its latest gift was included in a 40ft container of goods from across the South Island, which was going over this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"We advertised and we've had quite a huge response from the local community - perhaps as far as even Nelson. We've had wheelchairs, walking frames, crutches and very warm clothing, toys, and even three hospital beds have been donated," Douglas said.</p>
        
            <p>In response to previous donations, two flags had been sent back from Ukraine with messages of gratitude from soldiers, which were proudly hanging up in the factory.</p>
        
            <p>"After the soldiers got the first lot of woollen underwear back in 2023, they started realising the virtues of wearing merino next to the skin. There's very little merino worn over there... it's usually cotton.</p>
        
            <p>"You can imagine that getting wet and if you're in the trenches, of course it's never going to to dry out. Whereas a woollen merino product does dry out; it keeps you warm even when it's wet. That was another thing that drove me to realise these guys could have a far better experience and to physically keep them warm."</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittle page and donations from the community had helped his company fund the project, and a charity sale later this month would go towards the latest shipment to Ukraine, Douglas said.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine Association of New Zealand southern regions vice president Vladimir Rodnyanskiy said the generosity was appreciated in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"The product [Weft Knitting] makes is I believe quite unique and very high quality and we get ... exceptional feedback from our end users.</p>
        
            <p>"In a few months it will be winter and European winter can easily go to -20C, and soldiers really need this sort of underwear."</p>
        
            <p>Weft Knitting Company opened in 1980, and had helped with humanitarian efforts in New Zealand and Afghanistan in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess I latch on to those ... things which I feel it's worth supporting and I've done for the last 20 years," Douglas said.</p>
