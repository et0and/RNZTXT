            <p>Boy racers churning up rural roads are costing Carterton ratepayers thousands of dollars each month.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Ron Mark said eventually "these idiot racers, these clowns, are going to get it wrong and someone is going to get killed".</p>
        
            <p>At a council meeting on Wednesday, infrastructure manager Johannes Ferreira said incidents of unauthorised street racing was increasing "significantly" throughout Carterton's roading network.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a frustration when we have just resealed or remarked an area to turn up to go out every Monday and clean up tyres, tyre marks and damaged signs," Ferreira said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's taking a lot of attention away from areas we should be focusing our attention to."</p>
        
            <p>He said the bill to repair the damage was "getting up to a few thousand dollars a month".</p>
        
            <p>Mark, who met with the Wairarapa police area commander this week, said it was not an easy issue to deal with.</p>
        
            <p>He said the boy racing incidents often happened "in the wee hours of the morning", and created a lot of noise, but residents were too intimidated to get involved and take down information.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a number of elderly residents [at one boy racing hotspot] and there is no way in Hades that an elderly couple are going to walk out there and photograph boy racers' number plates or ask them to stop.</p>
        
            <p>"The intimidation factor is just too high and it's not worth the risk."</p>
        
            <p>Mark said he sympathised with the police and acknowledged officers could only be in certain places if they knew things were happening.</p>
        
            <p>"It comes down to intelligence and local residents getting on the phone and reporting things to the police while this stuff is happening when they see or hear it."</p>
        
            <p>Ferreira said council officers were reporting each boy racing incident they were aware of to create a record for police.</p>
        
            <p>In October last year, a boy racer incident at Carterton's industrial area captured national attention when police were pelted by bottles, rocks and fireworks.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Wairarapa police senior sergeant Gill Flower said it was "probably the worst" incident she had ever seen.</p>
        
            <p>Because of the closed road network in the industrial area, police were able to trap more than 100 cars involved in the incident and dish out 100-plus tickets.</p>
        
            <p>Following the October incident, Police Minister Mark Mitchell said current legislation could be strengthened.</p>
        
            <p>At the moment, vehicles cannot be destroyed - crushed - until a third offence has been committed.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell had previously told media he would introduce legislation in 2024 that would give police new powers to seize vehicles from boy racers.</p>
        
            <p>In December, he said there was still complexity to work through but that the new legislation was at the front of the queue for 2025.</p>
