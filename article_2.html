            <p>Paris Olympics' catering service might need a touch of Simone Biles' magic.</p>
        
            <p>Adding to the early criticism about the quality and quantity of the food at the Olympic Village, the queen of gymnastics gave the French offerings there a thumbs-down, opining that athletes would need to get out to enjoy the "real" local cuisine.</p>
        
            <p>Her comment came at a press conference following the US women's gold-medal win in the team gymnastics event on Tuesday, where a reporter asked the five gymnasts what they were eating and whether they were enjoying French food.</p>
        
            <p>Hesitating, the women looked at each other before Biles stepped in to offer a sugar-coated response.</p>
        
            <p>"OK, here's the thing. I don't think we're having proper French cuisine in the village like you guys might be eating because you're outside the village," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the athletes it's a little bit... healthier."</p>
        
            <p>Teammate Hezly Rivera was more direct, clearly itching to speak her mind.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's very good, at least what we're having in the dining hall," the 16-year-old said. "I definitely think French food is good, but what we're having in there, I don't think it's the best. But it gets the job done," she joked.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought the pizza was good," Biles jumped in, diplomatically.</p>
        
            <p>Using the more than 600 tonnes of fresh produce provided by Carrefour, catering firm Sodexo is in charge of providing an estimated 40,000 meals a day to 15,000 athletes in the Olympic Village.</p>

            <p>Organisers had promised fresh produce mostly made in France, with a focus on local and organic products and more vegetarian options. The criticism, including a paucity of meat, soon prompted Paris Olympics organisers to respond with a fix.</p>
        
            <p>Still, Biles was likely partaking in some delectable pastries that Paris had to offer.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone can calm down!" an Instagram post by head coach Cecile Landi earlier in the day read, accompanied by a photo of a basket of chocolate croissants. "Freshly baked pain au chocolat were delivered to Simone this morning."</p>
