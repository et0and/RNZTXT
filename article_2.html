            <p>A Pegasus mum says her accommodation supplement would almost double if she lived in the neighbouring Canterbury town of Woodend, just a few minutes down the road.</p>
        
            <p>The woman, who Local Democracy Reporting agreed not to name, rents a three-bedroom house in Pegasus for herself and one child at $560 a week and receives an $80 accommodation supplement on top of her ACC payments.</p>
        
            <p>If she lived in Woodend or Rangiora - 3km or 8km away - she would receive $155 a week.</p>
        
            <p>Every area is divided into one of four accommodation supplement zones, which can determine how much support they can access.</p>
        
            <p>"When I first came here seven years ago the rent was $400 a week.</p>
        
            <p>"It has gone up by $60 a week in the last 12 months and the accommodation supplement doesn't keep up with that."</p>
        
            <p>She has been looking to move Woodend or Rangiora, but there are few rental properties available.</p>

            <p>Waimakariri Mayor Dan Gordon said the accommodation supplement classifications were "completely out of date".</p>
        
            <p>"It is my understanding that the maximum payment setting for the accommodation supplement has only been reviewed twice in more than 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"It has never cost so much to run a household and having the extra money in the accommodation supplement will be life changing for some people."</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said he planned to raise the issue at the Canterbury Mayoral Forum.</p>
        
            <p>A quick search on TradeMe found just 28 properties for rent in Pegasus, Woodend, Ravenswood, Rangiora and Kaiapoi with three or more bedrooms, all ranging between $540 and $680 a week.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has confirmed Pegasus is classified as "area 4", which is the lowest of four classifications.</p>

            <p>"Every town, city and rural area across New Zealand falls into one of four accommodation supplement areas," general manager housing and employment Hayley Hamilton said.</p>
        
            <p>The classifications were established in the Social Security Act 2018, when the government updated accommodation supplement area boundaries and increased the payment rates, she said.</p>
        
            <p>People living in area 1, including Auckland and Queenstown, may qualify for the highest maximum accommodation supplement weekly payments, while those living in area 4 qualify for the lowest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Area 2 includes Christchurch, Rangiora, Woodend, Oxford and Amberley, while Kaik≈çura and Hanmer Springs are listed in area 3.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton said some people may qualify for temporary additional support.</p>
        
            <p>It was up to Parliament to change the payment rates or boundaries, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In March, Social Development Minister Louise Upston announced she had commissioned advice on changes to the accommodation supplement.</p>
        
            <p>It followed concerns the area classifications were not keeping up with urban growth in the Queenstown area.</p>
        
            <p>"The use of outdated geographic information and classifications by MSD has seen some households receive a lower accommodation supplement than they otherwise would," Upston said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue is particularly pronounced in Queenstown and exists in a small number of other areas where there has been rapid urban expansion."</p>
        
            <p>There is no update on when this will be resolved, leaving people struggling to keep up with rising rents.</p>
