            <p>Australian Open semi-finalist Ben Shelton has taken the Grand Slam's on-court interviewers to task for being "disrespectful" to players.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton reached his first semi-final at Melbourne Park with a four-set win over Italian Lorenzo Sonego at Rod Laver Arena.</p>
        
            <p>He was interviewed on court by Australian former Davis Cup player John Fitzgerald, who suggested no-one would be cheering the American in his semi-final, with his opponent yet to be confirmed between defending champion Jannik Sinner or local hope Alex De Minaur.</p>
        
            <p>Sinner later beat De Minaur in straight sets in the evening session at Rod Laver Arena.</p>
        
            <p>On court, Shelton laughed off the comment and said home fans were welcome to boo him or "throw stuff at (his) head" if supporting De Minaur.</p>
        
            <p>But he was scathing in his post-match press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been a little bit shocked this week with how players have been treated by the broadcasters," Shelton told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think that the guy who mocked Novak (Djokovic), I don't think that was just a single event.</p>
        
            <p>"I've noticed it with different people, not just myself."</p>
        
            <p>Tennis Australia, the tournament's organisers, were contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic was annoyed by comments made by Australian broadcaster Tony Jones on TV, saying the Serb was "over-rated" and a "has-been".</p>

            <p>Djokovic declined to do the customary on-court interview after his fourth-round victory over Jiri Lehecka on Sunday pending a public apology from Jones.</p>
        
            <p>Shelton said he was also put off during his post-match interview after playing 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils in the fourth round.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some comments that have been made to me in post-match interviews by a couple of different guys, whether it was, 'Hey, (Gael) Monfils is old enough to be your dad. Maybe he is your dad,'" Shelton added.</p>
        
            <p>"Or today on the court, 'Hey, Ben, how does it feel that no matter who you play in your next match, no one is going to be cheering for you?'</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, it may be true, but I just don't think the comment is respectful from a guy I've never met before in my life."</p>
        
            <p>Shelton signed off by saying broadcasters should help grow the sport and help athletes who won matches on the biggest stage to enjoy one of their biggest moments.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like there's just been a lot of negativity. I think that's something that needs to change," he said.</p>
