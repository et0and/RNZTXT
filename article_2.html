            <p>New Zealand Defence Force Chief Air Marshal Kevin Short has recalled the ties that bind New Zealand and Australia, through the lives of two servicemen.</p>
        
            <p>Short told the national Anzac service in Wellington of shared sacrifices through the story of two young men who fought in Malta during World War II.</p>
        
            <p>When flight sergeant David 'Derek' MacLean was killed in action, his Australian friend Bob wrote to MacLean's mother in Whanganui to express his admiration for "Young Mac", Short said.</p>
        
            <p>Bob wrote that Mac was "lost doing a very courageous thing", Short said.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Air Force Museum of New Zealand, he had been tasked with intercepting an incoming raid of more than 50 aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>He took off in his Spitfire with eight others, but was shot down into the sea near Comino Island.</p>
        
            <p>Short quoted from Bob's letter: "It takes great courage and resolution to attack a formation of bombers like that singlehanded.</p>
        
            <p>"Mac had always plenty of spirit and I shall always value his friendship.'"</p>
        
            <p>Bob went on to write that he knew how hard it was to lose a loved one, Short said.</p>
        
            <p>"'My older brother was killed on 4 November in Libya and I know how my parents felt.</p>
        
            <p>"'I hope that this letter conveys a little to you of my regard for Mac.'"</p>
        
            <p>According to the Air Force Museum, MacLean grew up in rural Whanganui and studied at Victoria University College before enlisting with the Air Force as an airman pilot on 1 March 1941.</p>
        
            <p>He left for Canada in June and trained there and in England before embarking for the Mediterranean.</p>
        
            <p>MacLean's body has never been found. He is commemorated on the Malta Memorial.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Defence Force chief General Angus Campbell also spoke at the dawn parade.</p>
        
            <p>He said an "unrivalled heritage" of service linked Australia and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Their story was one of "mateship, bravery and determination against the odds", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today, Australia and New Zealand stand together in an increasingly challenging world. Together, we continue the Anzac story."</p>
        
            <p>The Australian High Commissioner also attended the service.</p>
