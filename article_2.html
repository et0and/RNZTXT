        <h2>'This was murder' - Crown begins closing address in Polkinghorne trial</h2>
        <p>
The Crown says the retired eye surgeon would do anything to pursue a life with the "intoxicating Madison Ashton", rather than his wife.

            <p>Warning: This story mentions potential suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown has begun its closing address in the murder trial of retired Auckland eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is accused of killing his wife Pauline Hanna in their Remuera home three years ago, while the defence argues Hanna committed suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutor Alysha McClintock, closing the Crown's case on Monday morning, said Hanna's death looked like a suicide at first blush because it was meant to. She argued Polkinghorne was unable to explain what happened at the scene during his interview with police.</p>
        
            <p>"Pauline Hanna did not die tied to that rope," she said. "That's why he couldn't explain it."</p>
        
            <p>McClintock addressed the jury of 11 before a packed public gallery, describing Polkinghorne as an atypical man with a high level of intelligence.</p>
        
            <p>"The police decided to explore the possibility that Dr Polkinghorne, renowned eye surgeon man of wealth and standing, had killed his wife," she said. "We are dealing - members of the jury - with a very unusual case and a very complex defendant.</p>
        
            <p>"He is highly intelligent, he certainly sees himself as smart. There is an arrogance in Dr Polkinghorne, I suggest, that you should not underestimate."</p>
        
            <p>McClintock said she would take much of Monday, if not the whole day, for her closing address as she worked through the Crown's evidence.</p>

            <p>"The Crown says once you fit everything together here, you are able to be sure that suicide can be excluded. This was murder."</p>
        
            <p>The Crown claimed Polkinghorne was living a double life with Australian-based escort Madison Ashton, and wanted to pursue a future with her instead of Hanna.</p>
        
            <p>"[Hanna] was not a woman who had given up," said McClintock. "She was a woman whose husband was giving up on her. She was in the way of Dr Polkinghorne's life with the intoxicating Madison Ashton."</p>
        
            <p>McClintock went through evidence from the trial, including a search Polkinghorne had made on his device that the Crown claimed unmasked a murderer.</p>
        
            <p>"Leg edema after strangulation," she said. "After strangulation... Strangulation is an entirely different word to hanging."</p>
        
            <p>She said there were multiple parts to the case that needed to be considered.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
