            <p>The festive season is here - and it is looking wet for most of the country on Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told Morning Report that a southerly working its way up the country would hover over the motu this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"In the lead-up towards Christmas it is unfortunately an unsettled one. I know at this time of year there is a lot of travel happening, a lot of planning for the big day."</p>
        
            <p>The southerly was a "bit of a throwback" to winter, bringing rain on Friday and unsettled weather for this weekend, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a low pressure system just east of the country and that has been feeding through south-easterly winds. I know here in Wellington they can be quite biting and chilly, and a lot of places have been feeling that."</p>
        
            <p>MetService issued a heavy rain warning for Bay of Plenty from the early hours of Saturday morning to 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>People in the region should expect 80mm-120 mm in periods of heavy rain and thunderstorms, especially inland and about the eastern ranges. Peak rates of 25 to 40 mm/h were possible in localised downpours.</p>
        
            <p>But a bright spot is on the horizon - literally - with a westerly system on the way.</p>
        
            <p>"It won't be as cold or cool as it we've had recently but it is still looking like it will bring some wet weather with it.</p>
        
            <p>"Christmas Eve looks to be the best day to do any of those outdoor activities that people have in mind."</p>
        
            <p>The East Coast and Hawke's Bay were likely to be the best bet for beach activities on Christmas Day, Makgabutlane said.</p>
        
            <p>It was too early to say whether more settled weather would arrive in time for New Year's Eve events, and the low-pressure system would "take its time" moving off the country.</p>
        
            <p>"It is still a long way away and even for Christmas Day definitely keep your plans and keep your eye on the forecast as we come closer to the day."</p>
