            <p>Israel's foreign ministry has released updated casualty figures - but failed to give a reason why.</p>
        
            <p>A ministry spokesperson said the death toll from the 7 October Hamas attack in southern Israel had been revised to about 1200 from a previous government estimate of 1400.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 1200 is the official number of victims of the October 7 massacre," spokesperson Lior Haiat said in a written statement.</p>
        
            <p>Haiat said the figure had been updated on Thursday. He did not provide a reason for the revision.</p>
        
            <p>The death count, which includes foreigners, "is not a final number. It (is) an updated estimate. It might change when (they) identify all the bodies," Haiat said.</p>
