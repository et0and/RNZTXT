            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is warning against jumping to conclusions about Trump policies that might affect New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Republican Donald Trump was projected to win the US election and had spoken on the campaign trail promising trade tariffs and protectionist policies to favour American manufacturers and farmers.</p>

            <p>Luxon congratulated Trump on a "comprehensive win".</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to working with him and advancing the interests of our great countries.</p>
        
            <p>"I know both sides of the aisle in Washington... I've got no doubt we'll do everything we can to work constructively to move forward together."</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Trump's campaigning on trade tariffs which could be bad for New Zealand, Luxon said we needed to wait and see what policies were actually introduced.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the American people having a free and fair election, selecting a president."</p>
        
            <p>It was the government's job to work with that person and Luxon had "every confidence" they would do that well, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters told RNZ's Midday Report that New Zealand's diplomats were not surprised by the result and were ready to "hit the ground running".</p>
        
            <p>Peters offered his congratulations to Trump on X, formerly Twitter, yesterday, saying the two countries' relationship would go from strength to strength.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ the government would seek to make progress with the new administration across "a multitude of issues".</p>
        
            <p>"They are to do with trade, they are to do with a better relationship... we work in cooperation with every country we possibly can."</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the prospect of tariffs being slapped on exports into the US, Peters said the government was "prepared for that" but would make efforts to improve trading arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>"We came so close (to securing a free trade deal) last time that I think we've got good grounds to pick up where we left off."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said New Zealand's ambassador in Washington Rosemary Banks also held the role during Trump's last term and so had "close links" with the Republican Party.</p>
