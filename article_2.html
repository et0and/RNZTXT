            <p>Havelock North teenager Sarah* took her first puff on a vape when she was 11.</p>
        
            <p>Her 10-year-old friend had got her hands on one, and she tried it.</p>
        
            <p>"My friend was pretty rebellious," Sarah said.</p>
        
            <p>Seven years later, Sarah is still vaping. She estimates she takes about 100 puffs a day now.</p>
        
            <p>She said she didn't feel addicted and there would be a point in her life when she would not want to vape. But for now, she has no interest in quitting.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm young. Let me make dumb decisions. Some people are smoking far worse things."</p>
        
            <p>But experts and local body politicians say starting on an addictive substance at such a young age is problematic, and they are alarmed by the amount of youth vaping in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>EIT researcher, Associate Professor Anita Jagroop-Dearing, a member of the Stop Adolescent Vaping E-Cigarettes (SAVE) group formed in 2020, said the problem seemed to be out of control.</p>
        
            <p>Increased school absenteeism, inability to concentrate on school lessons due to nicotine addiction, and mental health problems were all being seen in the community, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned about the creation of this new generation of nicotine-dependent youth who are also graduating to cigarette smoking."</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay councils are also concerned. There's no shortage of outlets to purchase vapes from with a total of 210 in Hawke's Bay.</p>

            <p>Hastings District councillor Ana Apatu and Napier Deputy Mayor Annette Brosnan, along with their respective councils, are backing a local 'vape-free kids' Hawke's Bay representative, Sukhdeep Singh, who is calling on the government to take urgent action to curb youth access.</p>
        
            <p>Singh's submission to the government's Smoke-Free Environments and Regulated Products Amendment Bill No 2, presented 11 critical recommendations, including reducing vape retailer numbers and establishing greater distance requirements between vape stores and schools.</p>
        
            <p>He said 71 percent of vape retailers operated within 800 metres of schools, making the products easily accessible to young people.</p>
        
            <p>"Vaping is creating a health crisis for our youth," Brosnan said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a city and a country, we need to access every tool we can to counter the rapidly increasing trend in youth vaping."</p>
        
            <p>Brosnan said she would support the government providing local authorities with increased powers to regulate vape store numbers and restrict their proximity to schools.</p>
        
            <p>Similar to the 2013 Psychoactive Substances legislation, which effectively limited access to harmful substances, Brosnan said "bold, local measures" were needed to address it.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Apatu said local councils should have an opportunity to protect young people's health.</p>
        
            <p>Both Apatu and Brosnan want to restrict vape sales near schools and increase enforcement against retailers that illegally sell to minors.</p>
        
            <p>Councils currently have no power to control where vape stores are set up in their towns and cities.</p>
        
            <p>A team at EIT has recently finished a survey of more than 2000 students - both vapers and non-vapers - in Hawke's Bay about the impact it has had on them.</p>
        
            <p>The research is now being collated and will give an insight into vaping problems and triggers.</p>
        
            <p>The project is being funded by EIT (Research Innovation Centre), the Health Research Foundation Hawke's Bay and the Health Research Council.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Sarah* said her friends would continue to vape.</p>
        
            <p>She started vaping consistently when she was 14, and it was easy to get them, despite being underage, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We just asked older people to buy them for us.</p>
        
            <p>"All my friends vape. My parents were smokers. For this generation, it's vaping. No different, really."</p>
        
            <p>The Hastings District has 16 specialist vape retailers and 74 general retailers, while Napier has 15 specialist vape retailers and 62 general.</p>
        
            <p>In Central Hawke's Bay there are three specialist retailers and 18 general and in Wairoa, there are six specialist vape retailers and 16 general.</p>
