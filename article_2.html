            <p>Former Football Ferns captain Ali Riley's family home in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Pacific Palisades has been destroyed in the wildfire.</p>
        
            <p>The fires, which have devastated Los Angeles neighbourhoods on the east and west sides of the city, have so far killed 10 people and destroyed nearly 10,000 structures, with those figures expected to grow.</p>
        
            <p>"We lost so much but have everything we need," Riley wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
        
            <p>Riley said her parents had evacuated "with two full cars and have been offered so many places to stay".</p>
        
            <p>"They have home insurance and are luckier than so many who are left with nothing.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking forward to joining the relief efforts and rebuilding our great city together."</p>
        
            <p>Riley also thanked the firefighters and first responders "still out there fighting for our friends and neighbours".</p>

            <p>On Thursday, Riley posted a video that her "entire neighbourhood is gone".</p>
        
            <p>"We are all safe. Holding on to that with my whole heart while we figure out what to do next," she said on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>Riley lives in Los Angeles where she plays for Angel City FC, in the US women's professional league.</p>
