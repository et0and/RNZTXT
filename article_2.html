            <p>It will go down as one of the best games of the year as Bulldogs five eighth Matt Burton's golden point field goal saw his side home over a hugely depleted Warriors, 13-12.</p>
        
            <p>Without their skipper, fullback and both wingers, the Warriors were dealt an avalanche of adversity, but lived up to their name with a tenacious performance.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors were dealt a huge blow before kick-off, with skipper Tohu Harris ruled out with a wrist injury.</p>
        
            <p>Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Dallin Watene-Zelezniak, and Marcello Montoya were all forced from the field through injury, leaving the Warriors with a makeshift backline for majority of the second spell.</p>
        
            <p>Unable to be separated on the scoreboard after 80 minutes, the sides went to golden point where they traded field goal attempts in a pulsating finish.</p>
        
            <p>As things looked set to end in stalemate, Burton made the clutch play to break the resilient Warriors.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors had an early shot at points as Harris Tavita sent one across to a leaping Dallin Watene-Zelezniak, only for the winger to knock it on in the air.</p>
        
            <p>Another chance went begging when Te Maire Martin waltzed through a gaping hole but was called back for obstruction.</p>
        
            <p>The Bulldogs were struggling to complete their sets, committing numerous errors, but were given a reprieve when Marcello Montoya was penalised and put on report for a no arms hit.</p>
        
            <p>As the 20-minute mark ticked over, the Warriors were looking assured to open the scoring. Harris Tavita threw a wide ball but it was picked off by Matt Burton who streaked 80 upfield and found Bronson Xerri on his inside jut as the cover came.</p>
        
            <p>In a coach killer moment, the Bulldogs made an error from their first hit up after scoring. It took just one play for the Warriors to make them pay, Watene-Zelezniak flying into the corner, expertly grounding it under plenty of attention.</p>
        
            <p>Montoya made up for his earlier indiscretion, barrelling his way over the chalk off a ball from Mitch Barnett to take the lead as Pompey converted from the corner.</p>

            <p>With four repeat sets inside the Warriors 20, the visitors managed to repel the relentless Bulldogs attack right on the brink of the break.</p>
        
            <p>The injury curse continued for the Warriors, with Charnze Nicoll-Klokstsad's evening ended with a calf injury.</p>
        
            <p>Watene-Zelezniak was also sent to the sideline for a head injury assessment. It was deemed a category one concussion and the Warriors were without their winger and fullback for the last half hour.</p>
        
            <p>Their issues were compounded after Sexton put it on a platter for Villiame Kikau to win the aerial battle against Adam Pompey and slam the ball down, squaring the ledger at 12 apiece.</p>
        
            <p>The last remaining member of the back three then also succumbed to injury, with Montoya limping off, leaving the Warriors backline in absolute disarray.</p>
        
            <p>The flustered Warriors managed to survive another onslaught from the home side, an offside penalty giving them a much-needed reprieve.</p>
        
            <p>After bravely defending at the other end, the Warriors clicked into attack and with his first touch, Leka Halasima made a storming run but was held up over the chalk in a stunning play.</p>
        
            <p>A towering Burton bomb spilled by Tuivasa-Sheck gave Burton a field goal from infront, but hit the upright as the drama continued and we went to golden point to separate to two sides.</p>
        
            <p>Harris-Tavita had the first shot at the posts of the extra period but pushed his attempt just wide.</p>
        
            <p>Burton was next up, his long range attempt falling agonisingly short of the sticks.</p>
        
            <p>The shot for shot continued, Harris-Tavita again only slightly to the left of the horns.</p>
        
            <p>The Bulldogs had the first opportunity of the second period, and Burton charged down to give them back-to-back sets.</p>
        
            <p>They needed no further invitation, Burton finally nailing one down the middle to bring the curtain down on an absolute classic.</p>
        
            <p>Bulldogs 13 (Xerri, Kikau, tries, Burton 2 goals, 1 field goal )</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 12 (Watene-Zelezniak , Montoya tries, Pompey 2 goals)</p>
