            <p>The ban will apply to all households in Featherston, Greytown, and Martinborough.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water acting chief executive Susannah Cullen said she could appreciate people's frustration at being asked to conserve water when there were leaks in the network.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was not enough funding from the council to fix all the leaks, Cullen said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the reservoirs in South Wairarapa was at just 55 percent capacity on Friday, she said.</p>
        
            <p>South Wairarapa lost about 46 percent of water supplied as a result of leaks in the past financial year.</p>
