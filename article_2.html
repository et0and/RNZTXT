            <p>A person RNZ spoke to said that the car had been in the area since at least 8am.</p>
        
            <p>Residents at a nearby property told RNZ they heard "really loud bangs" last night, but they believed they did not sound like gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was under way.</p>
        
            <p>Police staff could be seen coming and going from the home which looks over Oriental Bay and downtown Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Officers have also been speaking to neighbours.</p>
