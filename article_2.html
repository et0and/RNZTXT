            <p>Tauranga mayor Mahé Drysdale is yet to move to the city he leads because he says he can't find a home in his desired school zone.</p>
        
            <p>After being elected in July, Drysdale said he would commute from his current hometown of Cambridge, but aimed to be living in Tauranga by the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>A ratepayers representative said the mayor needed to move to Tauranga to "to live up to his truths".</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale lives in Cambridge with his wife Juliette and their three primary school-aged children, but finding a house within their preferred school zone in Tauranga was "proving to be very challenging", the mayor said.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale told Local Democracy Reporting the couple were still working on their housing situation.</p>
        
            <p>"The schools are all overloaded. You've got to buy in zone or rent in zone and trying to find houses to either rent or buy in the school zones that we're keen on is proving to be very challenging."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale would not say which school zones they were wanting to live in, but said they had made the schools they were interested in aware of their situation.</p>
        
            <p>The couple were "actively searching" and would move here as soon as they found a home, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to actively look for a suitable home, but as yet (despite a couple of offers) we have been unable to secure one."</p>
        
            <p>Bayleys residential sales and projects manager Bay of Plenty Jon O'Connor said there were a number of suburbs in Tauranga that were traditionally sought after because of school zoning.</p>
        
            <p>These included The Aves, Tauranga South and Mount Maunganui.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the same can be said for most of our inner-city suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand our schools' rolls are under increasing pressure as more people relocate to the sunny Bay of Plenty from other regions."</p>
        
            <p>Housing stock was also "lighter than usual" because of strong sales at the end of 2024, O'Connor said.</p>
        
            <p>Every school in Tauranga was projected to grow in 2025 apart from five schools, according to the Ministry of Education's provisional school roll data from late January.</p>

            <p>Ministry of Education Te Tai Whenua (Central) hautū (deputy secretary) Jocelyn Mikaere said the ministry did not have official classroom capacity information.</p>
        
            <p>Most schools in Tauranga were zoned and might operate ballots if they had additional capacity for out of zone students, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Tremains Tauranga director and head of sales Hayden Duncan said in his experience people in the Bay of Plenty were more driven by lifestyle choices than school zones when buying homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Within Tauranga one thing we are spoiled for [choice] is an amazing selection of high-quality schools, both public and private."</p>
        
            <p>He said the city didn't have issues like the sought-after 'double grammar' school zone in Auckland that pushed up house prices.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure there are some people that buy into specific school zones, but not enough to drive values up in one particular area over another."</p>
        
            <p>Mount Maunganui Ratepayers, Residents and Retailers Association president Michael O'Neill said it came back to the mayor's commitment to the people that he would move here.</p>

            <p>"If it doesn't happen then the locals are going to see that as a bit of electioneering, a mistruth you could say. Therefore, that level of trust and respect starts to deteriorate.</p>
        
            <p>"You really want a local who understands the people, mixes and works with the people to be representing your needs at the council table.</p>
        
            <p>"He said he would shift here, he said he'd do it ASAP, and he needs to make that happen in my view. He needs to live up to his truths."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale grew up in Tauranga and said he stayed with his mum in Mount Maunganui during the week, so he wasn't commuting daily.</p>
        
            <p>It was a "pretty easy commute" from Cambridge and one he did prior to becoming mayor as a financial advisor at Forsyth Barr in Tauranga, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale joked with Pāpāmoa ward councillor Steve Morris that on a bad day Morris' commute to the city centre was worse because it could take an hour or more.</p>
        
            <p>It was hard from a family perspective because he wasn't around as much as he'd like, Drysdale said.</p>
        
            <p>Juliette and their children would come and stay during the week if the couple had weekend commitments.</p>
        
            <p>"[We're] trying to make the best of it, but it'll be ideal when we're all back in the same city together.</p>
        
            <p>"Our whānau is committed to moving to Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a significant move to uproot your family, and when we do secure a suitable property, we will make that move."</p>
