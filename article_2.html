            <p>A staff member at one of the country's most prestigious schools who resigned after admitting to "inappropriate online activity" with a minor was catfished by a fake identity.</p>
        
            <p>The staff member, who was involved with football and boarding, admitted to the activity, King's College confirmed in October.</p>
        
            <p>The school's principal notified police, who later found no criminal offences had been committed by the man.</p>
        
            <p>Documents released to RNZ under the Official Information Act, have shown the staffer was talking to what he believed was a 15-year-old boy online, but the identity was fake, nullifying any possible charges.</p>
        
            <p>A heavily redacted letter sent to King's College headmaster Simon Lamb from police, said online contact "of a sexual nature" was actively sought online by a person who created a fake identity claiming to be 15 years old.</p>
        
            <p>The staffer was "lured into this catfishing scam", police said.</p>
        
            <p>The offence being investigated was indecent communication with a young person, but police said the victim needed to be a real person.</p>
        
            <p>"Therefore the fake identity nullified the offending.</p>
        
            <p>"Only constables can create covert underage identities to gather evidence that can be used lawfully against such offenders."</p>
        
            <p>As a result, police told Lamb they could take no action in relation to the alleged sexual offences.</p>
        
            <p>In the police's case summary report, it mentioned the staffer had admitted he had "dabbled" in online sexual behaviour with minors.</p>
        
            <p>Detective sergeant Robert Kerr said the fake profile involved an adult pretending to be a 15-year-old online to "catch a sex offender".</p>
