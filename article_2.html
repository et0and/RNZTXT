            <p>One of the longest sponsorships in New Zealand sport may be coming to an end next year.</p>
        
            <p>Beer brand Steinlager is the All Blacks' longest serving sponsor having been associated with the team since 1986 in various ways but the brand might not be linked to New Zealand Rugby's flagship side in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Steinlager was a jersey sponsor between 1994 and 1998 when the logo sat on the upper right of the jersey and was a key sponsor through several Rugby World Cup cycles. Mid-year test series in recent years were named as Steinlager series.</p>
        
            <p>However, after the All Blacks' 2025 schedule was released the July home series against France did not have a sponsor's name attached to it.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby (NZR) chief executive Mark Robinson said NZR was "in market looking for opportunities" to sponsor the three-match series to be played in Dunedin, Wellington and Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working with Lion [producers of Steinlager] at the moment around our partnership there but we're also exploring other options as it relates to the July series."</p>
        
            <p>Steinlager was still listed on the NZR website as a regional sponsor.</p>
        
            <p>Alcohol sponsorship of sport in New Zealand has been around for decades and has divided the public and sporting bodies.</p>
        
            <p>Attempts to stop alcohol brands sponsoring sport have failed in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympics had a beer sponsor for the first time this year in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby's choice of current sponsors came under fire after shorts sponsor INEOS and jersey sponsor Altrad had been questioned for climate and corruption reasons.</p>
