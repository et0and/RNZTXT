            <p>Otago residents are today taking stock in the wake of widespread floods. What you need to know about roads, essential services, where to get help, and today's weather.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin and the Clutha District remain under a state of emergency, houses have been flooded in Dunedin, people have been evacuated, and there are water and power outages in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>Across Otago more than 130 roads and highways are closed, with widespread slips, blocks and damage - but both Dunedin City Council and Clutha District Council have urged people not to venture out unnecessarily.</p>
        
            <p>If there are immediate threats to life or property, always dial 111 for Police, Fire or Ambulance. Local authorities are responsible for civil defence emergency management in their area.</p>
        
            <p>There have been cell tower outages in places, and officials and welfare teams are working to make contact with those who have been cut off, including some isolated communities.</p>
        
            <p>There have been reports of wastewater treatment plants overflowing, and people in flooded areas are warned to treat all floodwater as contaminated.</p>

            <p>RNZ is NZ's statutory Civil Defence lifeline radio broadcaster, providing vital information and updates as they come to hand. All frequencies can be found here.</p>
        
            <p>Road crews are out today assessing damage to infrastructure and starting work to get all roads reopened.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the weather easing, the city has experienced several slips, including a large one on the West Harbour, and some that have affected houses," Dunedin Civil Defence controller Sandy Graham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Connectivity in, out and within the city is a priority."</p>
        
            <p>Of the more than 130 roads and highways that were closed early on Saturday morning, there are 17 in Waitaki District, 38 in Dunedin and 65 in Clutha District.</p>
        
            <p>But many other roads had also been affected by the flooding and slips, so while people have been told to stay put unless necessary, anyone venturing out has been warned to do so with care.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Airport is open, but has warned that road closures could affect those going to or from the airport.</p>

            <p>Many stretches of highway are closed:</p>
        
            <p>NZTA warned that some areas with closed highways had no detour in place.</p>
        
            <p>SH1 between Waihola and Milton had been reopened by Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday's red weather warnings were lifted by MetService by about 8pm on Friday. But the rain has not cleared completely, with a yellow heavy rain watch remaining over Otago on Saturday morning for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha.</p>
        
            <p>There was a risk thunderstorms could also show up over much of the South Island on Saturday afternoon or evening, however, they were more likely for inland Clutha and Southland than other areas. And if they do show up, could bring heavy rain up to 25mm an hour and hail.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned the amount of rain that had fallen in Otago means the current conditions could still pose a "threat to life", as waterways, flooding, slips and the roads all remain dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>"Widespread heavy rain has cleared. However, occasional showers are expected to affect the area tonight and tomorrow morning, one or two could be heavy. 10 to 15mm could accumulate in some places."</p>
        
            <p>People should keep up-to-date with the latest forecasts, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Water: It is not yet known how long it will take to restore water to Dunedin's West Harbour and Otago Peninsula areas. Infrastructure has been damaged by a huge slip near Ravensbourne, and people are being asked to conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, there are disruptions to the water supply for Tuapeka East, Glenkenich, Tapanui, Waipahi and Richardson North.</p>
        
            <p>While in North Otago, Waitaki District Council warned people in Awamoko and Windsor to conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>Welfare centres: An evacuation centre is open at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin, where about 30 people stayed overnight. The East Otago Community Centre is also open for people to take shelter there.</p>
        
            <p>Food is available at both, and anyone seeking shelter is reminded to take any medicines or medical equipment they may need.</p>
        
            <p>"Pets are also allowed if caged or under control," the council said.</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, three welfare centres that were open earlier have now closed, but the Red Cross is still running one at Te Whare PuƒÅwai o Tokomairaro in Milton.</p>
        
            <p>Waitaki District Council has now closed a welfare centre that was operating at Hampden Hall as those in need of a place to stay - mostly travellers - have been given places to stay with locals.</p>
