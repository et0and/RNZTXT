        <p>
Rachel Yerbury-Wilson says despite officials' warnings, she would do it again.

            <p>A Tasman woman says she did not think twice about rescuing a tiny seal pup when she saw it moving across a busy highway in peak traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Rachel Yerbury-Wilson spotted the baby seal on State Highway 60 near Appleby while driving to her work in Nelson on Wednesday, just before 8am.</p>
        
            <p>At first she thought it was a dog that had been hit by a car.</p>
        
            <p>"There's this black thing kind of waddling across the road,and I thought 'oh no, they've hit a dog'. And the way it was moving, I thought 'oh no, the back legs have been hit'.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of cars ignored the creature, and as Yerbury-Wilson got closer she realised it was not an injured dog at all.</p>
        
            <p>"I was like, 'What the hell is a seal doing on the main road?'"</p>

            <p>She pulled over and was able to scoop it up in a recycling bin, using her foot.</p>
        
            <p>"So I stopped the traffic, and literally like some lunatic from a film with like, both hands, crossing the main highway. People are going, 'What on Earth is this crazy lady doing?' And it was only half a metre from where the cars are."</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation (DOC) advice for people who come across a seal is not to handle it and call its emergency hotline. It says it takes a hands-off approach to seals, capable and resilient animals who usually find their way home.</p>
        
            <p>"I just thought, well, 'this creature is in immediate danger'. It's not as if it was on a side road or anywhere else I would have thought 'don't touch it'. But I think on the main highway where the traffic is 80km/h, if not more, there was no way."</p>
        
            <p>Once in the back of her car, another woman pulled over to give her a hand - just as well, as then the seal escaped and clambered over the seats and up onto the dashboard.</p>
        
            <p>The other woman, a volunteer for the SPCA, scooped the seal up in some blankets, put it back in the recycling bin and into her van - and the "little Houdini" escaped again.</p>
        
            <p>Eventually they secured the seal with a dog collar, and a DOC staff member arrived later that morning to release it back into the sea - but not before the police showed up to investigate reports of a 'dirty sheep' on the highway.</p>
        
            <p>"A feel-good story I suppose, for the beginning of the year," Yerbury-Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>She said faced with an unlikely repeat of the scenario, she would do it again.</p>
