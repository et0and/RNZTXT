        <h2>Ferry grounding to cause 'issues' for inter-island freight</h2>
        <p>
With NZ's only rail ferry out of action, trains can no longer get between the North and South islands, cutting the rail network in half.

            <p>The grounding of New Zealand's only rail ferry is going to cause "issues" for inter-island freight, a union representative says.</p>
        
            <p>The Aratere ran aground just out of Picton around 10pm Friday with eight drivers and 39 crew on board.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured, but the vessel could not be moved until high tide after 8am on Saturday, Interislander general manager Duncan Roy said.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime Union communications officer Victor Billot told RNZ the Aratere was New Zealand's only rail-enabled ferry, meaning it could be used to transport trains across Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>In that way it was an extension of the Main Trunk Line and formed an integral part of the rail network.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry's grounding meant there would be "issues" with getting freight between the North and South islands, Billot said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are going to be issues there. I have no idea how that's going to play out."</p>
        
            <p>The incident showed "just how important those ferries are for the connection between the islands", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Aratere, along with its sister ferries Kaiarahi and Kaitaki, carried billions of dollars of freight every year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're obviously going to see over the weeks ahead what the impacts are going to be of this incident."</p>
        
            <p>Roy did not answer questions about impacts on freight when asked by RNZ shortly after the ferry ran aground, saying it was too early to address that issue.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now I'm totally concentrated on our passengers on board and our crew on board - that is our main focus.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now we're totally focussed on recovering our vessel but most importantly making sure our people are safe and sound."</p>
        
            <p>Roy said the grounding came after a reported steering failure, but would not go into further details, saying he did not want to pre-empt an investigation that was under way.</p>
        
            <p>There was no word on the severity of the issue or how long it would take to fix.</p>
        
            <p>In 2013, the Aratere lost a propeller during a voyage, leading to the ferry being out of action for six months while it underwent repairs.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail hired a ship from Poland to cover the route during that time. All up, the repairs, ship hire and lost revenue cost KiwiRail between $20 million and $30 million, its then-chief executive Jim Quinn said at the time.</p>
