            <p>Author Neil Gaiman has been dropped by one of his publishers after he was accused of sexual assault and abuse by multiple women, including one from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple women spoke earlier this month to Vulture, a US entertainment section of New York Magazine, with allegations of sexual assault. Writer Lila Shapiro spoke with eight women who detailed their experiences.</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman is a best-selling British fantasy graphic novel and science fiction writer, whose books include Good Omens, American Gods and ground-breaking comic book series The Sandman.</p>
        
            <p>Dark Horse Comics, who have published many of Gaiman's graphic novels and comic books, announced Sunday that they would no longer publish Gaiman's work and were cancelling current projects.</p>
        
            <p>"Dark Horse takes seriously the allegations against Neil Gaiman and we are no longer publishing his works," the company wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Dark Horse takes seriously the allegations against Neil Gaiman and we are no longer publishing his works. Confirming that the Anansi Boys comic series and collected volume have been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>An adaptation of Gaiman's Anansi Boys book and collection of it has now been cancelled, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman and his now ex-wife musician Amanda Palmer were staying in New Zealand during Covid-19 lockdowns beginning in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>One of the women who has accused Gaiman of sexual assault is New Zealander Scarlett Pavlovich, Vulture reported. She was hired as a nanny for Gaiman and Palmer when they were living on Waiheke Island.</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman has denied the claims through a representative and on his personal blog, saying he had only engaged in "consensual encounters."</p>
        
            <p>The allegations made against Gaiman have already halted film and TV adaptations of his work that were in production. Disney has stopped work on The Graveyard Book, while the third season finale of Good Omens will now close off the series with a 90-minute episode, without the author's involvement.</p>
        
            <p>A second season of The Sandman, largely completed before the allegations surfaced, is currently still scheduled for release this year, as is Amazon's series adaptation of Anansi Boys.</p>
