            <p>Former Green MP Darleen Tana's husband's e-bike business is in liquidation, on the same day the executive summary of the report into what she knew about allegations of migrant exploitation at the business was publicly released.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Companies Register shows insolvency, forensic accounting, and consulting firm Khov Jones has been appointed as liquidators of E Cycles NZ Limited.</p>
        
            <p>The register shows Khov Jones was appointed by the company's shareholders by special resolution. Christian Hoff-Nielsen, Tana's husband, is listed as sole director of the business.</p>
        
            <p>The firm's first report is due on 23 July.</p>
        
            <p>According to the New Zealand Herald a notice in the window of Bikes and Beyond in Newmarket said the store was temporarily closed.</p>
        
            <p>A second Bikes and Beyond shop on Waiheke has been advertised on TradeMe since 2 July, with a list price of $0.00.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party has now publicly released the executive summary of the investigation into what Tana knew about allegations of migrant exploitation at her husband's business, and whether she was up front with the Greens.</p>
        
            <p>The report, which RNZ obtained last week, states Tana likely knew about the allegations, and failed to disclose to the Greens a personal grievance an ex-employee had raised.</p>
        
            <p>Tana disputes aspects of the report, and the manner in which it was conducted and released.</p>
        
            <p>She resigned as a Green MP last week, but the party wants her to resign from Parliament altogether.</p>
        
            <p>"Darleen was given multiple opportunities to be upfront about the serious allegations she was facing but chose to obfuscate instead of answering straightforward questions, prompting the need for an independent investigation," said Green Party co-leader Chl√∂e Swarbrick.</p>
        
            <p>"Now the public can see why Caucus was unanimous in requesting Darleen's resignation from Parliament."</p>
