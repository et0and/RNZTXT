        <p>
A medical clinic in Carterton will have no GP for the rest of the week as it grapples with the challenges of a GP shortage.

            <p>A medical clinic in the Wairarapa town of Carterton will have no GP for the rest of the week as it grapples with the challenges of a GP shortage.</p>
        
            <p>But it is far from the only rural clinic to face trouble.</p>
        
            <p>"An ongoing GP shortage across New Zealand means many practices like ours are starting to face challenges like this more often," said a spokesperson for the clinic.</p>
        
            <p>The clinic was quick to reassure that they would still be able to provide care for patients.</p>
        
            <p>"While one of our GPs had to begin their planned leave earlier than expected, this is temporary. Our other GP will be back on Monday, and in the meantime, we've secured a telehealth GP to assist with any immediate concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"Comprehensive care is still available at the practice. Our skilled team is here to support you and can handle many health needs, including prescriptions where appropriate."</p>

            <p>Carterton Mayor Ron Mark said the "dire situation" Carterton Medical Clinic faced was first addressed during a public meeting back in May.</p>
        
            <p>He said the clinic was down to two doctors while servicing a region of more than 10,000 people that were widely dispersed across a large area.</p>
        
            <p>The region also had an increasing population population of both elderly and children for the clinic to look after, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody loves to come here to play and to visit and to drink our wine, but trying to get doctors to come here and live here permanently and look after our people has been an ongoing challenge."</p>
        
            <p>Mark said rural New Zealand needed more support than some other districts because the distance in widespread communities made them more difficult to service than big towns and cities.</p>
        
            <p>Medical Director for the College of General Practitioners Dr Luke Bradford said for a number of years rural clinics had struggled to find people to work in them regularly, and struggled to find locums.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hearing incidences where clinics are struggling to get GPs or they're having days when they'll be nurse led."</p>
        
            <p>He said some patients were also being seen by GPs working remotely through telehealth.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously it's not an ideal situation."</p>
        
            <p>Telehealth has faced significant criticism from those in the rural community recently, with about 1000 people marching in Westport last weekend to protest against the closure of Buller district's only after-hours GP.</p>
        
            <p>Bradford said while telehealth had some advantages, it was not the ultimate solution.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that a significant proportion of cases actually need examination".</p>
