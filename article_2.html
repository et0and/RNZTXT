        <p>
With many parts of New Zealand warm and very dry, fires can take hold and spread quickly, fire fighters say.

            <p>Fire fighters are asking people to hold back on lighting fireworks this weekend, as conditions are just too dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>While conditions were wet in some areas, including a state of emergency declared in south Westland due to flooding and slips - in many others parts of the country it was warm and very dry, which meant fires could take hold and spread quickly, Fire and Emergency said.</p>
        
            <p>Crews had already been over-run with fireworks-related calls, responding to more than 80 requests for help since 2 November - double the number from the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ community education manager Tom Ronaldson said when windy, warm conditions were mixed with fireworks, it made for a dangerous scenario.</p>
        
            <p>Among the firefighters on high alert were those in Hawke's Bay, as temperatures were predicted to soar there this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecasted warm northwesterly winds and a sweltering 30 degrees in Hastings on Saturday, followed by 27 degrees on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings senior station officer Joel Fraser said the combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions inevitably increased fire risk, and his station got busy, so they were keeping a close eye on things.</p>
        
            <p>The norwester wind not only dried out the plains but could spread wildfires and controlled burns, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay will move to a restricted fire season next week.</p>
        
            <p>People should always visit the Check It's Alright website to make sure it was fine to light fires or cook outside.</p>
