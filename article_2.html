            <p>South Islanders saw a fireball break through the atmosphere near Wanaka overnight with a loud sonic boom.</p>
        
            <p>The meteoroid became a fireball and raced above Queenstown around 11pm, before burning out over Southland.</p>
        
            <p>Fireballs Aotearoa, a group interested in meteorites, said a sonic boom was widely reported as the object came in overhead.</p>
        
            <p>Although most of its mass burned up in the fireball stage, it was believed a small meteorite may have landed in a remote portion of the Eyre Mountains in northern Southland.</p>
        
            <p>Fireballs Aotearoa are on the hunt for it.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Steve Wyn-Harris said there was too much cloud cover to get specifics on its location.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't got a lot of cameras with good data to really pinpoint the exact location.</p>
        
            <p>"So because of that at this stage unless we get better data, we won't be setting up a search expedition for it in the Eyre Mountains."</p>
        
            <p>The group is still asking for public input.</p>
        
            <p>"We are assessing our data to see whether a meteorite may have fallen in the area. But we need your sighting reports," the group said on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"Was so spectacular to see this by chance tonight," one person in Queensberry, Otago said.</p>
        
            <p>"Was sitting on my balcony in Queenstown and the balcony suddenly light up, was amazing to see and then hear the sonic boom 2 mins later," another person wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Saw it fly overhead in Queenstown heading South over Deer Park Heights," said another. "Very loud delayed sonic boom 1-2mins later that rattled the mirror on the wall inside the house."</p>
        
            <p>The meteoroid would be New Zealand's 11th documented meteorite, if found.</p>

            <p>"Orbital data indicates the rock originated from asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, Fireballs Aotearoa posted.</p>
        
            <p>"It is therefore likely a fragment of a larger asteroid that formed early in in solar system's 4.5 billion year old history!"</p>
