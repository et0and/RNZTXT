        <h2>The day of the Swamp Fox</h2>
        <p>
The most celebrated victory of New Zealand's incredible sporting weekend may have been the one at a small rugby ground in Te Aroha.

            <p>Never mind our sporting victories in sailing, netball, two types of cricket and more in the weekend, the Swamp Foxes are the toast of their towns.</p>
        
            <p>It was a remarkable and unexpected moment during question time in Parliament this week.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister was talking about rebuilding the economy when he suddenly turned to the speaker and said: "It would be remiss of me not to mention the Swamp Foxes' win in the Meads Cup on the weekend."</p>
        
            <p>As he sat, another politician cheered "so good".</p>
        
            <p>This was the day after a golden weekend for New Zealand sport, including the America's Cup win, the White Ferns becoming T20 world champions and the Black Caps conquering India. The Silver Ferns even thrashed Australia by 14 goals.</p>
        
            <p>But some are claiming that the Swamp Foxes' 37-29 win against Mid-Canterbury in Te Aroha on Saturday tops the success list.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh, it is definitely number one by far," a delighted fan told The Detail in the main street of Paeroa, home to the Swamp Foxes' union headquarters.</p>
        
            <p>"It was amazing to see the women's cricket team, fantastic to see the America's Cup win, Team New Zealand get it done, but to be honest this was the main one."</p>
        
            <p>The Swamp Foxes, aka the Thames Valley Rugby Union, ended a near 30-year drought on Saturday by winning the Heartland Championship's Meads Cup on home soil.</p>
        
            <p>The last time they achieved this feat was in 1995. Warren Gatland was the coach, and Poverty Bay the opponent.</p>
        
            <p>On the morning before their latest win, the prime minister sent the team a video of encouragement and support.</p>
        
            <p>He has something of a connection with the team. One of his long-time employees is a big supporter and the Thames Valley Rugby Union van also accidentally backed into his Crown limo outside Auckland Airport last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is the day... the Thames Valley Swamp Foxes are going to get the job done," he said in his social media post. "The conditions are perfect; it's going to be awesome in Te Aroha today. You guys are so ready for it, I know you are going to get the job done..."</p>
        
            <p>And the team did, holding off a fierce last-minute attack by Mid-Canterbury and having a player sent off in the 77th minute.</p>
        
            <p>The win meant a lot to the district, which had endured a tough couple of years following Covid and Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>"It was incredible to see the faces of the supporters, especially the older ones... there were tears," Thames Valley assistant coach and former player Leon Holden says.</p>
        
            <p>"It was so neat to see all the different towns come and support the team.</p>
        
            <p>"Times have been tough here, businesses have had to close down. It hasn't always been easy, so hopefully this has given people a bit of a boost."</p>
        
            <p>An elderly fan who attended the game said it did. "A win like that is fabulous, it gives everybody something to look up to".</p>
        
            <p>The team won the Meads Cup, named for All Blacks legend Colin Meads. His daughter Rhonda was on hand to present it on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Colin's son Glynn, from the rival King Country Rugby Union, admitted the Swamp Foxes were worthy winners.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good to see," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The people at the ground, the support that was there, the way the game was played as well, it was great to see. And great for Thames Valley to achieve that, they have been fighting hard for a few years - it takes a lot of effort from a lot of people to achieve that."</p>
        
            <p>Grassroots rugby, he said, was crucial to small-town communities. But it was not always easy for the players, who faced daily struggles.</p>
        
            <p>"Work, family... our young men with a family nowadays have big ties that they struggle with to take time out for rugby, they have got to provide for their families, they have got to keep the money coming in. Sometimes our amateur players have to work Saturday mornings, so they have to figure how to get round the obstacles. So, we appreciate their efforts for it."</p>
        
            <p>So, would more money help?</p>
        
            <p>"That's a tough one. The province gets in and helps out as much as they can. New Zealand gives money to the provinces to do that. We are losing some slowly, the provinces from New Zealand, which makes it tricky. It's hard in smaller unions to get sponsorship all the time and keep providing for our team. More money would help but I don't think it's the total answer."</p>
        
            <p>He fired a friendly warning shot at Thames Valley.</p>
        
            <p>"A note from King Country, we're coming next year. We're having a crack at it. We are coming."</p>
