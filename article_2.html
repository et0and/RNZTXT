            <p>Back in the early 1930s, the pianette or a mini-piano was briefly an Art Deco home sensation.</p>
        
            <p>A final fight against the arrival of radio and hi fi, the stylish yet small piano was revolutionary. It was able to fit into small living areas due to the mechanical action of the upright being positioned below the keyboard. In use of hardwoods and coated steel, the pianette was also progressive in industrial design.</p>
        
            <p>Yet the popularity of the Eavestaff Mini Pianette was not to be. The instrument turned out to be acoustically poor and very difficult to tune. </p>
        
            <p>"As such," writes musician, artist and producer Andrew Laking, "there are thousands of these unwanted pianos scattered across the world."</p>
        
            <p>But now, in Pōneke Wellington, a band of enthusiasts led by Fat Freddy's Drop's Toby Laing and Laking have revived the instrument by converting it into a Pianette Automatique, thanks to, Laking says, some "off-the-shelf 19th century technology and some clever electronic work by Michael Piper".</p>
        
            <p>The Pianette Automatique is a new, self-playing, midi controlled musical installation. It will be on display, playing away, in the winter warmth of the Begonia House in the Wellington Botanic Gardens, until 21 June, 9am till 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>A concert will be performed with live accompaniment from Laing and Riki Gooch on the evening of 19 June. </p>
        
            <p>It's all part of Lōemis, an annual arts festival masterminded by Andrew Laking that takes place in unusual locations around Wellington. Its focus is on staging new works billed as "fantastical, mystical and transformative". </p>
        
            <p>Started in 2016, the Lōemis festival occurs around the time of the winter solstice, Maruaroa o Takurua and connects back to creative western cultural pagan traditions, encouraging participation in new communal rituals. </p>

            <p>This year's festival includes everything from Skål, a Midwinter Feast and winter food foraging to a 'Great Hall Hybrid Art Market'. </p>
        
            <p>The final night on Friday 21 June sees a wolf-themed procession, Wolf Run, that features mobile projections, a giant brass band and a closing fire ceremony, and The Longest Night, an ambitious sleep concert that runs from 11pm to 7am. Seven artists will perform all night long, while you hopefully get some sleep. The concert was dreamed up by 'gong bath' specialist Erika Grant and also features Riki Gooch, Chris O'Connor and David Long.</p>
