            <p>Auckland's Pasifika Festival is under way at Western Springs with a raft of sound and colour.</p>
        
            <p>Events on offer on Saturday included poetry, Zumba, a guide-to-life workshop and multiple performances, including an afternoon show from Fijian R&B group the LeftOvas, who opened for Six60 earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Aansan Yen, who has Chinese heritage but was born and raised in the Netherlands, said she was intrigued by and interested in Pasific Island cultures.</p>
        
            <p>"I love to see the dance, the artistry, and I also feel a strong connection to the ocean," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to celebrate unity, tradition, community - all the things that make life important for me."</p>
        
            <p>Political leaders also made an appearance, and the leader of the opposition Chris Hipkins said the festival was a chance to connect with different Pasifika communities in one place.</p>
        
            <p>"Pasifika communities make up such a big part of Aotearoa's overall culture and identity. We are of the Pacific," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think political leaders have got a really important job in bringing the community together. That means celebrating our differences."</p>
        
            <p>
Pasifika Festival runs from 9am to 6pm on Saturday 8 March and 10am to 4pm on Sunday 9 March.

            <p>The festival was cancelled in 2019 following the Christchurch mosque attacks, then again in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023 the festival went ahead but took a very different tone, held just weeks after storms devastated much of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Organiser Jep Savali said Pasifika Festival is now on a "growth curve".</p>
        
            <p>Authenticity had become an important topic in discussions with the Pasifika Village Charitable Trust, which advised on the cultural integrity of the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"In our feedback to each other about how we can be better, where we can once again grow this festival, authenticity is really important. Authenticity of food offering, authenticity in terms of the cultural exchange, in terms of the performances."</p>
        
            <p>Green Party MP Teanau Tuiono also used the weekend to announce a petition asking the government to extend visa-free travel to visitors from Pacific Island nations.</p>
        
            <p>Tuiono said Pasifika Festival would show Aotearoa New Zealand was a Pacific nation "by the rich cultural expression and coming together of peoples".</p>
        
            <p>Pasifika Festival runs from 9am to 6pm on Saturday 8 March and 10am to 4pm on Sunday 9 March. Entry is free.</p>
