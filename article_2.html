            <p>A resident in a Far North town has described seeing a "pool of blood" on the road after an overnight incident.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the Far North town of Ōkaihau late on Tuesday night, but so far secrecy surrounds the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand and St John were called to Settlers Way, the town's main street, at about 10.30pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency and St John were referring all questions to police, who were not commenting on the situation for now.</p>
        
            <p>One resident told RNZ she saw a pool of blood on the road outside Ōkaihau College on Wednesday morning, and a second patch about 50 to 100 metres away marked with neon spray paint.</p>
        
            <p>She said she saw police speaking to a staff member at the college, which was due to reopen on Friday after the summer break.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said he needed to confirm "a number of facts" before he could provide any information about what had happened.</p>
