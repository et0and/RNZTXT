            <p>In a riot of colour and joyous revelry, South Asian communities in New Zealand have celebrated the vibrant festival of Holi, marking the arrival of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the triumph of good over evil.</p>
        
            <p>Although some festivities were held more than a month ago, the Festival of Colours culminated in two key celebrations on Sunday and Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Holika Dahan was marked on 24 March, where bonfires were lit to symbolize the victory of good over evil.</p>

            <p>Rangwali Holi, or Dhulandi, was then celebrated on 25 March, where participants threw coloured water or powder at each other as they sang, danced and enjoyed festive foods.</p>
        
            <p>Many legends are associated with the festival.</p>
        
            <p>One recounts the story of Prahlad and Holika, where the former's unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu saved him from the flames of a pyre as his malevolent aunt, who had lured him onto the flames, met her demise.</p>

            <p>This tale symbolises the victory of good over evil and the importance of faith.</p>
        
            <p>Another popular legend revolves around the courtship of Lord Krishna and Radha.</p>
        
            <p>Krishna, envious of Radha's fair complexion, playfully applied colours to her face - beginning the tradition of smearing coloured powder onto others during Holi and infusing the festival with elements of romance and joy.</p>
