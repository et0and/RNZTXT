            <p>Police say it is possible they have uncovered a human trafficking and migrant exploitation ring in Hawke's Bay, sparked by a "distraught" victim raising the alarm.</p>
        
            <p>A 44-year-old man facing three charges of rape, and one of unlawful sexual connection, was remanded in custody and granted interim name suppression at Hastings District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>He was arrested following a joint operation between Hawke's Bay police and Immigration New Zealand, called Operation Wentworth.</p>
        
            <p>The operation began when a victim contacted police "after fleeing and asking for help", Detective Senior Sergeant Sally Patrick told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"She was distraught," Patrick said.</p>
        
            <p>"She went to a person that she trusted, and then they phoned police and we attended straight away."</p>
        
            <p>The woman accused the man of rape, and Patrick said the other information she gave led police to believe migrant exploitation and human trafficking were also at play.</p>
        
            <p>Human trafficking charges would likely be laid in the new year - but police first had to follow due process and seek the solicitor-general's consent to lay those charges, which took some time, Patrick said.</p>
        
            <p>Police "highly suspect" there were other victims - and other potential perpetrators, too, she said.</p>
        
            <p>They had so far carried out three search warrants in Hawke's Bay, and two migrants were served Deportation Liability Notices as a result.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation might go outside the region, and police were "potentially" looking at a human trafficking and migrant exploitation ring, Patrick said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we are reaching out to any victims to get in contact, and that's not always easy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The type of exploitation that they're subjected to makes them also scared to come forward."</p>
        
            <p>That could be for a number of reasons, she said - including fears they might be deported, not having financial support, and if English was not their first language.</p>
        
            <p>"We want people to know that they can come forward and police will absolutely speak to them and try and support them where we can."</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in Hastings District Court again next week.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information can contact police on 111 and quote file number 231129/1010 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration New Zealand declined to comment further, as the investigation is ongoing.</p>
