            <p>Māori health advocates say a Crown memo opposing an urgent Waitangi Tribunal inquiry demonstrates a 'blatant disregard' of Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles.</p>
        
            <p>Lady Tureiti Moxon is one of the claimants leading the bid for an urgent Tribunal inquiry into the disestablishment of Te Aka Whai Ora, The Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>Lady Moxon said the Crown response "signifies a systematic breakdown of the principles outlined in Te Tiriti o Waitangi across all government levels."</p>
        
            <p>In its response, the Crown acknowledged it had not consulted with its Treaty partner and it currently had no alternative solution to addressing health inequities for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown said its decision to dismantle Te Aka Whai Ora was "made by the government at the political level following political parties campaigning on this issue ahead of the recent General Election."</p>
        
            <p>A submission responding to the Crowns opposition was filed on behalf of claimants on Wednesday which said the Crown "clearly intended to create backlash against Māori."</p>
        
            <p>It said, the government intentionally created the "false impression of special treatment for Māori" and that "special treatment was presented as a problem politicians could promise to solve if elected, as a means to gain votes."</p>
        
            <p>The Crown accepted more support was needed to address poor Māori health outcomes but argued the Māori Health Authority was not the only way to do so.</p>
        
            <p>It said the 'present administration' believed there were 'more effective' ways to address inequities, but it was "not in a position to articulate in detail how it will do so."</p>
        
            <p>Lady Tureiti Moxon said there is clear evidence Te Aka Whai Ora will have a positive impact and meet the needs of tens of thousands of whānau Māori.</p>
        
            <p>She said the Crown had clearly demonstrated a "deliberate and politically driven effort to undermine the advancements achieved so far".</p>
        
            <p>Wai 3307 Claimants are hoping a decision on the application will be released today</p>
