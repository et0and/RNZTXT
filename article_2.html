            <p>Red Bull's Sergio Perez is expected to lose his seat to Liam Lawson as soon as the coming days, multiple outlets have reported.</p>
        
            <p>The move comes after Red Bull watched its run of consecutive constructors' championships come to an end in 2024 when McLaren finished on top.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull driver Max Verstappen won his fourth consecutive drivers' championship, but Perez finished eighth overall.</p>

            <p>The 34-year-old Mexican finished second in the 2023 standings and has won six races in 14 seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson, 22, had been on the Red Bull junior team since 2019 and was a backup Red Bull driver the past two seasons.</p>
        
            <p>He took over Daniel Riccardo's seat for Red Bull's RB team (formerly AlphaTauri) this season and has 11 F1 starts to his credit.</p>
        
            <p>Isack Hadjar, a dual citizen of France and Algeria, is expected to take Lawson's spot at for the RB team alongside Yuki Tsunoda of Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Hadjar finished second on the F2 circuit in 2024 with Campos Racing.</p>
        
            <p>Perez still is signed with Red Bull through 2025 and could stay on as an team ambassador or leave entirely.</p>
