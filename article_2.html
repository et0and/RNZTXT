        <h2>Government stands by Matariki funding cuts</h2>
        <p>
As the government defends reduced funding for Matariki events, the holiday is experiencing a resurgence throughout the Pacific.
</p>
        
            <p>The government is confident a funding cut for Matariki will not hamper future celebrations, Treaty Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government cut funding for Matariki by 45 percent this year.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said it was one of many tough decisions the government had to make.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the funding cut, the government had committed to ongoing funding of $3 million a year for Matariki, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We think that provides a basis to have continued celebrations and, of course, right across the communities, people are celebrating in their own different ways, so we feel there is a good basis on which to grow."</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon were among dignitaries at Matariki observance karakia hosted by Ngāi Tahu at Treble Cone near Wānaka on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told RNZ's Matariki programme it was an honour to attend the "wonderful" ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>The holiday was an important chance to stop, and to reflect on the people lost over the year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A moment to take a beat to think about the year ahead and actually what are our ambitions and aspirations, as a family and personally."</p>
        
            <p>He said the funding cuts did not stop communities from getting out and celebrating.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going through some tough times, we have to make some tough choices across the whole of government spending."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Dr Rangi Mātāmua said he was excited to see the idea of a Matariki public holiday spread across the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Mātāmua was invited to Tahiti recently to discuss New Zealand's public holiday.</p>
        
            <p>The territory had just announced its inaugural Matari'i public holiday - for 20 November 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really evident to see - because Matariki is right across Polynesia, right across the Pacific - that people are wanting to connect with their localised traditions and practices by following and implementing Matariki.</p>
        
            <p>"Traditional practice that has meaning and purpose in the modern day."</p>
        
            <p>Mātāmua said he could not reveal where New Zealand's national commemoration would be held next year.</p>
