        <h2>What the Lion King got wrong about lions</h2>
        <p>
Would Simba really end up with Nala? And why is Scar more attractive than Mufasa? We ask an expert.

            <p>For many millennials, the 1994 Disney coming-of-age classic The Lion King formed an integral part of our childhood.</p>
        
            <p>We gasped as the king of the Pride Lands, Mufasa, tragically died, trampled under the hooves of stampeding wildebeest.</p>
        
            <p>We wept as his heartbroken son and heir Simba left his home range, then cheered as he dethroned his villainous uncle Scar and took his rightful place as king.</p>
        
            <p>The movie was also a massive box office hit. It was the highest-grossing animated film of the 1990s, with its opening weekend drawing 10 million people in the United States alone.</p>
        
            <p>But while the iconic movie (and its equally iconic soundtrack) have a special place in many hearts, how accurate is it when it comes to actual lion behaviour?</p>
        
            <p>We asked an expert to sort fact from fiction.</p>
        
            <p>Spoiler alert: Simba's happily-ever-after story involves him falling in love with Nala, a young lioness from his pride.</p>
        
            <p>Elton John and Tim Rice's 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' is the soundtrack to the realisation of their feelings for each other, and the movie ends with a new cub to complete the circle of life and carry on Simba's legacy.</p>
        
            <p>But the Simba/Nala relationship just wouldn't happen, according to Neil Jordan, a zoologist at the University of New South Wales and Taronga Conservation Society, and a researcher with Botswana Predator Conservation.</p>
        
            <p>"As it is portrayed in the movie, there is quite a lot of potential for incest, particularly in the later scenes, which lions will definitely avoid when possible," Dr Jordan says.</p>

            <p>In real life, female lions live together in family groups, while male lions tend to leave their pride at around four or five years old and join a different one.</p>
        
            <p>This is to avoid breeding with close relatives.</p>
        
            <p>Which brings up the possibility of incest in The Lion King.</p>
        
            <p>Nala is about the same age as Simba.</p>
        
            <p>"She is at least a sort of cousin of Simba and possibly even a full sibling. So there's a little clanger there," Dr Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no benefit to Simba of returning to Pride Rock. He would disperse in real life … and take over another pride far from his own."</p>
        
            <p>All in all, the whole Pride Lands succession plan - where the firstborn son takes over when the king dies - just doesn't hold up.</p>

            <p>Simba's uncle Scar is a typical Disney villain who wants to see Simba and Mufasa dead so he can take over as king of the Pride Lands.</p>
        
            <p>The self-serving, jealous character gets his name from a huge scar over one of his eyes. Unlike his brother and nephew, Scar's mane is a deep, dark brown.</p>
        
            <p>And it's that dark mane that would make Scar popular with the ladies - more so than Mufasa, Dr Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>Lions with a dark mane are more attractive to females than their light-maned counterparts because making all that pigment uses energy.</p>
        
            <p>So the darkness of a lion's mane is thought to indicate how well-fed he is, and is a proxy for his overall "evolutionary fitness".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit like a peacock's tail but in lion language. It's essentially an honest signal of fitness to the female," he says.</p>
        
            <p>This is based on a study from East Africa where life-sized models of lions, with different coloured manes, were put out on the savannah, and the responses of other lions recorded.</p>
        
            <p>Females were more likely to approach and solicit males with dark manes.</p>
        
            <p>"So Scar is actually the hot one," Dr Jordan says.</p>

            <p>A trio of hyenas - called Shenzi, Banzai and Ed - do Scar's bidding. He's seen throwing scraps of food to them.</p>
        
            <p>But in nature, hyenas and lions compete with each other.</p>
        
            <p>"They are both top-order predators … they're used to working around one another, but it is not ever described as a cooperative relationship," Dr Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>Hyenas live in clans of up to 100 individuals, some related and some not.</p>
        
            <p>They're also highly intelligent.</p>
        
            <p>Mufasa's death scene, in which a wildebeest stampede is started by the hyenas, is a realistic hunting strategy, Dr Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>"Hyenas run prey down over long distances and probably the most typical way that hyenas will initiate a hunt is making the prey run, like they do in the stampede of the wildebeest."</p>
        
            <p>He says hyenas will also watch a herd, pick out a younger or weaker individual, then run them down over several kilometres.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>But meerkats are from southern Africa and The Lion King is set in East Africa, Dr Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>Plus, he adds, "[meerkats] are extremely timid animals … if a warthog were to approach or run close by, I think they'd be running to the closest bolt hole".</p>
        
            <p>And what about Pumbaa's smelly farts?</p>
        
            <p>"They run with their tail up in the air, so there's a good chance that if they do fart, it would make it to you," Dr Jordan says.</p>
        
            <p>Although he can't recall ever smelling a warthog fart, they are omnivores and eat everything.</p>
        
            <p>"I imagine given their diet … that you wouldn't really want to be downwind of one."</p>
