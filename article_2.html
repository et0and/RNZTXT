        <h2>Health NZ's proposed digital cuts: 'We are seeing the cracks widen'</h2>
        <p>
Nearly 98 percent of health IT experts and healthworkers say proposed cuts to Health NZ's digital services budget will hurt patients, according to a new survey.

More than 94 percent of those surveyed said slow and inefficient IT systems meant staff spending more time on admin and less time with patients. File photo.

            <p>Nearly 98 percent of health IT experts and healthworkers say proposed cuts to Health NZ's digital services budget will hurt patients, according to a new survey.</p>
        
            <p>The report by Health Informatics NZ (HiNZ) shows:</p>
        
            <p>Frustrations with IT were leading to extra workload and fuelling burnout, some reported.</p>
        
            <p>"We are already disillusioned. Simple basic IT functionality will now get in the way of us delivering care and impede research into how we can improve. We will burn out," said one.</p>
        
            <p>Crumbling and inadequate IT systems were having a direct impact on patients now, another said.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot in good faith assure my patients they are receiving high quality, equitable care."</p>
        
            <p>HiNZ said its December survey received 358 responses from digital health experts across the sector, of which a quarter were clinicians directly involved in patient care.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Simeon Brown has asked officials to reconsider the draft plan to slash the number of data and digital roles from 2400 to 1285 as part of Health NZ's wider Reset.</p>
        
            <p>Axing roles - including those currently vacant - was expected to save $100m a year, in addition to the $380m for IT projects "recalled" in Budget 2024.</p>
        
            <p>HiNZ said the new digital budget of $658m a year equated to just 2.2 percent of total health spend, which undermined Health NZ's stated commitment to using digital solutions to treat the current health crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"While budget cuts may appear to save money in the short term, they can have long term consequences on patient care by reducing efficiency, increasing errors, limiting access to care and impeding technological innovation," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>HiNZ chief executive Scott Arrol said the survey also asked respondents to identify the "opportunities" for digital health solutions.</p>
        
            <p>They were:</p>
        
            <p>"These solutions were those identified as being most likely to both significantly reduce patient harm and achieve substantial cost savings."</p>
