            <p>A vaccinologist is warning that restricting access to the Covid-19 vaccine could send a message that it is no longer important.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 vaccines and boosters have always been provided free-of-charge - but that funding commitment is due to expire at the end of June next year.</p>
        
            <p>It is possible the government could move to a more targeted approach like with flu vaccines - where only vulnerable populations get them for free.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told Morning Report whether or not some people might be charged for Covid-19 vaccinations later next year was one of a raft of issues new Health Minister Shane Reti was looking into.</p>
        
            <p>But Helen Petousis-Harris from Auckland University said if people were required to pay for the vaccines themselves it would lead to "poorer outcomes".</p>
        
            <p>"If people have to pay out of their pocket you immediately put a fairly substantial obstacle to actually people getting vaccinated."</p>
        
            <p>Vaccines which were not funded "no matter how good they are" were not perceived as being as important, she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, if vaccines were "free and easy to get, that makes a huge difference".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is currently experiencing its fifth wave of Covid-19, but Petousis-Harris said it was not just acute infections that needed to be taken into account.</p>
        
            <p>The burden of people developing Long Covid also needed to be weighed, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of reasons why we want to see good coverage."</p>
        
            <p>And while protection from existing Covid-19 vaccine formulas was beginning to wane, the newer vaccines were more effective against current variants, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are new formulations and we expect to see those shortly in New Zealand; they're going to do a better job."</p>
        
            <p>Medsafe last week said it had accepted applications for the latest updates of the Pfizer and Novovax Covid-19 vaccines and would begin reviewing them.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told RNZ he believed Pharmac funding for some vaccinations needed to continue.</p>
        
            <p>However he could not say whether funding for Covid-19 vaccinations for those at lower risk of infection would continue after June.</p>
        
            <p>"The first major problem we've got is that the [previous] government wasn't planning to fund Pharmac beyond June next year, which is quite outrageous."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti would "work his way through" though considerations and figure out the best way to deliver the necessary health services to people, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Reti on Sunday told the New Zealand Herald that Pharmac funding for both Covid-19 vaccines and antivirals was due to come to an end on 30 June, 2024.</p>
