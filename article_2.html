            <p>Three men are due to appear in court on Monday, charged with murdering Jayden Mamfredos-Nair who went missing in Auckland last April.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, police announced a body had been found at a Dairy Flat property after a search began on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"While we still have to carry out formal identification procedures, from all of our inquiries to date we believe this is Jayden," Detective Inspector Callum McNeill, of Waitematā CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, both aged 26, and a third man, aged 20, have been charged with the murder of Mamfredos-Nair.</p>
        
            <p>McNeill said police were not ruling out further arrests as part of the homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Mamfredos-Nair, then 19, was reported missing in April 2023. He was last seen on Birdwood Road in West Auckland's Rānui, the same month.</p>
        
            <p>McNeill called the recovery of his body "a devastating ordeal for Jayden's whānau, who are still coming to terms with the loss they have suffered".</p>
        
            <p>"We hope that this brings them some closure, in knowing that their boy can now be returned to them so he can be laid to rest."</p>
