            <p>Analysis - Labour has all but confirmed it will campaign on a capital gains tax (CGT) next election and could announce the details as early as mid-next year.</p>
        
            <p>Tax has long been a vexed issue for the Labour Party - most recently when Chris Hipkins, as prime minister, ruled out progressing a wealth tax at the 2023 election, and before that Jacinda Ardern pledged to never implement a CGT as long as she was leader.</p>
        
            <p>Those at the Labour conference in Christchurch at the weekend told RNZ a fairer tax system was a top issue for them, and several remits along those lines were put to the floor at the two-day meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Where it landed was with a promise to continue working on both a capital gains and a wealth tax ahead of the next election, with the party policy council and the caucus making a final decision.</p>
        
            <p>Remits to force the issue to be brought back to the party for sign-off, progressing just a wealth tax, and progressing a capital gains tax alone, all failed.</p>
        
            <p>As did a remit to make the leader, caucus and policy council consult before making any changes to policies in the party's election-year manifesto.</p>
        
            <p>In reality that already happens and Hipkins' decision to rule out a wealth tax in 2023 was a captain's call not to add it to the manifesto, rather than one to change or remove a policy already in it.</p>
        
            <p>What the weekend's decision did achieve was an endorsement for Hipkins with both the captain's call and wealth tax remits both failing.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins has always talked more positively about a CGT and as the person who put the nail in the wealth tax coffin, a decision to progress that alone would have been a difficult sell for the leader.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the wealth tax remit was vehemently voted down, and the group of members behind it was the same group given a resounding no by the rest of the party over the captain's call remit.</p>
        
            <p>They're an anti-Hipkins brigade for the most part.</p>
        
            <p>Now the work begins on how to implement a CGT, what to include, and how to convince a majority of voters it's needed.</p>
        
            <p>Labour knows all too well how difficult that can be after the policy blew up in its face in both 2011 and 2014.</p>
        
            <p>The way it's been framed so far is that it encourages productive rather than speculative investment, it fills a tax revenue hole needed for future infrastructure, and it rebalances the tax system away from salary and wage earners.</p>
        
            <p>But what to tax and how - to include a holiday home or not, for example - is going to require a lot of work and the policy council has only just been given the greenlight to go away and do that work.</p>
        
            <p>The other issue is whether to also announce a tax-free zone at the same time. It's a policy Australia has long had and Hipkins is keen to replicate it.</p>
        
            <p>But too many changes to the tax system in one go can overwhelm the public, and involves making sound cases for multiple things all at once.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins won't want to announce either until a rational argument has been mounted, and every question or potential hole has been filled with a comprehensive justification or solution.</p>
        
            <p>Big policy announcements have usually been reserved for not only election year, but broadly for the two-month election campaign period.</p>
        
            <p>National took a different approach to that last year and rolled out almost all of its policy announcements ahead of the campaign and then spent that intense six to eight weeks reinforcing it.</p>
        
            <p>Labour stuck to the tried and true of saving the bulk of the announcements for the campaign period, and as a result it turned into policy saturation and no particular policy was ever well articulated.</p>
        
            <p>Expect to see Labour take the lesson from 2023 National and roll out its policy much earlier - as early as 2025 that is.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands some big policy ideas will be ready to go by mid-next year and the rest will likely be finished rolling out by the end of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>A CGT could be one of the first cabs off the rank if the policy council and caucus get all their ducks in a row.</p>
