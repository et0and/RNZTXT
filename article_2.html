        <h2>Biden vows to push for Supreme Court reform</h2>
        <p>
The US president has vowed to "finish the job for the American people" in his first remarks since withdrawing as Democratic election candidate. Video

            <p>US President Joe Biden has told Americans it is time to pass the torch to a new generation - but he has also pledged to push for reform of the Supreme Court.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking from the Oval Office in his first speech since announcing he would not stand for re-eelection, he said the time is now for fresh voices.</p>
        
            <p>He warned there is no place in America for political violence after the shooting of former president Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>And he pledged to keep working in the few months left of his presidency to advocate for changes to the Supreme Court, one of the key arms of American government.</p>
        
            <p>Biden gave no details but sources in Washington have said he is keen to set term limits for justices and set up ethics rules.</p>
        
            <p>The Court is currently conservative leaning with six of the nine Justices appointed by Republican presidents.</p>
        
            <p>The Oval Office address marked his first public remarks since the 21 July announcement, which paved the way for Vice-President Kamala Harris to become the presumptive nominee.</p>
        
            <p>Harris, who earlier this week secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates, has already received an endorsement from the current president.</p>
        
            <p>In the first 36 hours after Sunday's announcement that he was quitting the race, the fledgling Harris campaign raised more than US$100m - a record-breaking sum.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Biden was expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, as well as with the families of US hostages still being held in Gaza.</p>
