            <p>New Zealand has claimed it's fifth Paralympic medal with Anna Grimaldi winning bronze in 100m final on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Will Stedman won a silver medal in the Men's 400m T36 final.</p>
        
            <p>Competing a little under 16 hours after finishing fourth in the Long Jump, the 24-year-old Christchurch-based athlete produced an outstanding display to record a national record time of 52.92 behind defending champion James Turner of Australia who set a world record mark of 51.54.</p>

            <p>For Stedman it was the fifth Paralympic Games medal of his career and a third successive Paralympic Games medal in the Men's 400m T36 after winning bronze medals at both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report he was definitely aiming for a sixth games in Los Angeles in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a lot of room to go, especially in the long jump, I think there's a lot of technical changes and perfection I can do.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously the 400, I think there's a lot of gains to be made there, today I ran a PB but I wasn't that fresh, and so, I'm actually really excited for the next four years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He was happy with how he went in the 400m final.</p>
        
            <p>"I got out well and felt pretty strong, I kind of hit the wall at 50m to go but managed to keep going across the line for the medal which was great."</p>
        
            <p>Stedman said cerebal palsy affected his coordination and he almost tripped a couple of times in the last 50m.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a few close calls there... I was really glad to get across the line for that silver medal."</p>
        
            <p>The Parisian crowds provided a great atmosphere to compete in, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The crowd is big, but also really gets into it, they really kind of participate... today in the 400 the noise was so loud, it's so cool, it's such a good atmosphere to be competing in."</p>
        
            <p>"I only got three-and-a-hours sleep last night (following the long jump final) and I was worried about that but as I warmed up, I got a good feeling," Steadman said after the race.</p>
        
            <p>"I ran a good first half of the race and felt good around the bend and pushed it hard. With 50 metres to go I had nothing in the legs, I was trying to hold on and I almost tripped over a couple of times.</p>
        
            <p>"To run 52.92 - a 0.44 PB is crazy. I knew I could run well today, but I didn't think that well given the sleep I had. I'm over the moon with that performance."</p>
        
            <p>On winning silver he said: "It means a lot to me, especially as a lot of other athletes in the field ran well today. I had to run well to get the silver. This year I've improved my 400m PB by quite a bit. It is cool to see the hard work I've put in over the past three years pay off."</p>
        
            <p>Steadman, who competes in the Men's 100m T36 on Saturday, said he plans to celebrate by eating some ice cream in the Village today and then rest up ahead of his final event at Paris 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really looking forward to the 100m. I'm in really good shape, we'll give it a go and then see what happens."</p>
        
            <p>He said the 100m was his "secondary event" but he hoped to make the final and make the most of his current good form and speed.</p>
