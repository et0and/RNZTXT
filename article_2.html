        <h2>Education Ministry staff 'constantly in tears' during 'unfair' job loss process</h2>
        <p>
The redundancies have been an "emotional rollercoaster", workers say, with flip-flops on decisions and managers ill-informed of changes.

            <p>Ministry of Education staffers were "constantly in tears" during an "unfair" job loss process, the Employment Relations Authority has heard.</p>
        
            <p>More than 700 roles - including some that were already vacant - are on the chopping block at the ministry as part of a government directive to make savings.</p>
        
            <p>But the ministry has hit the pause button on the process after a legal challenge from the Public Service Association about the way it is being handled.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has said the legal challenge could force the process to start all over again.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association set out its case to the authority in a hearing in Wellington on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It said the job cut process was in breach of the workers' collective agreement and the ministry had not done enough to meet its obligations on rehiring and retraining staff.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said in a statement it understood how difficult the change process had been.</p>
        
            <p>It said it wanted certainty for impacted staff, their families and whƒÅnau.</p>

            <p>Staff member Aleeta Hau said across years of working in change management for the ministry, only a handful of projects "had treated our people with dignity".</p>
        
            <p>Seeing the way the changes were being put in place had left her distraught.</p>
        
            <p>"I broke down, I was embarrassed, I was angry and in denial. I was constantly in tears."</p>
        
            <p>Others spoke of confusion and inconsistency as news of the the changes was broken.</p>
        
            <p>Tania Kelly Roxborogh said she went into a meeting with her manager - after previously learning her role was being disestablished - only to be told the decision had been reversed.</p>
        
            <p>Her manager was unable to tell her what changes were being made to her position other than "it now has an 'advisor' in the title", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no idea what my position is. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing."</p>
        
            <p>She said her partner had already taken on an extra 80 hours' work to help meet their financial commitments.</p>
        
            <p>She was told she could not talk to anyone in her organisation about the flip-flop, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing the people around me affected and crying and yet there's a part of me that had to keep doing my job. It [felt as if] my husband came to me and said 'I don't love you' and then changes his mind because he realises he's going to be worse off."</p>
        
            <p>Hayley Whitaker said attending meetings to discuss the changes made it obvious there was "no wiggle room" in the decision making process.</p>
        
            <p>"It was like I'd woken up in a different universe. It seemed like a fait accompli and there has been very little change from that until now," Whitaker said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the process had been "an emotional rollercoaster" for many people around her.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels like it (was) restructure by restructure rather than looking at the collective good as a whole. It seemed very messy, inequitable and unfair."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, in an email to staff, the ministry said it would re-enter talks with the union on specific changes if the authority found in favour of the union.</p>
        
            <p>"This may lead to new or amended proposals that may require further consultation before decisions are made and actioned."</p>
        
            <p>However, savings would still be required and at a level that would likely mean there would still be job losses.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry would continue with voluntary redundancies, but had paused expressions of interest in newly created roles from staff losing their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>It said the ministry had hoped to "find agreement with the PSA and avoid protracted legal action and uncertainty for our people".</p>
