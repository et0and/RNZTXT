            <p>It has been another scorcher day for much of Aotearoa, with some areas reaching the 30 degrees mark once again.</p>
        
            <p>Friday's hotspots included 32 degrees Celsius at Lake Tekapo in the South Island and 30 degrees in Hawke's Bay in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist John Law said it was a sunny end to the week.</p>
        
            <p>"Taking a look at the satellite picture, we've got plenty of sunshine across most of New Zealand ... plenty of warm temperatures as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even up towards places like Tauranga, 28 degrees, and Napier, 29 - so it's been a real spread of temperatures reaching into the high 20s and even a few spots nudging over the 30-degree mark."</p>

            <p>MetService issued a heat alert on Friday for Auckland, warning people to take measures to protect their health in hot temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>The national forecaster is running a trial of heat alerts this summer. Heat alerts are generated when an area becomes much hotter than is usual for that area.</p>
        
            <p>As well as being draining for every day life, it said extreme summer heat could cause illness or even be fatal.</p>
        
            <p>"But effective planning and actions can readily reduce its effects on health."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland was expected to be uncomfortably hot and muggy on Friday, with an expected high of 27 degrees Celsius and 28 degrees on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said people should keep hydrated, seek shade, and check in with vulnerable people, pets, and livestock.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is vulnerable to extreme heat. However, babies and infants, older people, those with pre-existing medical conditions or on certain medications are more at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the country will continue to get great beach weather through the weekend, though grey skies will close in from the south into Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is forecasting a warm and cloudy weekend for most areas, with temperatures reaching into the low 30 degrees Celsius range for some, including Hastings, which models show could reach 33 degrees.</p>

            <p>Law said heat alerts may also be issued to parts of the South Island's East Coast and parts of the North Island over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"Saturday, we're set to find those temperatures pick up again in places like Canterbury, many spots again widely up above 30 degrees Celsius - Dunedin, Christchurch as well, both set to reach 31 degrees Celsius," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And for the North Island, many spots will be high 20s as well, and even heading towards Sunday, we could find some of those temperatures on the North Island reaching highs around about 30 and 32 in Hawke's Bay."</p>
        
            <p>By Sunday, rain clouds are expected to head up from the south, with heavy downpours expected for Otago, Southland, and inland Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Severe weather watches for wind or rain are in place on Sunday for Fiordland, Southland, Stewart Island and Clutha, heavy rain for Fiordland and Westland south of Otira.</p>
        
            <p>"And as we heading in towards the start of the working week, Monday's looking like a rather wet story across the north and down across the South Island, although it's drier, with the winds turning to be more of a southerly, we're set to find some much cooler temperatures to start next week."</p>
        
            <p>Rain should ease in the South Island by late Monday, with a significant reduction in temperatures for many places.</p>
        
            <p>The rain would be relief for firefighters, with warm weather having dried out vegetation and prompted a number of fire bans and restrictions nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Total fire bans are in place for parts of Northland, Hauraki, Wairarapa, Marlborough, inland Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Fire restrictions are in place for Wellington, Coromandel Peninsula and much of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Open windows in the evening and overnight, once temperatures have cooled</p>
        
            <p>Turn off non-essential lights and electrical equipment - they generate heat.</p>
        
            <p>Home insulation will help keep your home cooler in summer</p>
        
            <p>Move into a cooler room if possible, especially for sleeping</p>
        
            <p>Keep light-coloured curtains or blinds closed on windows facing the sun during the day.</p>
        
            <p>Dark coloured curtains or blinds are best left open as they absorb the heat</p>
        
            <p>Use electric fans to keep cool</p>
        
            <p>Use the cool cycle on a heat pump. Clean heat pumps - vacuum the filters regularly.</p>
