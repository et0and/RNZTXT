            <p>The second day of haka groups performing to make the final 12 on Saturday saw three Auckland based groups go head to head.</p>
        
            <p>Te Waka Huia, Angitū, and Ngā Tumanako all tie for first place at the qualifying regional competition last year.</p>
        
            <p>Angitū performed an item written with the help of AI. The haka, written using ChatGPT, warns of the dangers of artificial intelligence, particularly its use among young children, and online abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Pere Wīhongi leader of Angitū described AI as both a "taniwha" and a "taonga".</p>
        
            <p>In an interview after the performance with TVNZ and Whakaata Māori, Wihongi said they fixed the mistakes made by ChatGPT.</p>
        
            <p>Te Waka Huia and Ngā Tumanako who performed at the end of the day both stunned the packed out crowd with their performances.</p>
        
            <p>Both kapa paid tribute to the late Māori King, Kiingi Tuheitia and Māori Queen, Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po.</p>
        
            <p>But it was their powerful and sweet singing that had the crowd buzzing.</p>
