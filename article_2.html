            <p>A long-time friend and colleague of one of three climbers missing on Aoraki Mount Cook says his local Colorado mountain guide community is devastated.</p>
        
            <p>Police hold grave concerns for the men - Americans Kurt Blair and Carlos Romero and an unnamed Canadian national - who were reported overdue from a climb on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The men flew into Plateau Hut at 3.30pm last Saturday, planning to summit the mountain via Zurbriggen Ridge, but failed to meet their flight out.</p>
        
            <p>The search for the climbers remains suspended until at least Thursday due to bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, Colorado's Silverton Avalanche School said it had received notification from New Zealand authorities that the climbers appeared to have succumbed to a fatal fall.</p>
        
            <p>The school's executive director Michael Ackerman told RNZ he had known Blair for almost 20 years.</p>

            <p>Ackerman said Blair was an accomplished and experienced climber who taught recreational avalanche courses and led climbs and skiing trips for San Juan Mountain Guides.</p>
        
            <p>"As much as he was a rugged individualist in this world of mountain professionals, he was the kindest, the most compassionate, the most patient person doing this work," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Professionally, Kurt was part of a pretty close-knit group of mountain guides ... you can imagine this hits pretty close to home. We're all pretty shattered, this is not the guy we expected this to happen to.</p>
        
            <p>"From a personal standpoint just knowing Kurt, his family and his sons, my heart just goes out to them."</p>
        
            <p>Ackerman said Blair had an amazing quality of being able to connect with people and guide them, and people came back to work with him year after year.</p>
        
            <p>"Kurt had this amazing ability in the face of almost insurmountable odds, inclement weather, snow storms, rain storms, freezing temperatures to just be really steady and just be a rock. I think that brought a really calming presence to the groups," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ackerman said Blair was very excited about travelling to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand authorities contacted him after Blair was reported missing to see if he could connect with his colleague through United States' mountain guides' satellite and communication resources.</p>
        
            <p>Ackerman said becoming a professional mountain guide was a "mid-life pivot" for Blair.</p>
        
            <p>"He was always a climber in his personal life, his dad was quite an accomplished climber in his own right, and he hit a point where he wanted to chase this dream of being a professional mountain guide. In 2022 he realised that dream and he achieved IFMGA status, he became an international mountain guide recognised through the highest certification available internationally," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Before that he had been guiding mountain and rock climbing, teaching snow safety and avalanche education in Southwest Colorado, that is where Kurt and I became really close."</p>
        
            <p>During an initial search for the men, several climbing-related items were found that police believe belonged to the three men.</p>
        
            <p>They were working with the US and Canadian embassies to support their families.</p>
