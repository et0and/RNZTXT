        <h2>Government may still need to pay for Cook Strait ferries - Maritime Union</h2>
        <p>
The government may still need to pay if it wants a resilient ferry connection between both the main islands, says the Maritime Union.

            <p>The government may still need to pay if it wants a resilient ferry connection between both the main islands, says the Maritime Union.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition is to set up an expert advisory group, rather than committing another $1.47 billion for KiwiRail to replace three of its ageing ferries.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis said the panel would ensure that robust plans would support safe, resilient and reliable Cook Strait transport services in the coming years.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said it was open to an independent review looking at the future of its Interislander ferry service.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Peter Reidy said he welcomed the appointment of an independent reviewer to look at the best economic options for the service.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime Union chairperson Craig Harrison was glad the Interislander had not been scrapped altogether.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that, for instance, KiwiRail's spent close to $400m on the project so far.</p>
        
            <p>"So there's been quite a bit of money, and we'd say in some respects, well spent, on ferry designs ... so maybe they've reflected on it and realised it's such an important connection."</p>
        
            <p>But he said the government needed to make a choice.</p>
        
            <p>"They have to invest in two new ferries and infrastructure that ... works with the design and efficiencies at either end.</p>
        
            <p>"Or they go for another solution where they don't spend any money at either end for the ferries to dock."</p>

            <p>Harrison said cost blowouts have become part and parcel of big infrastructure projects.</p>
        
            <p>Four unions representing maritime and rail workers called for the Finance Minister's resignation last week for halting the funding.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough mayor Nadine Taylor, who previously said she was "blindsided" by the government announcement that it was pulling funding from the project, supported the establishment of the panel.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pragmatic way of dealing with the void that we have in front of us ... I'm very, very pleased to see the minister actioning that so quickly," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Environmental watchdog group the Guardians of the Sounds said they were glad mega ferries have been axed in Picton.</p>
        
            <p>But Sounds spokesperson Tim Healey said they wanted to see an indepth risk assessment of the Tory Channel be a part of any future plan.</p>
        
            <p>"Our big concern has always been the Tory Channel entrance, that's probably the most dangerous part of the whole passage.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very narrow entrance, it's well-documented [there have been] ships grounding, hitting the rocks, being stranded - not one, but multiple times.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got a history."</p>
        
            <p>Tim Healey said the group wanted the Marlborough Sounds to be a safe place for ferries.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Labour has suggested the government was acting prematurely in halting a planned restoration of the Interislander ferry service.</p>
        
            <p>Its finance spokesperson Grant Robertson said Willis may be regretting pulling the pin on the project with no alternative in place.</p>
