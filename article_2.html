        <h2>Govt 'clarifying' functions of Te Arawhiti, the Crown-Māori relations office</h2>
        <p>
So what does that mean? Tama Potaka says the office will remain a departmental agency.

            <p>Crown-Māori Relations Minister Tama Potaka says the government is "clarifying the respective functions of Te Arawhiti and Te Puni Kōkiri".</p>
        
            <p>Crown-Māori Relations Minister Tama Potaka says Te Arawhiti will remain a departmental agency and "continue its core role of progressing long standing Treaty of Waitangi settlements and Takutai Moana applications".</p>
        
            <p>"Te Puni Kōkiri will advise on policy to support the acceleration of Māori economic development, continue to support the revitalisation of Māori language and culture, and support Māori social development including through a social investment lens."</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said Te Puni Kōkiri would "provide quality policy advice using the Treaty-based public policy framework Te Tautuhi ō Rongo, to ensure that the distinct rights and interests of Iwi (as collectives) and Māori (as citizens) are recognised and provided for".</p>
        
            <p>It would also better monitor other agencies to ensure they were delivering adequate services to and for Māori, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Arawhiti, the Office for Māori Crown Relations, was created in 2018, bringing together the Office of Treaty Settlements (including the Takutai Moana team), Post Settlement Commitments Unit (Te Kāhui Whakamana), and Te Kāhui Hīkina (Crown Māori Relations Unit).</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
