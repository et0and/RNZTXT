            <p>Court documents have revealed details of how former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman stole items of clothing from shops in Auckland and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old admitted four shoplifting charges, relating to the theft of thousands of dollars' worth of clothing, when she appeared in the Auckland District Court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Documents released to RNZ outline what Ghahraman stole, and how she stole it.</p>
        
            <p>The documents state that on 22 October last year, Ghahraman visited the Cre8iveworx store on Cuba Street in central Wellington, where she removed a number of items of clothing from the display rack and took them into the changing rooms.</p>
        
            <p>One item taken was a black Zambesi shirt costing $695.</p>
        
            <p>When she was out of view, Ghahraman placed the shirt inside her clothing or bag.</p>
        
            <p>She left the changing room, and bought a pair of pants at the counter.</p>
        
            <p>"She left the Cre8iveworx store without making any attempt to pay for the Zambesi shirt," the court documents say.</p>
        
            <p>On 21 December 21, it was stated Ghahraman entered Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby, in Auckland, carrying a large tote bag.</p>
        
            <p>She removed an Acne Studios single breasted coat, valued at $1900, from the rack as well as a pair of black pants, taking them into a changing room and closing the privacy curtain behind her.</p>
        
            <p>While in the changing room, Ghahraman placed the coat into her bag, and returned the pants to the rack after trying them on.</p>
        
            <p>A short while later, she picked up a Commes des Gar√ßons wallet, valued at $160, and took it to a deserted area of the store.</p>
        
            <p>While out of sight, she placed the wallet in her tote bag with the coat.</p>
        
            <p>She continued to browse in the shop for another 16 minutes, before leaving.</p>
        
            <p>The court documents state she made no attempt to pay for the items.</p>

            <p>A day later, court documents show Ghahraman visited Standard Issue, a knitwear store in the Auckland suburb of Newmarket.</p>
        
            <p>While there, she spoke to the store manager, before picking up a navy blue cardigan off the display table.</p>
        
            <p>The cardigan was priced at $389.</p>
        
            <p>While the manager wasn't looking, she placed the cardigan in her tote bag and left the store.</p>
        
            <p>"The manager immediately noticed the cardigan was no longer on the table when Ms Ghahraman left," the document says.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman returned to Scotties Boutique the next day, where she attempted to steal a $650 Issey Miyake bag, a $333 Two Squares dress, a $4500 black Row Calanthe dress, and a $290 Lemaire Crepe tank top.</p>
        
            <p>As she left, an employee approached her in the carpark and asked to check inside her bag.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman refused, briefly going back inside to offer an explanation, pointing to a dress hung inside a coat as the reason for the misunderstanding.</p>
        
            <p>Later that day, an associate of Ghahraman visited Scotties, carrying Ghahraman's tote bag.</p>
        
            <p>She spoke to the store worker and returned the Row Calanthe dress, the Two Squares dress, and the Issey Miyake bag.</p>
        
            <p>"The Lemaire Crepe tank top was not returned," the documents say.</p>
        
            <p>In the summary of facts, Ghahraman admitted it was her on CCTV footage from the Cre8iveworx store incident, but said she did not recall taking the shirt.</p>
        
            <p>She accepted the facts and admitted to both offences at Scotties Boutique, but declined to comment on the offending at Standard Issue.</p>
        
            <p>Reparation was sought to replace all stolen items, some of which have not been recovered or were unable to be resold after being used.</p>
