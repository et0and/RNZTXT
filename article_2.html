            <p>Originally hailing from Queensland, where she grew up on a Stanthorpe apple farm, Bree Tomasel is perhaps best known on this side of the ditch as the co-host of Celebrity Treasure Island and a radio host on ZM.</p>
        
            <p>But behind the banter, Tomasel has battled anxiety, ADHD, struggled with her sexuality, and survived a harrowing attack as a young child. She shares her story in her new book UnApologetically Me.</p>
        
            <p>The attack she endured as a nine-year-old child has echoed through her life, she tells RNZ's Sunday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We were sitting there - me, my mum and my nan - all having a cup of tea. And there was two men that came to the door and broke in, and we were involved in a home invasion where they held us at knifepoint for ... what felt like hours.</p>
        
            <p>"It was probably about 10 minutes to 15 minutes all up, while they stole bits and pieces from the house and threatened to kidnap me.</p>
        
            <p>"In that moment I truly believed that I was going to die. And growing up in the country, [in an area with] a population of 6000, I lived a very sheltered amazing childhood and never really had thought anything bad could happen - and I think it changed me as a person forever."</p>
        
            <p>Despite Tomasel's outward appearance of breezy self-confidence, the attack has left her with anxiety problems and panic attacks, she said.</p>

            <p>"I had my first panic attack couple of weeks after that initial attack, and they've never stopped ever since. I go through really good patches, and then I can go through really bad patches, as I talk about in the book. But anxiety has been at the forefront of my life since that day."</p>
        
            <p>When she started working in radio in Australia she found her home, she said, but initially felt compelled to keep her sexuality a secret.</p>
        
            <p>"There was someone back home in Australia that said to me they thought it wasn't a good idea if I shared that part of my life on the radio, and it could be bad for my career.</p>
        
            <p>"And that moment sat with me for a very, very long time, because it was already concerns and thoughts and worries that I'd already had, and to hear it come out of someone who I looked up to that knows radio, was terrifying to me.</p>
        
            <p>"So, I feel like my whole life, especially in my 20s, I danced around. I'd tell certain people and hide it from others, and eventually it all came to a head I think."</p>
        
            <p>Her brain is like a laptop with hundreds of tabs open at the same time, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be sitting down sending an email, doing some prep for the radio show, watching a TV show on my phone like just my brain is just going 100 miles an hour."</p>
        
            <p>A formal ADHD diagnosis has made it easier to manage the symptoms. And the reaction she got when she discussed her mental health on air was "immense."</p>
        
            <p>"Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people just being like, 'I feel the same', and 'you've made me feel less alone', and 'it's not just me'.</p>
        
            <p>"And I knew in that moment that I'd done what I set out to do."</p>
        
            <p>She concludes at the end of this "non memoir", which she calls "silly scribblings", that success comes when you have the courage to accept who you are.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like this is one of those moments where it really, truly pushed me to be completely and utterly myself. And I hope that I've done that in the book with how honest I've I tried to be."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile she has no plans to return to Australia, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is home to me. I have a beautiful partner, we bought a house together. We put in a veggie patch last weekend, we've got two dogs, and hopefully one day we'll have a family and stuff. So, there's no plans to go back home."</p>
