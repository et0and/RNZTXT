            <p>Job openings so cool they are practically ice cold have opened up.</p>
        
            <p>Antarctica NZ is looking for a crew of 40 to join Scott Base for the 2025/26 research season - and you do not need to be a scientist.</p>
        
            <p>General manager for Antarctic operations Mike Shapland told RNZ's Midday Report Scott Base was "almost like a small city, it's like a small town".</p>
        
            <p>"We employ everyone from engineers, tradies, field experts, cleaners, cooks, mechanics, medics, and technicians - you know, so we've got a role for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>The good news is most of the jobs need to be filled over the southern continent's summer - from August to February. Just a dozen will need to stay through the winter.</p>

            <p>Those picked will receive training and "the opportunity to live and work in one of the world's most awe-inspiring landscapes", Antarctica NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Around 130 other people would be at Scott Base, so you would not be too alone.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking at people that want to come and work in an extreme environment, generally like the cold - but you know, it's a great environment to work in and someone who can work as part of a team."</p>
        
            <p>The most in demand were engineers and mechanics.</p>

            <p>"A research station is like a ship, with a bit of everything and a bit of something from every decade of Scott Base's existence," Shapland said in a separate statement. "The technology is vintage though to cutting edge,"</p>
        
            <p>Antarctica NZ general manager for people Megan Nicholl said applicants should be "level-headed, enthusiastic, collaborative".</p>
        
            <p>"It helps to have some experience of isolated or remote locations. The crew develop true camaraderie, building lifelong friendships with a tight-knit, like-minded team."</p>
        
            <p>Applications for these roles close on 16 March, but there would likely be more positions available in the coming months. More information is available on the Antarctica NZ website.</p>
