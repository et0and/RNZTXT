            <p>With the sun losing its heat and the mercury falling, New Zealand's thick forests are beginning to turn hues of vivid yellow, orange and red.</p>
        
            <p>The South Island gets most of the plaudits at this time of the year, with iconic sites around Arrowtown, Cromwell and Lake Wanaka frequently topping the lists of recommended places to visit in autumn.</p>
        
            <p>The North Island shouldn't be overlooked, though, with several locations offering spectacular views of autumn foliage that are worth checking out.</p>

            <p>Known for its vibrant colours, Cambridge should be an automatic inclusion on any North Island autumn map.</p>
        
            <p>Located just 1Â½ hours from Auckland, the area around Cambridge Town Hall and Victoria Street gives visitors the opportunity to take a relaxed stroll past cafes, galleries, vintage shops and tree-lined streets bursting with seasonal colour.</p>
        
            <p>You might even turn a corner and find yourself face-to-face with a statue of a magnificent racehorse, a nod to Cambridge's equestrian heritage.</p>

            <p>Travel tips </p>
        
            <p>On Saturday mornings, Matakana the Matakana Village Farmers' Market offers everything from locally grown flowers to artisanal mushrooms and honey. Grab a handcrafted burger packed with Matakana bacon.</p>
        
            <p>Located a kilometre northeast of the township, The Green Shed makes for a charming roadside stop. Just pull over, stretch your legs and sample freshly caught Pacific oysters. In winter, the oysters are at their plumpest and most succulent. By spring, they develop a delicate, creamy texture. In autumn, the oysters tend to have a briny tang - as if they've been plucked straight from the ocean minutes earlier.</p>

            <p>Patrick's Pies has won the best New Zealand pie award an impressive eight times. Its gold-medal pie in 2023 featured a thick, buttery pastry encasing aromatic roast duck, tender mushrooms, caramelised onions and melting cheese, making every bite packed with rich, savoury flavours.

            <p>Meanwhile, Oppies Fish & Chips has twice been crowned best in New Zealand. Its portions are generous, the oil is always fresh, and the fish is coated in a thin, golden, crispy batter. Add a dash of local vinegar and a sprinkle of salt, and you have a perfect bite - tender, juicy and subtly sweet. Oppies also offers a variety of Chinese dishes, which regulars call "a taste of home."</p>

            <p>At the foot of Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill, Cornwall Park is Auckland's autumn crown jewel.</p>
        
            <p>Boasting 8000 trees and countless flowering plants, the park's golden gingko forest is legendary. In autumn, fallen leaves form a soft golden carpet - perfect for photographers.</p>
        
            <p>Travel tips </p>
