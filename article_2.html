            <p>Sam Nock has again proven he is a match winner with a clutch turnover to help the Blues claim an enthralling win in their top of the table meeting against the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>The heavyweight clash lived up to the hype with a stunning clash at Eden Park igniting Super Rugby Pacific with the final just around the corner.</p>
        
            <p>Up 21-27 with time up, the Hurricanes were hammering away at the Blues line before Angus Taʻavao laid in a solid shot to send them backpedaling and Nock ripped the ball clear and booted it onto touch.</p>
        
            <p>It was a tit for tat affair as both sides showed why they are title favourite with some scintillating rugby on display.</p>
        
            <p>The nail-biting result sees the Blues leapfrog the Canes to top of the table, knocking them off their perch for the first time in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Blues skipper Patrick Tuipolotu told Sky Sport that those are the games you want to be a part of.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a see-saw battle, right down to the wire, this a test match for us, couple more games until the finals so this puts us in good stead.</p>
        
            <p>Tuipolotu credited the tenacious defence of his troops.</p>
        
            <p>"We often put a measurement on defence, in tough times like that, that's where it counts, so good to see it pay off in the end."</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes captain Brad Shields said it was disappointing to come so close and fall short.</p>
        
            <p>"Rugby is a pretty cruel game at the end of the day, it was pretty intense, it was exactly what we expected, when you cant quite get there, it's pretty gutting. We chucked everything in there."</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes would land a blow either side of the break, but it would prove not enough as Harry Plummer produced a perfect night with the boot.</p>

            <p>Within the opening minutes, the Blues swung on to attack as hooker Ricky Riccitelli was held up over the line due to some desperate defence.</p>
        
            <p>His side were under advantage however, and turned down an easy three points to kick for the corner.</p>
        
            <p>Riccitelli was again just short of the line, but Bryce Heem swooped in and darted over from the ruck for the opening try.</p>
        
            <p>With less than ten minutes on the clock, a Hurricane's penalty saw Jordie Barrett put it five out with a superb touch finder.</p>
        
            <p>The Canes took full advantage of the field position, a slick lineout move before skipper Brad Shields struck back for the visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Another blow for the Blues soon followed a fullback Zarn Sullivan was forced from the field with a knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>Akira Ioane was then sent to the sin bin for head on head contact on TJ Perenara.</p>
        
            <p>However, it would not cost his side as another strong Heem bust, led to replacement Cole Forbes eventually cracking the Cane's defence for a second time.</p>
        
            <p>Just as it seemed the Blues would take a handy lead into the break, they conceded a penalty and Barrett again put it deep into the 22.</p>
        
            <p>After some strong carries by the pack, Cameron called for it to go wide and Ruben Love beautifully straightened the attack, committed two defender and sent Josh Moorby away.</p>
        
            <p>Cameron missed his second conversion to see the sides head to the sheds with the Blues up by just four.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes struck first after the break, Peter Lakai muscling his way over after several raid from their big men.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues responded soon after, a surging lineout maul falling just short, before Funaki fired right to the blindside and Plummer quickly flicked it on to Mark Telea to waltz in and reclaim the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett pulled it back by three but Blues prop Angus Taʻavao then burrowed over to score and re-establish a solid buffer.</p>
        
            <p>Another twist came as TJ Perenara spotted a hole and sneaked his way in for his 64th career try.</p>
        
            <p>After turning down numerous shots at goal, with time ticking away, Plummer finally pointed to the posts and put the Blues ahead by four once again.</p>
        
            <p>With three minutes to play, Dalton Papali'i snaffled a clutch turnover for his side with the Hurricanes hot on attack, but the Blues then conceded a crucial penalty to give the table toppers a golden opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>The plugged away, coming within a metre of the coveted chalk but Taʻavao's hit and Nock's strip proved the pivotal plays, to call curtains on the match of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers</p>
        
            <p>Blues 31 (Heem, Forbes, Telea, Taʻavao, tries, Plummer, 4 cons, 1 pen)</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes 27 (Shields, Moorby, Lakai, Perenara, tries, Cameron, 1 cons, Barrett 1 pen)</p>
