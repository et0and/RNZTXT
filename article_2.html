            <p>Prince, King, Princess, and even Prynce and AazyahRoyaal are among the baby names that didn't pass muster with officials during 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Te Tari Taiwhenua / Department of Internal Affairs has released the names most often turned down by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The most declined name in 2023 was 'Prince' (five applications). For the previous 13 years, 'King' was the most declined name - this time it was rejected three times.</p>
        
            <p>Other names that failed to impress officials included: Isis, Judge, MissTaunese, Notoriety, Pope, and Sovereign-Kash.</p>
        
            <p>All up, 64 registrations were turned down throughout the year.</p>
        
            <p>Guidelines are in place to ensure that names don't cause offence, are a reasonable length and don't represent an official title or rank, the department said in statement.</p>
        
            <p>The law allows the Registrar-General to reject names being registered which fail to comply with those guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>"Names are a gift, and they are an important part of a person's identity. We encourage parents to think about their child and how they might feel about their name later in life," the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages Russell Burnard said.</p>
        
            <p>"When a name is in review, we give parents the opportunity to present the reasoning for the name. Then we make a decision, considering the balance of how the name may be perceived by the public and the department's obligations under the law."</p>

            <p>Earlier this month the department released its annual list of the most popular baby names.</p>
