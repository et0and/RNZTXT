            <p>All of the young people who climbed up on the roof of a South Auckland youth justice facility on Monday evening have now come down.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the Korowai Manaaki facility in Wiri shortly before 6pm after eight youths climbed onto the roof.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki spokesperson Iain Chapman said that all of the young people have now come down, four overnight and four today.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was disappointing that the young people had caused some damage to the Youth Justice Facility.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the day-to-day operational running of the facility has and will continue.</p>
        
            <p>"We will work with police to determine the extent of any further offending by these young people during the incident, including in relation to the damage caused to the youth justice facility.</p>
        
            <p>"An operational review will be undertaken to determine the circumstances that led to this incident."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were no concerns for public safety at any time.</p>
        
            <p>Three Police cars and a truck have now left the facility.</p>

            <p>Earlier, RNZ's reporter at the scene said occasional shouting and banging could be heard, and some of the youths were throwing hand signs and posturing for media at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>One was also seen throwing a ventilation cover that had been wrenched off the roof.</p>
        
            <p>Another had what appeared to be roofing tiles with insulation attached in their hands.</p>
        
            <p>The young people were in a shouting match with a woman outside the facility, who was urging them to come down.</p>
        
            <p>They were demanding fast food and banging on the roof with what appeared to be wooden poles.</p>
        
            <p>A fire engine was also seen arriving at Korowai Manaaki and firefighters in breathing apparatus were seen entering the building, shortly after 12pm.</p>
        
            <p>A fire alarm was sounding but there was no visible smoke. About 10 minutes later the fire truck left.</p>

            <p>Chapman said many of the young people in custody in youth justice facilities had committed serious offences motivated by a range of factors, including peer pressure, notoriety and adrenaline.</p>
        
            <p>"It is likely they participate in serious incidents once in custody for similar reasons."</p>

            <p>It was the second protest at Korowai Manaaki this year - seven teenagers were charged after spending the night on the roof in October.</p>
