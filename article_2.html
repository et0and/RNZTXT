            <p>The New Zealand Space Agency is calling for post-graduate students to shoot for the stars and apply to intern at NASA next year.</p>
        
            <p>The Space Scholarship programme gives students the opportunity to work on space-related programs guided by NASA mentors at the NASA's Ames Research Center or Jet Propulsion Laboratory for up to 13 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Each successful intern will be supported by the New Zealand Space Scholarship, which will cover return airfares to the United States and accommodation costs, plus an allowance for living expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy head Andrew Johnson said the knowledge and connections the students bring home will help to strengthen and grow Aotearoa's science and space sectors.</p>
        
            <p>"Previous interns have gained hands-on experience in their fields of study and access to NASA's advanced research facilities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an invaluable experience for these students and the skills, knowledge and connections they bring home will help to strengthen and grow our science and space sectors.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Space Scholarship programme is one way the government is helping to foster talented people working in space-related fields."</p>
        
            <p>The agency was looking for students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to apply.</p>
        
            <p>Applications closed 27 October.</p>
