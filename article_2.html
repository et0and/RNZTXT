        <h2>Are Auckland central beaches safe for swimming yet?</h2>
        <p>
It has been five weeks since a sinkhole in Parnell caused a water and stormwater pipe to burst, having a knock-on effect at some Auckland beaches. Audio

            <p>The quality of water at some of Auckland's central beaches is still not good enough for safe swimming, five weeks after a sinkhole caused a water and stormwater pipe to burst.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council is keeping an eye on a number of inner city beaches which have been marked 'do not swim' on its Safeswim website.</p>
        
            <p>Council head of Heathy Water Nick Vigar said where the black pins are on the Safeswim map - broadly Herne Bay to Ōkahu Bay - there is greater uncertainty about the water quality.</p>
        
            <p>"To be clear, that means most of the time the water is testing fine but we're getting occasional samples or we're getting results that are higher than we would normally expect.</p>
        
            <p>"And so from an abundance of caution, we're keeping black pins up until we're confident of the water quality."</p>
        
            <p>Testing was being done at least every couple of days at those beaches.</p>
        
            <p>At least three days of clear results was needed for it to be marked green - or safe to swim at.</p>
        
            <p>But, for example, if one of these days comes in just below the threshold, it would not count as a clear day, he said.</p>

            <p>The threshold for swimming in salt water in New Zealand is 280 enterococci per 100ml. Enterococcus is an indicator bacteria.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the time our beaches would be well below that, so anything over 100 would be unusual in dry weather."</p>
        
            <p>Current issues are a flow on effect of the Parnell sinkhole, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But asked if it was residual contamination from that, Vigar said the council was not sure.</p>
        
            <p>"To our knowledge, there are no dry weather issues at the moment and the pump over that's there as far as I understand is capable of handling dry weather flows.</p>
        
            <p>"But it doesn't take very much increase in flow for some of our aged sewer network to have issues."
