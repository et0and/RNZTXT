            <p>A former nurse of a Christchurch mental health facility who engaged in a sexual relationship with a patient has avoided jail time.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Ogden had pleaded guilty to one charge of ill-treatment of a vulnerable adult linked to a relationship he had with a patient between 2021 and 2022.</p>
        
            <p>During his sentencing at the Christchurch District Court on Wednesday, Judge Tom Gilbert said the relationship was exploitative and a gross departure of what was considered reasonable practice for a nurse.</p>
        
            <p>Ogden was sentenced to 12 months home detention and ordered to pay an emotional harm payment of $10,000.</p>
