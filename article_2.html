            <p>The government is "still working through the exact details" on where the money for its promised tax relief will come from, the Finance Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis unveiled the government's mini-Budget yesterday alongside Treasury's half year update.</p>
        
            <p>She said they made $7.47billion of savings by slashing funding from initiatives like Let's Get Wellington Moving, Fair Pay Agreements and the Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
        
            <p>But the pressure is on for the government to provide detail on how it will deliver promised tax cuts as the country's economy slows.</p>
        
            <p>Willis told Morning Report that while savings have already been found and public service agencies have been directed to cut costs, the government was "still working through the exact details" for the funding of tax cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been given good estimates by Treasury which gives us confidence that the quantum of cost means that we can meet that cost through the savings, new reprioritisations and new revenue measures that we have committed to.</p>
        
            <p>"So we're confident that we can deliver tax reduction in a way that's responsible, that's fiscally neutral over the forecast period and people will see that in May [the government's Budget]."</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
