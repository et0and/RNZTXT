            <p>Police say 62-year-old Chris Allen died on Monday following the incident at his property in Ashburton Forks.</p>
        
            <p>He was a respected farmer in the area, an advocate and a long-time member of Federated Farmers and was also a board member for eight years.</p>
        
            <p>Mid Canterbury Federated Farmers president David Acland said his friend's death was a tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>"It is absolutely gutting, he's made a significant contribution to the rural community and especially this community here."</p>
        
            <p>Acland said Allen had a huge impact on the community.</p>
        
            <p>"His contribution to within Federated farmers, he sat on the national board for a number of years.</p>
        
            <p>"And his contribution around the biodiversity work he did and in Wellington with water as well, his work there was instrumental over that period of time."</p>
        
            <p>Acland said he has left behind a huge legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"He was respected by everyone, he negotiated and worked with a smile on his face, and he was always happy to engage and have a conversation.</p>
        
            <p>"He'd ring me and give me a little bit of advice every now and again too, which was always welcome and guidance so, yeah he will be greatly missed." Acland said.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone was still coming to trms with Allen's death, and Acland's thoughts went out to his friends and family.</p>
