            <p>The government's Fast-track Approvals Bill could see a much-needed boost to Wellington's housing supply, but some of the projects are not without controversy.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, the government revealed the 149 projects to be included in the bill, which is due to go before the environment select committee this month.</p>
        
            <p>Housing was a big focus for the capital, with six of the 11 named projects slated to add more than 8000 new homes across the Kāpiti Coast and Hutt Valley, should they go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The other projects listed included the "Long Tunnel" currently under investigation by the Transport Agency and replacing the seawall at the southern end of the Wellington Airport runway.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Company has two projects on the list, which would see a combined 2350 new homes built around Kāpiti Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Developments at Plimmerton Farm in Porirua and Silverstream Forest in Upper Hutt - which have previously been controversial - were also given the green light.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua, north of Wellington, has seen significant growth in recent years, and under the bill, stands to gain 3300 new homes.</p>
        
            <p>The Plimmerton Farm project - which seeks to build 2400 new homes in addition to a commercial area, retirement village and school - would make up the bulk of the new properties in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>The project, which received consent in 2021 by then-environment minister David Parker - has been criticised by environmental groups due to its proximity to Taupō Swamp, a 25 hectares lowland swampland classified as nationally significant.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua mayor Anita Baker, who has long been an advocate for the the project, said she was confident the checks and balances to protect the wetland would be sufficient.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ on Monday Porirua was in desperate need of more homes, as the city's growth outstripped demand.</p>
        
            <p>Both the Plimmerton Farm project and the slated 900-home development for Pukerua Bay would deliver a much-needed boost to the housing supply, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Silverstream Forest Development - which seeks to develop 330 hectares of land for 1500-2040 new homes - has also faced opposition.</p>
        
            <p>The Post reported last month on moves by the Upper Hutt City Council to block the project by rezoning a crucial parcel of land, and the Hutt City Council's opposition to the development due to its proximity to the landfill.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the proposed 1800 new homes, The Wellington Company's New Central Park project would see an extension to the Paraparaumu Town Centre, including a mix of commercial and retail properties.</p>
        
            <p>The developer's other project - slated for Ōtaki Māori Racing Club - would include 550 residences, and Waikanae could see 1000 new homes built under the Waikanae North Developments proposal.</p>
        
            <p>The so-called "Long Tunnel" has been named as one of the five infrastructure projects included in the Fast-track Approvals Bill for Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal, which would see a 4km-long tunnel under the city bypassing congestion sites around the Basin Reserve and Mt Victoria tunnel, is being investigated by the NZ Transport Agency under the instruction of Minister of Transport Simeon Brown.</p>
        
            <p>Official Information Act documents released to RNZ showed from 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024, nearly $1.3 million had been spent on consultants to investigate the tunnel project as well as the Basin Reserve upgrade project.</p>
        
            <p>Two Transpower projects were also included in the list, one of which would see a replacement of the undersea cables that connect the North Island and South Island, while the proposal by Wellington Airport to replace the seawall at the southern end of the runway and an extension to the Belmont Quarry also made the cut.</p>
