            <p>A man charged in relation to a protest at Te Papa this week has been released on bail.</p>
        
            <p>A display of an English version of the Treaty of Waitangi was damaged on Monday, when a man hung from abseiling equipment and used black spray paint and an angle grinder to obscure most of the text.</p>
        
            <p>Te Wehi Ratana has pleaded not guilty to charges of intentionally damaging an art installation and obstructing police.</p>
        
            <p>There was standing room only in the public gallery when Ratana appeared at Wellington District Court on Thursday afternoon seeking bail - he had been held in custody since his arrest on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police opposed the application. The Crown did not oppose bail but asked for strict conditions to be imposed.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Katie Elkin granted bail, on the condition Ratana stayed at a specified Wellington address until 8am Friday, when he and his family will drive back to Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Elkin said he was not to incite, support or participate in any unlawful protest activity, or travel south of Levin except to attend court.</p>
        
            <p>Ratana is next due at the court in February.</p>
