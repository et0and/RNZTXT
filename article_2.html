            <p>Winston Peters has angrily rejected evidence that his party's constitution has similar diversity requirements as the public service targets that he wants scrapped.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First last week proposed new legislation which it says would end "woke left-wing diversity targets".</p>
        
            <p>But the party's own constitution says list rankings for candidates should consider things like gender, social groups, ages and ethnicity.</p>
        
            <p>A reporter asked Peters on Wednesday how this was different from the public service targets of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI).</p>
        
            <p>"The constitution of New Zealand First says the list rankings should consider the gender diversity of the MPs," a reporter said to Peters. "Isn't that DEI?"</p>
        
            <p>"No, it's not," Peters responded.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got two words for a start, not three," he said.</p>
        
            <p>When pressed again by reporters, Peters offered to hold a class for them "pro bono".</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear what the class would be for.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Peters said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade advertising a job for a 'tikanga lead' was a case of a bad idea getting "dug in deeper than ticks on a hound".</p>
        
            <p>Peters has been adamant diversity was being preferred over merit for people getting jobs in the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told RNZ on Tuesday he was open to adopting some of his coalition partner's ideas.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he had tasked minister Judith Collins with overhauling the Public Service Act to ensure it was a "meritocracy".</p>
        
            <p>Asked for examples of wokeness, Luxon cited the Labour government's focus on "Wellbeing Budgets", co-governance, and the target to reduce prisoner numbers.</p>
        
            <p>Peters told Morning Report "all sorts of judgements" were being made about employing people. Employers were not making their selections on merit, but on criteria they had made up themselves.</p>
