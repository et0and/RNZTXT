            <p>In the 1800s, members of the South Island iwi Ngāi Tahu wrote many eloquent letters to local newspapers about the challenges and promises of bicultural life.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch academic Dr Emma Maurice, a Māori woman adopted into a Pākehā world, has found strength in researching those letters.</p>
        
            <p>We often hear about the negative impacts of colonisation but Māori pulled off something remarkable under that foreign influence - rapidly transforming their oral culture to a bilingual and bicultural one, says Maurice (Ngāti Kahungungu ki Heretaunga).</p>
        
            <p>The letters written to local newspapers by members of Ngāi Tahu in this period demonstrate a high degree of "bicultural fluency" as well as agency and innovation, she tells Mihingarangi Forbes.</p>
        
            <p>"Māori were able to uplift a second language and culture and have fluency within 50 years. From 1850 to 2024, has there been the same level of uptake by non-Māori in cultural fluency and language? There's the answer in there, but it's not for me to say what that is."</p>

            <p>In 1850, Aotearoa was home to more literate Māori than literate Pākehā, Maurice says.</p>
        
            <p>In newspapers - aka "the social media of their time" - Ngāi Tahu publicly shared their opinions on the country's evolution via 'letters to the editor'.</p>
        
            <p>Using this platform, tangata whenua could communicate directly with the South Island's rural settler communities and advocate for bicultural partnership, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"[Ngāi Tahu] are encouraging the sharing of resources. They're encouraging the leasing of land. They're encouraging trade."</p>
        
            <p>While there were no letters to the editor from Māori women to the papers - and little mention of any women before the 1890s - words from the "formidable wahine" Hira Moroiti Pōhio Traill began to appear in the 1930s.</p>
        
            <p>Traill used her letters to write against the forced conscription of young men, Maurice says, and also to have direct korero with Canterbury MPs about substandard infrastructure.</p>

            <p>"I've got about 38 letters of an exchange between her and local MPs talking about everything from potholes in the road to wastewater pipes not being installed."</p>
        
            <p>Maurice says she was"gifted" the research topic of Ngāi Tahu letters to the editor by Māori language advocate and academic Hana O'Regan.</p>
        
            <p>The letters, published between between 1850 and 1950, became the subject of Maurice's PhD thesis Voices Across a Century .</p>
        
            <p>For nine years, she immersed herself in these via the National Library's Past Papers archive.</p>
        
            <p>As a Māori woman raised in a Pākehā world after a closed adoption, she says their powerful voices strengthened her own.</p>
        
            <p>Although Maurice's "beautiful" adoptive parents knew how important it was for her to connect with her heritage, she was also surrounded by "stereotypical negative narratives" and as a young person did not identify as Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of my friends had straight blonde hair and blue eyes and in the 80s the bob cut was a really big haircut. I have very frizzy Polynesian hair and when I got the bob haircut, the fringe was like two little ringlets that kind of bounced above my eyebrows… From that moment, I thought, okay, there's something different about me."</p>
        
            <p>Entering puberty, Maurice felt an "incredible rage" burning inside as she struggled to find her own sense of identity and belonging.</p>
        
            <p>Although she had a good experience of closed adoption, she says many other Māori children are not so lucky.</p>
        
            <p>"As a little human, you need to be able to look around and see humans that reflect you. When you don't see that there is a level of trauma that you will then need to go through as an adult in order to get to that space."</p>
        
            <p>"That's an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. We need to build the fence at the top to prevent our tamariki from being placed in places where they are potentially unsafe."</p>

            <p>Even after seeing 'ethnicity Māori' on her birth certificate in her late 20s, Maurice felt a "big disconnect" from the culture.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't see myself reflected anywhere. There was a decade or more period of my life where I wrangled with these questions of identity."</p>
        
            <p>Maurice says she was only able to commit to her academic path after forging her own personal connection with te ao Māori in her 30s.</p>
        
            <p>While Maurice feels "very at home" in Christchurch, connecting with her tupuna in Hawke's Bay was an essential part of this.</p>
        
            <p>While living in the district for a time, she enrolling to study at EIT (The Eastern Institute of Technology) and was overcome by receiving there a kananga (ceremonial welcome).</p>
        
            <p>"The tears just started streaming down my face. I thought 'For the first time I'm on my whenua. This is where my people have been for hundreds, if not thousands of years.' It was a sense of 'I've come home' and I could feel that they were like 'Welcome home, girl', spiritually."</p>
