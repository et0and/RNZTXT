            <p>A homage to Auckland mayor Wayne Brown's least favourite symbol of urban living will light up the northern Nevada Desert next month.</p>
        
            <p>Coney McConeface is an 18-metre road cone that is being built by a team of New Zealanders for the infamous Burning Man Festival.</p>
        
            <p>Every year, tens of thousands of people flock to the desert for the festival, where they create a makeshift city that is then set on fire.</p>
        
            <p>Coney McConeface was designed by an artist known as Kiwi. One of the team working on the artwork, Hippathy Valentine, told Checkpoint Coney had many secrets to reveal.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not only building a large traffic cone, but we're building an idol for us to worship," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The team had previously built a temple and a wētā, but burning the cone would be very satisfactory, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you like to build burning art, then there's nothing like building a giant chimney, which is basically what a cone is, to burn.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely a lot of time and energy being thought about the burning process, and it's going to burn very well."</p>
        
            <p>The cone was being built in Reno, Nevada in a warehouse called the Generator - a large space designed for Burning Man art.</p>
        
            <p>Valentine said the cone was not too hard to move around.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely been designed to be made in a structurally simple way to be a kitset, basically a giant Lego set. It's made of wood and it will be painted on top," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will look orange and reflective, just like a real traffic cone."</p>
        
            <p>The cone was chosen from hundreds of applications to Burning Man to receive a funding grant, however, its team was still fundraising.</p>
        
            <p>"We still need to raise at least another US$10,000 (NZ$16,000) to be able to see the project through to completion."</p>
        
            <p>The cone would be shipped out to Black Rock City, where Burning Man is held, on 16 August.</p>
        
            <p>Valentine told Checkpoint the team was not taking souvenirs from Aotearoa to Nevada, "except for our passion and love for the traffic cone".</p>
        
            <p>He said other projects in the past, such as the wētā, were put into shipping containers and brought back to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The wētā lives next to the giant wētā breeding programme at Pūkaha National Wildlife Centre in Mount Bruce now."</p>
        
            <p>However, for Coney McConeface, "it's all built there and it will all turn into ashes there".</p>
        
            <p>The Burning Man festival will be held from 25 August to 2 September.</p>
