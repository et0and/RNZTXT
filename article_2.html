            <p>There's belief Kuini Nga wai hono i te po will be a voice for rangatahi after being named as the Kiingitanga's new leader.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old was crowned the eighth Māori monarch after her father Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII died last week.</p>
        
            <p>She is the second woman to hold the position. The first was her grandmother, Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu, who died in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>Reo Māori student at Te Waananga Taki-ura, Miro Harre, told Midday Report it was special to stand with te iwi Māori at Turangawaewae Marae yesterday when her appointment was announced.</p>
        
            <p>Harre said there was symbolism around te mana o te rangatahi and te mana o te wahine for the future.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Central and Green Party MP Tamatha Paul said it was super exciting to see a young wahine Māori at the helm of te ao Māori.</p>
        
            <p>She was thrilled that there would be a wahine in leadership that would help unify people in divisive times.</p>
        
            <p>Alicia Dehar a kaihaka from kapa haka group Te Whare Karioi told Midday Report Kuini Nga wai hono i te po was a good suit for the role.</p>
        
            <p>"As a rangatahi she'll be able to connect with our other rangatahi across the motu."</p>
        
            <p>Miro Harre said social media has been a forum for the voice of te iwi Māori.</p>
        
            <p>She said the fact that the Kuini is a rangatahi created to an opportunity to share te ao Māori with the world.</p>
        
            <p>Harre said she was excited to see the contrast between the Kuini's leadership and other leaders both in New Zealand and around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Paul said she the Kuini has demonstrated that she was committed and willing to lead.</p>
        
            <p>"She is a source of inspiration for our people and to see her at such a young age ascend [to] a role with such responsibility and such weight to it is inspiring."</p>
