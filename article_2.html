        <h2>Luxon rules out treaty referendum under National</h2>
        <p>
The Treaty Principles Bill continues to dog the National Party despite Luxon's repeated efforts to communicate the legislation will not go beyond second reading.

            <p>The prime minister has ruled out signing up to a treaty referendum if National and ACT are back at the negotiating table after elections in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill continues to dog the National Party despite Luxon's repeated efforts to communicate the legislation will not go beyond second reading.</p>
        
            <p>At Rātana Pa today, Kiingitanga spokesperson Rahui Papa told Luxon "the state of the Māori nation is at the highest level of concern that it has been for a whole lot of years."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon responded by reiterating a message he has repeated ad naseum during his time in the top job, that "National won't support the bill, it will be voted down and it won't become law".</p>
        
            <p>He was later asked what he would do if the ACT Party asked for a public referendum on the Treaty next term.</p>
        
            <p>"I will [refuse]. It's a no for me."</p>
        
            <p>When approached for comment, ACT Party leader David Seymour said: "It's always best not to get too far ahead of yourself, you've got to serve the people and see if they re-elect you first."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said there was no doubt the Treaty Principles Bill had caused anxiety on both sides of the debate and blamed the former Labour government for the angst.</p>
        
            <p>"We are where we are because of, I think, the previous government not making the case for the changes it was driving through that period of time, but that then creating that division."</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill is government legislation Luxon himself signed, sealed and delivered for ACT through the coalition agreements at the start of the term.</p>

            <p>The Green Party today pushed for National to bin the bill right now, arguing it had technically fulfilled its coalition promise now it was before select committee.</p>
        
            <p>It was not something Luxon would entertain.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to run a process. That was our commitment that we take it to first reading and select committee," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Justice Committee would start hearing oral submissions on the Treaty Principles Bill on Monday and Luxon had been keen to emphasise the process was nearly over.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is it will pass. We've got one more month of submissions and then the bill will be killed."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters also emphasised the bill's limited lifetime today, saying it was "dead in the water".</p>

            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer later told reporters the strong statements had only left people asking why the bill had got this far if neither National or New Zealand First liked it.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole way through they have assured us that they will vote the bill down - but where I was sitting, which is like second row from the pae, everyone was saying, 'then why?'</p>
        
            <p>"Why did you agree to it? Why are you here defending that you agreed to it? Why are we having to waste all that ink?"</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chloe Swarbrick said National could halt select committee proceedings now if it wanted.</p>

            <p>"The coalition agreement says to take it to select committee, it doesn't promise a second reading."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the statements at Rātana Pa would do little to assuage people's concerns about the legislation.</p>
        
            <p>"The damage has been done. They've set the relationship between Māori and non-Māori back by decades and it was an unnecessary debate. We didn't need to do this."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he and his senior leadership team had maintained "constructive dialogue" with iwi leaders over the last year with a focus on what areas the Crown and Māori could collaborate on.</p>
