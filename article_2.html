        <h2>For weeks, there have been signs that Gaza's ceasefire might not hold</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - These attacks in Gaza come just hours before large protests against the Netanyahu government were due to begin, Matthew Doran writes.

            <p>Analysis - For weeks, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been on the brink of collapse.</p>
        
            <p>Now, it appears the worst fears for the future of the war in Gaza could be realised.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the Israel military said it launched new strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Medics in the area reported casualties in what they said were the most violent air strikes since the 19 January ceasefire began.</p>
        
            <p>Palestinian officials from the Hamas-run Health Ministry have reported at least 200 deaths.</p>
        
            <p>The ceasefire, already incredibly fragile, has been shattered.</p>
        
            <p>But in recent weeks, there have been indications this could happen.</p>
        
            <p>In February, just days after being named as the new Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief, Major General Eyal Zamir said that "2025 will continue to be a year of combat".</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said US strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen should be seen as a warning to Hamas about delays in ceasefire negotiations in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>That may well have given the Netanyahu government a green light to launch these attacks, a week after the proposal was developed by the IDF and presented to the prime minister for approval.</p>
        
            <p>We also know the White House was given advance warning of the strikes.</p>
        
            <p>People like the far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich were making those demands even before the ceasefire came into force, threatening to quit the government - and topple it - if a deal was struck.</p>
        
            <p>But that rhetoric looks increasingly out of touch with the views of the large parts of the Israeli community.</p>
        
            <p>These attacks in Gaza come just hours before large protests against the Netanyahu government were due to begin.</p>
        
            <p>The rallies are expected to include the families of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>They're accusing the prime minister of trying to prolong the war, putting the fight ahead of getting the captives home.</p>
        
            <p>They also alleged he's purging members of the defence and intelligence establishment who defy him.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>On Monday Netanyahu announced moves to oust Ronen Bar, the head of the nation's domestic intelligence agency, citing "a distrust that has grown over time" between the pair.</p>
        
            <p>There are 59 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza - only 24 of them are believed to be alive.</p>
        
            <p>Hamas says these strikes "expose" those captives "to an unknown fate".</p>
        
            <p>The domestic response to the attacks on Gaza will come quickly, as Israel wakes up.</p>
