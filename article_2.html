            <p>Police are hoping a post-mortem on a plastic-wrapped body fished out of the Gulf Harbour will provide answers about the death.</p>
        
            <p>Recreational fisherman Paul Middleton recovered the bag and alerted police after finding the remains inside.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tim Williams said the investigation was still at the very early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority is to establish the identity of the deceased and what has led to their death."</p>
        
            <p>Cordons at the scene have been removed and Williams said they have spoken to people in the area at the time the discovery was made.</p>
        
            <p>"We would also encourage any residents in the nearby coastal area that saw anything suspicious to contact us."</p>
        
            <p>Middleton was in the Whangaparaoa area hoping to land some decent-sized kahawai or snapper.</p>
        
            <p>"I [threw] my lure out ... and nothing much was happening but there was a bag out there," he said.</p>

            <p>He said at the time he did not know it was a bag, and thought it was a log or a dead animal.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyway the wind changed, brought it into the coast. I think yeah, anything floating in the water brings fish around, so I'm targeting it. I got that perfect shot, like millimetres to the side of it."</p>
        
            <p>He hooked it and pulled it into the shore.</p>

            <p>He struggled through "layer and layer" of plastic to open the bag.</p>
        
            <p>There was "a bit of clothing ... and then there was this hand sticking out".</p>
        
            <p>It was at that point that he called police.</p>
        
            <p>"Two cops turned up and they thought I'd actually said there's just a hand in a bag and then they went down there and went, 'Oh no we've got a body'," Middleton said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not try to open the bag further once he discovered the hand.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information that could help with police inquiries is asked to contact them on 105, using reference number 240312/9837 or go online using 'Update my report'.</p>
