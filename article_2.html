            <p>Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis have posted a Father's Day tribute to their father, Prince William, in their first social media post.</p>
        
            <p>The post reads: "We love you, Papa. Happy Father's Day", followed by two red hearts and signed "G, C & L".</p>
        
            <p>In the picture, taken by Catherine, the Princess of Wales, William can be seen standing on a beach with his arms round his children, looking out to sea.</p>
        
            <p>Kensington Palace said it was taken on a trip to the Norfolk coast last month.</p>
        
            <p>It marks the first time that a personal message from the prince's three children has been posted on the family's social media accounts.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Sunday, William posted his own Father's Day tribute, to his father, King Charles III.</p>

            <p>The prince shared a photograph of himself as a child, playing football with the King in the gardens of Kensington Palace.</p>
        
            <p>Taken on 12 June 1984, the then nearly two-year-old prince can be seen smiling while kicking a brightly coloured football.</p>
        
            <p>A few months after the picture was taken, William's younger brother would be born - the Duke of Sussex.</p>
        
            <p>The post was personally signed off by the prince, with the caption: "Happy Father's Day, Pa."</p>
        
            <p>As well as marking Father's Day, it was also a potential nod to the England football team, who were due to start their Euro 2024 campaign later on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile the Royal Family's X account shared some archive footage of the King with his father, Prince Philip.</p>

            <p>Sourced from the BFI National Archive and set to a piece of classical piano music, the video features black-and-white clips from when King Charles was a child.</p>
        
            <p>One shows the King as a baby, being lifted out of a pram by his father. In another, the pair can be seen enjoying a sailing trip.</p>
        
            <p>It is captioned: "Wishing all Dads, and those who may be missing their parents today, a relaxing Father's Day." The King's father, Prince Philip died in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The social media posts come a day after the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony, which celebrates the monarch's official birthday.</p>
        
            <p>It was Catherine's first public appearance of the year, as she is receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.</p>
        
            <p>The King is also being treated for the illness, and only made a return to public duties at the end of April.</p>
        
            <p>The royals were greeted by cheers from the crowd in central London, as they travelled in their carriages from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade.</p>
