            <p>Two large marches, one pro-Palestine, the other pro-Israel, have converged on Parliament's lawn on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The Palestinian Solidarity Network Aotearoa had organised an 'Aotearoa National Rally for Gaza' to walk through Wellington on Wednesday and deliver a petition to MPs.</p>

            <p>They were instead met with a gathering of pro-Israeli protesters, waving flags and chanting "bring them home" on a megaphone.</p>
        
            <p>An organiser from the pro-Palestine side claimed they organised their protest first. But she said the government had facilitated both for freedom of speech.</p>
        
            <p>A person standing with Israel said they were there to stand against rising anti-Semitic sentiment.</p>
        
            <p>At the height of the protest there were about 500 protesters on each side and an RNZ reporter at the scene said it had been peaceful - although some barbs had been exchanged.</p>

            <p>MPs from Labour, the Green Party, and Te Pāti Māori stood on Parliament's forecourt to welcome the pro-Palestine marchers.</p>
        
            <p>ACT MP Simon Court was seen speaking with the pro-Israel contingent, which also included former National MP Alfred Ngaro, and Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki.</p>

            <p>The Greens have launched a member's bill following the rally, calling on the government to duplicate the framework of the Russia Sanctions Act to allow sanctions to be imposed against Israel.</p>
        
            <p>There is a large Destiny Church contingent in the pro-Israel side. Many were wearing Man Up shirts.</p>
