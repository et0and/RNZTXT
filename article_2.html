            <p>There was supposed to be an open home at 81-year-old Alan Johnson's house on Sunday, but it had been torn to shreds during the storm that hit Mangawhai overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"Top floor is gone, but every room is damaged," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Two people from Mangawhai were taken to hospital in a serious condition. One was flown to Auckland Hospital by helicopter and the other was taken to North Shore hospital.</p>
        
            <p>One of them was Johnson's daughter, who was at his Old Waipu Road home at the time, and escaped by jumping down on top of the carport.</p>
        
            <p>She is now in Auckland Hospital, awaiting surgery.</p>
        
            <p>"She's got lacerations and broken bones," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said he was still in shock, but was relieved his daughter is okay.</p>

            <p>Johnson had worked for years to get his house ready to sell.</p>
        
            <p>"It was supposed to be an open home today. It was an open home yesterday. The house was in beautiful condition, like tip-top condition. Now look at it.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really devastating. We'd worked four years to get it up to this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said he was still in shock.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm relieved my daughter is okay.</p>
        
            <p>"My granddaughter was living in Mangawhai last night. She didn't get hurt. She's now down at Auckland Hospital with my daughter."</p>
