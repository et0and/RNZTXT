            <p>Train services have once again resumed in Wellington after a widespread signal outage.</p>
        
            <p>A fault cancelled all trains earlier this morning, with services resuming just before 8am.</p>
        
            <p>But shortly after 8.30am Metlink advised that services on the Kāpiti, Melling and Hutt Valley lines had been suspended again.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink says those services have now resumed, but passengers should expect severe delays and possible cancelled services on those lines.</p>
        
            <p>"Signals around Wellington Railway Station have now been repaired and all trains can access the station. There will be some ongoing service delays as displaced trains and crews return to normal schedule."</p>
        
            <p>Metlink senior manager of operations Paul Tawharu said a KiwiRail signal/power outage at Wellington Station occurred at 6am meaning trains were unable to enter or leave the station.</p>
        
            <p>"Power to signals at Wellington Station was restored by 9:20am. Services have resumed running on all lines and trains and staff are working to return to schedule."</p>
        
            <p>A train arriving from Woburn on the Hutt line shortly after 8am was full and unable to pick up any new passengers.</p>
        
            <p>The conductor told commuters the next train would have capacity to take people to Petone for bus replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Heidi and Nicky had to wait over an hour for a bus replacement. Heidi said that wasn't good enough and it had been freezing cold waiting.</p>
        
            <p>Among the first passengers to arrive at Wellington Station was Alison who caught the train from Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>She said the train stopped at Petone and passengers were told there were bus replacements, but she was able to get through on the Wairarapa train, although it went slowly the whole way.</p>
        
            <p>She caught the train at 6.40am and arrived just before 8am this morning.</p>

            <p>A worker at Wellington Station said the fault was between Wellington and Kaiwharawhara.</p>
        
            <p>Karen Shaw says her daughter's commute to Porirua for her course has been delayed as a result of the signal fault.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
