            <p>An Auckland paddleboarder was left "buzzing" after a close encounter with two playful orca whales at a North Shore beach.</p>
        
            <p>Justin Serville was paddling off Castor Bay beach at around 10am on Friday when the orcas came to say hi.</p>
        
            <p>Filming on his Go Pro, Serville can be heard greeting the whales as they swim around him.</p>
        
            <p>"Woah, beautiful, beautiful," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Hello, hello, hello gorgeous. How are you? Hello, hello darlings. Look at you guys, wanting to say hello."</p>
        
            <p>Serville told Checkpoint it was not the first time he had encountered orcas in the water but the creatures seemed very relaxed around him.</p>

            <p>He assumed they were juveniles - given their smaller size - and said they were playfully rolling under the board.</p>
        
            <p>"I just wanted to pat them like puppy dogs, they were so playful."</p>
        
            <p>Serville said he would like to think one of the whales smiled at him as they were giving off a "really good vibe".</p>
        
            <p>"I just see them as beautiful, loving creatures, free, playful, so that's the energy I put out so I'm really relaxed around them and obviously that energy came back."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was "quite tempted" to jump in the water with them, but knew it was prohibited.</p>
        
            <p>But Serville said the experience left him "buzzing" and he was "over the moon" to catch the footage and share it with the community.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation website said it was an offence under the Marine Mammals Protection Regulations 1992 to swim within 100 metres of a whale.</p>
        
            <p>"For the purpose of the protection regulations, a whale is defined as all species commonly known as whales; and includes baleen whales, sperm whales, beaked whales, killer whales, and pilot whales. The penalty for breaching the regulations is a $10,000 fine."</p>
        
            <p>The department said orcas were the most "widely distributed mammal on earth with the exception of humans".</p>
        
            <p>The species has a population of 150-200 in New Zealand waters.</p>
