            <p>A Māori-owned bakery in Wellington is bringing pretzels, rēwena bread and manaakitanga to its new store in the eastern suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>Little Bread Loaf owner Lynda McGregor is expanding her bakery's reach with a second store in Miramar to match its Lower Hutt bakery.</p>
        
            <p>McGregor (Ngāti Raukawa ki te Tonga, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Kuia, Te Atiawa, Te Whānau a Apanui, me Te Atihaunui a Pāpārangi) worked in the public sector for 25 years before her childhood memories of rēwena bread sparked a renewed interest in the world of breadmaking.</p>
        
            <p>"I was standing in my kitchen in my house in Lyall Bay and I was thinking about rēwena bread, and then realised I only had one auntie who was left alive who knew how to make rēwena bread, and then I went on the journey of teaching myself how to make that."</p>
        
            <p>She began filming her trials and successes with rēwena on YouTube and the bakery began to take off.</p>
        
            <p>"As a single parent I was on a very small income, and I thought if I can make bread and I can teach people how to make bread, then people will never be hungry. So it started from a place of need and wanting to sustain my whānau and my children, then it grew into teaching."</p>
        
            <p>McGregor said food sovereignty, giving people the tools to produce their own kai, is an incredibly important part of her business. Her rēwena recipe was developed for anyone to use.</p>
        
            <p>"How I teach people to make that starter bug is really simple... anybody can take flour, they can take potatoes, they can take water and a little bit of sugar and they can turn it into a product that will sustain their whānau."</p>
        
            <p>When McGregor, a Lyall Bay local herself, saw an opportunity to open a shop in Miramar she took it - especially since the bakery was already well-known enough that she was making special deliveries on her commute home from Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to deliver here after work on a Sunday because people couldn't come out to Alicetown, so then I started to deliver to them. And we have a very good reputation for our food, but more importantly we have a very good reputation for our manaaki and how we look after our customers."</p>

            <p>McGregor said tikanga was her point of difference as a Māori-owned business.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course I'm passionate about my rēwena bread, I'm passionate about our bakery but I'm also passionate about Māori in business and business model I've created."</p>
        
            <p>Values like manaakitanga (hospitality) and whakawhanaungatanga (relationship building) were at the heart of her business, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in business, I'm in business to make money, I'm in business to stimulate the economy - but we do it in a way that sits very close to our values and my values as Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"At the centre my business is about manaaki, so that's how we look after each other, how we look after our customers and how we look after our surroundings."</p>
