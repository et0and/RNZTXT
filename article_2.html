            <p>The Employers and Manufacturers Association says it is seeing disagreements crop up between employers and employees regarding working from home agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Some workers at One NZ are calling for the telco to back down on changes to its work from home policy.</p>
        
            <p>The company is proposing that some call centre workers come into the office three times a week - one day additional to their current arrangement.</p>
        
            <p>In response, some union workers are working solely from home over the next 11 days.</p>
        
            <p>Employers and Manufacturers Association general counsel Paul O'Neil said they were seeing employees who may have been working one or two days a week from home and it working well for them; equally, however, there were employers who found the settings were no longer working for their businesses.</p>
        
            <p>The association was advising businesses they could avoid disputes over working from home by being upfront about expectations at the time of hiring, O'Neil said.</p>
        
            <p>Public sector organisations were more likely to be flexible around working from home arrangements, he said.</p>
