            <p>If a wife and husband fall out of love in the Philippines they are legally required to remain married - even in cases of infidelity.</p>
        
            <p>As the ABC reported earlier this year, it also means that women who are abused by their husbands cannot escape.</p>
        
            <p>So, why does divorce remain forbidden in the Philippines? What does the Filipino public think of divorce?</p>
        
            <p>And when might the law change?</p>
        
            <p>In a word: Catholicism.</p>
        
            <p>The religion arrived with the Spaniards who came to colonise the archipelago in the 16th century.</p>
        
            <p>"Catholic Church teachings emphasise the indissolubility of marriage. It is a lifelong commitment that cannot be dissolved by human authority," said Cecilia Francisco-Tan, a Melbourne-based theology lecturer.</p>
        
            <p>"A consummated marriage between baptised individuals cannot be dissolved except by death.</p>
        
            <p>"Divorce is not recognised. Annulment is the Church's response to 'invalid marriages' - that is, certain conditions have not been met at the time of the marriage."</p>
        
            <p>While Spain legalised divorce in 1981, its legacy lives on in the Philippines - the only place other than the Vatican where divorce remains outlawed.</p>
        
            <p>Today the Philippines is the third largest Catholic-majority country on the planet, after only Brazil and Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 80 percent of the country's 109 million people were Roman Catholics in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>While the Vatican has remained opposed to divorce, Pope Francis has emphasised during his tenure that those who have divorced and remarried should still be welcomed by the church.</p>
        
            <p>Filipino Muslims, who account for 6.4 percent of the population, are exempt from the divorce ban.</p>
        
            <p>Former president Ferdinand Marcos in 1977 enacted the Code of Muslim Personal Laws based on sharia, which recognises divorce.</p>
        
            <p>For the vast majority of Filipinos, however - Catholics and religious minorities such as Protestants and Buddhists alike - legally ending a marriage is off-limits.</p>
        
            <p>In line with Catholic teachings, they may annul their marriage in a range of circumstances, including "psychological incapacity"; where one partner is homosexual; or if one party has an incurable sexually transmitted disease.</p>
        
            <p>But the legal process for annulments is generally slow and prohibitively expensive, meaning it's not an option for many Filipinos.</p>
        
            <p>It generally costs upwards of 150,000 Philippine pesos (NZD$4300) - more than the average annual salary.</p>
        
            <p>The divorce ban therefore means many are trapped.</p>
        
            <p>Some 17.5 percent of Filipino women aged 15 to 49 had experienced physical, sexual or emotional violence from their intimate partners, according to the 2022 National Demographic and Health Survey.</p>
        
            <p>Many Filipinos remain socially conservative, including about divorce.</p>
        
            <p>Still, nationwide survey data from 1500 respondents by Filipino pollster Social Weather Stations found in June 2024 that only 31 percent were opposed to legalising divorce for couples in irreconcilable situations.</p>
        
            <p>Half of those polled were in favour of legalisation.</p>
        
            <p>A bill to legalise divorce passed the House of Representatives in 2018 but was thrown out by the Senate.</p>
        
            <p>The current president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr, has expressed support for divorce being made legal in the Philippines, while emphasising the process should not be easy.</p>
        
            <p>"We must allow our couples, our married couples to work on their marriages," he said in an interview ahead of being elected in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to not give them an easy option."</p>
        
            <p>In May, the Filipino House of Representatives passed a bill that would reinstate "absolute divorce" in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Under the bill, a married person would have to file a petition to a court for consideration.</p>
        
            <p>Grounds for divorce under the bill include physical violence or abuse; drug, alcohol or gambling addiction; and marital infidelity.</p>
        
            <p>Other cited reasons for divorce, which are currently valid under the Family Code of the Philippines for annulment of a marriage, include "lack of parental consent", "insanity" and "impotence".</p>
        
            <p>Arlene Brosas, a member of the House of Representatives for the Gabriela Women's Party, was one of the authors of the bill.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a significant women's rights push forward to legalise divorce," she told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't have anything to do with the church, religion, or whatever."</p>
        
            <p>Another of the bill's authors, MP and human rights lawyer Edcel Lagman, said that its passage through the House reflected changing attitudes in the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a clear and resounding victory," he said as quoted by the Philippine News Agency.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] signals the imminent liberation for Filipino wives who are entombed in toxic, abusive, and long-dead marriages."</p>
        
            <p>The bill has moved to the Senate for further debate.</p>
        
            <p>But conservative forces are gearing up to fight the change.</p>
        
            <p>More than 40 religious organisations formed the Super Coalition Against Divorce in June "to work together to prevent anti-family and anti-life laws from being passed in Congress".</p>
        
            <p>The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines reiterated its opposition to legalising divorce.</p>
        
            <p>While acknowledging the division of church and state, in July it warned Filipino politicians against "jump[ing] on the divorce bandwagon".</p>
        
            <p>Catholic leaders have mobilised prayer rallies and petitions against the reform.</p>
        
            <p>Auxiliary Bishop Midyphil Billones told Catholic radio station Radio Veritas that the Philippines could be the "last bastion of hope" by keeping divorce illegal.</p>
        
            <p>Brosas, the Gabriela Women's Party MP, said she remained hopeful but was expecting that legalising divorce could once again be voted down in the Senate.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it will be blocked again," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Still, Dr Francisco-Tan said that there were signs of change in attitudes "among a small but growing cohort of theologically educated Filipinos".</p>
        
            <p>"There is, even among the bishops, a divergence of views about a very human problem."</p>
