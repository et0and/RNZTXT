            <p>The sight of a crop never grown before in New Zealand has been puzzling residents north of Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>The conversion of former dairy paddocks alongside State Highway 10 at Kapiro has sparked much conjecture in recent months about what the plants are, who's growing them, and why.</p>
        
            <p>It turns out there's a good reason even seasoned horticulturalists don't recognise the young trees - hwangchil, a Korean medicinal plant, is new to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The trees are being grown on a farm bought by Kerikeri resident Ilchi Lee, who is variously described as an author, a businessman and a spiritual leader.</p>

            <p>His business interests in the Bay of Islands are centred on tourism - he is developing an "eco village" on the edge of Puketi Forest, west of Kerikeri, and he owns a motel and a holiday resort - but he also has an education centre, a kiwifruit orchard, and a hobby farm catering to his international visitors.</p>
        
            <p>The hwangchil orchard is his first attempt at creating a new industry in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>Hwangchil, or Dendropanax morbifera, is a shrub native to the Korean peninsula used in traditional medicine.</p>
        
            <p>Lee already uses hwangchil grown in Korea to make skincare products with claimed anti-ageing effects.</p>
        
            <p>His aim, once he has Food Safety approval, is to use New Zealand-grown hwangchil in a range of food products.</p>

            <p>A director of NZ Eco Farms, Yewon Hwang, said so far 25,000 trees had been planted on 7ha.</p>
        
            <p>It had taken three years to work out how to get biosecurity clearance to import the seeds, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The trees had been raised in pots before being planted in paddocks and were now about two years old.</p>
        
            <p>Hwang said growing the trees in New Zealand conditions was a case of trial and error.</p>
        
            <p>"We are still learning about how they grow here. We are always experimenting and learning," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kikuyu was proving to be one of their biggest challenges, especially given their reluctance to use chemical sprays.</p>
        
            <p>In Korea the young trees were planted directly into pasture, but Korean growers did not have to reckon with Northland's vigorous, all-smothering kikuyu grass.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said the trees themselves did not need much care.</p>
        
            <p>"They like well-draining soil but they're not too fussy, so they could be planted on marginal farmland as an extra source of income."</p>
        
            <p>Ilchi Lee said the trees grew slowly in Korea, where they were confined to the warmer south coast.</p>
        
            <p>They seemed to grow better in New Zealand, which was not entirely surprising - kiwifruit originally came from Asia and only became a major commercial crop when grown in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Lee said New Zealand had the environment, the space and the growth rate to make a hwangchil industry work, though there were also new challenges to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>All parts of the plant could be used but mostly the leaves were harvested, freeze dried and powdered.</p>
        
            <p>Lee said there was already demand for hwangchil products in Korea, North America and Europe.</p>
        
            <p>He envisaged making teas, beverages, supplements, and healthy substitutes for gum, sweets and biscuits.</p>
        
            <p>He planned to keep expanding the area planted in hwangchil, and create a "healing park" on the 119ha former dairy farm.</p>
        
            <p>Lee said he had applied to NZTA for permission to hold events on the property.</p>
