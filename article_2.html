            <p>"Hey, you fucker, here I am, shoot here!" screamed a Czech reporter trying to distract a gunman who killed 14 people at a university building in Prague on Thursday, helping people to flee the country's worst mass shooting.</p>
        
            <p>Jiri Forman, a reporter for a small security-focused news outfit who said he had experience in war zones, evaded fire from the gunman who was perched on a balcony on the top floor of Charles University's Faculty of Art.</p>
        
            <p>While ducking behind a corner in a square below, he kept feeding information to police outside and urged them to fire back, while filming continuously on his phone.</p>
        
            <p>Asked by an officer what was he doing, Forman is heard in the footage shouting: "So that he doesn't shoot at the people! What do you think I'm am I doing, man? There are people there!"</p>
        
            <p>His actions have won him plaudits in Czech media, but Forman played down suggestions he was a hero.</p>
        
            <p>"Where I stood it was absolutely safe, nobody was there and I knew I could duck behind an obstacle," he told Reuters on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"And if he shoots in my direction, he won't have the people fleeing, they will have a chance to reach cover. I screamed at him and he started shooting in my direction."</p>
        
            <p>Police in the square returned fire at the attacker, a 24-year old student at the faculty with a gun licence.</p>
        
            <p>He eventually dropped his rifle with sights, and police said this allowed officers inside the building to get closer, prompting the attacker to shoot himself.</p>
        
            <p>"The policeman I believe shot three times at the attacker. I think this threw him off balance. Then he also hears that police are getting close from inside, so he shot himself," Forman said.</p>

            <p>Police said they had been hunting the assailant since 12.26 pm (1126 GMT) on Thursday, when his friend alerted them he had sent a suicidal text message. While they tried to intercept him at a lecture he was due to attend at another location, he went instead to a different building.</p>
        
            <p>Police said it took 21 minutes from the first information on the shooting at the building to confirmation the attacker was dead at 3.20 pm.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from victims at the university, police said the attacker also killed his father earlier on Thursday and ballistic analysis linked him to the murder of a man and his two-month old daughter last week.</p>
        
            <p>"I did things I believed were right, and unfortunately, the sad heroes are the relatives who lost their closest ones at this Christmas time, and policemen and rescue services," Forman said</p>
