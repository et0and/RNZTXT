        <h2>'Kids shouldn't be living in motels': How Hastings cut numbers in emergency housing</h2>
        <p>
At its worst in 2019, two-thirds of the city's motel rooms were being used for emergency accommodation.

            <p>A Hawke's Bay city that has long been home to a chronic housing shortage has made a massive dent in the number of people forced to live in motels.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of March 2022 - when the Ministry of Social Development began regularly reporting these numbers - 285 people in 117 Hastings households were living in emergency accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of September 2023, that was down to 66 people in 39 households - a 77 percent drop.</p>
        
            <p>Officials put the success down to the district's place-based housing strategy, which was introduced as a pilot in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>That year was breaking point, when two-thirds of the district's motel rooms were being used for emergency accommodation, Hastings District Council chief executive Nigel Bickle said.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't have all the answers, but we said 'look we've got a problem, we've got some ideas around what perhaps is causing it, and also some ideas around what might solve it'.</p>
        
            <p>"But the bottom line is no one can solve this on their own if they don't understand the local housing market, and that you bring the right partners together."</p>
        
            <p>Those partners included council, government, community organisations and iwi, who were driven by the principle that every community had its own housing issues and opportunities - and a one-size-fits-all approach would not address them.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings faced specific challenges, such as having to house 6000 seasonal workers for seven months of the year - which had a domino effect, said Bickle.</p>
        
            <p>"In a place whose population is growing, and economy is going really strong, why did we have 1000 less rental houses than we had five years previously?</p>
        
            <p>"Well, in a visitor economy, when all of a sudden two-thirds of your visitor accommodation is being used to house families in emergency housing and to look after temporary workers, a lot of houses that were once rentals got converted to Airbnb."</p>
        
            <p>The cycle was perpetuating - but four years in, the puzzle had mostly been pieced together.</p>
        
            <p>That included allowing for:</p>
        
            <p>Five motels had been taken out of circulation for emergency housing, because they were no longer needed, Bickle said.</p>
        
            <p>But the mission was not over yet, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kids and families shouldn't be living in motels - they're not designed to be housing.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a KPI to try and get to zero within three years. We've made a lot of progress, but, there's still a long way to go."</p>

            <p>It has taken a village - and it was vital that Ngāti Kahungunu was part of it, chief executive Bayden Barber said.</p>
        
            <p>Māori represent about 70 percent of those living in emergency accommodation in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>Now, ancestral land was being used for papakāinga to house generations of whānau, Barber said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got whānau that have whenua, and iwi's role is to enable and empower those whānau to build homes for their people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a great model, because it's connection to whenua, place and whakapapa.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's about whai kāinga, whai oranga, which is, if you can get housing, there's wellness in that. It's more than just housing, it's a kaupapa approach."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development said it was looking to achieve the same success with place-based housing strategies in nine other communities from Te Tai Tokerau to Queenstown, in a bid to move thousands of people out of motels and off the public housing waitlist.</p>
