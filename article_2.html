        <h2>Eight years of road cones on one short stretch of highway</h2>

Documents show how masses of road cones inhabited part of a highway for most of the past decade.

            <p>A spreadsheet full of crosses shows how masses of road cones inhabited a short stretch of highway for most of the last eight years.</p>
        
            <p>The government is on the war-path against what one minister has called "the sea of orange road cones that have taken over the country".</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 58 has been full of them, for a very long time, a newly released Official Information Act response from NZTA shows.</p>
        
            <p>The 6km stretch up Haywards Hill to Judgeford had one of the worst safety records of any highway before roadworks began.</p>
        
            <p>"It is why the project was approved and implemented - to make the road safer for the public," NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have always tried to strike a balance between project completion and the needs of road users."</p>
        
            <p>Now most of the highway is safer, but getting there took a different toll on motorists.</p>
        
            <p>"I was stunned at how often I had to deal with temporary traffic solutions and wayward Hayward road cones (Wellington is windy, who would've thought?)," one motorbiker emailed RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Roadworkers have always needed cones to keep them safe on active corridors; there have been horrific fatalities in recent years. That has contributed to tighter rules that have increased the extent of traffic control measures.</p>
        
            <p>A Transport Ministry report commented recently:</p>
        
            <p>"Health and safety standards for road maintenance have seen an [approximate ] 80 percent reduction in the number of potholes filled per day."</p>
        
            <p>Crews that had filled a maximum of 50 potholes a day, were down to just 10 a day "because of the time required to temporarily close and manage lanes safely", it said.</p>
        
            <p>SH58 has needed a lot more work than for pothole filling - it has been widened and straightened, and wire-rope median barriers and more barriers put in - and thus alot more traffic control.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the requirements of the Code of Practice for Temporary Traffic Management ... cones would have been required in all" traffic control areas, said Waka Kotahi in the OIA.</p>

            <p>The counting of the road cones on the spreadsheet begins in September 2014 and ends on August 12, 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Each X denotes a day with cones.</p>
        
            <p>The spreadsheet is solid with Xs from July 2021 on, for the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to 2021, Xs mark at least half the days, back to 2016.</p>
        
            <p>The motorbiker was perplexed.</p>
        
            <p>"Seven - 8 years worth of work on a road that never gets wider than 3 lanes that bridges two large suburbs in our capital city just doesn't sound right to me," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the importance of the road is held up by the Transport Agency as a reason for all the work, no matter how long it takes.</p>
        
            <p>"The project has taken longer to complete compared to other projects that can mostly be built away from busy active roads," it said.</p>
        
            <p>It had to avoid work in peak traffic periods, cutting down crews' hours and lengthening the job.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the frustration that comes with prolonged periods of construction.</p>
        
            <p>"NZTA/Waka Kotahi appreciates the project has been disruptive over several years. However, SH58 is an important state highway link that carries more than 20,000 vehicles per day."</p>
        
            <p>Road cones still pepper a series of roundabouts at the inlet end of of SH58, beneath the flyover of Transmission Gully motorway at Pauatahanui.</p>
        
            <p>"These roundabouts have cones in place as part of a measure to help reduce wrong-way driving", up the motorway off-ramps for example, the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>It was still deciding whether to make this "dogleg layout" permanent or not.</p>
        
            <p>The nationwide costs of road cones and traffic controls will be reported back to the Transport Minister for the first time in November.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown laid this new expectation on NZTA earlier this year, saying in July that road cones and traffic management were "out of control".</p>
        
            <p>The traffic control rules themselves are changing, to try to more efficiently match control measures (like cones) to the risks of a specific job.</p>
        
            <p>The escalating costs under the old rules reflect not just how many cones there are, but how long they hang around.</p>
        
            <p>On SH58, while the worst and windiest 5km is now complete after a marathon eight years, the job is not done.</p>
        
            <p>"Works are to be finished in other areas along the corridor," NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>"Traffic management is in place to ensure the safety of drivers and roadworkers."</p>
