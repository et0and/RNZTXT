            <p>Wellingtonians' general levels of satisfaction with their city has fallen to a record low, according to a Wellington City Council survey.</p>
        
            <p>However, there is satisfaction in some areas including transport, events and council facilities.</p>
        
            <p>The Residents Monitoring Survey is conducted annually to provide an estimate of what residents want and need.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council use the results of the RMS to inform their decision making.</p>
        
            <p>A record low of 50 percent surveyed residents feel a sense of pride in how Wellington looks and feels, down from 56 percent in 2023. This figure was 84 percent in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>A record low of 37 percent of people think central Wellington is "lively and attractive". This figure was 80 percent in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>However, residents have been feeling more satisfied with their suburban hubs since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 64 percent of residents surveyed in 2024 think their local suburban area is lively and attractive.</p>
        
            <p>Forty three percent of Wellington residents are concerned about safety in the central city after dark.</p>
        
            <p>This figure has sunk from 57 percent in 2022 and 71 percent in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Perceptions of safety during the day have remained steadily high since 2020 at 86-90 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Respondents who reported feeling unsafe in the CBD were asked to explain why in their own words.</p>
        
            <p>The most common themes were drugs and alcohol (41 percent), rough sleepers (31 percent) and aggressive or intimidating behaviour (29 percent).</p>
        
            <p>An analysis of police data showed that despite these perceptions, Wellington figures for 'victimisation' had increased 12 percent between 2021-2023 while other main cities have increased 30-50 percent.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 76 percent of residents feel safe in their local suburban area.</p>
        
            <p>General satisfaction with Wellington City Council performance has fallen from 33 percent to 29 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Satisfaction with the city council's decision-making process has risen slightly to 20 percent from 17 percent in 2023 and an all-time low of 12 percent in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>As in previous years, the main reason for dissatisfaction (38 percent) is because the city council does not "listen to residents".</p>
        
            <p>Only 29 percent think the council's approach to building resilience is satisfactory.</p>
        
            <p>Storm water infrastructure satisfaction is at 35 percent and has been stable (34-39 percent) for the past four years.</p>
        
            <p>This figure has steadily declined from 68 percent in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Just over half of responding residents (54 percent) said they are satisfied with the cleanliness of Wellington's streets, while 56 percent think roadside vegetation is well maintained.</p>
        
            <p>Despite poor satisfaction ratings in key areas, Wellington must be doing something right, with high satisfaction scores for culture, events, facilities and transport.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 81 percent of respondents were in agreement that Wellington has a rich and diverse arts scene.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a high level of satisfaction (86 percent) with city council events among attendees.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were happy overall with council facilities like pools (75-95 percent), libraries (80-90 percent) and sports facilities (71-89 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Green and open spaces have a satisfaction rating of 77-88 percent.</p>
        
            <p>There has been a large jump in how easy people feel it is to get around on public transport - from 38 percent last year to 58 percent in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>2023 was a year fraught with bus driver shortages and reduced services.</p>
        
            <p>Over the last three years there has also been a large increase in satisfaction in cycling infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Forty one percent of respondents reported being satisfied with cycling infrastructure, up from 27 percent in 2023 and 17 percent in 2022.</p>
