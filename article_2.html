            <p>The Prime Minister says the government would be open to sending soldiers as peacekeepers in Ukraine if a ceasefire was reached.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that is something we'd be open to, but obviously it's speculative at this point, but we do support a lot of peacekeeping missions around the world and this is something that we would be open to working through," Christopher Luxon told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Since the 1950s, New Zealand has been continuously involved in UN peacekeeping activities. Where have they been based?</p>
        
            <p>As of April, there were about 97 NZ Defence Force (NZDF) personnel deployed throughout Europe as part of Operation Tīeke, which it says contributes to international efforts to assist Ukraine in its self-defence. They are not mandated to enter Ukraine.</p>
