        <h2>Cricket diplomacy key to New Zealand business ties with India</h2>
        <p>
Trade officials see the game as an important part of their outreach efforts with the South Asian nation.
</p>
        
            <p>Amid his whirlwind four-day tour of India, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon managed to squeeze a few overs into an already packed schedule.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon spent his last full day in New Delhi as part of a programme that included a spot of street cricket with children.</p>
        
            <p>The game was a light moment organised by charity group STAIRS that saw the prime minister square off with children, using a stack of bricks as stumps.</p>
        
            <p>Also taking part was former Indian great Kapil Dev, as well as Kiwi cricketers Ross Taylor and Ajaz Patel, who are part of the New Zealand delegation.</p>

            <p>The affair celebrated the rich 70-year history between the two cricketing nations, which first played each other in 1955 when the New Zealand men's team played a five-test series in a newly independent India.</p>
        
            <p>Thirteen years later, the Indian team played a four-test series in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>For a country of more than 5 million, New Zealand has always punched above its weight in the cricketing world.</p>
        
            <p>More importantly, cricketers from New Zealand have acquired a reputation of playing competitive cricket over the years without the spite that sometimes comes from rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Or, in the words of former Indian captain Virat Kohli, Kiwi cricket players are "too nice".</p>
        
            <p>It's why many Indians love them, and why the game is an important part of New Zealand's diplomatic outreach efforts with the South Asian nation.</p>

            <p>Ever since former Black Caps captain Brendon McCullum scored the first-ever Indian Premier League century in 2008, the world's most lucrative cricket franchise tournament has been set ablaze by Kiwi talent over the years.</p>
        
            <p>Be it Corey Anderson, Kane Williamson, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tim Southee, Colin Munro or Tom Latham, New Zealand cricketers have always commanded top dollars at the auctions.</p>
        
            <p>And let's not forget Stephen Fleming, who deserves a special mention.</p>
        
            <p>A much-adored figure in India, the former Black Caps captain is easily the most successful coaches in world T20 cricket, having led Chennai Super Kings to five IPL titles.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's popularity in India was what prompted then-Prime Minister Sir John Key to invite the former opening batting star to accompany his delegation on his first trip to India in 2011.</p>

            <p>McCullum followed in Fleming's footsteps when he joined Key on his second trip to India in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Recognising India's passion for the sport, the Key administration recognised that it was important to foster cricketing ties between the two nations if New Zealand was to expand trade ties.</p>
        
            <p>By inviting Taylor and Patel to join his latest delegation to India, New Zealand trade officials appear to recognise this as well.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the cost of one commercial flight to India and accommodation in New Delhi and Mumbai were covered by the government for Taylor's services. No other payment was provided.</p>
        
            <p>Notably, the appeal that Kiwi cricketers appear to have in India is not only reserved for prime ministerial visits.</p>

            <p>When former left-arm Black Caps bowler Geoff Allott decided to establish Quality New Zealand 12 years ago, he asked other cricketers to be shareholders and ambassadors of the business group, including patron Sir Richard Hadlee, as well as Fleming, McCullum and former spinning star-turned-coach Daniel Vettori.</p>
        
            <p>Quality New Zealand has been selling sheep meat, seafood and dairy in India for more than a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Connections formed on the cricket pitch certainly helped the team gain entry to the market, Allott told RNZ's Country Life earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>"The passion that India has for cricket - it's almost a religion over there - and it certainly opens doors, it starts conversations. It helps build those relationships," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington-based CricHQ, which developed software for scoring cricket matches, is another shining example of cricket diplomacy at work.</p>
        
            <p>McCullum and Fleming founded the company, setting up offices in India in 2013.</p>
