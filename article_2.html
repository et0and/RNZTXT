            <p>A 52-year-old man who caused chaos at Auckland's Albert Park which saw roads shut down and buildings evacuated has been charged with making a false statement.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, police responded to Albert Park after a person made a number of "concerning comments".</p>
        
            <p>Albert Park, as well as buildings on Princes Street and Bowen Lane were evacuated as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>The incident also caused traffic chaos for people leaving the city.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons were lifted when police took the man, who was wanted by police, into custody.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City Central Area Commander Inspector Grant Tetzlaff earlier acknowledged the public's patience.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to acknowledge the public's patience while this incident unfolded, as several evacuations and cordons impacted many people going about their business at the time," Tetzlaff said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continued to engage with the man and these measures were put in place so we could ensure the safety of all."</p>
        
            <p>He was scheduled to appear in Auckland District Court on Thursday.</p>
