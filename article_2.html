            <p>RNZ understands about 130 roles could go at the Department of Conservation, with a number of these already vacant positions.</p>
        
            <p>It is the latest department to learn its fate as part of the government's cost cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 jobs are already set to go across the sector.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation (DOC) staff gathered for a meeting early Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>DOC, which manages nearly a third of New Zealand's total land area, has already had its funding cut this year by 21 percent.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
