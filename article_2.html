            <p>A six-metre-tall statue of a Rangitāne ancestor has been disfigured, with vandals reportedly using tools to cut away its phallus.</p>
        
            <p>The large metal sculpture of the ancient warrior chief Whatonga is a landmark that stands over the forest on the Manawatū Gorge Tawa Loop track, near Ashhurst.</p>
        
            <p>But it had been disfigured in a disrespectful attack, Te Āpiti Manawatū Gorge governance group said.</p>
        
            <p>Those responsible had carted steel-cutting equipment to the top of the track to remove part of the figure, the group said.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Danielle Harris said Whatonga was a significant ancestor of the Rangitane people, and the iwi and other groups were disgusted by the vandalism.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatonga is one of our primary ancestors and the patterns on his statue tell his great story as a chief and explorer. To say we are disgusted to have a part of that story so disrespectfully removed is an understatement.</p>
        
            <p>"It clearly shows the ignorance and lack of understanding by some individuals of art and its place in our world. We encourage those responsible to front up to the act.</p>
        
            <p>"Rangitāne have a whakatauki (proverb) that talks about there being as many Rangitāne people on the land as there are stars in the sky, so this vandalism to Whatonga's reproductive organs is an insult to a belief system we hold precious."</p>
        
            <p>Harris said the vandals should front up.</p>
        
            <p>Te Āpiti Manawatū Gorge governance group would work with iwi to have Whatonga repaired.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatonga is one of the most visually represented icons of the wider Manawatū and Rangitāne - he is photographed by local, national and international visitors, is on the front page of our local paper, greets people at the airport and has featured in many other places. It's really hard to believe that someone would go to so much effort to disfigure him and we share the disappointment of our iwi partners," Te Āpiti Manawatū Gorge chair and Horizons Regional Council councillor Fiona Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were made aware of the damage the day following the vandalism and do not know who is responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"Efforts will be made to restore him to his proper state as soon as possible and we hope those responsible know they will not succeed in diminishing his mana through their premeditated, disrespectful actions."</p>
