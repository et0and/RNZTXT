        <h2>In photos: Tall Ships Regatta in the Bay of Islands</h2>

            <p>More than 70 vessels of all ages, sizes and designs took part in Saturday's Tall Ships Regatta in the Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The annual event is touted as a spectacle of sail rather than a serious race, but that doesn't dim some sailors' determination to take out top honours in its divisions - classic invitational, tall ships, junk rigs and all-comers.</p>
        
            <p>The oldest boat competing this year was Undine, built in Kerikeri in 1877, while the most spectacular under sail was Ōpua-based R Tucker Thompson.</p>
        
            <p>It was R Tucker Thompson's year, with the 60-foot gaff-rigged top sail schooner winning the coveted tall ships trophy for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>The regatta has been hosted by the Russell Boating Club for the past 48 years.</p>
        
            <p>A post-race hāngī at the club's Matauwhi Bay headquarters, catering to 700 hungry sailors, is one of the biggest in the country and is as much a highlight as the race itself.</p>
        
            <p>For the full list of results go to the Russell Boating Club website.</p>
