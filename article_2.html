            <p>The pilot of a helicopter that crashed into the roof of a Far North Queensland hotel has died.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 400 people were evacuated from the DoubleTree by Hilton on Cairns Esplanade after the crash, which set the top of the building alight, shortly before 2am on Monday, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the helicopter's rotor blades came off and landed on the esplanade and in the hotel pool. There were no injuries on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic investigators are working to identify the pilot, who died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Two other patients - a man in his 80s and a woman in her 70s - were taken to Cairns Hospital in a stable condition.</p>

            <p>Hotel guest Alastair Salmon woke up to "a colossal ear-deafening bang". He and roommate Harry Holberton were on the third floor.</p>
        
            <p>Holberton said the crash felt like a bomb going off, with flames "rising up the side of the building".</p>
        
            <p>"Suddenly all the alarms start going off and then (people) start evacuating with police yelling 'get out, get out, get out'."</p>
        
            <p>Salmon, who had travelled from London, said he first mistook the helicopter's rotor blade for a lamppost.</p>
        
            <p>"Then we looked up there and you could see this massive hole in the window of the building," he said.</p>

            <p>The pair were let into the hotel to get their belongings.</p>
        
            <p>"All over the hotel there was debris, parts of a windscreen," Holberton said.</p>
        
            <p>Salmon said he could see "small fragments of what looked like a helicopter" in the hotel's courtyard.</p>
        
            <p>Wayne Leonard, who lives about 100 metres from the hotel, said he woke up to a bang.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very loud - I thought it might have been a tower on top of the building exploding, it was that sort of a sound," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I went and looked out the window I could see huge big flames on the top of the building."</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is sending a team of investigators.</p>
