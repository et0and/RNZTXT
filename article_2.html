            <p>As many as 10 people, including children, have been shot and wounded at a city-run water park near Detroit on Saturday evening, police said, calling the incident random gunfire.</p>
        
            <p>The suspect was still at large late on Saturday, but police said they believed he was cornered in a house nearby. The gun was found at the scene, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A man got out of a vehicle in front of Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad park, in Rochester Hills, Michigan, about 5pm (local time) and fired about 30 shots from a 9mm semiautomatic Glock, reloading several times, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>It was not immediately clear if there were any fatalities, said police, who had initially reported five people shot.</p>
        
            <p>Rochester Hills is about 50km north of Detroit. The neighbouring community Oxford Township, also in Oakland County, was the scene of a 2021 mass school shooting where student Ethan Crumbley, then 15, killed four students and wounded six other students and a teacher at Oxford High School.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a gut punch, obviously, for us here in Oakland County," Bouchard said. "We've gone through so many tragedies, you know. We're not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford."</p>
        
            <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on X, "I am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills."</p>
