            <p>The board of a Northland high school has pleaded guilty to two charges of exposing people to risk of serious injury or death following a caving trip that ended in tragedy last year.</p>
        
            <p>Karnin Petera, who was 15, died after he was swept away by floodwaters during a Whangārei Boys' High School trip to Abbey Caves on 9 May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>During a brief hearing in the Whangārei District Court on Monday afternoon, the school board's lawyer Marie Wisker entered guilty pleas to both charges laid by WorkSafe.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Gene Tomlinson set a sentencing date of 27 September and directed the entire day be set aside, starting at 10am.</p>
        
            <p>He also ordered restorative justice be offered to all victims named in the court documents, including the 14 other boys on the trip and two workers.</p>
        
            <p>The two workers were granted interim name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Tomlinson started the hearing with a minute's silence, which he said was "in light of Karnin's passing and the solemnity of the matters here today".</p>
        
            <p>The hearing was attended by 10 members of Karnin's whānau, including his parents Alicia Toki and Andre Petera.</p>
        
            <p>They did not wish to comment after the hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyers for WorkSafe and the school board appeared via audio-visual link.</p>
        
            <p>The charges, as laid under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, are:</p>

            <p>As earlier reported by RNZ, 15 students and two adults entered the cave during the outdoor education trip.</p>
        
            <p>All but one managed to get out or were rescued.</p>
        
            <p>Karnin's body was recovered about 9pm that evening by a search and rescue team working in extremely difficult conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The caves, which are just 5km northwest of Whangārei's city centre, have been closed to the public ever since.</p>
        
            <p>A risk assessment carried out before the trip stated Abbey Caves were prone to flooding in heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>It recommended postponing the trip if water levels were too high.</p>
        
            <p>The trip went ahead, despite Northland being subject to a MetService orange rain warning at the time.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe's two charges were filed against the legal entity of the school board, not individual board members.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei Boys' High principal Karen Smith sent a letter to parents when the charges were first laid, writing: "Our thoughts remain with the whānau of Karnin Petera, his friends, our school whānau, the wider Whangārei community and everyone who has been touched by this tragedy."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said the school had worked closely with WorkSafe throughout the investigation, and had developed and implemented new outdoor education policies following the tragedy.</p>
