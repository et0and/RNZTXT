            <p>Authorities in New York state are "closely monitoring" an incident on the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls and state agencies are on site, New York Governor Kathy Hocul said in a post on X on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Local media WIVB reported earlier that all four international border crossings between the United States and Canada in Western New York were closed Wednesday due to an incident involving a vehicle at the Rainbow Bridge. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.</p>
        
            <p>Border agency officials in the United States had no immediate comment, while their Canadian counterparts did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
