            <p>The Shaun Johnson farewell tour stopped off in Sydney on Friday night and departs on another losing note.</p>
        
            <p>It has become a familiar feeling for the Warriors in 2024, who came close but ultimately not close enough as Manly shut them out 24-10.</p>
        
            <p>A mathematical miracle was required for the Warriors to sneak into an unlikely play-off spot, but that equation was answered and now even the most faithful fan's hopes are officially quashed.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors were well in the contest at halftime with the scores all square at 10-all, but a downpour in the second 40 led to a flood of handling errors which kept them score-less and allowed Sea Eagles to snatch the victory.</p>
        
            <p>Manly fullback Tom Trbojevic told Fox Sports the Warriors gave a brave fight.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a weird one, we weren't good enough in the first half, but it was a bit of wet weather footy we weren't expecting and so good to get the win."</p>
        
            <p>The win moves the Sea Eagles closer to the top four, while it leaves the Warriors languishing near the bottom of the table in 14th.</p>

            <p>Manly kicked the scoring off after 10 minutes through winger Jason Saab. Adam Pompey was denied a four-pointer after the centre crashed over, but an early obstruction was detected.</p>
        
            <p>However, Johnson's effort would not be scrubbed as the mercurial halfback was fed a superb offload from Addin Fonua-Blake who had broken through the line.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson was then half of a poor defensive read which allowed Tom Trbojevic to waltz through and regain the lead.</p>
        
            <p>But again the visitors responded, a trademark flying try in the corner for Dallin Watene-Zalezniak to square things up at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Manly reasserted their advantage shortly after oranges, Daly Cherry Evans sending one to the heavens and Ruben Garrick beating Marcelo Montoya in the air to score.</p>
        
            <p>The skies then opened and heavy rain fell on 4 Pine Park, forcing several handling errors.</p>
        
            <p>As the mistakes compounded for the Warriors, Manly eventually took advantage to put the result to bed, Lehi Hopoate with the crucial blow.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors return to Mount Smart next weekend for their final home game of the year against the Bulldogs and a final chance for fans to pay tribute to one of the club's GOATS.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers:</p>
        
            <p>Sea Eagles 24 (Saab, Trbojevic, Garrick, Hopoate tries, Garrick, 4 goals)</p>
        
            <p>Warriors 10 (Johnson, Watene-Zalezniak, tries, Metcalf, 1 goals)</p>
