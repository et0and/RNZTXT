            <p>The highest priced filly ever sold in New Zealand has become the talk of the annual Karaka yearling sales.</p>
        
            <p>The Savabeel-sired filly sold for an eye-watering $2.4 million dollars following competitive bidding at the auctionhouse south of Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>She was also a full sister to a champion three-year-old named Orchestral who won the million-dollar race at Ellerslie last weekend, after winning last year's $1.5m Karaka Million 3YO.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Bloodstock managing director Andrew Seabrook said the sale of the young filly set the sale alight.</p>
        
            <p>"Not in anyone's wildest dreams did we think that she would make 2.4 [million dollars]," Seabrook said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a highest price for a filly ever sold in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>He said the buzz and atmosphere at the sales was "absolutely amazing".</p>
        
            <p>"People wanted to break out and clap loudly when the hammer came down," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Scoring the highest price for a yearling in 25 years, the filly was sold to a Christchurch buyer who planned to take the horse to the stables of leading Australian thoroughbred trainer Chris Waller in Sydney to continue her career.</p>
        
            <p>"She's the daughter of Savabeel, who has been the leading sire in New Zealand for over 10 years," Seabrook said.</p>
        
            <p>He said interest from New Zealand and Australian buyers had been strong recently, with buyers from South Africa, Japan, England, the Netherlands and Hong Kong also bringing their chequebooks.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really pleased how it's how it's held up and given the weak economy, it's amazing how resilient this industry is."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Bloodstock said it was on track to hit $80m of turnover which was on par with last year's successful sale.</p>
