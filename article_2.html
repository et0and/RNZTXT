            <p>Analysis - At times, his achilles injury was so bad he struggled to walk around his own house, but Shaun Johnson hasn't yet made up his mind on his future in the NRL.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking candidly to friend and co-host Brook Ruscoe on his new podcast Play On Sports Show, the crowd favourite Warriors halfback pledged his allegiance to the club, saying it would feel wrong pulling on another team's colours - despite offers from the West Tigers last year and the Sydney Roosters this year.</p>
        
            <p>"If I think about performing at a high level and wanting to put my body through everything that you've got to put it through to play in the NRL, the thought of winning in another team's colours just does not sit right with me at all," he said. "Ultimately having success and bringing the first premiership to the Warriors is all I have left to do."</p>
        
            <p>But the 33-year-old number 7 admits he has struggled this season and now, out injured and weighing up his future, he is watching the team play better without him.</p>
        
            <p>"The hardest part about it is I still love the sport so much. I still feel like if I'm healthy I can compete at the highest level… [but] I'm not the only one involved in this decision," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a team that are playing really well without me - so that's a factor. There is, damn, I am really enjoying being able to walk down my stairs at the moment. I'm enjoying getting out of bed and not hobbling. I feel like I can breathe again.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's also the part where, If I'm sitting at home next year and I'm watching the boys go to work… I don't know how that makes me feel."</p>
        
            <p>While "conversations are happening", there is currently no contract offer on the table for the Warriors for next year.</p>
        
            <p>With time running out, here are some of the possible scenarios, barriers and potential outcomes for the future of the beloved Mt Smart custodian:</p>

            <p>It's no secret that Johnson has always been a proud family man; last year proved how powerful finally being close to his loved ones can be - it's a key factor that resulted in one of the best seasons in a Warriors jersey we've ever seen.</p>
        
            <p>After the likes of the brutal isolation from friends and family felt during the Warriors Covid-19 stint in Australia along with his three years at the Sharks away from family - you'd be hard pushed to see him leave New Zealand any time soon it seems.</p>
        
            <p>Say Johnson doesn't leave and wants to stay on in Auckland, see out the rest of his league days as a Warrior - no matter how long that may be fans and pundits alike will applaud his commitment to the club he cherishes so much.</p>
        
            <p>But the reality is; he faces the serious prospect of not only a potential pay cut but - at this point in time - slides down the pecking order as first choice starting halfback goes with the likes of Te Maire Martin and Chanel Harris-Tavita playing good footy at the moment, not to mention the return of the recently resigned Luke Metcalf who was electric last season.</p>
        
            <p>Having admitted the team is performing without him, would Johnson be comfortable playing NSW cup for one of the first times in his career in Auckland? On top of that, could he prove everyone wrong and play his way back into the first grade side? Time will tell.</p>

            <p>Having turned down presumably high-paying options to play in Leichhardt with the Wests Tigers this year - or to be sitting pretty on the beaches of Bondi with one of the richest NRL clubs the Sydney Roosters next year - it's clear that the man can't betray his club running out in the colours of another team.</p>
        
            <p>In the NRL at least it seems… The Super League's Catlan Dragons are definitely on the look out for some new players - maybe a sabbatical for Johnson and the family in France is on the cards?</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors stand apart as a club by having a rich history of involving former players in the make up of the club's administration, media and coaching staff.</p>
        
            <p>Stacey Jones served as an assistant and interim head coach, Jerry Seuseu and Ben Henry in player wellness roles and Adam Blair is the U20's SG ball coach. They all spring to mind as legends of the club who have gone on to play crucial roles in the organisation and it seems like this would be a perfect pathway for Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>It's clear his passion, energy and enthusiasm still burns for the club, and his experience and wisdom would be amazing for younger players coming up through the grades into professional environments like he once did.</p>
