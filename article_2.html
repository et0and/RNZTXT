        <h2>What's causing a spate of rubbish truck fires?</h2>
        <p>
Residents are being told off for inadvertently causing rubbish truck fires.
</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council said there were at least two fires a week at the region's recycling centre with the cause most often being battery-powered devices and batteries being disposed of incorrectly.</p>
        
            <p>Five rubbish and recycling truck fires had caught fire in the first two weeks of 2025 alone.</p>
        
            <p>Waste Solutions general manager, Justine Haves, said people needed to understand putting e-waste in kerbside bins created a fire hazard.</p>
        
            <p>"Electronic devices and batteries can be recycled in most cases, but they contain hazardous substances so require specialist handling.</p>
        
            <p>Damaged or crushed, lithium-ion batteries could ignite during the waste collection process.</p>
        
            <p>Haves encouraged people to use takeback and drop-off schemes run by retailers and community recycling centres.</p>
        
            <p>"Making use of battery and e-waste drop-off options helps keep you and our staff safe, keeps harmful materials out of the environment, and helps us recover and reuse valuable resources."</p>

            <p>In December 2024, the council said almost 600 laptops and over 300 12-volt batteries found their way to Auckland's recycling facility, in what appeared to be a pre-Christmas offload by Aucklanders.</p>
        
            <p>It said batteries were not the only fire hazards placed in bins.</p>
        
            <p>A half-full 40kg LPG bottle and a partially full jerry can of petrol were discovered by recycling truck drivers in January.</p>
        
            <p>Over 300 LPG bottles and gas canisters were found in the past six months at the Auckland recycling facility.</p>
        
            <p>To mitigate the dangers of rubbish truck fires, the council's Waste Solutions team were testing an early warning system for truck drivers experiencing a fire and options for extinguishing a fire inside a truck.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, drivers were required to first notify their supervisor, who contacted Fire and Emergency, before finding a safe clear place to empty their load if they noticed a fire coming from their truck.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the new system would reduce the potential for environmental contamination when the load was tipped out for Fire and Emergency responders to extinguish.</p>
