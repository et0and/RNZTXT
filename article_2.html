            <p>Four award-winning authors are in the running for the $65,000 fiction prize at this year's Ockham Book Awards.</p>
        
            <p>Birnam Wood author Eleanor Catton, Lioness author Emily Perkins, Audition author Pip Adam, and A Better Place author Stephen Daisley are finalists for New Zealand's top fiction award.</p>
        
            <p>"They've all won this award once before, and I can't think of another year where there have been previous winners coming back and they're all up against each other," NZ Book Awards Trust chair Nicola Legat said.</p>
        
            <p>"Often you find that writers are always great friends, so I'm sure they're feeling... they'd love to win but they'd also love to see their friends win too."</p>
        
            <p>The four novelists are joined by 12 more authors competing for poetry and non-fiction awards.</p>
        
            <p>"There's four main categories: fiction, poetry, general non-fiction and illustrated non-fiction, and there's also four 'best first book' awards in those same categories," Legat said.</p>
        
            <p>The finalists were chosen at the end of a months-long selection process.</p>
        
            <p>"There were about 150 books in the long-list, then that came down to 44 [for the short-list]," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"[The judges] started in about August last year. It's been an enormous amount of reading for them, often the books are read by them many times as they go through their processes to whittle it down."</p>
        
            <p>The winners will be announced at the 2024 Auckland Writers Festival in May and take home a share of the total $140,000 prize pool.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest prize is of course the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction which is an amazing $65,000," Legat said.</p>
        
            <p>Selecting an overall best book was a lengthy and challenging process for the judges.</p>
        
            <p>"It's literary excellence in the main... is this book beautifully crafted? Is it a strong narrative? How profound is this book? It's very difficult for the judges because the standard of fiction in New Zealand at the moment is so incredibly high," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more than just a story, there is something about the craft of being a novelist shining through."</p>
        
            <p>At the end of the day, Legat said the win would be decided by a gut feeling.</p>
        
            <p>"The judges, in the end, they've read the books over and over again. I would imagine [the winner] is the book that lingers with you, you just know."</p>
        
            <p>Four more awards were open to first-time authors. Legat said avid readers should take note of the emerging talent in those categories.</p>
        
            <p>"Often for writers who win that award it's the start of a great career trajectory. Eleanor Catton won that award for her very first novel, it's kind of a launching pad," Legat said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's quite a bit of pedigree. The winners are often a who's who of New Zealand writers."</p>
        
            <p>She said the variety and quality of the finalists showed the strength of Aotearoa's literature industry.</p>
        
            <p>"[The industry] is in really good heart. There's just been the most amazing amount of publishing, the audiences at writers festivals remain really strong," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still enormous interest in books and our New Zealand authors are becoming quite famous national figures."</p>
