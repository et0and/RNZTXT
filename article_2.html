            <p>Mandating Whangārei District Council fluoridation is being slammed as a "despotic Soviet-era disgrace" by New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>Director-General of Health Dr Diana Sarfati is requiring Whangārei District Council (WDC) fluoridates its drinking water for 80,000 people by 28 March.</p>
        
            <p>WDC this week reaffirmed its 28 November refusal to fluoridate - in spite of Sarfati's sternly written email to the council on 30 January indicating "potentially heavy penalties upon any conviction by a court" for refusing the order.</p>
        
            <p>In her letter, Sarfati said it was an offence under the Health Act 1956 for a local authority to contravene a direction.</p>
        
            <p>Sarfati on Friday announced her resignation, effective this Friday.</p>

            <p>Lawyers have warned councillors of the risk of imprisonment for refusing to comply with the 28 March fluoridation deadline.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei Mayor Vince Cocurullo said he would go to prison over the principle of democratic freedom and the community being able to make its own fluoridation choice, rather than being directed to do so by one person.</p>
        
            <p>"It is chilling that we have got to a point in New Zealand where elected politicians are being threatened with imprisonment just for doing their jobs, standing up for democracy and asking for a vote," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not a matter of being pro-fluoride or anti-fluoride. It is a matter of what New Zealanders see and value as democracy in our country.</p>
        
            <p>"Individual democratically elected councillors are not only being threatened with huge fines, they are now being threatened with imprisonment - all for disagreeing with a foolish law change and forcing Wellington-based bureaucrats to act.</p>

            <p>Deputy Director-General of Health Dr Andrew Old said Parliament had considered the issue of community water fluoridation and in 2021 passed reforms to empower the director-general of health to direct local authorities to fluoridate their water supplies.</p>
        
            <p>Old said over 60 years of international and New Zealand research showed community water fluoridation was a safe, effective and affordable way to improve oral health.</p>
        
            <p>Local Democracy Reporting Northland asked Sarfati whether her handling of WDC fluoridation (including her strongly-worded letter to the council), and the 13 other councils also directed to fluoridate nationally had led to her resignation.</p>
        
            <p>Old said in response that her resignation was not related to WDC's fluoridation directive or the Ministry of Health's approach to fluoridation nationally.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry of Health continues to work with the Whangārei District Council to encourage compliance with its direction to fluoridate the water supplies in Bream Bay and Whangārei."</p>

            <p>Cocurullo said on Sarfati's resignation that his council's fluoridation directive refusal would have been but one of a number of major issues she had been dealing with in her role.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't say our council's fluoridation refusal is the reason why she is leaving," Cocurullo said.</p>
        
            <p>Cocurullo has been a vocal critic of the director-general of health since 2021 having the sole power to make a fluoridation decision for councils around New Zealand.</p>

            <p>New Zealand First introduced a Member's Bill the day after the WDC meeting aimed at returning flouridation decision-making power to local communities.</p>
        
            <p>"All the council is fighting for is to have a referendum on the matter so locals can have a voice," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Fluoridation (Referendum) Legislation Bill' seeks to repeal the Health (Fluoridation of Drinking Water) Amendment Act 2021 that granted centralised authority to the director-general of health and mandated the fluoridation of local water supplies.</p>
        
            <p>It will also amend the Local Government Act 2002 and Health Act 1956 mandating local authorities to hold a binding referendum on water fluoridation.</p>
        
            <p>"This bill reinstates the fundamental right for communities to determine through democracy whether or not their water supply is fluoridated," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>He would not comment on Sarfati's resignation.</p>
