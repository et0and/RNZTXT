            <p>Police have voiced concerns about a planned new unit to investigate harm to children in state care, while the children's commissioner has hopes it could prove pivotal to real change towards better protections.</p>
        
            <p>A new Child Protection Investigation Unit to "rigourously' investigate reports of harm was announced by Minister for Children Karen Chhour on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>She said the Abuse in State Care Royal Commission of Inquiry - which released its final report in July showing that at least 200,000 people had been abused while in state care - showed the risk of not acting immediately on serious concerns and complaints about the care provided for children.</p>
        
            <p>The unit was one of the royal commission's 138 recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>However, documents obtained by RNZ under the Official Information Act showed internal communication and advice to the minister of police showed police had worries the recommendation could undermine their independence, and that the results could be better achieved in other ways.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they believed their organisation could implement a dozen other recommendations in three to five years.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson told RNZ the police executive would be considering the specialist unit before the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Children's Commissioner Claire Achmad told RNZ she hoped the unit would support meaningful change.</p>
        
            <p>The investigators would help Oranga Tamariki identify compromises to children's safety throughout the care system.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm keep to see it support real change, so that every child and young person who is in the care of Oranga Tamariki is safe," Achmad said.</p>
        
            <p>"Setting up this unit is a welcome step in the right direction."</p>
        
            <p>The unit would operate independently, but within Oranga Tamariki, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope it will lead to improved accountability, and ultimately over time I hope that it will play a really strong role in guarding against no more children or young people in care experiencing abuse or harm."</p>
        
            <p>Achmad has labelled the abuse experienced by children and young people in state care as "a national shame".</p>
        
            <p>Commenting on the official Crown apology to survivors of abuse in care, which followed the final report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry, she said the public statement had been an important step.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to be a nation where all children and young people are safe in the care of their whānau, and where all of their rights are fulfilled, so they grow up free from all forms of violence and harm. We have a long way to go to make this a reality, but it is absolutely achievable, through collective, concerted action.</p>
        
            <p>"This moment must lead to action that makes real change for children and young people in the care of the State. I want to see immediate and ongoing efforts that will give effect to this apology."</p>
