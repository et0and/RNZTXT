            <p>Many local roads remain closed in flooded parts of Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty are closed in and around Dunedin, and the city council says the Port Chalmers highway, State Highway 88, will stay closed until at least Monday because of a large landslip at Māia, and another near Parry Street.</p>
        
            <p>To the south, in Clutha District, the Coast Road on the Milton side of Toko Mouth remains closed because of an unstable slip - residents of Toko Mouth still cut off.</p>
        
            <p>Other closed roads included a section of Kaka Point Road where it crossed the Puerua River.</p>
        
            <p>The council said a cut had been made through the sandbar on the Pūerua River to lower the water level on the road and help drain affected paddocks.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors in Dunedin will be resuming inspections around the city on Sunday to assess the damage from the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Nine properties have been red-stickered as unsafe to live in.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 50 buildings were inspected on Saturday. Otago Civil Defence controller Rob West said more could be if more slips were found.</p>
        
            <p>The welfare centre at Forsyth Barr Stadium closed on Saturday night after temporary accommodation was found for some remaining flood evacuees.</p>

            <p>Some communities were under boil-water notices because of the risk of flood contamination.</p>
        
            <p>In Dunedin, this included Māia, Roseneath, Sawyer's Bay, Port Chalmers, Carey's Bay and Deborah Bay, residents of which were also asked to conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>For Outram, Waikouaiti, Karitane and Hawksbury, the city council said the tap water was safe to drink but people were asked to conserve it.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the suburb of Maia were being asked to conserve water because a pipe had been affected by a large landslide, and just a day's worth of water was left in reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Engineers were looking to replace a 500m-long section of the pipe.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got tankers out there and we're gonna be using an alternative water supply, which is already up and running - but we're just doing some testing to make sure that the water is OK for people to use," Otago Civil Defence controller Rob West said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the meantime, people on the West Harbour have a boil water notice as a precautionary measure."</p>
        
            <p>West said there was no timeframe on when the slip would be cleared, as it was still being assessed.</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, Stirling and Tapanui had boil-water notices.</p>
        
            <p>The Clutha District Council said because all the region's rivers were discoloured, water was taking longer to treat to a drinkable standard, so all residents should try to conserve it.</p>
        
            <p>Several of Clutha's wastewater systems had been overflowing.</p>
        
            <p>A red heavy rain alert for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha was lifted Friday night, and there had been no warnings or watches put in place since.</p>
        
            <p>The MetService forecast for Dunedin on Sunday was "fine, then cloud increasing this afternoon with the chance of a shower or two this evening. Light winds, afternoon northeasterlies."</p>
