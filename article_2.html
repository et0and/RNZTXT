            <p>The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade is heading to London to take over as Acting High Commissioner following Phil Goff's sacking.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters removed Goff from his post as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, after comments he made about US President Donald Trump at a Chatham House event in London.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said Goff's conduct was not the way a diplomat should behave, and left his position "untenable".</p>
        
            <p>Chris Seed, who left MFAT just over a year ago, will serve as Acting High Commissioner while the search continues for a permanent option. He will travel to London late next week.</p>
        
            <p>He previously served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to Australia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said Seed was one of New Zealand's "most senior and accomplished diplomats."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile Goff will return to New Zealand this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Peters acknowledged the difficulty of the decision and wished Goff well, saying he would be held in "high esteem".</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Goff has contributed significantly to the interests of our country over a long period of time.</p>
        
            <p>"As a senior minister with a range of domestic and internationally focused portfolios, mayor of Auckland, and then as a diplomat, Mr Goff has dedicated his professional life to serving the New Zealand people. We continue to hold him in high esteem, and we wish him well."</p>
        
            <p>An announcement will be made in due course about a permanent replacement, once approval has been received from the UK Government.</p>
