        <h2>'So much variation' in teacher training courses - ERO</h2>
        <p>
An Education Review Office report found graduates from some universities felt better prepared than others, as did those from courses that involved more time in the classroom.

            <p>The Education Review Office says too many new teachers feel poorly prepared for their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>In a report published on Monday, the review office said 60 percent of the principals it interviewed said their new teachers were not ready.</p>
        
            <p>The report also found graduates from some universities felt better prepared than others, as did those from courses that involved more time in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>It called for an exit exam for graduating teachers, higher entry standards, and a push to attract the most academically able students.</p>
        
            <p>It also recommended the Teaching Council review the effectiveness of different teaching courses.</p>
        
            <p>ERO's Education Evaluation Centre head Ruth Shinoda said some new teachers were unprepared in key areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Concerningly, we have found that new teachers are not prepared in key areas that really matter.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, over a third of teachers said they were not able to manage classroom behaviour when they started in the role and a third of new primary school teachers said they were unprepared to teach science.</p>
        
            <p>"We are particularly concerned that there is so much variation in the quality of teacher education across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Some courses are setting up teachers well, but we need all courses to do this. ERO has found that over a quarter of new teachers say their teacher education was ineffective."</p>
        
            <p>The report recommended ensuring teacher education programmes included more of the knowledge and skills teachers need in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>It said they should better prepare teachers to adapt their teaching to different students, use assessment, work with parents and whānau, and manage challenging behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The report said teachers who had achieved an excellence endorsement in NCEA Level 3 when they were at school were twice as likely to stay in teaching for five years or longer.</p>
        
            <p>It also found Māori teachers were more likely to feel ready to manage classroom behaviour and more likely to stay in the role.</p>
        
            <p>The report said half of the new primary teachers it surveyed were on fixed-term contracts in their first year of work.</p>
        
            <p>It said they needed greater stability and the Education Ministry should consider guaranteeing employment for newly graduated teachers working toward full registration.</p>
