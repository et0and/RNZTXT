            <p>Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and died of heart disease and other factors likely days after his wife, Betsy Arakawa, died of a rare syndrome spread by mice, according to autopsy results released on Friday in New Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>The 95-year-old Oscar-winning actor, 64-year-old Arakawa, and one of their dogs were found dead on 26 February in separate rooms of their Santa Fe home.</p>
        
            <p>Hackman's heart disease and the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome that caused Arakawa's death were announced at a press conference at the Santa Fe Sheriff's office.</p>
        
            <p>Hackman's wife died days before he did, results showed. A reporter asked Sheriff Adan Mendoza if Hackman's Alzheimer's had hindered him from perceiving her death.</p>
        
            <p>"I would assume that is the case," Mendoza told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased," Heather Jarrell, chief medical investigator at the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>Arakawa is believed to have died around 11 February, authorities said on Friday, citing the date of the last email she sent.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the sheriff told reporters that a pathologist determined the last signal from Hackman's pacemaker was from 17 February, making it likely that was the last day of the actor's life.</p>
        
            <p>Hantavirus is a rare disease in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. In northern New Mexico the virus is spread by droppings and urine of deer mice. The virus is often transmitted through the air when people sweep out sheds or clean closets where mice have been living.</p>
        
            <p>Hackman and Arakawa, a pianist, called Santa Fe home since the 1980s and were active in the city's art community and culinary scene. In recent years, the couple were seen less often in town as his health deteriorated. They lived a very private life before their deaths, Mendoza said.</p>
        
            <p>A caretaker at their gated community discovered the couple dead. Sheriff's deputies found Hackman in the kitchen. Arakawa and a dog were found in a bathroom.</p>
        
            <p>Both Hackman and Arakawa appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor and neither showed signs of blunt force trauma.</p>
        
            <p>One door was found ajar at the back of the house. Two of the couple's surviving dogs had used it to move in and out of the house, Mendoza said.</p>
        
            <p>Hackman, a former Marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.</p>
        
            <p>He earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde. He won an Oscar for best actor in 1972 for his portrayal of detective Popeye Doyle in The French Connection, and in 1993 won an Oscar for best supporting actor for Unforgiven.</p>
