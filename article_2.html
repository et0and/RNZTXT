            <p>The All Whites have drawn 1-1 with the USA in their football friendly in Cincinnati.</p>
        
            <p>It follows New Zealand's 3-0 loss to Mexico at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides had scoring opportunities and it was the 16th ranked Americans that probably deserved the win.</p>
        
            <p>However a freak goal from Ben Waine in the 88th minute gave the 94th ranked Kiwis a draw.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand started a lot stronger than they did against the Mexican managing to press the Americans and control the midfield.</p>

            <p>However the homeside grew into the game and Ricardo Pepi managed to put the ball in the back of the net in the 20th minute before it was disallowed for a foul in the build-up.</p>
        
            <p>Liberato Cacace forced a save from the US keeper in the 38th minute, while Elijah Just did the same in the 56th minute.</p>
        
            <p>It took US star and AC Milan attacking midfielder Christian Pulisic to break the deadlock with a well taken goal in the 69th minute.</p>
        
            <p>As substitutes were made the intensity fell slightly and the US managed to control the tempo of the game and looked to play out for the win.</p>
        
            <p>They appeared to have achieved that until the final couple of minutes when Waine followed up a long ball and deflected a US clearance into the home sides net much to the dismay of the American players and fans.</p>

            <p>New Zealand were under pressure as 12 minutes of time was added, but they held on for the draw.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Darren Bazeley made four changes to the starting line-up that lost to Mexico with Nando Pijnaker and Finn Surman replacing Michael Boxall and Tommy Smith in defence, while Elijah Just and Alex Rufer replaced Kosta Barbarouses and Ben Old.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood regained the captain's armband from Boxall who went onto the bench.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had played the USA three times previously, losing two of them and drawing once.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites start their Oceania World Cup qualifying campaign in October.</p>
