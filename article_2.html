            <p>The Warriors are back in action in a trial match against the Sharks, with more than a few interesting position choices for coach Andrew Webster to think over. Top of mind will be the halves in the post-Shaun Johnson era, as well as the best make up of a typically physical forward pack.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off is at 9:30pm NZT.</p>
