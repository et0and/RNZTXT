            <p>Dairy giant Fonterra is proposing cutting jobs at its Waikato headquarters as it outsources labour to overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, finance staff at the central Hamilton office were informed about proposed changes as part of an operating model review for the dairy co-operative.</p>
        
            <p>Its incoming chief finance officer Andrew Murray said part of the proposed changes to finance operations included outsourcing work to India and the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] includes co-sourcing elements of our transactional work with an existing partner who has facilities in Bangalore and Manila," Murray said.</p>
        
            <p>"The changes... relate to us optimising core operational efficiency to support the entire business."</p>
        
            <p>He said the proposed changes aimed to create financial value for its farmer shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Federated Farmers dairy chairperson Matthew Zonderop said he understood the desire to put money back into pockets of their farmer-shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the end of the day, there's a smarter way to do that than outsourcing those jobs offshore," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the New Zealand co-operative should support staff locally.</p>
        
            <p>"We should be keeping that money in New Zealand. I mean that's what this company is; it's New Zealand-built, New Zealand-made."</p>
        
            <p>He questioned why the co-operative would outsource to staff outside of New Zealand - especially considering new technologies that were available.</p>
        
            <p>"There's plenty of technology available now to be able to keep those jobs in New Zealand. If it's just accounting, you can do that with AI, Microsoft Co-pilot chat, GDP."</p>
        
            <p>Furthermore, later in the year, 51 roles at the region's Waitoa and Te Rapa sites will also be impacted by the closure of four plants from October - though some will be redeployed and some are already vacant.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the proposals ends on Friday.</p>
