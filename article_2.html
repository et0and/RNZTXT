        <h2>Heavy rain forecast for South Island mid-next week</h2>
        <p>
The West Coast is to bear the brunt of the strong northerly winds and dumping of rain that is likely to reach warning levels, the MetService says.

            <p>Heavy rain is forecast for the western parts of the South Island in the middle of next week, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>"We have this system over the east coast of Australia that is moving towards New Zealand," said MetService meteorologist Alec Holden.</p>
        
            <p>He said forecasts showed it would impact "the West Coast of the South Island most, such as Westland", however north and south of the area could also be affected.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there was a high confidence of rain for central and southern parts of Westland to reach warning levels.</p>
        
            <p>There was a moderate confidence for rain to reach warning levels in northern Fiordland, including spillover into the headwaters of Otago and Canterbury lakes and rivers.</p>

            <p>As for rain in other areas of Fiordland, south of Bligh Sound and also in Grey and Buller, there was a low confidence of reaching severe weather levels, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Those in exposed inland parts of the South Island from north Canterbury to central Otago could also experience severe north to northwest gales, with a low confidence of the wind reaching warning levels, said the MetService.</p>
