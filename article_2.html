        <h2>Borrow a granny and go and see Thelma. Neither of you will regret it</h2>
        <p>
Thelma is the year's least-likely action hero on a mission to get back the money she lost to scammers. Audio

            <p>Starring 93-year-old force of nature called June Squibb, she's out long past her bedtime, and she's not going back empty handed.</p>
        
            <p>Thelma succeeds because it didn't realise it was meant to be a cosy, old folks feel-good movie. It thought it was a Mission Impossible action film. So why not be both?</p>
        
            <p>Squibb finally hit the big time in 2014 with an award-winning performance in Nebraska, and since then has been in more than 50 films and TV shows. But this is her first time with her name above the title.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, there really is a Thelma Post - the widow of Hollywood director Ted Post, who made some pretty good cop movies back in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>Thelma is also the grandmother of the director of this film, Josh Margolin. And she really was the victim of a heartless scam.</p>
        
            <p>The real-life Thelma was stopped before she sent off thousands of dollars. But it got Margolin thinking - what if she hadn't been? What could she do?</p>
        
            <p>Thereby hangs this tale - that, and a reminder that the star of the world's most successful action franchise Mission Impossible is no spring chicken himself.</p>
        
            <p>What if Thelma decided to take on this scammer the same way Tom Cruise and the Missions Impossible gang would? The first thing she's going to need is a team, right?</p>
        
            <p>But what do you do when your usual crew are dead or institutionalised?</p>
        
            <p>Fortunately, Thelma thinks of the very man. I'll give you a clue. Who's the cat who won't drop out when there's danger all about?</p>
        
            <p>It's private eye Shaft, of course, or rather actor Richard Roundtree who played him in the movie. He may no longer be a "sex machine to all the chicks", but there's one thing Thelma's friend Ben has got, and that's wheels - a mobility scooter for two.</p>
        
            <p>So that's a reluctant sidekick and a slightly low-powered vehicle sorted out. Next, they need some firepower.</p>
        
            <p>Thelma remembers her old friend Mona usually has a gun on top of her bedroom wardrobe. Time to go calling.</p>
        
            <p>The next scene is pure Mission Impossible. While Ben distracts Mona, Thelma has to race up the stairs with Lalo Schifrin-type music pulsing underneath.</p>
        
            <p>She climbs up on the bed, dislodges the pistol, gets off the bed and makes her getaway - no mean feat for a 93-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>I should tell you, Squibb does most of her own stunts, apparently. Just like Tom Cruise.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Thelma's family belatedly notice she's gone missing - along with Ben and his scooter.</p>
        
            <p>Stopping only for an extended family bicker, they take off after the world's oldest action heroes. The clock is clearly ticking.</p>
        
            <p>But Thelma and Ben are way ahead of them as they hunt down the scammer's address. All they have to do now is wait for him to show himself.</p>
        
            <p>And we're delighted to see that, like most action-movie villains, this one's an elderly Brit, Malcolm McDowell.</p>
        
            <p>Our slightly shop-soiled Doctor Evil may whine that he's just trying to survive in these troublous times, but Thelma sees right through him.</p>
        
            <p>Thelma is huge fun, and while it cheerfully ticks all the action genre boxes, it gives itself room for some notes on aging, on friendship and independence.</p>
        
            <p>I lived with people all my life, says Thelma. I'm rather enjoying being on my own for a while.</p>
        
            <p>For a film so clearly targeting the over-eighties, it's the most purely entertaining film I've seen in ages.</p>
        
            <p>Squibb has waited long enough for her spotlight. And when she got it, she knew exactly what to do with it.</p>
        
            <p>Borrow a granny and go and see Thelma. Neither of you will regret it.</p>
