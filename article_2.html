        <h2>'Bloodbath': Loss of third top health boss a huge blow, doctors say</h2>
        <p>
The sector is now in a perilous position after the resignation of Director-General of Health Diana Sarfati, doctors and colleagues say.
</p>
        
            <p>The resignation of Director-General of Health Diana Sarfati is "a huge blow" and leaves the health sector in a "perilous" position, doctors, unions and those who worked closely with her say.</p>
        
            <p>In a written statement released by the Ministry of Health, she said she appreciated "the privilege, and responsibility that has come with leading the Ministry of Health during a time of significant change within the sector".</p>
        
            <p>"It is now time to allow someone new to take up the mantle of one of the most challenging and rewarding roles within the health sector."</p>
        
            <p>Having made the decision to go, she had decided to "leave promptly", and her final day would be next Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"The challenge of restructuring and unifying an entire health system is not to be underestimated. I want to acknowledge the incredible people who I have worked with across the sector who give their all every day."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at the Tōtara Haumaru North Shore Hospital campus on Friday, Health Minister Simeon Brown said Dr Sarfati called him on Thursday to tell him of her decision and he "wished her all the best".</p>
        
            <p>Asked why so many top health officials had resigned under his watch, he said "these people have made their own decisions".</p>
        
            <p>"I've made it clear we need the right people in all positions so New Zealanders can get timely, quality healthcare.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a lot of upheaval in the sector in terms of the last government's reforms, and I'm focused on getting back to ensuring the healthcare system is delivering for patients."</p>
        
            <p>Brown declined to be drawn on why the Director-General of Health was allowed to quit with just one week's notice, saying that was a question for the Public Service Commission.</p>
        
            <p>However, he hit back at Labour's criticism that the Government was tearing apart the health system and undermining its leadership, saying the Opposition needed to "look in the mirror".</p>
        
            <p>"Labour tore apart the entire health infrastructure by restructing health system during a pandemic - they got rid of the five health targets that focused on patients and focused on health bureaucracy."</p>
        
            <p>It comes days after the sudden resignation of Health New Zealand chief executive Fepulea'i Margie Apa and the announcement Director of Public Health Dr Nicholas Jones would be stepping down and returning to his regular role, and less than a month after Dr Shane Reti was dumped as Health Minister.</p>

            <p>Apa resigned - four months ahead of her contract coming to an end - in a "mutual agreement" with Health Commissioner, Lester Levy, who was installed by the Government after Health NZ's board was sacked last July.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Sarfati, who was previously head of Te Aho o Te Kahu The Cancer Control Agency, has headed the Ministry since Dr Ashley Bloomfield resigned in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Te Aho o Te Kahu's chief executive Rami Rahal said as both founding head of that agency and as Director-General, Dr Sarfati provided "strong, evidence-informed leadership and guidance to a health system emerging from substantial reforms".</p>
        
            <p>"On behalf of Te Aho o Te Kahu, I want to express our deep appreciation for Dr. Sarfati's visionary leadership and to acknowledge the lasting impact of her work on the health system."</p>
        
            <p>Acting Labour health spokesperson Peeni Henare said it appeared Prime Minister Christopher Luxon believed "a purge" of health leadership would turn around the health system.</p>
        
            <p>"Dr Sarfati is a world-leading cancer research expert, improving survival rates and closing inequities in treatment. If the Government doesn't reach its cancer targets without Dr Sarfati they have no one to blame but themselves," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge Dr Sarfati's leadership when the Ministry of Health continued to give evidenced based advice on tobacco control despite a hostile government.</p>
        
            <p>"Health is complex, and firing the leadership may come back to haunt the Prime Minister."</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association (PSA), said the resignation was a further symptom of the Government's chaotic mismanagement and underfunding of the health system.</p>

            <p>The union's acting national secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said: "Hard working public servants delivering health care like Dr Sarfati are being asked to work miracles to somehow keep a groaning system working for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we have started litigation in the Employment Relations Authority aimed at stopping rushed and damaging job cuts in health to meet the Government's savings targets."</p>
        
            <p>A leading oncologist, Dr Chris Jackson, said he hoped Dr Sarfati would not be lost to the New Zealand health system.</p>
        
            <p>"The health system is in a much better shape for her leadership and we all owe her a great deal of gratitude."</p>
        
            <p>A former colleague, who worked with her closely, said to lose a leader of her stature and expertise was "gutting".</p>
        
            <p>"It's so disappointing, and frankly it leaves the Government - and the health system - in a perilous position."</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Simeon Brown said the outgoing Director General of Health has led the Ministry through a challenging time and he thanks her for her service.</p>
        
            <p>"An experienced and respected leader, Diana has led the Ministry of Health during a challenging time as the last government's reforms were being implemented.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge Diana's decision to step down from the role and thank her for her commitment to ensuring the health system delivers for New Zealanders.</p>
