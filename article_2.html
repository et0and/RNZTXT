            <p>Anna Grimaldi has won New Zealand's first gold medal at the Paralympics Games in Paris - and not in her specialist event.</p>
        
            <p>Grimaldi cruised to an easy victory in T47 200-metre final, having time to glimpse at the big screen and smile before crossing the line.</p>
        
            <p>She won in an Oceania record time of 24.72 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>It is Grimaldi's second medal of the Game after she took the bronze in the 100 metres.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Dunedin athlete missed out on a medal in her specialist event, the long jump, on Saturday, finishing fourth.</p>
        
            <p>But she rebounded in spectacular fashion in the 200m, rounding the bend strongly to take the lead and clear out from her rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Grimaldi, who was born without a right hand, was one of the New Zealand team's two flag bearers at the Paris Paralympics opening ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>It was her fourth Paralympics medal overall after gold medals in the long jump in 2016 and 2020.</p>
        
            <p>She was a comfortable victor over American Brittni Mason, while Thailand's Sasirawan Inthachot was third. Grimaldi had also broken the Oceania record when winning her 200m heat on Saturday night in 25.09sec.</p>
        
            <p>The 200m has been considered Grimaldi's third string event, making her gold medal all the more stunning.</p>
        
            <p>It was a surreal turnaround after she missed a medal by only one centimetre in the long jump.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a strange 48 hours. I try not to prep for the outcome, but I think yesterday was a shock,'' a joyful Grimaldi said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is never out of the realm of possibility to come fourth, last whatever, but it was a shock. More than that it was a shock because of the prep that we had done, how good I had been feeling in myself and my confidence. My long jumping has improved and it was a hard pill to swallow that I am a great long jumper but yesterday I didn't get to show it.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of me was nervous for this (the 200m) because I haven't done many, I didn't know how to run one. We only spoke about tactics five minutes before call room. After the heat I knew if I could hold it together, I could run a really good time but I didn't know that good!</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone thinks there would be a huge amount of disappointment after the long jump, but I think the journey I've been on from Rio to Tokyo where I struggled, just happy to be here happy and healthy that really showed up today and yesterday. It has been really freeing and I ran really freely today."</p>
        
            <p>Her gold medal takes New Zealand's tally in Paris to eight, with four silvers and three bronzes.</p>
