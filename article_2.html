            <p>Foodstuffs has recalled a batch of pre-packaged garlic bread from stores, after a customer reported finding a rat's foot inside.</p>
        
            <p>A Foodstuffs spokesperson said the customer called Pak'nSave Te Awamutu on Friday, and the batch was taken off the shelves straight away.</p>
        
            <p>They said the garlic bread was made by a third-party supplier, and arrived in-store fully wrapped and sealed.</p>
        
            <p>The customer was offered a refund, and an investigation is underway.</p>
        
            <p>"The store team is in regular contact with the customer who is understandably very concerned and, together with the supplier, Ministry of Primary Industries and NZ Food Safety, we're working with urgency to get to the bottom of what's happened here," the Foodstuffs spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>As a precautionary measure, Pak'nSave, New World, Four Square, Gilmours and Trents stores are removing that batch of garlic bread from shelves nationwide.</p>
