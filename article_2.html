            <p>It was the same finishing order as the 200m earlier in the programme.</p>
        
            <p>"I just wanted to go out there and have fun no matter the outcome," Aitchison said afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't particularly happy with the 200. Out there I loved the challenge with Yiting Shi next to me, pushing each other along. I'm really happy with how the race went.</p>
        
            <p>"It is so special to have my family in the crowd. It is so different from Tokyo. It is so great to have them come over to Paris and celebrate with me and enjoy the experience.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really excited to get back into training in a couple of months, I know I can push myself and get that gold medal in LA."</p>
        
            <p>Aitchison went one better than at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games where she won bronze in the same event.</p>
