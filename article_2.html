            <p>A 31-year-old has been charged with murder after a man died in an "altercation" at Waikanae Beach, sparking a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The man will appear in the Porirua District Court on Wednesday on a charge of murder.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to Napier Grove about 4:20pm, where they found a seriously hurt man after a fight.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite receiving urgent medical attention, he died at the scene a short time later," police said.</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem exam on the man is set to be carried out on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A person living nearby the Kāpiti Coast house where a man was killed on Tuesday said neighbours were shocked and concernd.</p>
        
            <p>Another man at the house who knew the victim was helping them with their inquiries, they said.</p>
        
            <p>A local, who RNZ has agreed not to name, said she and her neighbours were worried after seeing and hearing all the lights and sirens - and she was shocked to learn someone had died.</p>
        
            <p>"People were coming out on the street to have a look, and people were really concerned as to what was going on, because no one has been told.</p>
        
            <p>"With all that attention by the different services, it would seem that something very serious had taken place."</p>
        
            <p>Once the sirens had died down, everything seemed very calm, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a quiet, real, genuine feeling of concern about what had gone on."</p>
        
            <p>No one seemed to have seen or heard anything, and the house where she believed the person was killed was tucked down a long driveway that could not be seen from the street, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The community was home to a variety of people, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I like the area because it's what I call a mixed area.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people rent, some people own, some people have money, some people haven't got money, but it doesn't matter because we all say hello to each other."</p>
        
            <p>Police had been guarding the address overnight, and a scene examination would take place in the coming days, they said.</p>
