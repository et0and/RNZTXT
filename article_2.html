            <p>The new operator of the Tūroa Ski Field on Mt Ruapehu says ski passes will be on sale from next week.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation has granted Pure Tūroa a 10-year concession to operate the Tūroa Ski Field, 18 months after the previous concession holder, Ruapehu Alpine Lifts, went into voluntary administration.</p>
        
            <p>Both Pure Tūroa and the Crown are backing the project, matched dollar for dollar.</p>
        
            <p>Pure Tūroa spokesperson Jess Till says the deal will go through this Friday, and the company is confident it has got the capital to make the ski field a success.</p>
        
            <p>Pure Tūroa paid just $1 for the ski field for accounting purposes, but now has considerable financial liabilities.</p>
        
            <p>"It sounds like we're getting a bargain for $1 but we're absolutely taking on a lot of financial responsibility going forward," Till told Nine to Noon.</p>

            <p>How much each side was putting in was not yet determined, with "a few things financially" to be worked out before the deal was finalised.</p>
        
            <p>She was unable to disclose Pure Tūroa's financial backers, aside from the government.</p>
        
            <p>They only went for Tūroa, and not Whakapapa too, because even just one field was "a massive financial matter… huge".</p>
        
            <p>"We believe it's something we can make work, which is why we're focused on this side of the mountain."</p>
        
            <p>There has been criticism of a lack of consultation with local iwi. Till said they were "happy" with the process.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long road coming - it has been 18 months of discussions. No matter what process you go through, it's never going to be perfect for everyone, but we are really happy with our relationship with them, and their focus on their values will help to ensure a positive future for Tūroa we can all be proud of."</p>
        
            <p>Staffing-wise, Till said they had enough and were "raring to go".</p>
        
            <p>"We are ready to go. We are definitely on track."</p>
        
            <p>As for the cost of using the ski field, Till said the prices would be up on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a really special launch season pass offer as well, so it definitely pays to get on there on Monday… my lips are sealed right now."</p>
        
            <p>People who bought life passes from the previous ski field operator Ruapehu Alpine Lifts would be offered a "really heavily discounted three-season multipass" that will also be available from Monday. They will be $999 for three seasons for adults, and $299 for kids.</p>
        
            <p>"We think we've got a financial model that is going to stand the test of time. The weather patterns are looking fantastic for this season."</p>
