            <p>Parliament has kicked off for 2024 with a debate over the government's decision to deploy six New Zealand Defence Force personnel to the Red Sea.</p>
        
            <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been attacking ships in the Red Sea, which they say are linked to Israel, since the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict. In response, US and British forces have been carrying out strikes at different locations in Yemen, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, according to a joint statement signed by the six countries.</p>
        
            <p>The NZDF personnel will "provide support to coalition forces to carry out precision attacks on identified Houthi military targets" and will not enter Yemen.</p>
        
            <p>Both Labour and the Greens have criticised the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Making a ministerial statement to the House, Defence Minister Judith Collins said the deployment was in New Zealand's national interest.</p>
        
            <p>"Freedom of navigation is an integral part of New Zealand's national prosperity and trade security. Disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea and Suez Canal means higher costs for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders were not "freeloaders", so the government would do its bit, Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand cannot enjoy the benefits of global security without making a contribution when we can, and when it is in our clear security interests."</p>
        
            <p>The international community had repeatedly demanded the Houthi cease their attacks on ships, but to no avail, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition response is an inevitable consequence of the Houthi's very deliberate actions in the face of these warnings."</p>

Labour defence spokesperson Peeni Henare says New Zealand's place in the world as a respected country should not be taken for granted.

            <p>Labour defence spokesperson Peeni Henare said unlike the deployment of personnel to Europe to assist with training Ukrainian soldiers, he could not see a clear rationale for this deployment.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to be very mindful about getting involved in such conflicts, and I don't believe that the government has made a clear case for it."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's reputation was respected worldwide, and should not be taken for granted, Henare said.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions over the evidence the Houthi attacks were impacting the cost of living, Collins said 15 percent of world trade went through the Red Sea.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone really wants to know what happens when our shipping lanes and our supply chains are interrupted, just think back to what happened to New Zealanders and to their lack of buying power when we had the Covid-19 situation," she said.</p>

Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson accused Judith Collins of "hooking our trailers" up to states who were risking escalations of violence.

            <p>Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said the government should be focused on de-escalation, and not further fuelling conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"This government's denial that this conflict in Yemen is connected to the war in Gaza is naive and dangerous, at best, wilfully ignorant."</p>
        
            <p>She accused Collins of "hooking our trailers" up to states who were risking escalations of violence.</p>
        
            <p>"How does the minister decide when to be concerned about threats to security and stability, and when to be concerned about legality, and where does she cherry pick and choose to not be concerned about threats to security?"</p>
        
            <p>Collins said New Zealand had been involved in matters in the Red Sea since 2013.</p>
        
            <p>"The member may wish to, as she has today, express support for the Houthis, but I do not, and nor does this government," she said to Davidson.</p>
        
            <p>Collins reiterated the deployment would finish on or before 31 July.</p>
