            <p>A spate of toxic algae appearances in Southland has prompted warnings at rivers across the region.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Environment Southland released an alert that harmful algae had been found at Whitestone River - near Te Anau.</p>
        
            <p>It followed an alert the day before for a section of the Waihōpai River in Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Southland senior scientist surface water quality Katie Blakemore said algae was a natural part of a river's ecosystem, but some species were capable of producing toxins.</p>
        
            <p>Problems were more common in summer, especially when there hadn't been much rainfall and river flows were stable.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't answer how long it will be around for. Largely a bloom could continue until we get a rainfall event that changes the flow conditions in the river," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Flow is probably the most critical factor."</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, Blakemore was encouraging people to check rivers before swimming or letting their dogs off the leash.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council issued warnings for monitored locations, but conditions could change between visits and not all sites were checked.</p>
        
            <p>Dark green or black algae spelled bad news.</p>

            <p>Blakemore said they asked the public to stay informed and check Environment Southland's website for details of what to look out for.</p>
        
            <p>There are currently three warnings in place for Southland.</p>
        
            <p>Warnings in Fiordland include Whitestone River downstream of Manapouri-Hillside Rd and Waiau River near the Excelsior Creek inflow.</p>
        
            <p>There is one warning for Invercargill's Waihōpai River, upstream of Queens Drive.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the council also revealed it was investigating reports of an algal bloom in Doubtful Sound, and whether it was connected to an unusual number of fish deaths.</p>
