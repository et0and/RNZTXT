        <h2>ASB Classic: Match stalled by protesters in wild first day</h2>
        <p>
Watch: Vocal Pro-Palestine protesters halt the sixth seed's win over Israeli Lina Glushko.
</p>
        
            <p>Vocal Pro-Palestine protesters managed to halt sixth seed Naomi Osaka's eventual win 6-4 6-4 over Israeli Lina Glushko today at the ASB Classic.</p>
        
            <p>A group of around a dozen protesters caused the players to briefly leave the court, as the noise from a loudhailer and shouting disrupted the usual silence while the ball was in play.</p>
        
            <p>For her part, Osaka seemed non-plussed, saying that she had "just heard a lot of shouting and then people on the sidelines were telling me there was a protest".</p>
        
            <p>There was a further delay shortly after when Glushko had to leave the arena for a medical timeout, causing further confusion. In a press release, the Palestine Forum of New Zealand stated that they had targeted the match as Glushko is a former Israeli Defence Force member and "symbolizes a regime that implements apartheid policies".</p>
        
            <p>It was always unlikely the 220 ranked Glushko was going to be staying longer than the first round anyway, given that she came through qualifying and Osaka is a four time Grand Slam winner. The Japanese former world number one said that the "first match of the season is always very toughâ€¦and I'm just glad to get it done in two (sets)."</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely a little difficult," Osaka said of the windy Auckland conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"You definitely can't predict where the wind's going, but I figure if I'm struggling with it, my opponent is too. So I can't make any excuses. I think there were some on and off moments with my focus, I was really nervous."</p>
        
            <p>Nerves or not, Osaka did win comfortably so this stands as a pretty good statement to the rest of the field.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a sombre Lulu Sun faced media after her shock first round loss to Canadian Rebecca Marino. Sun, who switched allegiance to New Zealand and stood as the most likely hope for a home town victory in decades, said that Marino's awkward style was a key factor in the 6-3 3-6 6-3 result.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, she kind of plays that way, you know?" said Sun.</p>
        
            <p>"She doesn't give you a lot of rhythm. She serves good serves. And then she had one or two shots and then she'll miss some shots. So she is definitely a player that doesn't give rhythm."</p>

            <p>Sun also admitted a bit of rust didn't help, given that it was her first competitive match since August.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't had a really official match in six months, so, I think that was probably more of a problem. If I would have played someone with rhythm, maybe I would kind of get the flow. But since her game style is that way where you don't get a lot of rhythm."</p>
        
            <p>Sun was confident of bouncing back for the upcoming Australian Open.</p>
        
            <p>"I do the same routines usually. So it gives you kind of, zen moment, I guess. And I talked to my coach and kind of devise game plans and all."</p>
