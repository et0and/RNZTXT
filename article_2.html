        <h2>Armed police in downtown Auckland</h2>
        <p>

</p>
        
            <p>Armed police are guarding the entrance to an apartment complex on Gore Street in central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter saw about five police cars at the scene and a number of ambulances on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Two police officers were guarding the door of Auckland Harbour Suites, questioning witnesses or residents.</p>
        
            <p>Police cars had arrived about 7.15am and officers armed with assault rifles made their way to the apartment building.</p>
        
            <p>About 12 police officers with firearms were seen.</p>
        
            <p>Two further ambulances arrived around 7.50am but there appeared to be no panic or rush.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter at the scene said police were talking to residents as they entered or left the building.</p>
        
            <p>He said the situation seemed to be under control and there did not appear to be any danger to public.</p>
