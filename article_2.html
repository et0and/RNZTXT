            <p>The coffin, the staple, the cheese-cutter, the flying squirrel, the tornado, the back-slapper and the time-honoured manu bomb.</p>
        
            <p>Those were just a few of the many styles on show during a hotly contested bomb contest at Russell wharf on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Manu Masters, now in its fourth year, is one of the more light-hearted events that make up Matariki festivities in the Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 edition boasted a double-level jumping platform for the first time, with competitors able to jump from as high as 4.3m into water that measured a chilly 14.5 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>Also new this year was an award honouring Tim "Sticke" Grant, a Russell identity and past event organiser, who died in May.</p>
        
            <p>He was remembered not with a minute's silence, but a more fitting 30 seconds of applause.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-plus contestants, ranging in age from eight to 63, were judged on style, splash and wairua (spirit), with the top eight going through to a final round.</p>
        
            <p>This year's supreme title went to Kree Smith, a 30-year-old qualified chef, rigger, abseiler and competitive trampolinist, who is currently working as a stay-at-home dad in Northland's Wainui Valley.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said the secret to success in manu was simple: "It's practice, bro, practice."</p>
        
            <p>The previous evening, more than 1000 people gathered at Waitangi to mark Matariki - or Puanga as the new year is also known in the north - with kai, music, bouncy castles, bonfires on the beach, and a fireworks display.</p>
        
            <p>That event was organised at short notice by Te Tii Marae and Focus Paihia after a government funding cut forced the cancellation of a planned light and waka show at Paihia.</p>
