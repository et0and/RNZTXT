            <p>An earlier version of this story included the incorrect information that being in Code Black meant the ED was unable to accept more patients.</p>
        
            <p>Whang훮rei Hospital's emergency department hit "Code Black" today after reaching more than 150 percent capacity.</p>
        
            <p>A Health NZ spokesperson said it was not uncommon for the ED to go into Code Black, but it would continue to take patients who needed emergency care.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora Group Director of Operations Alex Pimm said Whang훮rei Hospital continues to accept patients and new admissions and any claims otherwise are completely inaccurate.</p>
        
            <p>"Patients and their families can be assured that they will be seen and anyone who requires hospital level care will receive it.</p>
        
            <p>"The emergency department uses the Emergency Department at A Glance (EDAAG) system, which has four escalations (green-amber-red-black), factoring in patient numbers, acuity, patient waiting time, and resuscitation bed capacity.</p>
        
            <p>"Colour coding systems are blunt tools used in ED, which is a highly dynamic environment, and the status can change back and forth in minutes over the course of a 24-hour period. It is a real time measure.</p>
        
            <p>"The ED may arbitrarily trigger a particular colour status multiple times in one day as demand and pressures change."</p>
        
            <p>Staff have told RNZ there have been more than 80 arrivals since midnight, including 21 within one hour.</p>
        
            <p>"I have never seen this before," one said.</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon the ED was at 156 percent capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Whangarei's ED - which has space to treat 32 patients - had 50 patients.</p>
        
            <p>The pressure was partly due to the hospital having to pick up the slack left by smaller Northland hospitals, which were also struggling demand and staff shortages.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Islands Hospital at Kawakawa has been forced to downgrade services this weekend due to a doctor shortage.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands up to nine patients from Bay of Islands were transferred to Whang훮rei yesterday, and a medical registrar had been asked to take calls for Dargaville patients, too.</p>
        
            <p>The declaration of a "code black" is made when the situation in a hospital is deemed critical, triggering an emergency escalation response by management.</p>
        
            <p>It is not always restricted to the emergency department, but could involve "bed block" within the hospital itself, which can mean patients who need to be admitted have to stay in ED until beds become available.</p>
        
            <p>At some hospitals, it can mean procedures and operations have to be delayed. However, there is no suggestion that is likely to happen in this instance.</p>
        
            <p>Heath Minister Shane Reti has declined to comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
