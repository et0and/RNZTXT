            <p>A resident in a Far North town has described seeing a "pool of blood" on the road after a hit and run.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the Far North town of Ōkaihau late on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe the collision between a cyclist and vehicle has occurred between 10pm and 10.15pm on that road," Detective Senior Sergeant Kevan Verry said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tragically, it has resulted in a 19-year-old dying from his injuries at the scene."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were still looking for the person responsbile.</p>
        
            <p>"A young man has lost his life, and it's important that anyone in the community with information does the right thing and speaks up now," Verry said.</p>
        
            <p>Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand and St John were called to Settlers Way, the town's main street, by residents, Verry said.</p>
        
            <p>The fatal hit-and-run has shocked residents in the small, close-knit town, which is located on State Highway 1 about 20km west of Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>One resident told RNZ she saw a pool of blood on the road outside Ōkaihau College on Wednesday morning, and a second patch about 50 to 100 metres away marked with neon spray paint.</p>
        
            <p>She said she saw police speaking to a staff member at the college, which was due to reopen on Friday after the summer break.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident told RNZ police had gone door-to-door at businesses, asking for information and any CCTV that might have captured the car.</p>
        
            <p>Officers set up a checkpoint at the start of Settlers Way, opposite Two Ponga Park, and were stopping every car to ask the occupants if they knew anything about the hit-and-run.</p>
        
            <p>Verry said police were searching for a car with obvious signs of damage, and urged anyone with information to speak up.</p>
        
            <p>A crash investigator examined the scene in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Verry said, and a criminal investigation was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"Detectives are working to piece together who is responsible. Police will be in the Ōkaihau township as part of our investigation, seeking witnesses and further information."</p>
        
            <p>Verry said Victim Support was helping the cyclist's family.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time and with what they are going through."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who witnessed the lead-up or aftermath of the hit-and-run, or who had any information, should contact police, Verry urged.</p>
        
            <p>They could contact police online or call 105, quoting reference number 250129/0360.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be passed on anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
        
            <p>Ōkaihau has a population of about 370, according to Census data, but is a service town for the wider area with primary and secondary schools, two dairies, two cafes and other businesses.</p>
        
            <p>It is an important stop on the popular Twin Coast Cycle Trail from the Bay of Islands to Hokianga.</p>
