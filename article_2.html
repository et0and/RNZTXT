            <p>"Firefighters were called to a chemical incident on Lessar Avenue in Clapham this evening," the London Fire Brigade said in an emailed statement to Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Crews used specialist equipment to detect a corrosive substance that is believed to have been used in the incident, it added, without giving any further details.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC reported three police officers, who responded to the incident, sustained what were believed to be minor injuries. The Met said police helicopters were being used in the search for the assailant.</p>
        
            <p>London Assembly Member Marina Ahmad said on X (formerly Twitter) that there had been a traffic collision "with a man assaulting occupants in a car".</p>
