            <p>MetService has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Northland, as a "line of severe thunderstorms" crosses the top of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The forecaster upgraded its previous 'watch' to a 'warning' at 3.49pm on Tuesday, valid for just under an hour, for Kaipara, Whangarei and the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>"At 3.45pm, MetService weather radar detected a line of severe thunderstorms lying from Mititai to Tutamoe to Kaitaia," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"This line of severe thunderstorms is moving towards the southwest, and is expected to lie from Te Kopuru to Waipoua Forest to Ahipara 4.15pm."</p>
        
            <p>Half an hour later, the storms were expected to be over Dargaville and off the coast of Ninety Mile Beasch.</p>
        
            <p>"These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain" which could "cause surface and/or flash flooding about streams, gullies and urban areas, and make driving conditions extremely hazardous".</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch remained in place for the rest of Northland and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Kaitaia Airport recorded 18.6mm of rain in the hour to 1pm, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch was issued for Tai Rāwhiti earlier Tuesday afternoon, from 9pm through to 9am Wednesday. Heavy rain may approach warning criteria, especially north of Gisborne, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a low risk of a few thunderstorms from East Cape to Mahia."</p>
        
            <p>Beyond the northern thunderstorms, the eastern parts of the North Island could experience intermittent rainTairāwhiti/Gisborne, in particular, may see this trend intensify from tonight into tomorrow morning, prompting the issuance of a Heavy Rain Watch pic.twitter.com/eLmAUjYitb</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Thapi Makgabutlane said intense rain up to 40mm an hour could hit some areas, and the intense downpours could cause surface and flash flooding in some low-lying areas.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
