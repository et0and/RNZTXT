            <p>The government is expected to announce the Ministry of Education will be required to publish weekly school attendance statistics as part of its crackdown on truancy.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the announcement will be made by Associate Education Minister David Seymour and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in Wellington later on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Luxon announced nine targets for the next six years, including health, crime and education goals.</p>
