            <p>An urgent Waitangi Tribunal inquiry into the repeal of Treaty of Waitangi commitments within Oranga Tamariki is under way.</p>
        
            <p>Evidence submitted to the tribunal on Friday showed repealing Section 7AA, which outlines requirements for agency to improve outcomes for tamariki M훮ori would elicit strong reaction from M훮ori.</p>
        
            <p>Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act introduced legislative obligations and explicit duties on the chief executive to demonstrate a practical commitment to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Documents submitted by claimants and published on the Waitangi Tribunal website show correspondence and advice provided by Oranga Tamariki to Minister for Children Karen Chhour, outlining the possible implications of the repeal.</p>
        
            <p>The government was advised the tight timeframe for repeal would limit the ability to review a wide range of evidence regarding the impact this decision would have on tamariki M훮ori.</p>
        
            <p>The documents included feedback from other government ministries outlining the possible implications of repealing section 7AA.</p>
        
            <p>It was also told repealing section 7AA may diminish the unique rights, needs and voices of tamariki M훮ori.</p>
        
            <p>Despite objections from government departments, like Te Puni Kokiri, plans to repeal the act continue.</p>
