            <p>The vote count is underway across the country but already the pundits have projected former president Donald Trump as winner in 22 states while Vice President Kamala Harris has earned the nod in 12, according to CNN.</p>
        
            <p>Around 5.45pm NZ time CNN projected Trump would win in North Carolina - one of the seven key races.</p>
        
            <p>Harris is hoping to become the first woman elected president, while Trump is vying to become only the second former president to win a non-consecutive second term.</p>
        
            <p>Remember the winning candidate must earn at least 270 votes in the Electoral College to move into the White House.</p>
        
            <p>The election is expected to come down to a handful of battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
        
            <p>In the list below we have key race alongside each of those states. Here's how it stands mid-afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
