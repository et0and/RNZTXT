            <p>Police have arrested 15 people over a variety of charges at a Whakatﾄ］e tangi procession.</p>
        
            <p>Eastern Bay of Plenty Area Commander Inspector Nicky Cooney said of those arrested, 14 were either associated with or were patched members of gangs.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the arrests were made using the Search and Surveillance Act through gang conflict warrants.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were arrested on warrants to arrest after previously failing to appear in court, four people were arrested for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile other charges included breaching of release conditions, failing to stop for police, possession of drugs, dangerous driving and driving while disqualified.</p>
        
            <p>A number of weapons were also seized in the arrest, including a cut down Ruger Semi-automatic .22 rifle, a cut down Rossi Semi-automatic .22 rifle, two machetes, a knuckle duster, an axe, a variety of knives and a variety of ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>Police also seized six motorcycles.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Eagle helicopter was in Whakatﾄ］e to assist officers on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Cooney acknowledged those wanting to pay their respects at the tangi, but she warned that unlawful activity would not be tolerated, and that officers would not hesitate to hold those people to account.</p>
