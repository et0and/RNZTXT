        <h2>Bondi attacker's path from finding new 'life' to killing six</h2>
        <p>
A month ago, Joel Cauchi's parents were relieved to see him enjoying the beach. The next time they saw him was on TV attacking people.

            <p>Five weeks before Joel Cauchi armed himself with a knife and killed six people in a Bondi shopping centre, he sent his mum a video message.</p>
        
            <p>It was a selfie at Coogee Beach in Sydney's south with the comment, "Mum, I just want to show you how beautiful Coogee Beach [is]".</p>
        
            <p>The mobile message was a welcome reprieve for parents Michele and Andrew Cauchi, both in their 70s, who had been desperately trying to make contact with their youngest child.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, that same day his distressed mother had reached out to his bank.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to know what's in his account. I just want to know my son's still alive. Is he still using his account?" Mrs Cauchi had asked.</p>
        
            <p>The family in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane - where Joel Cauchi spent his childhood and university years - breathed a sigh of relief after receiving his message.</p>
        
            <p>Their son was in Sydney, he was alive and seemed to be doing OK.</p>
        
            <p>But after that selfie message marvelling at the beauty of Coogee Beach, the next time Andrew and Michele Cauchi saw their son it was on national television.</p>
        
            <p>Like much of the country, the couple was horrified by the news flooding television channels about the attack at the Westfield shopping centre on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"I walked in and my wife said, 'It looks like Joel'. I said, 'It does a bit', but he had his head down," Andrew Cauchi said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I watched and watched and watched."</p>

            <p>Over and over they scrutinised the footage of a man in football clothes running through the shopping centre at Bondi Junction in Sydney's east, armed with a knife.</p>
        
            <p>Coming to the realisation it was their son, the distraught couple called police.</p>
        
            <p>At 8.30am on Sunday, NSW police announced the man responsible - shot dead by a police inspector inside the shopping centre - was 40-year-old Joel Cauchi from Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>He had fatally stabbed six innocent people at the shopping centre and injured more, including a nine-month-old baby.</p>
        
            <p>The entire country was reeling in shock. So too were Michele and Andrew Cauchi.</p>
        
            <p>They knew their son, who they said had been top of his class at school and graduated from university, was troubled.</p>
        
            <p>But they could not comprehend how or why he could have committed such a dreadful act.</p>
        
            <p>Neither could Josephine Everson. She first met Cauchi in mid-2019, about the time of her 18th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>They had made contact on a dating site and, despite the age gap, started going on dates.</p>
        
            <p>Everson was living in Toowoomba and they arranged to meet for the first time at a coffee shop at Northpoint Shopping Centre.</p>
        
            <p>They clicked and, for the next five months or so, hung out together.</p>
        
            <p>He took her to places she had never been, like a little place outside Highfields with pumpkins on the fence.</p>
        
            <p>They had coffee at Picnic Point, at the top of the Toowoomba range, overlooking the valley below.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything was perfect. He was the most kind and sweetest person I had met," Everson said of the man she knew back then.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a fun and kind person."</p>
        
            <p>They shared a love of photography and Cauchi helped her with a camera and taught her how to take good pictures.</p>
        
            <p>"He loved taking photographs," Everson said.</p>

            <p>Everson tearfully remembered how happy Cauchi was.</p>
        
            <p>"He always had this big smile on his face. He was a joyful person," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said he was always polite in her company and had met her parents.</p>
        
            <p>"He was respectful towards them [my parents] and my brothers."</p>
        
            <p>Everson had no idea that Cauchi had been diagnosed with mental illness.</p>
        
            <p>She said he never mentioned it or discussed it with her. He told her he was hoping to study to become a teacher.</p>
        
            <p>In October 2019, Cauchi moved to Brisbane to live.</p>
        
            <p>For a while they tried to keep the relationship going, but they ended up going their separate ways.</p>

            <p>Michele and Andrew Cauchi said their son went off his mental health medication at about that time with the agreement and aid of his treating doctor.</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi had been diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 17.</p>
        
            <p>His mother said he had been under the care of doctors for 18 years.</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi's family said he excelled at school and in 2012 graduated from the University of Southern Queensland with a Bachelor of Arts in international relations and culture and language.</p>
        
            <p>Michele Cauchi said her son's doctor took him off his medication over a number of years, carefully warning him of what might happen.</p>
        
            <p>"When he came off [the medication], it was like it had all lifted from him and he wanted to have a life," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"After living at home until he was 35, he went to Brisbane, so he wasn't with his doctor anymore."</p>
        
            <p>His father said it was a six-month trial with an option to recommence medication if needed.</p>
        
            <p>"He didn't want anyone knowing he has got a mental illness," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was embarrassed when I said anything about it and he bolted off to Brisbane and he got a life."</p>
        
            <p>That life included using dating sites during Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

            <p>One Brisbane woman, who matched with Cauchi on Tinder in 2020, remembered chatting with him.</p>
        
            <p>She does not wish to be identified but says she had the impression he wanted to connect with people.</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi was very polite, telling her that he was living in Ascot at the time and that his parents were in Toowoomba.</p>
        
            <p>They shared phone messages about the movies they were watching and the best beaches.</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi was keen to meet in person but it never happened due to pandemic restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Over the next few years he moved between Brisbane, Toowoomba and the Gold Coast and for a period slept rough in his hometown.</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi was turning up for dinner at Tony's Kitchen, a homeless outreach charity in Toowoomba.</p>
        
            <p>Founder Tony Hurle said he understood that Cauchi was sleeping with other rough sleepers at a park near the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"We never had any issues with him. He was always polite," Hurle said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was very softly spoken from memory. We only knew him as Joel."</p>
        
            <p>By January of 2023, Cauchi rang his father and said he had lost his unit in Brisbane and was about to be homeless. Andrew Cauchi brought him home to Toowoomba.</p>
        
            <p>But he refused to allow his son's United States Army combat knives in the home. He had found about six of them.</p>
        
            <p>"I said to Joel, 'You can stay here as long as you like but you are not going to have these in my house' and so I took them off him, knowing that there was going to be pandemonium in my house but I was willing to put up with it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His son called police, complaining that his father had stolen his knives.</p>
        
            <p>The next day, Joel Cauchi drove down to Tweed Heads and bought himself another knife.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Cauchi said his wife thought their son's wish to have knives was for self-protection.</p>
        
            <p>He was often seeking friendship, someone to surf with, share rides with and look around Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>In January this year, he sought someone to help him learn about astrophotography at a dark sky site in Sydney, and in February posted a review about Sydney's Palm Beach, saying it was a beautiful spot with an amazing beach.</p>
        
            <p>On 8 April, just five days before his stabbing attacks, he posted that he was surfing Bondi if anyone wanted to meet for a surf.</p>
        
            <p>As police delve into Cauchi's life in a bid to uncover the motivations for the Bondi attack, his distraught parents have apologised for their son's actions and to his victims' families.</p>
        
            <p>"My heart goes out to the people my son has hurt," a tearful Michele Cauchi said this week.</p>
        
            <p>"If he was in his right mind, he would be absolutely devastated by what he has done.</p>
        
            <p>"But he obviously was not in his right mind and he has been somehow triggered into a psychosis and he lost touch with reality.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who has got a relative with mental illness will understand medication doesn't make you feel very well.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a condition with a mental illness called anosognosia where the brain is damaged and it doesn't tell you you're sick. So if you don't know you're sick, why would you take medication?"</p>
        
            <p>She urged other families experiencing mental illness to seek support.</p>
        
            <p>The incident is still under police investigation and will be subject to a coronial inquest.</p>
