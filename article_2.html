            <p>Consumer confidence has turned more pessimistic, and Wellington is the most downbeat region of all.</p>
        
            <p>The ANZ-Roy Morgan monthly consumer confidence index fell 4 points in April to 82.1, which was near the lows seen during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, but slightly above more recent pandemic lows.</p>
        
            <p>A reading over 100 indicates optimism.</p>
        
            <p>Inflation expectations eased slightly to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent in March, while expected house price inflation rose slightly to 3.5 percent from 3.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>More people think it is a bad time to buy an appliance, with 28 percent in April versus 24 percent in March.</p>
        
            <p>Only 5 percent expect to be better off this time next year, compared with 19 percent last month.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ senior economist Miles Workman said weaker signals out of Wellington were not surprising given its exposure to central government.</p>
        
            <p>"Interestingly, however, Wellington's relative optimism wore off from early 2022, perhaps as it became clear that fiscal expansion couldn't go on forever," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As the public sector as a share of economy contracts from here, this cut of the data will be worth paying close attention to," Workman said.</p>
