            <p>The Homegrown music festival is leaving Wellington after 18 years on the city's waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>This year's iteration, set for March, would be the last held in the capital, festival director Andrew Tuck said.</p>
        
            <p>The festival has run on the Wellington Waterfront since its inception in 2008.</p>
        
            <p>"For a myriad of personal and logistical reasons Homegrown is moving cities after this year," Tuck said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The support from WellingtonNZ and Wellington City Council has been massive over the years so we're keen to knock this last one out of the park as a heartfelt thank you to Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>The 2025 festival would also host Wellington band Shihad's last-ever gig, Tuck said.</p>
        
            <p>He did not confirm which city would host the festival from 2026 onwards.</p>
