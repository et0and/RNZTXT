        <h2>Man who fought Bondi stabber with bollard 'really wanted to stop him'</h2>
        <p>
Damien Geurot heard people screaming. Then he saw a murderer coming up an escalator, and knew he had to act.

            <p>The man who faced down a murderer with a shopping centre bollard has described looking into the "empty eyes" of the killer.</p>
        
            <p>Joel Cauchi, 40, killed six people and seriously injured many more during a stabbing rampage at Westfield Bondi Junction in Sydney on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Queensland man was shot dead by police, who have since said he had known mental health issues.</p>
        
            <p>Videos shot inside the mall showed some people running in terror from Cauchi, while others tried to stop his attack.</p>
        
            <p>One video showed a man blocking the top of an escalator, brandishing a bollard at Cauchi as he slowly approached.</p>
        
            <p>7News has identified the man with a bollard as Damien Geurot, who was heading to the gym with his friend Silas Despreaux when the attack unfolded.</p>
        
            <p>Geurot told 7News the pair heard someone screaming "there's a man stabbing people". They ran to see what was happening before catching sight of Cauchi.</p>
        
            <p>That was when they grabbed the bollard, Geurot said.</p>
        
            <p>"We just saw him coming ... we were thinking, 'We need to try and stop him'."</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi tried to come up the escalator and Geurot fended him off with the bollard.</p>
        
            <p>He said when he came face-to-face with the killer, he was looking into "empty eyes".</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi "wasn't there", Geurot told 7News.</p>
        
            <p>"We tried to throw the bollard. We really wanted to stop him."</p>
        
            <p>
Joel Cauchi had been diagnosed with a mental illness when he was 17. He had recently moved to Sydney.

            <p>Geurot then helped to lead police inspector Amy Scott towards the attacker and she shot him dead.</p>
        
            <p>Geurot told 7News he was not a hero and Scott deserved that title instead.</p>
        
            <p>"We just did what we did," he said, referring to himself and Despreaux.</p>
        
            <p>Five of the six stabbing victims had been identified as of Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>They were new mum Ashlee Good, security guard Faraz Ahmed Tahir, architect and mum of two Jade Young, artist and designer Pikria Darchia, and young e-commerce assistant Dawn Singleton.</p>

            <p>Good's nine-month-old daughter, who was stabbed alongside her, remained in hospital on Sunday night after undergoing surgery. Her family said she was doing well.</p>
        
            <p>Geurot told 7News he saw people being stabbed in front of him, including one girl on a balcony.</p>
        
            <p>"She was just walking, she didn't do anything."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese acknowledged the everyday people - like Geurot - who had tried to stop Cauchi.</p>
        
            <p>"We ... see the footage of ordinary Australians putting themselves in harm's way in order to help their fellow citizens," he said.</p>
