        <h2>Community board chair claims he was forced to step down as he is 'too old'</h2>
        <p>
"It's ageism. I should just do a Biden and go away," 80-year-old Ross Goudie says.

            <p>The 80-year-old chair of the Waih朝 Beach Community Board claims he was forced to step down because he is "too old".</p>
        
            <p>But the board's new chairwoman says they never said he was too old for the role and there were concerns about his leadership and behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Ross Goudie resigned from his chairman position at a tense community board meeting on Monday but he will remain as a board member.</p>
        
            <p>He is in his second term on the board and previously spent 12 years as a Western Bay of Plenty District councillor.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was stepping down as board chair because if he did not, he would be forced to at a special meeting next week.</p>
        
            <p>"This has become very personal, with ageist statements made about me and my ability to lead," he told the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"Questioning someone's ability to lead based on age is never acceptable, and the narrative that I am the problem is misguided."</p>
        
            <p>In a letter seen by Local Democracy Reporting, five board members wrote to Western Bay of Plenty District Council chief executive John Holyoake on 19 November.</p>
        
            <p>The board members requested a meeting on 12 December to remove Goudie as the chair.</p>
        
            <p>A dozen people from the community spoke in support of Goudie at Monday's meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Bob Hulme, who was on the community board with Goudie from 2019-2022, said it was "ludicrous" the board was attempting to make changes almost two-thirds of the way through the term.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] is an affront to Ross and all the work that he's put into the community for years and years."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a "slap in the face" for voters who elected Goudie.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Anne Henry responded that it was up to the board members - not voters - to choose the chair, and Goudie would remain on the board.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing has changed in terms of what the community voted for."</p>
        
            <p>Otawhiwhi Marae representative Reon Tuanau said the relationship between the whole board and the marae was pretty strong and he had weekly catch-ups with Goudie.</p>
        
            <p>"I tautoko [support] what I've heard throughout this evening's korero from the community."</p>
        
            <p>It was a "heavy kaupapa" and he implored the board to find the best outcome for everyone.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Tuanau said it was not long until the next election in 2025 and he hoped the board would make a pragmatic decision after hearing from the community.</p>
        
            <p>Niki Moat, of Waih朝 Beach Community Events and Promotions, said what had happened was "really concerning" and "pretty dirty".</p>
        
            <p>Dani Simpson, who the board later picked as the new chair, said there was a lot the board could not share, and it was not the appropriate forum to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Board member Wayne Stevenson asked Goudie for a point of order because it was "inappropriate to allow people to insult us".</p>
        
            <p>Just before the meeting ended the board voted unanimously for Simpson to become the chairwoman and Heather Guptill to be deputy chairwoman. Goudie abstained from voting.</p>
        
            <p>Guptill said Goudie was still going to be an integral part of the community board.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all grateful for having Ross in our lives, but he's not going anywhere."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking after the meeting, Goudie said he was immensely proud of the community for supporting him.</p>
        
            <p>"I was not going willingly; I was forced to go. I was to go quietly and not make a noise because I was too old.</p>
        
            <p>In his view: "It's ageism. I should just do a Biden and go away."</p>

            <p>The age of political leaders was a major theme of the recent US presidential election, where President Joe Biden, who turned 82 last month, withdrew from the race against eventual winner, former President Donald Trump, 78.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier was due to retire when he turned 72 in March because of a requirement in the Ombudsmen Act 1975. But he will stay in the role until Parliament find a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Goudie said he trusted and mentored his fellow board members.</p>
        
            <p>"I introduced them to all sorts of things that were going on at council level and now I've been told I shouldn't [be the chairman]."</p>
        
            <p>In August and September, Goudie had pneumonia and said he was not coping well, but once he got back on his feet, he was fine.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking after the meeting, Simpson said after the 2022 election the board agreed Goudie would be chairman for 18 months then the deputy chairman would take over.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Goudie said this was a suggestion between himself and the former deputy chair Alan Kurtovich, not an agreement.</p>
        
            <p>It was not brought up again when Kurtovich resigned, and Simpson took on the deputy role, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson said discussions with Goudie about stepping down had been ongoing since the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"We never asked him to leave the board and have appreciated his knowledge and guidance over the past two years.</p>
        
            <p>"At no time have we said that he is too old for this role or any other."</p>
        
            <p>In her view: "This is about leadership and behaviour that led to the whole community board having lost confidence in his ability to be an effective, inclusive leader."</p>
        
            <p>The board had tried to work through it in a dignified, respectful and considered way, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public had approached board members with concerns about Goudie's health, behaviour and ability to lead effectively, Simpson claimed.</p>
        
            <p>The board had exhausted all "preferred avenues" so therefore planned to hold a meeting on 12 December to remove Goudie as chairman, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The board's intent was to approach the matter with empathy, respect and understanding in the best interests of the board and community, Simpson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was disappointing that Monday night's meeting was conducted in the way it was.</p>
        
            <p>"Leadership transitions are a natural part of any organisation or board and they offer opportunities for growth and new perspectives."</p>
        
            <p>Holyoake said several comments made at the meeting should have remained confidential.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disappointing that they have been shared publicly and I won't contribute to that conversation."</p>
