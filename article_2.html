            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman will learn her fate on Monday, after her political career was left in tatters following a shoplifting scandal.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman, 43, admitted four shoplifting charges relating to the theft of thousands of dollars' worth of clothing when she appeared in the Auckland District Court in March.</p>
        
            <p>She had resigned as an MP earlier in the year after the charges came to light.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, she said stress relating to her work had led her to "act in ways that are completely out of character".</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The former politician was charged with stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx Store on 22 October, 2023 and a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue in Newmarket on 22 December.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with two counts of shoplifting from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby - $5773 of items on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods on 23 December.</p>
        
            <p>It is expected her lawyer will seek a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman will be sentenced in the Auckland District Court on Monday afternoon.</p>
