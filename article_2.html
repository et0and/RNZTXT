            <p>A Hindu priest is facing deportation after failing in his bid to avoid conviction for a lengthy campaign of control and violence against a woman that included him pressing his fingers into her eyeballs, slapping her and isolating her from others.</p>
        
            <p>Jainesh Prasad, 40, appeared in Hamilton District Court on Friday for sentencing on representative charges of assaulting with intent to injure, assaulting a person in a family relationship, and breaching a protection order.</p>
        
            <p>Over 12 months, Prasad set on a course of what the Crown described as controlling behaviour where he sought to control the woman's finances, who she associated with and isolated her from others.</p>
        
            <p>He was also violent, and called her employer to say she had stolen items from her work, which was a lie.</p>
        
            <p>In reading her statement to the court, the victim said Prasad, a Hindu priest in the Waikato, had "injured me in many ways".</p>
        
            <p>"He has hit me many times and I have been injured and had cuts to my body and in my mouth.</p>
        
            <p>"He also used his fingers to press on my eyeballs and I ended up sore for two weeks and [suffering] blurry vision.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a lot for me ... I would be scared 24/7.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt so isolated as my family and friends drifted away from me.</p>
        
            <p>"He would call me and my female friends, lesbians."</p>
        
            <p>She told Judge Glen Marshall she would only feel safe if he left the country.</p>
        
            <p>Prasad's offending involved him accusing the woman of being involved in another relationship after she had finished working a night shift.</p>
        
            <p>She told him to stop with the accusations and tried to rest.</p>
        
            <p>However, Prasad pulled the blankets off her and slapped her so hard across the face that he loosened one of her teeth.</p>
        
            <p>He then tried to stop her screaming, "because someone might hear", by putting his hand over her mouth and she struggled to breathe.</p>
        
            <p>In an argument at another Hamilton house, in August 2023, Prasad ran at her, grabbing her head, and pressing his fingers into her eyeballs.</p>
        
            <p>In October of that year, he demanded to see her phone to check who she had been talking with.</p>
        
            <p>When she said "no", he pushed her to the floor and held his hand around her throat as she, again, struggled to breathe.</p>
        
            <p>The protection order charge was laid after he called her employer falsely stating she had stolen items from work.</p>
        
            <p>In court, defence lawyer Katie Hogan said at the time of the offending relations between the pair were "disintegrating and fraught".</p>
        
            <p>A pre-sentence report found her client at low risk of reoffending and harm to others.</p>
        
            <p>Prasad was also keen to attend restorative justice but the victim declined that.</p>
        
            <p>Hogan submitted he had taken steps to rehabilitate, had not appeared before the court before, and had a job with Turners and Growers.</p>
        
            <p>She argued convictions for Prasad would outweigh the gravity of his offending as an expert immigration adviser said if that happened he would likely be subjected to the deportation process.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a real and appreciable risk he will be deported," she said, adding that the offending was not as serious as some other cases.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown had also agreed to replace a more serious charge of strangulation with a lesser charge.</p>
        
            <p>However, if the judge did not grant a discharge without conviction, Hogan urged him to hand down a sentence of community work and supervision.</p>
        
            <p>Crown solicitor James Lewis said the victim lived in fear of Prasad while his assaults targeted her head and involved a breach of trust.</p>
        
            <p>He submitted that deportation was "not a forgone conclusion".</p>
        
            <p>Judge Marshall first praised the victim for having the courage to read her victim impact statement to the court.</p>
        
            <p>He also noted Prasad's comment in the pre-sentence report, where he said he wasn't happy finding out their relationship was over by somebody else.</p>
        
            <p>"He found that distressing for a man of his standing," the judge said.</p>
        
            <p>Prasad explained one argument was caused by him getting upset that the woman hadn't done the dishes before she went to work but he denied physically assaulting her.</p>
        
            <p>The judge said his comments indicated a minimisation of his offending and the impact it had on the victim.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Marshall accepted Prasad was a priest in the Waikato Hindu community and might face deportation if convicted, but ultimately found the offending "squarely in the moderate level" and declined his application for a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>He then noted that Prasad's remorse was "somewhat limited".</p>
        
            <p>"More limited to his view of the circumstances than what impact he has had on the victim's life."</p>
        
            <p>Prasad was sentenced to 200 hours of community work and nine months of supervision.</p>
        
            <p>He was also issued several conditions including not to contact the victim.</p>
