            <p>Half the cyclone-wrecked Hawke's Bay properties deemed too unsafe to live in have now been bought out, or are close to it.</p>
        
            <p>Across Hastings and Napier, 167 properties are in Category 3 and eligible for a buyout, with local councils and the government going halves on the cost.</p>
        
            <p>Offers for 85 properties have been received or approved by property owners - and 24 have already settled.</p>
        
            <p>And 86 percent of eligible properties have completed valuations, or had valuations commissioned from independent valuers.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said though it was a complex process, the progress was heartening.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this remains a difficult time for those with Category 3 properties.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Voluntary Buy-out Office team has been pulling out all the stops to keep things moving as quickly as possible so people can move on."</p>
        
            <p>It was "wonderful" to see families relocating to safe areas of the district, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Napier mayor Kirsten Wise said trusting councils to deliver the best outcomes was a big deal.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope this allows these property owners to move forward with their lives.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate the co-operation of all those who have chosen to take up the option for a voluntary buy-out."</p>
        
            <p>The councils expected that most offers would be completed by October.</p>
