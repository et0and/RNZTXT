            <p>A family fighting to keep their aunt in New Zealand has been granted a reprieve.</p>
        
            <p>Loasi Latu and her husband have lived in New Zealand for decades as overstayers and were told they had to leave the country voluntarily.</p>
        
            <p>However, Latu is a carer for her brother Viliami, who is a New Zealand resident and needs 24/7 support for his intellectual disability and epilepsy.</p>
        
            <p>Associate minister of immigration Chris Penk has now granted a five-year temporary visa for them.</p>
        
            <p>The family said while it was not the permanent residence they were hoping for, it gave them a chance to work towards a long-term solution.</p>
        
            <p>"This temporary visa gives us the chance to work towards a long term solution, while our family can remain in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Our fight has been about keeping our family together and protecting the life of our Uncle Viliami, and our Aunty Loasi.</p>
        
            <p>"We are so grateful for all the community support and for leaders like Phil Twyford and Dave Letele coming out to support us! It's because we had such strong backing that we have this outcome today."</p>
