            <p>Eighty workers being laid off from a mill in Gisborne say the sudden job loss is devastating.</p>
        
            <p>Japanese-owned Juken New Zealand told staff on Friday that it had decided to close due to ongoing financial difficulties and falling demand.</p>
        
            <p>Sixty workers were set to lose their jobs before Christmas, with another 20 leaving in March.</p>
        
            <p>First Union represented the workers, and its representative, Colleen Ryan, said they were heartbroken, with some losing their entire family income.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though they knew this was potentially going to happen, it was extremely upsetting for them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In some cases, we've got couples that both worked there, which is going to be doubly bad. They are absolutely devastated.</p>
        
            <p>"When I phoned one of our delegates she was in tears talking to me. I mean, even with the knowledge or the potential knowledge that this is going to happen, just this time of year, it is devastating."</p>
        
            <p>She said the union would meet with workers on Monday to offer support and help them find new employment.</p>
