            <p>The government is making changes to the Accredited Employer visa to make it easier for businesses to hire migrants.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet has also agreed in principle to bring in two new seasonal visas from late 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The AEWV changes taking effect from March include:</p>
        
            <p>Immigration Minister Erica Stanford revealed the changes in a statement on Tuesday morning, and said the changes - along with other tweaks already made to the scheme - would ensure the right balance of New Zealanders prioritised for job opportunities and providing a more fit-for-purpose visa scheme.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus remains on attracting more higher-skilled workers while managing migration levels responsibly, so New Zealand has access to the skills we need to grow our economy. These changes will support a smarter, efficient and predictable immigration system."</p>
        
            <p>She said the previous government had used the median wage as an "artificial proxy for skill which did not work".</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, it distorted wages and in some cases resulted in businesses paying migrant workers more than New Zealanders doing the same job. Other businesses had to increase prices to ensure pay equity across Kiwi and migrant workers."</p>
        
            <p>The two new seasonal visas would provide a more "nuanced and flexible response" to the needs of businesses in some sectors and regions, and the current seasonal subcategory would be extended, she said.</p>
