            <p>The Penrith Panthers have won their fourth NRL rugby league grand final title in a row with victory over the Melbourne Stom in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>The Panthers won 14-6, after leading 10-6 at halftime, in an intense low-scoring match that did not disappoint for excitement.</p>
        
            <p>Nathan Cleary stood out in a brilliant display for Penrith, despite playing with a shoulder injury, and with his halves mate Jarome Luai controlled play for long enough to stifle the Storm's chances.</p>
        
            <p>It took 21 minutes to open the scoring with Harry Grant dotting down for the Storm, but the Panthers were starting to dominate in the middle of the field, and struck back with Sunia Turuva sprinting over in the corner after some slick backline passing.</p>

            <p>Penrith took the lead just before halftime, with a sizzling try to Liam Martin after slick work from Cleary and Luai.</p>
        
            <p>Penrith had dominated the attack, but their defence was pretty hot and they managed to get three players around the Storm's Jack Howarth when he launched himself for a try nine minutes into the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Melbourne gamely tried to get back in front with some full-blooded attacks, but it was Penrith who dealt the decisive blow when Paul Alamoti was on the end of excellent passes from Martin and Moses Leota, finishing it off with an acrobatic dive.</p>
        
            <p>The Storm never gave up, but Cleary and Luai had their game plan ticking over too well in the end.</p>
