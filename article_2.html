            <p>An advocacy group trying to save Wellington Botanic Garden's iconic Begonia House are set to stage a "sit in" protest Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council has identified the building as an unsafe public space, and is planning to demolish the landmark glasshouse to save money as As part of its long term plan amendment process.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation Friends of Wellington's Botanic Gardens said they believe they can renew the building for under $3 million and have a petition on the go to save it, which so far has more than 7000 signatures.</p>
        
            <p>President of the Friends of the Wellington Botanic Garden, Mazz Scannell told Saturday Mornings that the Begonia House was a "generational conservatory."</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody goes to the Begonia House," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have a building that is the second most visited building in Wellington, you've got to ask big questions about why you would want to knock it down."</p>
        
            <p>The building was certainly in need of work, but that did not justify a demolition, Scannell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had a few panes of glass been blown out, not falling in, because of these fantastic winds we get every now and again."</p>
        
            <p>"It's earthquake-proof, it's 60 years old, and like all of us that are over 60 it needs some work."</p>
        
            <p>
Two glass panes at Wellington Botanic Garden's Begonia House were dislodged by strong winds on 25 April, 2024.

            <p>It was feasible for the council to repair the building by doing the renovations in sections over a longer period of time, Scannell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The $3m has been put upon us by the council, because that's what they've estimated it's going to cost to knock it down.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're going to spend $3m knocking it down, how about you spend $3m fixing it up?"</p>
        
            <p>"There's two big chunks that cost the money with the Begonia House: It is replacing the glazing, and the boiler that keeps it tropical," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The building was important to the people of Wellington, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not happy with the idea of just knocking it down and building a car park."</p>
        
            <p>The protest at the Botanic Gardens tomorrow was a great opportunity for people to show their support for the Begonia House, Scannell said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had people offer to chain themselves to the structure."</p>
        
            <p>She was not encouraging that though, she laughed.</p>
        
            <p>"I am encouraging people to come along. We have a whole lot of placards, and it's just a great opportunity to have Wellingtonians have their voice with something that they love."</p>
        
            <p>The sit in is scheduled from 11.30 to 1pm.</p>
