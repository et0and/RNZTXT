            <p>Heavy rain is pounding much of the North Island, with thousands reportedly forced to evacuate a Simple Minds concert in Hamilton early.</p>
        
            <p>The Simple Minds concert in Hamilton's Claudelands Oval as part of the Summer Concert Series was evacuated before the end due to hazardous conditions and lightning.</p>
        
            <p>"A crew member came on stage and told them cut it short," one woman on Facebook said on a Waikato community page.</p>
        
            <p>There were reportedly several thousand people at the concert told to leave.</p>

            <p>Concert-goer Jonathan Hall told RNZ it was a shame the event ended early.</p>
        
            <p>He said a security guard came onstage and told crowds to evacuate at about 6.25pm - five minutes before the show was scheduled to end.</p>
        
            <p>Hall said the crowd seemed calm, but he was disappointed headline act Simple Mind's last song was cut short.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of them would have gone to listen to Simple Minds and that was probably a bit of a fan favourite, the last song," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The last song's usually the one that is a lot of fun and gets people going and it goes off with a bang so it sort of just seemed to fall a bit flat."</p>
        
            <p>Hall said he was unsure why the concert could not continue for a few more minutes, but said it was a good event overall.</p>
        
            <p>Greenstone Entertainment, the organiser of Summer Concert, said the event at Claudelands Oval ended ten minutes early because of thunder and lightning.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ staff member Anastasia Hedge, who was at the concert, said audience members were told to take down all tents and umbrellas during the show due to high wind warnings.</p>
        
            <p>Simple Minds were performing their hit song 'Don't You (Forget About Me)' when the concert was abruptly ended, she said.</p>

            <p>Some attendees voiced concern about the weather on social media earlier today, but were reassured by Greenstone Entertainment that the event would go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The company commented that the concert would only be cancelled if the conditions were considered dangerous by organisers.</p>
        
            <p>Simple Minds had performed in Taupō on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The rain-out comes one year after Elton John was forced to abandon a concert in Auckland during the Anniversary Weekend flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, flooding, debris and slips were making driving conditions treacherous on State Highway 3 north of New Plymouth on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said contractors were on their way to assess State Highway 3 between Awakino and Mahoenui and drivers were advised to take extra care in the area.</p>

            <p>Earlier, MetService upgraded a heavy rain watch to an orange warning for parts of the central North Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Heath Gullery said while the heavy rain and thunderstorms had passed over the central North Island, Bay of Plenty could still be in for downpours and flooding overnight.</p>
        
            <p>He said heavy rain warnings remained in place for inland Bay of Plenty, including the eastern ranges.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still potential for thunderstorms and localised downpours and flooding across the Bay of Plenty tonight and in the east overnight."</p>
        
            <p>People in the central North Island should also continue to take care around rivers and streams, Gullery said, as they could continue to rise for several hours after rainfall.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a slow-moving front is set to bring rain to the Westland District.</p>
        
            <p>The heavy rain watch is still in place for Westland District south of Franz Josef and North Taranaki including the Mountain/Taranaki Maunga until 9pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Thunderstorms may also hit in those regions, with rainfall amounts possibly reaching warning criteria in localised places, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>The heavy rain watch for Fiordland has been lifted as conditions eased there on Sunday morning.</p>
