            <p>Former US President Donald Trump has sought to temper the uproar over his rally at Madison Square Garden - which included a string of racist and vulgar messages from its speakers, including about Puerto Rico - by telling a group in Pennsylvania that "we love" the island.</p>
        
            <p>Trump was participating in what was billed as a roundtable discussion focused on seniors in Delaware County. Trump's rally generated controversy after one comedian described Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage."</p>
        
            <p>The moderator of the Pennsylvania event introduced a retired medical worker he said was "born in Puerto Rico and came to the United States when she was 17." The crowd cheered at the mention of Puerto Rico.</p>
        
            <p>The worker told Trump: "I want you to know that Puerto Rico stands behind you, and Puerto Rico loves you."</p>
        
            <p>The former president responded "Well, we love it. I know it very well, and we helped you through a lot of bad storms - I'll tell you, we've had some really bad ones." He added: "I think no president's done more for Puerto Rico than I have."</p>
