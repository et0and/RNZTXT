            <p>One person has been rescued after becoming trapped inside a car for several hours after it crashed into a New Plymouth home.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they received a report of a vehicle colliding with a house on Riverside Drive in Merrilands about 9.15am.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said crews rescued the sole occupant of the car who had been trapped underneath the house on Riverside Drive in Merrilands.</p>
        
            <p>They say it took several hours to pull the car out with a fire truck due to the position of the car.</p>
        
            <p>They don't believe anyone was inside the home, and said there were no other injuries.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ confirmed power lines were knocked down during the crash and power was off in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the fallen lines also made it difficult for them to get to the driver safely.</p>
        
            <p>St John said it sent three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, and an operations manager to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>One person had been taken to Taranaki Base Hospital in a moderate condition, St John said.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said the road has been closed while emergency services respond.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists are to avoid the area if possible and expect delays."</p>
