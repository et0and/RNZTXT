            <p>Police have arrested another funeral director in relation to an investigation relating to inappropriate handling of burials at an Auckland cemetery.</p>
        
            <p>The man is the second person to be arrested as police investigate complaints that bodies were disinterred following flooding at the Waikumete Cemetery in early 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Police have also been investigating fraud allegations.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland man arrested on Friday has been charged with obtaining money by deception.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said the investigation was ongoing and police could not rule out further charges being laid.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation team has been looking at allegations that loved ones' remains were inappropriately handled at the cemetery's mausoleum."</p>
        
            <p>Investigators had been working through complex issues and were still keen to hear from other families that may have been impacted or had concerns, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Fiona Bakulich, who is a former employee of Tipene Funerals, was charged with mishandling human remains and nine counts of obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>The charges also related to bodies disinterred at Waikumete Cemetery during flooding in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>She will be sentenced in April.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland man arrested on Friday is expected to appear in Auckland District Court on 20 March.</p>
