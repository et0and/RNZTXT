            <p>A New Zealander living in New York says it's been "very strange and surreal" to experience an earthquake, after a magnitude 4.8 quake rocked the north-east United States.</p>
        
            <p>The rare quake struck around 10.20 on Friday morning local time (3.23am NZT) in New Jersey, and could be felt from Pennsylvania to Connecticut.</p>
        
            <p>In New York, the Statue of Liberty was seen swaying, while planes were grounded.</p>
        
            <p>Rosie Gordon and her flatmate were working at home in the New York borough of Brooklyn when they heard a rumbling that they initially thought was a truck.</p>
        
            <p>"But then it started to get more and more shaky, it got quite strong and I said to her 'I think it's an earthquake'.</p>
        
            <p>"So we ran over to the doorway and put our shoes on, getting ready to go outside and then it faded out and stopped."</p>
        
            <p>Gordon, a former RNZ reporter who now works for the United Nations, said New Yorkers have been "rattled" by the quake.</p>
        
            <p>There have been warnings there could be aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty unusual for New York to have earthquakes.... People have been a little bit cautious and on edge but overall the message from officials has been to go about your day as normal.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily there haven't been any reports of injury or any major damage."</p>
        
            <p>Gordon, who is from Wellington, said while she and her Kiwi flatmate sheltered in a doorway, many residents in her apartment building headed outside.</p>
        
            <p>A British friend was in her high-rise apartment in Manhattan and texted Gordon asking for advice.</p>
        
            <p>"I think people have been pretty nervous.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, I guess it kind of reminds you of home but it was still very strange.</p>
        
            <p>"You just don't expect to experience that kind of thing in New York."</p>
