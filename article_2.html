        <h2>Live: Trump pardons 1500 people charged over January 6 Capitol riots</h2>
        <p>
US President Donald Trump has wasted no time getting stuck into paperwork, signing mountains of orders on his first day back in the office.
</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Donald Trump was sworn in as the president of the United States of America for the second time.</p>
        
            <p>He has wasted no time getting stuck into paperwork, signing dozens of orders on his first day back in office.</p>
        
            <p>One of his most immediate priorities was to pardon about 1500 people who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>His supporters assaulted police and caused damage to buildings as they tried to prevent lawmakers from certifying his 2020 election defeat.</p>
        
            <p>The new president expressed a wish for their immediate release if they had been jailed.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has also signed several executive orders both at a rally with supporters and now in the Oval Office, where he is also signing pardons.</p>
