            <p>The council that pioneered Māori representation in local government says it sees no need to establish a Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>Many councils chose to set up Māori wards at the 2022 elections, but under new legislation, councils must now ratify them by referendum or abolish them.</p>
        
            <p>That edict kindled chaos in the north last week, when protesters disrupted a Kaipara District Council meeting that resolved to scrap its new Māori Ward.</p>
        
            <p>By contrast, the West Coast Regional Council - despite its less-than-progressive reputation in the past - took steps decades ago to ensure mana whenua had seats at the table.</p>
        
            <p>The council has had iwi reps for 35 years, well before Ngāi Tahu settled its Treaty claims.</p>
        
            <p>Council chair Peter Haddock said the stable system had allowed the council to work well with Poutini Ngāi Tahu for more than three decades.</p>
        
            <p>"I suppose we are lucky in that we only have two rūnanga to deal with, Ngāti Waewae in the northern part of the Coast and Ngāti Māhaki (Makaawhio) in the south. "</p>
        
            <p>It might be more complicated for councils in the north, where there are various iwi who may have competing interests, Haddock said.</p>
        
            <p>"But what I can say is iwi reps have always added value to our council with their perspectives and their contributions to debates and decisions."</p>

            <p>Rūnanga chairs Francois Tumahai (Ngati Waewae) and Paul Madgwick (Makaawhio) have full voting rights on the regional council's major committees, but as non-elected members, cannot vote at meetings of the council itself.</p>
        
            <p>Madgwick said that had never bothered him.</p>
        
            <p>"There's the odd time when it would have come in handy, but I'm relaxed about it - we have plenty of influence, and as long as we're listened to and get a fair-enough say, that's fine."</p>
        
            <p>The council/Māori relationship was further strengthened in 2020 when the WCRC and iwi signed up to the country's first Mana Whakahono ā Rohe agreement - a tool designed to help local authorities and tangata whenua agree on how they will work together under the RMA.</p>
        
            <p>The region's three district councils have all followed the West Coast Regional Council example, appointing the Rūnanga chairs and other iwi reps to various committees.</p>
        
            <p>Buller mayor Jamie Cleine said his council's Ngāti Waewae representative Ned Tauwhare worked not only at the governance level but also on project teams.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially on some of our bigger infrastructure projects, Ned has been front and centre, guiding the team and ensuring iwi input each step of the way."</p>
        
            <p>The council could see no point in a Māori ward, and neither could iwi consulted in the recent six-yearly representation review, the mayor said.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly we are guided by Ngāti Waewae in terms of their appetite for any change like a Māori ward; that's not something they supported. "</p>
        
            <p>Despite Tauwhare's inability to vote at full council meetings, the iwi influence was strong, and offers a fresh perspective, the mayor said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a good listener and a circuit breaker - he'll listen to a lot of to and fro from councillors and when he speaks he's often quite profound in encouraging us to think in different ways or take a more strategic long-term view or just remind us of the communities we represent."</p>
        
            <p>Ensuring Māori were represented in local government was not about 'race' as some politicians would have it, Cleine said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about fairness, respecting the status of the indigenous people and our obligations in the Treaty and in law.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a thing that's been a threat to us - it adds to council and should be embraced."</p>
        
            <p>Grey District and Westland councils are also sticking with their current Māori representation models.</p>
