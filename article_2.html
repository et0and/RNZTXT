            <p>An Auckland Councillor says a widespread internet outage in the suburb of Māngere Bridge shows how reliant communities can be on technology.</p>
        
            <p>The internet went down at 5.30am on Monday morning, and was still out with no indication of when it will be restored.</p>
        
            <p>The neighbouring suburb of Onehunga has also been faces outages since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Manukau ward councillor Lotu Fuli said she hoped the community would be back online soon.</p>
        
            <p>"It just shows, I guess, how reliant we have become as a society on these things and on technology, and when it does go wrong, the disruption that it causes to our lives," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I really do hope that it's sorted out as soon as possible so that our families can get back online and get back to work, but especially for our more vulnerable families, our seniors who rely on that for their doctor's appointments for example, our hospitals, our clinics and places like that who may be relying on it for really important equipment."</p>
        
            <p>Internet provider Chorus has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
