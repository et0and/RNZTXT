            <p>The Blues scored a bonus point 38-11 win over the Rebels in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>The result kept the Blues just a point behind the Super Rugby Pacific leaders the Hurricanes who beat the Waratahs 41-12 earlier on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It was a torrid first half with the Blues leading 12-11 at the break.</p>
        
            <p>However the visitors raced away with the game in the last quarter to secure maximum points.</p>
        
            <p>Lock Sam Darry came on and scored a double to blow out the scoreline, with the Blues surviving a yellow card to Harry Plummer.</p>
        
            <p>The class difference proved far greater than the standings might suggest, with the Blues running in five tries to one, with All Black winger Mark Tele'a also finishing with a double.</p>
        
            <p>For the most part the Rebels matched the Blues and judging by statistics midway through the second half, should have been on top.</p>
        
            <p>But the visitors' ability to take advantage of their opportunities and some rock-solid defence proved the difference, delivering an emphatic win in the end, helped by two late tries.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues lost Test back Rieko Ioane to a head clash just before the break.</p>
        
            <p>Melbourne lost both centres David Feliuai (head) and Matt Proctor (head) at the same time, both leaving after 30 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>While the Rebels repeatedly hammered the Blues' tryline and came up empty-handed, the Aucklanders ran in four tries, with Darry's double coming in the 74th and 77th minutes.</p>
