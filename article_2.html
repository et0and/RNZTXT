            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis says the coalition government can afford its promised tax relief, having already carved out $7.47 billion of savings and extra revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury's Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update has reported the economy continues to slow under weaker conditions that have deteriorated the Crown's fiscal outlook.</p>
        
            <p>Willis has now outlined how it plans to tighten public spending while simultaneously safeguarding the delivery of public services and delivering its promised tax relief in Budget 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"The advice we have received so far gives the confidence that we can responsibly deliver the tax relief New Zealanders deserve," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The documents set out $2.61 billion of savings that have already been made since the coalition took office that include scrapping Let's Get Wellington Moving, Fair Pay Agreements and Industry Transformation Plans.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said this dealt with fiscal risks in the government books including the $15 billion liability of Auckland Light Rail and up to $16 billion associated with building a pumped hydro scheme at Lake Onslow.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition was also making savings by stopping Labour's free childcare extension, half-price public transport, clean car discount, work on the RMA reforms, work on the income insurance scheme and half-price public transport.</p>
        
            <p>The mini-Budget confirms the following changes: adjusting benefits in line with inflation (currently wage growth), bringing the bright-line time-period test for rental properties back to two years from 1 July 2024 and removing commercial building depreciation deductions.</p>
        
            <p>It also confirms the coalition's intention to increase interest deductibility for rental properties from April 2024 and to "responsibly deliver income relief measures" in next year's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said the government was progressing work to deliver "meaningful income tax reduction" in next year's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes considering design and implementation advice for the delivery of our proposed Family Boost childcare tax rebate, and for delivering income relief to workers and their families."</p>
        
            <p>The finance minister has directed government agencies to find $1.5b of savings per year, with individual agency targets informed by headcount growth since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>"I have also asked to undertake a 'health-check' on medium and high risk capital projects in the investment pipeline for their agencies, to understand and respond to under-funding, cost blow outs and delivery risks that may exist," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Further work is underway on enabling fully cost-recovery for immigration visa processing, taxing online casino gambling operations, replacing the fees-free policy with a final year fees free policy from 2025, improving the cost-effectiveness of the school lunch programme and stepping up the audit activities of the IRD.</p>
        
            <p>The government will use $2.047b of forecast cash proceeds from the Emissions Trading Scheme as a 'climate dividend' to pay for income tax reduction.</p>
        
            <p>This includes closing the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund (GIDI) which has been subsidising already profitable businesses to reduce emissions, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>The mini-Budget also sets out longer-term work to upgrade the Public Finance Act to provide better oversight of government spending, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>"The mini-Budget draws a line under six years of economic mismanagement," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today our coalition government starts a new chapter for New Zealand's economy, with our focus on reducing cost of living pressures, delivering better value for public money and enabling public enterprise."</p>
        
            <p>The next economic and fiscal update will be at Budget 2024 and will capture the new government's decisions and economic developments.</p>
