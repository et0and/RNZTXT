            <p>Carterton's deputy mayor is "disappointed" and "disgusted" at the response to a proposal to erect a memorial sculpture of the late Georgina Beyer.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just really disappointed at how some people have expressed their views by tearing apart a deceased person and their character when they can't defend themselves," Carterton's Deputy Mayor Dale Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Beyer, who died last year, was elected mayor of Carterton in 1995, making her the world's first openly transgender mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said he was "disgusted" by the comments his council had received regarding a proposal to erect a life-sized bronze statue of Beyer.</p>

            <p>Carterton councillors met on Wednesday to discuss the proposal, but decided to seek public feedback on the idea and potential location before supporting the project further.</p>
        
            <p>The sculpture would be externally funded and has been endorsed by the executors of Beyer's estate. The estimated price to complete the sculpture is between $300,000-$500,000.</p>
        
            <p>Beyer also became the world's first transgender Member of Parliament and was celebrated for her courage, sharp humour, and fierce advocacy of the communities she represented.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said he was "incredibly disappointed" in some of the discussions in the Carterton community about the project and at "how the conversation deteriorated from a discussion around a memorial or public monument into Georgina's character, sexuality, politics, all of that".</p>
        
            <p>"As a human being, I have been disgusted at some of the comments that the council has received and people have said."</p>
        
            <p>Williams did however acknowledge concerns from the community that now was not the time to be discussing the project.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely clear, separating the principle and the person … The two things that have come forward is that it's controversial and it's a distraction.</p>
        
            <p>"Most people are grappling with [the] Long-Term Plan [LTP], with life, with a whole lot of things, and I guess for me … I don't have a strong opinion yes or no, but I believe not now."</p>
        
            <p>He said it could be discussed once the council had completed its LTP process and representation review.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe we can have a responsible and respectful conversation around this particular topic and do fair justice to the person involved".</p>

            <p>Mayor Ron Mark said he had received some emails regarding the proposed memorial sculpture.</p>
        
            <p>"I always remind myself that communities have their top 1 percent and they have their bottom 1 percent".</p>
        
            <p>"Knowing Georgina, as a parliamentary colleague and a friend, she'd be laughing right now because she has always been controversial," Mark said.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything you do, naming a street, putting a little brass plaque down, or putting a memorial up is going to be controversial because that is the nature of Georgina's life.</p>
        
            <p>"Georgie was a controversial mayor, a controversial parliamentarian, but one thing she certainly did was put Carterton on the map.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can't recognise someone who has performed on the international stage, who are we ever going to recognise?"</p>
        
            <p>Many of the comments online regarding the project were focused on the cost and impact on other fund-raising initiatives in the district, or desire to erect a memorial of other mayors who contributed to the town.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors resolved to "seek public feedback on the development of a Georgina Beyer memorial sculpture and location subject to external funding before the end of the calendar year".</p>
