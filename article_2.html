            <p>Muslim leaders in New Zealand admit it has been an uphill task to get food aid into Gaza amid the humanitarian crisis there.</p>
        
            <p>The Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand said the first delivery of food aid has reached an undisclosed camp inside Gaza over the past few days.</p>
        
            <p>The camp is sheltering about 2000 people, predominantly women and children.</p>
        
            <p>The federation's spokesperson Abdur Razzaq said it has been a huge logistics exercise.</p>
        
            <p>
The exact camp cannot be revealed as there are safety concerns for aid workers.

            <p>"It has been a major logistics exercise for us to ensure we can provide cooked food during this fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
        
            <p>"The food had to be precooked and specially packed since there is no fuel or fresh water at this particular camp inside Gaza."</p>
        
            <p>Razzaq said the location of the camp cannot be revealed as aid workers are being targeted by Israeli forces.</p>
        
            <p>
It is the first humanitarian food aid delivered to Gaza from New Zealand.

            <p>"We cannot put our local helpers in such danger, since more than 630 aid workers have already been killed by IDF forces.</p>
        
            <p>"The camp where we have started distributing the cooked meals has about 200 tents and approximately 2000 mainly children and women."</p>
        
            <p>Razzaq said it was the first time the federation had delivered food so directly to provide aid overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also pleased to confirm that FIANZ, with a consortium of international NGOs, has organised for 100 trucks of food, medicine, sanitary and other essential humanitarian supplies to be sent to Gaza via Egypt.</p>
        
            <p>"A small FIANZ team from NZ will also be assisting on the ground with the logistics of this major aid supply."</p>
