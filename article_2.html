        <h2>All Blacks v Italy: The key talking points</h2>
        <p>
Who does Scott Robertson pick for what should be a walk in the park against Italy?

            <p>All Blacks v Italy</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 9.10am Sunday 24 November</p>
        
            <p>Allianz Stadium, Turin</p>

            <p>After five gruelling months, Scott Robertson's first season in charge of the All Blacks comes to a close in Turin.</p>
        
            <p>They face Italy on Sunday morning in what should be a regulation win, so the real question is: Who will be picked to inflict the damage on the hapless home side?</p>

            <p>If Ethan de Groot does not get a run here, then whatever he did to get dropped in the first place must have really pissed Robertson off.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaiti Williams is due a rest, so de Groot really should rotate into the front row.</p>
        
            <p>In saying that, Ofa Tu'ungafasi has been playing well other than unluckily getting pinged for a debatable neck roll in the loss against France.</p>

            <p>The loose forwards are down to Wallace Sititi, Ardie Savea, Peter Lakai and Sam Cane - unless by some miracle Samipeni Finau gets cleared to play.</p>
        
            <p>So the question is which order they go in.</p>
        
            <p>Lakai certainly made an excellent case to start last weekend so does he go to openside and give Savea a rest on the bench?</p>
        
            <p>Cane has played blindside before and Sititi is clearly at home at number eight.</p>

            <p>Few All Blacks have been granted the sort of farewell Cane and TJ Perenara have enjoyed ever since they were named in this year's All Black squad.</p>
        
            <p>Both will certainly play in this test and walk off to the final round of adulation before they both leave, following their triumphant win in the second Bledisloe test that doubled as Cane's 100th test.</p>

            <p>With the news that Harry Plummer is the latest NZ 10 to head overseas, it gives a clear indication that Robertson's chips are all in on Damian McKenzie and Beauden Barrett for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>However, Stephen Perofeta has been sparingly used and may well get a run at first five to give one of them the weekend off.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie has been excellent on this tour after a few frustrating Rugby Championship performances, all three can provide fullback cover as well so are options to wear the 23 jersey.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Here is where it gets interesting because Robertson brought Chay Fihaki into the squad during the Rugby Championship, so he clearly rates the Crusaders wing.</p>
        
            <p>Here is the perfect chance to give Fihaki a run because Caleb Clarke deserves a rest after his outstanding efforts, Mark Tele'a is still in doubt and Sevu Reece deserves to be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>Will Jordan is another wing option to accommodate a combination of McKenzie, Barrett and Perofeta at first five/fullback.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Does Cortez Ratima get another go to try and rectify something from a tough few weeks? Or does Robertson stick with the in form Cam Roigard as presumably the reserve halfback behind Perenara?</p>
        
            <p>David Havili has been holding tackle bags for the tour, with Jordie Barrett's injury last weekend he finds himself with potential call up.</p>
        
            <p>Asafo Aumua and George Bell should be the hookers, with Bell getting some decent minutes after the score blows out.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The last time these sides met there were genuine fears of an upset and that Italy would send the All Blacks crashing out of last year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>That ended up being the most poorly placed bit of pessimism ever as the All Blacks ran up a 96-17 final margin of victory, so really this team will have absolutely no fear of the Italians this time around.</p>
        
            <p>There is no excuse to not try and run the ball from the opening kick-off.</p>
