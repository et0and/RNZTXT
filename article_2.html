            <p>A Wellington woman was horrified when she was handed the bill for her son's uniform this year and discovered she had to pay more than $1000.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington College kit, including a $60 physical education shirt, $260 blazer, $85 shorts, $130 rain jacket and $30 shorts, was the most expensive uniform she had ever bought, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said it seemed tough to have such a high cost at a state school.</p>
        
            <p>She did not want to be identified because her son would be "mortified" but she said she worried about other families.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty unwelcome sized bill. We can stretch to cover it… but it's a huge amount of money. And kids also have to have a laptop so it all adds up."</p>
        
            <p>She said every uniform item had the school's crest on it so she could not buy a cheaper generic version. The uniform was bought from the school's uniform shop.</p>
        
            <p>In a response to RNZ, Wellington College said they would not comment on the cost of uniforms.</p>
        
            <p>At Auckland Grammar, a school jersey is $110, a school shirt $55, a rain jacket $165 and a shirt $50. At Whangarei Boys' High, a jacket is about $100, trousers $90, and blazer $225. Rotorua Girls High jumpers are $100, blouses $40 and skirts between $50 and $60.</p>
        
            <p>Financial coach Shula Newland said uniforms tended to be more expensive for high schools, and it could be a problem for families, particularly if they had depleted their savings over Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"The private school uniforms would be even more, and I do know parents that will live off noodles to send their children to 'good' schools."</p>
        
            <p>Some parents can buy second-hand uniforms from school uniform shops or online.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Fincap, a network of financial mentors, said back-to-school expenses drove families to look for support because they often had to be bought in bulk not long after the financial hit of Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>He said mentors reported that $1000 was not unusual for a uniform and that blazers were particularly expensive.</p>
        
            <p>He said Fincap data showed that the more dependent children someone had, the higher proportion of their income was going to clothing.</p>
        
            <p>"While that is logical, to have double the median clothing spend when you have four or more dependent children … is a lot of money on an already tight annual budget to come up with in bulk for uniforms."</p>
        
            <p>He said Fincap mentors reported that clients often sought support from charities such as Variety, or looked for advances from the Ministry of Social Development.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, lecturer in public health at the University of Otago, Johanna Reidy, told Morning Report that uniforms should encourage school attendance, not be a barrier.</p>
        
            <p>Reidy said the research she had been involved with on the impact of uniforms on education and health had shown there was a place for school uniforms, but they needed to be less complex as a way of reducing cost.</p>
        
            <p>"The more broad research I've been doing into the impact of uniforms on education and health shows that when we are looking globally at most studies, there is a place for school uniforms, easy school uniforms though.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be a very simple one that helps reduce distractions and helps students settle to task."</p>
