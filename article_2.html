            <p>The last surviving member of the 28th Māori Battalion has died at the age of 99.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert Gillies, known as "Bom", served in B company during World War 2 from 1942 to 1945.</p>
        
            <p>Gillies was knighted by Governor General Dame Cindy Kiro in 2022, after previously turning down the knighthood.</p>
        
            <p>This knighthood, he told RNZ at the time, was not for him, but the more than 3000 young Māori who went to fight on foreign lands for Aotearoa, who, in the eyes of the one remaining rangatira, never got the recognition or acknowledgement they deserved.</p>
        
            <p>"All the right people for this honour have died," he said. "I agreed to this for my friends who are passed on, that was my reason for agreeing."</p>
        
            <p>He was born in Rotorua, and attempted to enlist in the battalion twice but failed. It was on his third attempt aged 17 that he was successful - after lying about his age.</p>
        
            <p>He served in B Company during World War II from 1942 to 1945.</p>
        
            <p>When asked what he would tell his 17-year-old self after his experience in the war he simply said, "stay home."</p>
