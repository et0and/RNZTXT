            <p>"It has attempted to take off but hasn't left the ground and run into another plane."</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody is safe," says the reader, who has asked for their name not to be used.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire engine is on its way."</p>
        
            <p>Another person in the area reported to the Bay of Plenty Times that there has been about 4-5 fire trucks rush to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson says police are responding to an incident at Waihi Beach Airfield reported around 1.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency New Zealand northern shift manager Michael Anderson says at the peak of the incident, four fire trucks and one support vehicle from Mayor View and Waihi fire brigades attended the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently there are two trucks on site, and other resources have been stood down.</p>
        
            <p>"The two trucks are there to ensure the area is safe."</p>
