            <p>The father of an Otago University student who died at an overcrowded house party says "it's only a matter of time" before another family loses their child.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin police say this week's student antics on Saint Patrick's Day were some of the worst they've seen with drinking from 4am, couch-burning and half-a-dozen people hit in the head by flying glass bottles.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of people also travelled to the city to join students partying on the streets.</p>
        
            <p>Sophia Crestani died after being crushed on a staircase pile-up at a party hosted in a student flat known as The Manor in October 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner found her death was a tragic but likely preventable accident and made several recommendations, including that Otago University review its approach to disciplining and punishing students after big events that breach its code of conduct.</p>
        
            <p>Her father, Bede Crestani told Checkpoint he was horrified to hear of the incidents in Dunedin on St Patrick's Day.</p>
        
            <p>"Also, seeing students on roofs, it just feels like it's a bell curve and at some point someone's going to die again."</p>
        
            <p>A culture change from the students themselves would have the best long term result, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Parents have a big role to play, we constantly hear of parents saying I did it in my day, you go ahead and do it, it's all a bit of a laugh, and the latest students do more.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately we visit our daughter at a grave, so we know it's not a possibility, it has happened and it's likely."</p>

            <p>Crestani said Otago University was the best in the country in terms of academic achievement but the drinking culture needed to change.</p>
        
            <p>He said government agency support was needed to urgently review safety and whether Otago University had been let down by out of towners and non-students causing problems.</p>
        
            <p>Liquor stores and supermarkets also needed to "step up and see the harm that their products cause".</p>
        
            <p>"There are single sales that could stop, they could limit bottle sales, stop bottle sales at particular events, they could reduce the hours that they're operating..."</p>
        
            <p>Crestani said he was focused on law change, continuing to advocate for safety and speaking up "when dumb things happen".</p>
        
            <p>Otago University's director of student services Claire Gallop said the issue of "interlopers" in North Dunedin on St Patrick's day continued to cause concern.</p>
        
            <p>She said the university was told a large number of students from other tertiary institutions planned to travel to the southern city on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It was "disappointing" the actions of a few reflect poorly on all Otago University students.</p>
        
            <p>While the university code of conduct could apply to Otago University students, it had no jurisdiction over those not enrolled there.</p>
