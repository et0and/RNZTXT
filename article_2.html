        <h2>Football World Cup 2026: Who makes the cut for the All Whites?</h2>
        <p>
With qualification secured, Mathew Nash looks at who will be heading off on next year's World Cup adventure.
</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Analysis - The All Whites are going to the FIFA World Cup. For the first time in 16 years and only the third time overall, New Zealand's men are heading to the grandest football showpiece, following a 3-0 victory over New Caledonia in their final Oceania Football Confederation qualifier earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>It's potentially a once in a lifetime opportunity for many of these players and after three World Cup cycles in the wilderness, one that is long overdue for the All Whites.</p>
        
            <p>So it was no wonder to see so much excitement on faces at Eden Park as the reality of the achievement, and opportunity it provides, set in. But not everybody will be left happy. Nations can only name 26 players to take with them to the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada next June - leaving head coach Darren Bazeley with some tough choices and conversations in a little over a year's time.</p>
        
            <p>A lot can happen between now and then but, right now, who looks likely to be on the plane, who might be left on the tarmac and are there any wildcards that might make a late dash to the check-in gate?</p>
        
            <p>On the plane - Max Crocombe, Alex Paulsen, Oli Sail</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The only question All Whites fans will have around the latter duo is who should start. Bazeley clearly prefers the experience of Crocombe, who has become the number one under his management. Paulsen's push may rest on where he ends up next season, following a successful loan at Auckland FC from Premier League side AFC Bournemouth.</p>
        
            <p>Oli Sail seems the most likely to join them as a three man goalkeeping unit.</p>
        
            <p>Late check-ins: Alby Kelly-Heald, Henry Gray</p>
        
            <p>This will largely depend on whether New Zealand take three or four goalkeepers. A fourth slot could open up a spot for one of New Zealand's young stoppers to take in the experience, with Phoenix breakthrough Kelly-Heald and Ipswich talent Gray the most likely.</p>
        
            <p>On the plane: Libby Cacace, Francis de Vries, Tim Payne, Michael Boxall, Tyler Bindon, Nando Pijnaker</p>

</p>
        
            <p>It seems the two left-back positions are sewn up. Cacace is vice-captain and playing in the Italian top-flight while Auckland's de Vries is currently in career-best form and is a weapon from set-pieces. At right-back, Tim Payne appears to have the trust of his manager but there are potential question marks over his back-up. At centre-back, Boxall has emerged as the leader of this back-line while Bindon looks like an All Whites star for years to come. Pijnaker should also be a shoo-in, even if not as a starter.</p>
        
            <p>Waiting at the gate: Storm Roux, Tommy Smith, Finn Surman, Bill Tuiloma</p>
        
            <p>Central Coast full-back Roux currently has the role of Payne's back-up, and he will need to ensure performances stay high to maintain that status into next year. At centre-back, Smith would bring valuable experience to the squad and as long as he's playing regularly should be boarding. Surman and Tuiloma both find themselves struggling for minutes in Major League Soccer but one, if not both, will likely be playing in their adopted homeland.</p>
        
            <p>Late check-in: Callan Elliot, Sam Sutton, Isaac Hughes</p>
        
            <p>Elliot has proved a more than able deputy for Hiroki Sakai at Auckland this season and, if game time becomes more frequent, will no doubt rival Roux for that back-up right-back slot. Sutton and Hughes are two players with immense ability, but both have struggled for consistency at the Wellington Phoenix this season. Rediscover that, and they might be in with a shout.</p>
        
            <p>On the plane: Marko Stamenic, Joe Bell, Ben Old, Sarpreet Singh</p>

            <p>Absolute shoe-ins. These four represent the New Zealand players with perhaps the best innate ability. Stamenic and Bell will likely form the double pivot, both competent defensively and offensively. Meanwhile, Old and Singh have the creativity and spark to create chances out of nothing. Club game time and fitness issues aside, these four should have the pick of the seats on any flight next June.</p>
        
            <p>Waiting at the gate: Alex Rufer, Matt Garbett, Callum McCowatt, Eli Just, Cam Howieson </p>
        
            <p>Phoenix captain Rufer has re-established himself as a vital member of the All Whites set-up and that should remain the case, given the defensive sturdiness he provides. Garbett will likely join him, once he finds a solution to his current club woes at Dutch side NAC Breda. McCowatt and Just are another pair of regulars who would be disappointed if not selected while Howieson will hope to get the nod as the final central-midfield pillar.</p>
        
            <p>Late check-in: Ryan Thomas, Matt Dibley-Dias, Lachlan Bayliss</p>
        
            <p>The door is open for Thomas, arguably the most naturally gifted player to come out of Aotearoa this generation, to return to the fold should he see fit. His once promising career has been decimated by a series of knee injuries, but he's fit again and playing for PEC Zwolle in Holland and would be a wildcard return to the All Whites set-up.</p>
        
            <p>Talented youngsters Dibley-Dias and Bayliss will both have an eye on a first cap in the coming years, but the World Cup is likely to come too soon.</p>
        
            <p>On the plane: Chris Wood, Kosta Barbarouses</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Bar injury, illness, scandal or an act of god, Wood will be on that plane next year. He's the captain, record goalscorer and talisman of this New Zealand side and is currently chasing a 20-goal Premier League season.</p>
        
            <p>As for Barbarouses, he brings a different quality to the front-line which was needed off the bench against New Caledonia and he deserves a shot at a World Cup after narrowly missing out in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>Waiting at the gate: Logan Rogerson, Jesse Randall, Ben Waine, Max Mata</p>
        
            <p>Rogerson and Randall have the benefit of being able to play in attack and on the wing, so one might be likely to go. Surely only one of Waine or Mata will fill out the attacking options so it might come down to who is in the best form in the tournament lead-up.</p>
        
            <p>Late check-in: Luke Brooke-Smith</p>
        
            <p>Here's the potential joker in the pack. The 17-year-old has been one of the Wellington Phoenix's only shining lights this season and looks like a future All White. Whether Bazeley and co decide that a World Cup would be good for his development will be dependent on how his next few months go at club level - but don't rule this one out.</p>
        
            <p>Goalkeepers: Max Crocombe, Alex Paulsen, Oli Sail.</p>
        
            <p>Defenders: Libby Cacace, Francis de Vries, Tim Payne, Storm Roux, Tyler Bindon, Michael Boxall, Nando Pijnaker, Tommy Smith, Finn Surman.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielders: Joe Bell, Marko Stamenic, Alex Rufer, Ryan Thomas, Sarpreet Singh, Ben Old, Matt Garbett, Callum McCowatt, Eli Just.</p>
        
            <p>Forwards: Chris Wood, Logan Rogerson, Kosta Barbarouses, Max Mata, Luke Brooke-Smith.</p>
