            <p>The man accused of shooting and killing Albert Enoka in Lower Hutt earlier this month can now be named as Wipuhara Kapene.</p>
        
            <p>Enoka, who was a member of the Tribesmen gang and a former president of the Rebels Motorcycle Club's Christchurch chapter, died on 10 December after being shot on Seddon Street in Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>He was found critically injured about 3.15pm, but died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was then launched and police began searching for Kapene, saying he was armed and dangerous, and should not be approached.</p>
        
            <p>Kapene was arrested and charged with murder on Christmas Eve after police executed a number of search warrants in Wairarapa - although they did not at the time name the man arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Kapene appeared at the Wellington District Court from prison via AVL on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The charges of murder and possession of a firearm were transferred to the High Court in Wellington, where he will appear in January.</p>
        
            <p>Kapene told the court he wanted name suppression, but no application was entered, given his name had widely been reported in relation to the case.</p>
