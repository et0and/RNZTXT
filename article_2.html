            <p>Comedian James Nokise hopes his Topp Prize win inspires more Pasifika to achieve whatever they aspire to.</p>
        
            <p>The third annual Topp Prize, presented by the New Zealand Comedy Trust, honours individuals who "push boundaries and inspire through their work".</p>
        
            <p>"I talk to my Pacific academic friends and they're like, well, you know, you're the first one … I'm always just hoping someone sees me doing this and goes 'I could do that' or 'I could do it better'," the Samoan/Welsh stand-up comic says.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope there's more Pacific representation in not just comedy, but podcasts and journalism and a little bit more fearlessness in the next generation coming up."</p>
        
            <p>Nokise says he found out about his win after getting "tricked" into calling the Trust to advise on some podcasts - another field he's received acclaim for including RNZ/PMN podcast Fair Game: Pacific Rugby Against the World and RNZ podcast Eating Fried Chicken in the Shower.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not really processing it properly because I'm still working and doing end of year things, so I haven't really put it together properly. I still feel like I'm working."</p>
        
            <p>He says it is a "wonderful full-circle moment" to receive a prize from the Topp twins, who he first saw perform live whilst working front of house at Spiegeltent.</p>
        
            <p>For him, having a chance at meeting the twins means more than the $15,000 cash grant from the Trust.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I'm going to have to spend most of it buying the plane ticket to come home," Nokise jokes.</p>
        
            <p>"My mum really wants to meet the Topp twins … I'd love for them to put their name on it, I think that's actually more to me than the cash prize.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'd love to shake their hands and say thank you for trusting me with your name."</p>

            <p>The panel - led by comedy industry legend Paul Horan - paid tribute to Nokise's contributions to the arts and comedy as playwright, columnist, podcaster, theatre maker, and social commentator.</p>
        
            <p>"His contributions to the comedy industry go beyond his own achievements, as he continuously uplifts his peers and champions the arts community," says Lauren Whitney, chief executive of the New Zealand Comedy Trust.</p>
        
            <p>"From directing beloved comedians like Tofiga and James Roque to advocating for diversity and inclusion, James exemplifies what the Topp Prize is all about-creativity, courage, and a deep commitment to his community."</p>
        
            <p>The seasoned performer's 20-year career has seen him come a long way since his breakthrough in TV talent show Pulp Comedy in his first year of doing stand-up.</p>
        
            <p>He has earned multiple awards, including best male comedian at the NZ Comedy Guild Awards (2013) and the Fred Award for best New Zealand show (2019) for his show God Damn Fancy Man.</p>
        
            <p>His latest project is the RNZ/ABC podcast The Last Voyage of the Rainbow Warrior, where he investigates the 1985 bombing of Greenpeace's flagship and the devastating impact of nuclear testing in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of my career has been taking a chance on projects that seemed a stretch," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"But that's how you end up performing poetry with a DJ in the British Museum, or covering the 100m finals at the Paris Olympics, or interviewing survivors of Nuclear fallout in the Marshall Islands.</p>
        
            <p>"Comedy is about empathy and connection and joy, and in these times that can really give people the energy to tell their stories."</p>
