            <p>A try at the death to replacement Elliott Daly has secured a dramatic 26-25 win for England over France this morning at Allianz Stadium in London. Fin Smith converted to give England the lead for only the second time in the match, completing a massive upset victory.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, a tight first half saw the sides locked at a try apiece at halftime. France had completely dominated territory and possession, however the wet conditions meant several chances were bombed with the tryline begging.</p>
        
            <p>The match broke into life on the hour mark, with English winger Tommy Freeman scoring a spectacluar try, only for France to hit right back through Damian Penaud.</p>
        
            <p>From there both sides ran the ball in a wild last 20 minutes, first prop Fin Baxter put England ahead with a try in the 70th minute, then Louis Bielle-Biarry looked to have won the game for France with a try five minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>The win reversed a long run of England capitulating at the business end of test matches, and puts their Six Nations campaign right back on track after a first up loss to Ireland last weekend.</p>
