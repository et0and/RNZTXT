            <p>A third of the country's free budgeting services face closure during a cost of living crisis, after missing out on the latest round of government funding.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has confirmed it will no longer fund 44 of the current 132 budgeting services, due to a change in the funding model and the end of a cash boost given during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month it said the Building Financial Services funding had dropped from $22.3 million last year to $19.5 million from 1 July, but did not confirm how many services would miss out on the funding.</p>
        
            <p>In Whangarei, Anglican Care's free budgeting service has run for 30 years and employs six financial mentors who currently help 520 clients.</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson Angela McGregor said it was a shock to learn the service would not receive government funding for the next three years under the new funding model.</p>
        
            <p>She said 30 more people were asking for budgeting help each month and they had planned to expand.</p>
        
            <p>"We applied for $300,000 because of the need. We wanted to employ more financial capability mentors to give those who haven't a voice, a voice and help them and their wider communities."</p>
        
            <p>McGregor called a special meeting for all staff last Friday to tell them the funding had been cut.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in tears... they were absolutely devastated because they felt that things had been going so well and now, nothing," McGregor said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our worry is that we won't be able to provide the services that we have been up till this point."</p>
        
            <p>She said they could continue operating the budgeting service until the end of this year, if they used cash reserves.</p>
        
            <p>"We do have some reserves which we are having to work really hard to access. If we have those we can last till Christmas, that's it."</p>
        
            <p>McGregor said they provide wraparound services, and budgeting was an important part of their holistic approach.</p>
        
            <p>"We would not diminish the service, we would either be here fully operating or we're not here."</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, she said they were praying for a miracle and looking at creative ways to find funding at short notice.</p>
        
            <p>MSD said the 88 budgeting services it would be funding "have a strong connection and presence in their communities and understand the unique needs of the people they work with".</p>
