            <p>The Tahuna Golf Club is bringing to an end more than half a century of tradition by getting rid of the flock of sheep that has long kept its fairways trim.</p>
        
            <p>The club, some 120km south of Auckland in the Waikato region, made the decision when faced with a bill of $25,000 for replacing 125 ewes this year.</p>
        
            <p>Life member Frank Hopper said another consideration was the desire to attract younger members who might not be happy negotiating the sheep dung as they lined up their iron shots.</p>
        
            <p>Itâ€™s a case of out with the ewe for Tahuna Golf Club | For 55 years the #golf course north of Morrinsville has farmed sheep and used them as greenskeepers to maintain fairways, until a decision last week to sell the sheep https://t.co/f2GefpD9An</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a desire from people to play on a fully-groomed course as opposed to playing with sheep on the course," Hopper told the New Zealand Herald. </p>
        
            <p>"The most obvious reason is that there's no animal crap on the course, it's easier to clean your shoes and gear when you come off the course if it's a groomed course."</p>
        
            <p>While New Zealand's 25 million sheep famously far outnumber its human population of around 5m, the Tahuna club is not the only golf course in the world with ovine groundskeepers.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's Eastern Sward Golf Club near Melbourne introduced sheep, alpacas, ponies and goats in 2019 as part of an environmental experiment to reduce the use of artificial chemicals in grass management.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Eagle Golf Course in Winsen near Hamburg in Germany, which hosts the European Open on the DP World Tour, also uses sheep to keep the rough down.</p>
