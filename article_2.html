            <p>Russia blasted the main children's hospital in Kyiv with a missile in broad daylight on Monday and rained missiles down on other cities across Ukraine, killing at least 36 civilians in the deadliest wave of air strikes for months.</p>
        
            <p>Parents holding babies walked in the street outside the hospital, dazed and sobbing after the rare daylight aerial attack. Windows had been smashed and panels ripped off, and hundreds of Kyiv residents were helping to clear debris.</p>
        
            <p>"It was scary. I couldn't breathe, I was trying to cover (my baby). I was trying to cover him with this cloth so that he could breathe," Svitlana Kravchenko, 33, told Reuters.</p>

            <p>The government proclaimed a day of mourning on Tuesday for one of the worst air attacks of the war, which it said demonstrated that Ukraine urgently needs an upgrade of its air defences from its Western allies.</p>
        
            <p>Air defences shot down 30 of 38 missiles, the air force said. Fifty civilian buildings, including houses, a business centre and two medical facilities were damaged in Kyiv, the central cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro and two eastern cities, the interior minister said.</p>
        
            <p>An online video obtained by Reuters showed a missile falling from the sky towards the children's hospital followed by a large explosion. The location of the video was verified from visible landmarks. The Security Service of Ukraine identified the missile as an Kh-101 cruise missile.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-two people, including two children, were killed in Kyiv and 82 more were wounded in the main missile volley and another strike that came two hours later, officials said.</p>

            <p>Eleven were confirmed dead in the Dnipropetrovsk region and 64 were wounded, regional officials said. Three people were killed in the eastern town of Pokrovsk where missiles hit an industrial facility, the governor said.</p>
        
            <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would retaliate and called on Kyiv's Western allies to give a firm response to the attack.</p>
        
            <p>"We will retaliate against these people, we will deliver a powerful response from our side to Russia, for sure. The question to our partners is: can they respond?" Zelensky who is visiting Poland said during a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.</p>
        
            <p>Diplomats said the United Nations Security Council would meet on Tuesday at the request of Britain, France, Ecuador, Slovenia and the United States.</p>
        
            <p>"We will call out Russia's cowardly and depraved attack on the hospital," Britain's UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward said in an X post.</p>
        
            <p>The Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had carried out strikes on defence industry targets and aviation bases in Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, although its attacks have killed thousands of civilians since it launched its invasion in February 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine's Prosecutor General said he discussed the attacks with International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan, adding that his office would be sharing evidence with the ICC.</p>
        
            <p>The attack came a day before leaders of Nato countries were due to begin a three-day summit of the military alliance that Zelensky is expected to attend, with the war in Ukraine one of the focuses.</p>
        
            <p>"This callous aggression - a total disregard for human life, jeopardising European & Transatlantic security - is why leaders will make significant security commitments to Ukraine this week," the US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, posted on X.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine still lacked enough air defences and urged Kyiv's allies to supply more systems promptly to help protect its cities and infrastructure from regular Russian aerial attacks. Air Force representative Colonel Yuri Ignat said it became more difficult to repel Russian attacks as Moscow's forces kept enhancing their bombardment tactics.</p>
        
            <p>"Enemy missiles are equipped with additional means, including radar and thermal traps," Ignat wrote on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>The missiles flew at extremely low altitudes during Monday's attacks, he said. DTEK, the largest private power producer, said three electricity substations and networks had been damaged in Kyiv. The power system has already sustained so much damage from targeted Russian air strikes that began in March that electricity cuts have become widespread.</p>
        
            <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attack was one of the largest of the war, with the damage registered in seven districts across the city. The Health Minister said that five units of the children's hospital, the largest and best equipped in the country, were damaged and children were evacuated to other facilities.</p>
