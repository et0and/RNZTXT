            <p>Controversy over a proposal to redefine the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi is expected to breathe new life into an annual hīkoi from Cape Rēinga to Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi, or march, has been held almost every year since 1984 though numbers had declined in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>It's likely to get a boost this year thanks to moves by the new government to reduce the use of te reo in the public service, disband the Māori Health Authority, and introduce a Bill to clarify or redefine the existing Treaty principles - which National has said it will support no further than a first reading and select committee.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi will start at dawn on 2 February at Te Rerenga Wairua, or Cape Rēinga, and end five days and 200km later on 6 February, in time for participants to join Waitangi Day commemorations.</p>
        
            <p>Organiser Rueben Taipari said this year's theme - like that of the wider Treaty commemorations - was upholding Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>"It's bigger than a few policies. The Treaty is a living, breathing document, so it needs people to participate in its discussion and defence," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The current government is trying to erase Māori. The purpose of the hīkoi is to raise awareness, to stand up and protect Te Tiriti o Waitangi. They're trying to reduce the capacity for Māori to be Māori, that's what it comes down to."</p>

            <p>Taipari would not put a number on the expected size of this year's hīkoi, but said he would not be surprised if it hit 10,000 over the duration of the march.</p>
        
            <p>He said the ACT Party and others were inadvertently helping the cause.</p>
        
            <p>"These fellows, they don't realise they're doing us a favour. Every time they attack the covenant [of the Treaty] they're just making us stronger."</p>
        
            <p>Taipari said it wasn't just Māori concerned about the current government's direction - many Pākehā had had enough of politicians who didn't want Māori to prosper, or who thought it was still the 1900s.</p>
        
            <p>"That time's gone. The Winston Peters, the Don Brashes - they're out of touch. There's a new world. People who can't see that need to move over, because there's a new future, and Te Tiriti is an integral part of that."</p>
        
            <p>Taipari said Māori should be commended for their capacity to use peaceful means of protest such as hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>Participants will stay at marae along the way and hold rallies in Kaitāia and Taipā.</p>
        
            <p>Rose Raharuhi, who took part in Whina Cooper's 1975 Land March to Parliament, will give a talk during the first night's noho [stay] at Te Hāpua.</p>
        
            <p>The final day, 6 February, will start at 6am at Kawiti Marae, south of Kawakawa, with the group making its way to Tou Rangatira, a series of carvings next to Waitangi's Te Tii Marae at 9am.</p>
        
            <p>The final stage of the hīkoi will involve a walk up the hill to Te Whare Rūnanga [the carved meeting house] at the Treaty Grounds.</p>
