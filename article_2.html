            <p>Armed police are out in the tiny King Country settlement of Marokopa as they hunt for the children of fugitive Tom Phillips.</p>
        
            <p>Police cars and vans have been seen in and about the town as officers target back roads too.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons are on Marokopa and Managtoa roads - the only way in and out of the town that does not even have its own local police station.</p>
        
            <p>Police are casting a wide net and some cordons are set up 15km apart.</p>
        
            <p>One of the cordons was backed by a farm and dense bush. Police said getting into the bush was posing challenges.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter was called in on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>
Marokopa and the surrounding area in the King Country have been the focus of police searches for more than two years.

            <p>"Police believe they're somewhere in this area," RNZ reporter Maia Ingoe said from Marokopa.</p>
        
            <p>There were fewer than 100 homes, and residents were keeping to themselves, she said.</p>
        
            <p>One local said the extra police presence and the media attention on Marokopa was a "nuisance". He did not want any more visitors to the area.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips and the three children have been missing for two-and-a-half years.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrived on Wednesday after issuing an $80,000 reward for information that could lead them to the children, now aged eight, nine and 10.</p>

            <p>Officers have set up four cordons and are checking everyone entering and leaving the community.</p>
        
            <p>Tip-offs about the family have been coming in since the reward was announced on Tuesday but police have not yet revealed how useful it is.</p>
        
            <p>The offer, which includes considering immunity against prosecution for anyone assisting Phillips, lasts for two weeks.</p>

            <p>Ember, eight, Maverick, nine, and Jayda, 10, have been missing since December 2021, when they were taken by Phillips to an unknown location - though police believe it was in Western Waikato within Marokopa or the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Phillips does not have legal custody of the children. He is sought by police and there is a warrant for his arrest," acting detective inspector Andrew Saunders said on Tuesday.</p>
