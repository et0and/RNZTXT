            <p>The government is expected to unveil its long-awaited plan for replacing the Interislander ferries today.</p>
        
            <p>There had been reports it would buy two smaller ships for $900 million - much more than the $551m Labour's paid.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition ditched the previous iRex replacement project because the two mega ferries needed major terminal and port upgrades at Wellington and Picton, which would have pushed the overall cost to $3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, Interislander and its competitor Bluebridge have faced recurring mechanical challenges, with sailings cancelled and passengers reporting difficulty getting alternative bookings.</p>
        
            <p>The government had said its version would be cheaper, even after taking into account the cancellation fees for the former contract.</p>

            <p>Under the new plan, ports may be asked to bear more of the cost, potentially increasing prices for passengers and freight, and the Interislander service may shift to a new Crown-owned company.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Finance Nicola Willis told Parliament she stood by the decision not to increase funding for the project.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident that the government's alternative ferry solution for the Cook Strait will cost less than the i-Rex project that was started under the previous government, and which blew out to a cost of at least $3 billion."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Transporting New Zealand Chief executive Nick Leggett said it wanted a Cook Strait ferry service that was reliable and safe, but he was not too concerned about roll-on roll-off rail capability.</p>
        
            <p>Leggett said the most important thing was a trustworthy inter-island connection that would protect economic productivity.</p>
