            <p>A man who died after falling off the top of a car in Napier on Friday is being remembered as a loving father and beloved teammate.</p>
        
            <p>Police reported that the man was travelling on a mattress on the roof of a station wagon from the Marewa shops, when he fell onto the road at Nuffield Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>Family posting on social media have named the man as Reif Cotter, and a Givealittle page has been set up for his three young children and their mother.</p>
        
            <p>A post by the children's mother Holly Te Ngahue said he was "the most loving" Dad, brother, son and moko.</p>
        
            <p>"Your contagious smile, your willingness to give, your sily antics, the absolute life of any party. We all love you so much Reif," she wrote on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>The Givealittle page, set up by family friends, said Cotters' death was "unexpected" and "tragic".</p>
        
            <p>People are asked to donate to "help Holly and her children adjust to a new life, to be able to enjoy and stay in their home and to do all the nice things like kids' sports and hobbies, now sadly without the support of Reif", the page reads.</p>
        
            <p>Cotter played for the Eskview and Districts Ruby Football Club, and has been remembered as a "beloved teammate".</p>
        
            <p>"A talented winger, Reif brought not only skill to the field but also a contagious cheeky smile that could light up any room," a post on the Clubs' Facebook page reads.</p>
        
            <p>Posts by Te Ngahue on Facebook say the family were expecting Cotters body to be released on Tuesday afternoon, and a service will proceed at the Eskview Rugby Clubrooms on Friday.</p>
