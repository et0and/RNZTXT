            <p>The early signs of improvement in household finances are starting to show and the number of people struggling is peaking, according to a credit bureau.</p>
        
            <p>Centrix managing director Keith McLaughlin told Nine to Noon the number of people seeking assistance because they were struggling to meet mortgage payments had likely peaked.</p>
        
            <p>Those in financial hardship had been trending up for at least two years but with interest rates signalled to continue falling, McLaughlin believed there was relief ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"[That] will put more money into the household budget and make things more affordable, so I think we're probably at the peak now and I would expect that they will start to drop away."</p>
        
            <p>The high number of people having trouble in the mortgage sector was a flow on impact from the past 18 months, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But lenders were now better at working with borrowers to find a flexible solution to see them through, rather than simply opting for a mortgagee sale as they would have done a decade ago, McLaughlin said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been through a very difficult period, and I think everybody knows that.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew that households were struggling, and I think when you get to the situation where it's either a mortgagee sale or a renegotiation with a lender, it's quite good to see that there is a strong communication link between the borrower and the lender to try and resolve the issue without going down the path of perhaps a mortgagee sale."</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin said those struggling financially had cut back on discretionary spending, so buy now pay later services, credit card debt and car loans weren't really an issue.</p>
        
            <p>Rather essentials like power bills, rates and mortgages were where people had been falling behind.</p>
        
            <p>"The trend certainly is downward as far as the arrears is concerned, and that of course will flow into the defaults and into the hardships and any potential mortgagee sales.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing the early signs of improvement in household finances," he said.</p>
