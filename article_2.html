            <p>A leading Māori health advocate is heading a bid in the Waitangi Tribunal to stop the abolition of Te Aka Whai Ora, the Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>The government plans to disestablish the authority in its first 100 days.</p>
        
            <p>Lady Tureiti Moxon and the head of a Māori primary health organisation, Janice Kuka, have made a request for an urgent hearing regarding the government's plans on 8 December.</p>
        
            <p>A Waitangi Tribunal document published on Thursday said they were making the request on behalf of governors, managers, staff and Māori cared for by Māori-owned primary health organisations.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Damian Stone is considering the request and has given the Crown until the end of Monday to reply.</p>
        
            <p>The Māori health authority was set up last year under health reforms, with the aim of giving Māori a greater say in their own healthcare and ending poorer health statistics.</p>
        
            <p>In their Statement of Claim lodged with the tribunal, Lady Tureiti and Kuka said disestablishing the authority would likely prejudicially affect Māori.</p>
        
            <p>There would no longer be a Māori body which aimed to create services to achieve the best possible health outcomes for Māori and promote Māori health.</p>
        
            <p>They pointed out historic underfunding by the crown for Māori health providers and primary health organisations (umbrella groups comprising GP practices and other community health services).</p>
        
            <p>The Crown was supposed to work with Māori to change that, but had not, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Abolishing the authority would be inconsistent with the Treaty principles of tino rangatiratanga, partnership and equity, the claim said.</p>
        
            <p>There is another claim for an urgent Tribunal hearing regarding the government's 100-day plans.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga-based iwi Ngāi Te Rangi is accusing it of breaching the Treaty by failing to protect Te Reo Māori.</p>
