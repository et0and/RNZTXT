            <p>National MP for Ōtaki Tim Costley has apologised for a comment he made about Labour's Grant Robertson in the House.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on the Local Government Amendment Bill last Thursday, Costley had criticised the previous Labour government and accused it of telling people how long they could stay in the shower.</p>
        
            <p>"I just don't fundamentally believe in the concept of, A, 'Wellington knows best and we're just going to tell you how to live your life'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Geez, we had it during the last one, you were getting told how long you're allowed to stay in the shower. I don't like the thought of Grant Robertson inspecting me in the shower, quite frankly. But this is the attitude they've just purveyed from that side of the House."</p>

            <p>Robertson, a former Finance Minister who recently announced his retirement, is openly gay.</p>
        
            <p>He was sitting opposite Mr Costley in the debating chamber at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Costley stood ahead of Question Time on Tuesday, the first time since his comments Parliament had sat, saying he did not intend to cause offence.</p>
        
            <p>"Last Thursday in a debate towards the end of the day, I made an unparliamentary remark which I know some members took offence at. I would like to apologise unreservedly for this, I did not mean to cause offence."</p>
        
            <p>It is understood Robertson raised the comment with Costley after it was made and flagged his concerns about it.</p>
        
            <p>National's Leader of the House Chris Bishop and Labour's Shadow Leader of the House Kieran McAnulty met on Tuesday and agreed Costley should apologise.</p>
