            <p>A post-mortem has confirmed the man who died in Ellerslie received injuries that were "violent, and consistent with foul play", police say.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched following the death of the 66-year-old man at a Celtic Crescent address.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the man's home about 8pm Monday after he was found by a relative. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"While Police had always been treating this investigation as a homicide due to our initial enquiries, the post-mortem has sadly confirmed the injuries received to the victim are violent, and consistent with foul play.</p>
        
            <p>"Police now believe the victim died prior to Sunday afternoon as a result of the injuries sustained," Detective Inspector Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>Beard said police were still appealing for information on the whereabouts of the man's wife.</p>
        
            <p>She was last at the property over the weekend.</p>

            <p>"We are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of Mei Han Chong.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have not yet located 67-year-old, nor the vehicle (a blue Kia Rio, registration NJN927) which belongs to the family.</p>
        
            <p>"No piece of information is insignificant as we work to determine exactly what has occurred."</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday Beard said police had made inquiries to see if Chong has left New Zealand but at this stage that did not appear to be the case.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if she was a suspect, he said they were keeping an open mind about what happened, and she could instead be a victim.</p>
        
            <p>Beard told Checkpoint the car was driven by the deceased man from the North Shore just after 11pm Saturday 4 October. He could not say if his wife was in the car too.</p>
        
            <p>A scene investigation continues and police would remain in the area in the coming days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>
Police said a scene examination would take two or three days.
