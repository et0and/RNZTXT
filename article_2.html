        <h2>ASB Classic women’s singles: good draw for Kiwi Lulu Sun</h2>
        <p>
The relief on tournament director Nicolas Lamperin's face was evident at today's draw for the women's singles.

            <p>ASB Classic tournament director Nicolas Lamperin doesn't give away much, but his emotions were reasonably evident at the conclusion of the draw for this year's women's singles tournament.</p>
        
            <p>After taking over the running of New Zealand's only WTA and ATP tournament, Lamperin has overseen a couple of rough years when it came to the big attractions clashing early. However, the 2025 edition has seen what Lamperin described as a "very balanced" result.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a couple of very good matches in there," he said of the first round of the WTA 250 event, that begins on Monday at the ASB Tennis Centre in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really well-balanced draw and we can see how far they can progress during the week."</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi fans are in the very unfamiliar position of having a genuine contender to support in the women's singles, with fourth seed and world number 40 Lulu Sun drawing Canadian Rebecca Marino in her first-round match. Sun, who was born in Te Anau but grew up in Switzerland, completed a switch back to representing New Zealand earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Lamperin said that having her in Auckland was "really important".</p>

            <p>"She's a clear candidate for the title and already been here for 10 days, training a lot. After the year that she's had, winning a 250 is clearly part of her objectives. If it happens here in Auckland I think that'd be a good thing for all of us."</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old Sun memorably reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in August and was recently named WTA Newcomer of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, number one seeded American Madison Keys plays Italian Lucia Bronzetti first up, while other big names in action include the returning Emma Raducanu against American Robin Montgomery, and perhaps the most intriguing entrant in this year's draw, Naomi Osaka, has been handed a great start by drawing a qualifier in her first match.</p>

            <p>The Japanese former world number one was "top of the list" for Lamperin.</p>
        
            <p>"We had to work hard…it was not easy but we got it done," he said regarding the negotiations to get Osaka to Auckland, however judging by her Instagram output to her 2.8 million followers, it's already been well worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"She's a great ambassador for the sport, I don't know if you've seen her posts but I think Auckland city should definitely sign her to be a tourist ambassador too. It's been great, it's all organic and we haven't asked for anything. She's a former world number one, won four grand slams…she wants to go back to the top. If we can help be part of that journey, we'll be very happy."</p>
        
            <p>The women's singles will be without two-time reigning champ and world number three Coco Gauff, who will instead be competing at the United Cup in Perth. There is still a heavy American presence in the tournament though, with Keys and Montgomery joined by Bernarda Pera, Katie Volynets, Ann Li, Sloane Stephens, Alycia Parks, Amanda Anisimova and Hailey Baptiste.</p>
