            <p>Teenager Gukesh Dommaraju of India became the youngest chess world champion by beating defending champion Ding Liren of China on Friday morning (NZ time) in a dramatic turn of events in the last game of a 14-game match in Singapore.</p>
        
            <p>The 18th world champion is at age 18 four years younger than Garry Kasparov, who had been the youngest world champion since 1985 when he beat Anatoly Karpov.</p>
        
            <p>Gukesh won the game with the black pieces after Ding wilted under pressure and blundered in what commentators considered to be a comfortable position, snatching the title with a final score of 7.5-6.5.</p>
        
            <p>Ding, whose form has plummeted since he beat Russian Ian Nepomniachtchi to claim the crown in 2023, had not won a long-time format "classical" game since January and largely avoided top events in a bid to improve.</p>
        
            <p>But the Chinese player regained confidence after a surprise win in the opening round of the match and, following two wins for Gukesh and eight draws, had evened the score in round 12 with a victory which was acclaimed by several commentators.</p>
        
            <p>The match was a 14-round long-time "classical" event with a prize fund of $2.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>Gukesh had qualified in April by winning the Candidates tournament.</p>
        
            <p>World number one Magnus Carlsen, who had been world champion since 2013, relinquished his title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation.</p>
