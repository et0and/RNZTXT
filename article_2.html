        <h2>ACT MP mistakes Sir Collin Tukuitonga's volunteer role for 'high-paid' position</h2>
        <p>
Sir Collin Tukuitonga says the ACT Party is "not in a position to dictate" whether individuals should resign from their positions.

            <p>Sir Collin Tukuitonga says the ACT Party is "not in a position to dictate" whether individuals should resign from their positions.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Collin earlier this week resigned from his role as Te Whatu Ora National Health Pacific Senate chair, saying he had "no confidence" in the government to deliver outcomes for MƒÅori and Pacific people.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, ACT Party list MP and health spokesperson Todd Stephenson responded, saying "public advisors in high-paid positions" should "get with the programme or get out".</p>
        
            <p>Sir Collin said he was "not sure if ACT appreciate that members of the Pacific Senate are not paid, hence they are not in a position to dictate".</p>
        
            <p>When RNZ Pacific asked Stephenson if he realised the role of chair was a volunteer position, not a paid public sector role, Stephenson said: "I am not aware of the arrangements that they have. It was a government entity that was created under the last government, it must be funded in some respect."</p>
        
            <p>He also praised Sir Collin, saying he "has actually shown leadership" in stepping down.</p>
        
            <p>Stephenson said he was anticipating more resignations.</p>

            <p>"I think there are going to be others in positions that are advising the government that may feel uncomfortable and they need to consider moving on."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, members of the National Pacific Health Senate were mostly "sad" about Sir Collin's departure, but had no plans yet to follow suit. They were yet to regroup following the resignation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad," Dr Kiki Maoate said. "I think Collin is principled about his thinking. He made a decision that feels right regarding what is happening around him and I accept that. His decision is his decision, whether I agree with it or not."</p>
        
            <p>Maoate said he had no plans to step down, and was not aware of any other members choosing to either - he would sooner resign over the workload than who was in government.</p>
        
            <p>As for the hole left behind, Sir Collin said he had helped train others for the role, which he had planned to eventually transition from.</p>
        
            <p>Maoate said he felt more effective as a member.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about the long game... having the debate from the inside-out and around the table," instead of the outside-in, as Sir Collin would have to after stepping down.</p>
