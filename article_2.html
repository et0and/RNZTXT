            <p>At least two people have been killed and others injured when armed men opened fire on a group of journalists who gathered for a government press conference set to announce the reopening of Haiti's largest public hospital, a witness to the attack told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>A journalist and a police officer were killed at the scene, the witness said.</p>
        
            <p>Haiti's national police did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for information.</p>
        
            <p>The attack comes as armed gangs gain territory in Haiti in the face of under-resourced security forces and little international response, and follows several mass killings in the capital and surrounding rural areas.</p>
        
            <p>Haiti's transitional presidential council said in a post on Facebook that the act would not go without consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"We express our sympathy to all the victims' families, in particular, to the Haitian National Police and all the journalists' associations," it said, without confirming the number of people killed.</p>
        
            <p>Journalists were invited to arrive at the hospital from 8 am (1300 GMT) to the press conference in the downtown area of the capital Port-au-Prince with Haiti's new health minister. They were still awaiting the minister when shooting began around 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Duckenson Lorthe Blema was installed in November in a cabinet reshuffle when former Prime Minister Garry Conille was ousted after just six months in office.</p>
        
            <p>The State University of Haiti Hospital, known locally as the General Hospital, is the country's largest public hospital but it has been closed since a March surge in gang attacks that saw former Prime Minister Ariel Henry ousted from power.</p>
        
            <p>In July, authorities celebrated retaking control of the hospital with a press conference in the facility, but Conille was forced to flee alongside security officers and journalists under a flurry of gunfire.</p>
        
            <p>The hospital is in downtown Port-au-Prince, a stone's throw from the central Champ de Mars square, an area that has seen frequent gun battles and clashes between police and a city-wide alliance of gangs known as Viv Ansanm.</p>
        
            <p>Gangs are estimated to control some 80 to 90 percent of the capital, while neighboring countries have been slow to deliver on promises of security support for the Caribbean nation.</p>
        
            <p>An international mission approved last year has so far seen just a fraction of troops deploying, while Haitian calls to shore up its resources by converting it to a peacekeeping force met opposition at the UN Security Council.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the mission, led by Kenya, told Reuters after shooting began that its personnel had not been invited to the conference and it had sent in reinforcements.</p>
        
            <p>Only 24 percent of health facilities in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area are currently operating, according to a recent UN report.</p>
