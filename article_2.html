            <p>If you were walking blissfully with your dog along the beaches on Auckland's west coast last summer, you might have met Fletcher Munsterman.</p>
        
            <p>He was the beach dog warden for the beaches of Whatipu, Karekare, Piha and Te Henga Bethells from December 2023 to July, 2024. It's a role that was created two summers ago to protect beachgoers and wildlife while giving dogs and their owners some roaming space.</p>
        
            <p>"I am always happy to work outside and with any animal I can be around," said Munsterman, 30, an American with a Bachelor of Science in Marine Science and a master's degree in zoology.</p>
        
            <p>Much of his role involved educating owners about the beach rules relating to dogs - where dogs could roam free, where they needed to be on a leash and the areas where they shouldn't be at all. Occasionally, the role meant fining those who repetitively broke those rules. The fine is $300 per dog so more than one dog means more than one fine.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the role was about protecting human families on the beach and the penguin families who inhabit the rocky headlands from overly enthusiastic and occasionally aggressive dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"The little blues [penguins] are beloved and very protected and dogs think they are a very nice snack.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a security guard for penguins."</p>
        
            <p>He went on to a full-time role with Auckland Council's animal management when the beach warden role finished up in July. This summer, he will be the backup beach dog warden.</p>
        
            <p>The job is very weather dependent and Munsterman wouldn't go out on really windy or rainy days. When the weather was fine, Munsterman spent hours each day walking in the sand.</p>
        
            <p>At times, he would sit on the border between the no-leash and the leashed areas just to be a presence for rebellious dog owners. He would watch dog owners turn around or quickly leash their dogs in the distance.</p>
        
            <p>"It kinda felt like a highway cop. People slam on the breaks when they see a cop on the motorway and they are going 110 and they should be doing 100."</p>

            <p>To protect against dog attacks, Munsterman had to wear thick trousers and boots. Not ideal attire when you're walking along black sand beaches in the summer. Munsterman only encountered one dog that he felt unsafe with, but managed to get the dog on the leash.</p>
        
            <p>"Walking down the sand in boots takes training... Sun exhaustion was a bit of a challenge when you're on black sand beaches."</p>
        
            <p>He walked along all his beaches most days taking "analogue" notes with a pen on what was going on dog-wise. At the end of each day, he typed up a report.</p>
        
            <p>By the end of summer, Munsterman knew most of the local dogs by name.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest portion of being a beach dog warden is just being seen and educating owners."</p>
