        <h2>Unusual earthquake activity detected at Mt Ruapehu</h2>
        <p>
The quakes represent something new at the maunga and are not like volcanic tremors, volcanologist says.

            <p>Scientists are investigating what is causing an unusual series of minor earthquakes at Mt Ruapehu.</p>
        
            <p>An uncommon style of small earthquakes have been detected at Mt Ruapehu since mid-February according to a volcanic activity bulletin released by GNS Science on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Duty volcanologist Steven Sherburn said the earthquakes represented something new at Mt Ruapehu, but were not a cause for concern about eruptive activity.</p>
        
            <p>Each earthquake brought less than 10 minutes of ground shaking, and did not visually look like the volcanic tremor traditionally seen at the site, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mt Ruapehu will remain at the lowest volcanic alert level and the aviation colour code remains green - indicating the volcano is in a normal, non-eruptive state.</p>
        
            <p>Sherburn said GNS Science was unable to determine the location and depth of the earthquakes due to their small size and the style of the activity.</p>
        
            <p>It speculated the earthquakes originated near the summit area of the volcano within kilometres' depth beneath the surface as they were only recorded by monitoring stations on the upper part of the volcano.</p>
