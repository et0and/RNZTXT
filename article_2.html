            <p>Australia have claimed SailGP victory on Kiwi waters, as Tom Slingsby steered his three-time champions home in Auckland and the home team failed to reach the final.</p>
        
            <p>After struggling on the opening day, the Black Foils were one point outside the top-three contention for the final, but they were again astray in blustery winds on Sunday, falling behind their rivals to finish fifth overall.</p>
        
            <p>Australia were the most consistent on day one and won the opening race of day two to secure their place in the final, with Great Britain almost as safe.</p>
        
            <p>The real battle was for the third and final spot, with NZ, Spain, Italy and Denmark jostling across the last two races.</p>

            <p>The Kiwis were midfleet in the second race of the day and were dead last off the startline in the third, but worked their way through the field for second - but it was not enough.</p>
        
            <p>After almost toppling over in warm-ups, the Danes won the last two races and that still wasn't enough, as the champion Spaniards grabbed the last spot in third.</p>
