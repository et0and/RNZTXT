            <p>Downpours and thunderstorms are set to hit large parts of the North Island, with the deluge potentially continuing into Boxing Day for some.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a severe thunderstorm watch, covering Northland, Auckland, Coromandel Peninsula, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua, Taupo and Taihape from Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"These thunderstorms may become severe bringing localised rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm per hour," MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips."</p>
        
            <p>The rain is expected to set in from the afternoon, with the watch lasting until 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>A strong winds warning is in place over Remutaka Hill, on State Highway 2.</p>

            <p>SH2 northbound from Wellington has re-opened after it was partially blocked by downed power lines, which were brought down by bad weather combined with probable salt corrosion.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said it might take some time for traffic - which was backed up for several kilometres - to ease.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Electricity said a fault crew had secured the stray wires and another crew was on its way to fix them.</p>
        
            <p>The South Island may be affected by some of the storms too on Monday afternoon and evening.</p>
