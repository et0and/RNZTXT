            <p>Delaney Davidson and Barry Saunders have just released Happiness is Near, their second album together.</p>
        
            <p>They joined Music 101 for a live session from the Futuna Chapel in Karori Wellington - a church designed by architect John Scott.</p>

            <p>The church was designed in such a way as to bring the people and preacher closer, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was designed around the time that the Vatican put out a brief that they'd stopped wanting such deep churches that separated the congregation from the people up preaching.</p>
        
            <p>"So, they made it like a V, so you've got on each V people quite close to the altar, and the person in the middle at the point of the V is much more connected."</p>
        
            <p>The album's title came from an unusual source, Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>"Strangely I used to get Russian TV beamed into my house and there was a woman talking in Russian, and behind her on the wall in English, was written, 'happiness is near'. I thought it was just a lovely thing. So, we expanded the idea."</p>
        
            <p>It had been a fruitful partnership, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes a song has more of me, or sometimes it has more of Barry. But for me, I think the most interesting and successful ones are when they have a real meeting of both of us and a real blend," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>The relationship was an energising one, Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>"Delaney energises me, and I think I do the same with him. And a lot of the time we get to a place and that's what it's all about, really."</p>
