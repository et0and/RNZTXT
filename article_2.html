            <p>Speaking to Sunday Morning's Jim Mora at a point almost halfway into the 3000km New Zealand-long Te Araroa walk, award-winning journalist and author Naomi Arnold shares her tips and magic moments from the adventure.</p>
        
            <p>Arnold is in Picton, having now finished the South Island from her starting point at Bluff at the beginning of 2024, before she heads on to continue the trail in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Most people who tackle the trail walk from north to south, but Arnold recommends starting in Bluff because it allows time to work up to the challenging Richmond Range section, in Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>"The Richmond Ranges are up there with some of the most difficult stuff - also some of the most beautiful," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Walking north also means she crosses paths with more people, with most stopping to chat.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a huge range of people, there's obviously a lot of foreigners ...mostly Europeans and Americans, and then a lot of Kiwis just getting out and enjoying their country.</p>

            <p>The youngest person she has met along the way was an 18-year-old from Australia, and the oldest was a gentleman from Whangārei in his 70s.</p>
        
            <p>Te Araroa is said to be very difficult when weighed up against similar trails overseas: "I hear that it's up there with the hardest ones."</p>
        
            <p>"People who've done the Pacific Crest Trail or the other ones in America say this is definitely way harder than they expected and they're a lot slower than they anticipated.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also quite new, so I think people are still discovering it and maybe seeing how it measures up to the other ones ... but just the variety of terrain, the challenging New Zealand conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"It's marked and you can follow an app on your phone, but it's often not really a trail as much as it is a route through tussock or gorse or mud, or along a beach.</p>
        
            <p>"So it can be really humbling, you can go a lot slower than you think you will, and I think I'm onto my third pair of shoes. The first two got completely destroyed by gorse and blackberry - the fabric just got completely slashed."</p>
        
            <p>She set out on the trip because: "I just wanted to do it."</p>
        
            <p>"And it's been bloody hard and painful.</p>

            <p>"But there have been some moments - like I saw a pair of whio in the Deception River, which is just over Arthur's Pass, and that was just an incredible moment ... just to see them in that river there diving and playing.</p>
        
            <p>"And I've seen so many rifleman-tītitipounamu. There were so many in [Southland's] Takitimu Ranges, they were just filling up that forest and that was brilliant.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been a lot of moments where I've just really been so incredibly grateful to just be out there in the bush and just a lot of silent appreciation of what we have in New Zealand, as well as some good times with people I've met along the way and friends and family too."</p>

            <p>While she crossed paths with many people going the other way, long empty sections where she walked north alone were a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't really experienced loneliness like it before ... especially through that central part of the South Island, people [also walking north] were splintering off into bubbles and you could find yourself between bubbles quite easily."</p>
        
            <p>"I just really craved to be around people, so that was new for me ... but I was always really happy when I got to a campsite or a hut and there were people there."</p>
        
            <p>From Arthur's Pass on she has had company.</p>
        
            <p>"I live in Nelson, so my husband came down and walked 5 days or so with me and then I've had a whole bunch of good friends who've hopped in on the trail all the way from Otira to a couple of days ago, so it's been awesome."</p>
        
            <p>Walking in autumn and coming up on winter presents a challenge, and while Arnold has had mostly dry weather so far, she keeps a close eye on the forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"Now it's falling dark very quickly, so you have to get up in the dark and then really hustle to get your 10 or 12 hours that day done ... then quickly wash up, quickly feed yourself, find everything, get into bed, and then it's dark.</p>
        
            <p>"Then it's dark for 13 hours so then you're just lying there. Then making sure you get up quickly and out the door."</p>

            <p>Her worst moment on the trail so far was due to weather: "Getting caught in a lightning storm walking from Otago into Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>"Over Martha's Saddle, I got to the top of the saddle and looked over into Canterbury and there were these huge dark clouds and thunder and lightning, and that was probably the most scared I've ever been in my life actually.</p>
        
            <p>"I was the highest thing in the landscape, and I was walking along with these poles - these conductors, and it was raining really heavily and the lightning was booming and cracking above me and the thunder was just rolling.</p>
        
            <p>"So I just ran down the hill with the pack and with everything flying and at one point the lightning exploded above my head and I threw my poles away, threw myself on the ground, and just pulled my tent over me and just stayed there waiting for it to pass, it was terrifying."</p>

            <p>For walkers averaging 25km a day, the trail takes around four months to cover all the way.</p>
        
            <p>Her top tip for those interested in taking on the trail is compression socks, which so far seem to help with preventing blisters and wicking away moisture.</p>
        
            <p>"And there's been a few slips and trips, but I haven't had any injuries. I've been lucky so far."</p>

            <p>Her highlights from the South Island Te Araroa trail have been visiting Colac Bay and Riverton, "walking up to Stagg Saddle alongside Lake Tekapo and then looking over at Aoraki-Aorangi there and seeing that mountain change as I slowly walked around it", and coming over Waiau Pass into Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>"And actually any dawn - any time I've managed to wake up early and watch the sun rise and the sky change."</p>
