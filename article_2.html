            <p>The government says it is reforming anti-money laundering laws to help small businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee said current anti-money laundering legislation, which required financial service providers to report all domestic transactions worth more than $10,000 to police, was too complicated.</p>
        
            <p>Reform work had been approved and would streamline the law for businesses, police and the public, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reforms will deliver a critical government priority to cut red tape and improve the quality of regulation.</p>
        
            <p>"My aim is to provide regulatory relief to businesses and the public, enabling law enforcement to crack down on organised crime, and ensuring that New Zealand upholds its international reputation."</p>
        
            <p>The current regulations hurt small businesses that could not afford to have dedicated compliance teams, McKee said. The reforms would deliver "the most significant regulatory relief" since the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act came into force 11 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"The reforms will be undertaken in three parts. The first part is already well-advanced and will deliver immediate relief via two bills - the first of which, the Statutes Amendment Bill, has already been introduced to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"The second part will focus on structural changes and a sustainable funding model, to create a more effective and efficient system. The final part will make additional regulatory changes to implement international standards and deliver a more risk-based system."</p>
        
            <p>ACT campaigned on making anti-money laundering compliance "user-friendly for small businesses", McKee said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have heard from countless New Zealanders that the current regulations are unnecessarily risk-averse, resulting in complicated, repetitive processes. Simple tasks shouldn't be made confusing and difficult to complete."</p>
        
            <p>McKee said she was taking a "pragmatic approach" to the work to ensure that New Zealand still met the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.</p>
        
            <p>"Complying with these standards is important to protect our economy and our international reputation."</p>
