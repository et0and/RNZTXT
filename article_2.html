            <p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown says he is aware of the strong interest in the outcomes of his visit to China.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand government said that the Cook Islands failed to properly consult it on proposed agreements that Brown will be signing in Beijing this week.</p>
        
            <p>Brown's visit to China has ignited debate, both locally and regionally, about the relationship between the Cook Islands and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific understands Cook Islands government ministers also remain in the dark about when a controversial "comprehensive partnership agreement" will be signed in Beijing, but the island's Foreign Minister Tingika Elikana told Cook Islands News that Brown has the full support of his Cabinet ministers.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Thursday, Brown said he would be sharing more details on the visit "in the coming days".</p>
        
            <p>"I want to reassure our people that every conversation is being guided by what is best for the Cook Islands - ensuring that our partnerships support economic growth, environmental sustainability, and national sovereignty," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past few days, we have engaged in critical discussions with leading institutions in marine science, climate resilience, and economic cooperation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>These conversations have opened the door to new areas of collaboration, including:</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the Cook Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration (MFAI) and the Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) would provide further updates today (Thursday NZ time) on the details of meetings, including specific opportunities in the blue economy, scientific research, and trade development.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an important journey for the Cook Islands, and I look forward to sharing more in the coming days as we finalise key agreements," Brown said.</p>
