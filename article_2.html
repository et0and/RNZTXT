            <p>Daryl Mitchell was a big winner at the Indian Premier League player auction in Dubai, bought by the defending champion Chennai Super Kings for $2.7 million.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell - who starred with the bat at the Cricket World Cup - was the subject of a bidding war before the Stephen Fleming-coached Chennai offered the second biggest price ever paid for a Black Cap at the IPL.</p>

            <p>The Super Kings also picked up young Black Caps allrounder Rachin Ravindra for $350,000 while pace bowler Lockie Ferguson is going to Royal Challengers Bangalore for $385,000.</p>
        
            <p>Eight other Black Caps were unsold, including pace bowler Kyle Jamieson, who was picked up for a New Zealand record $2.86m three years ago by the Royal Challengers.</p>

            <p>Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has gathered a coterie of Black Caps at the Super Kings, with Mitchell and Ravindra joining Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner, who were part of last year's title-winning side.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell's bid was the third biggest among 72 players who went under the hammer at the 10-team auction.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Starc attracted an all-time competition record bid of $4.8m from the Kolkata Knight Riders.</p>

            <p>His sum eclipsed that of fellow-Australian pace bowler Pat Cummins, who is heading to Sunrisers Hyderabad for $3.9m, barely a month after leading his country to victory at the 50-over World Cup in India.</p>
        
            <p>Five New Zealanders already had contracts secured for next season - Conway, Santner, Kane Williamson, Trent Boult and Glenn Phillips.</p>
