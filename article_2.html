            <p>A neighbouring bar is setting trading rivalries aside to raise money for the owners of an under-construction Wellington music venue hit by thieves before it has opened its doors.</p>
        
            <p>Little Beer Quarter (LBQ) has been collecting money from beer sales from donated kegs for its competition and close neighbour, Meow, which is behind the planned venture, Meow Nui.</p>
        
            <p>It was a show of solidarity for the highly anticipated music venue, which is yet to announce a new opening date after blowing past its slated August debut.</p>
        
            <p>
Meow Nui was supposed to launch on 31 August but there have been delays.

            <p>LBQ general manager Joe Hirst said a recent theft at Meow Nui prompted him to put out the call for donations.</p>
        
            <p>And local breweries - Mean Doses, Parrot Dog, Hey Day, Garage Project, and Double Vision - stepped up with some kegs.</p>
        
            <p>He said the response from the local hospitality scene was huge.</p>
        
            <p>"They [the brewers] didn't have to do that, especially in the current climate, it's very generous of them."</p>
        
            <p>With all profits from the donated beer sales going to Meow, Hirst said the fact that LBQ was down to its last keg - after only six days of fund-raising - was a testament to the community.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Dean Moses from Mean Doses Brewery said the initiative highlighted Wellington's tight-knit hospitality industry.</p>
        
            <p>"LBQ is next door to Meow. They've always had a really good relationship despite being two bars basically side-by-side.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it speaks volumes about what the industry is like in Wellington, that they're prepared to do that for a bar beside them, and that a whole bunch of other places are willing to jump in and help a colleague try and get up on their feet."</p>

            <p>Meow's under-construction venue, Meow Nui, was due to launch on 31 August, but delays have meant that shows booked there, including Drax Project, Homebrew and the Beths, have had to move.</p>
        
            <p>Moses said the 1000-person venue would significantly add to the vitality and culture of the capital.</p>
        
            <p>A sentiment shared by others out in Wellington on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>LBQ bartender Leo Langridge said the city was crying out for a mid-sized music venue with its own set-up.</p>
        
            <p>"Something that is independently owned, locally owned, and of that size ... I think it's an excellent idea."</p>
        
            <p>Meow punters Sophie Kirby and Martin McKee agreed, saying the space would be "revolutionary" and they would "absolutely" go to gigs there.</p>
        
            <p>McKee said he was already anticipating a jazz show in the new space on 19 October and was hopeful it would still go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Meow Nui co-owner Damian Jones declined to comment.</p>
