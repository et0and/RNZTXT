        <h2>Police settle claims over staff treatment after Covid-19 vaccine refusals</h2>
        <p>
The claims were lodged in May 2022 on behalf of 91 staff after the High Court ruled a vaccine mandate for police was unlawful.

            <p>The police have settled personal grievance claims over how dozens of staff were treated over refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>The claims were lodged in May 2022 on behalf of [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/473962/covid-19-vaccine-sequel-dozens-of-police-staff-take-personal-grievance-case</p>
        
            <p>91 staff] after the High Court ruled a vaccine mandate for police was unlawful.</p>
        
            <p>It would have restricted the roles unvaccinated staff could carry out.</p>
        
            <p>Employees complained about how long it took for them to return to work, their roles, their treatment by other staff and the police's new vaccination policy.</p>
        
            <p>In August, police tweaked the policy to say vaccination was not "expected", but was "encouraged".</p>
        
            <p>The police now say that 41 individual grievances have been settled via confidential settlement, while others were withdrawn or not pursued.</p>
        
            <p>The police withheld any information about what it has cost them.</p>
        
            <p>They had engaged in resolution with firm Frontline Law, which has been approached for comment.</p>
