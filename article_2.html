            <p>American rapper Nicki Minaj on Saturday cancelled a show in Manchester, England, after she said she was held by police at Amsterdam Schiphol airport on allegations of possession of soft drugs.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight's show happen, the events of today have made it impossible," the Co-op Live venue in Manchester said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
        
            <p>Minaj, 41, was detained hours before the show had been scheduled to start.</p>
        
            <p>Dutch military police confirmed a 41-year-old American woman had been held for possession of soft drugs on Saturday, adding it was prohibited to take such substances out of the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>Police did not identify the suspect, but in a later post on social media platform X said the woman had been fined and released around 19.45 GMT (7.45am Sunday NZT).</p>
        
            <p>That was 45 minutes after Minaj had been due to begin performing at the Manchester Co-op Live.</p>
        
            <p>The singer had earlier posted a video on X in which a Schiphol employee apparently told her that police wanted to "search all her luggage".</p>
        
            <p>Another video on her social media showed a police officer telling her she was "carrying drugs". In the video Minaj denies that.</p>
        
            <p>"Now they said they found weed & that another group of ppl have to come here to weigh the pre-rolls," she said in a following post.</p>
        
            <p>The former American Idol judge played a show in Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome on Thursday and is due to return there for another show on June 2.</p>
