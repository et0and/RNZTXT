            <p>Novak Djokovic has retired injured after losing the first set 7-6(5) against Alex Zverev on Friday to put the German through to his first Australian Open final.</p>
        
            <p>Zverev will meet the winner of the Jannik Sinner and Ben Shelton match in Sunday's decider as he bids for his first Grand Slam title.</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic's long wait for a record 25th major title will go on, a year after he exited Melbourne Park with a semi-final loss to Sinner.</p>
        
            <p>There were doubts about his fitness ahead of the match and he came out at Rod Laver Arena with his left thigh strapped.</p>
        
            <p>But there was little indication Djokovic was struggling until late in the set when he noticeably began trudging slowly between points and muttering in frustration at his players' box.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the set, he promptly informed Zverev that he could not go on and shook hands with the chair umpire before exiting to a chorus of boos from the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"The very first thing I want to say is, please guys, don't boo a player when he goes out with injury," Zverev said in his on-court interview.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that everybody paid for tickets and wants to see hopefully a five-set match.</p>
        
            <p>"He has won this tournament with an abdominal tear, won this tournament with a hamstring injury.</p>
        
            <p>"So please show some respect."</p>

            <p>Nine commentator John McEnroe was critical of the crowd for booing when the chair umpire announced the Serbian could no longer continue.</p>
        
            <p>As he exited the arena, he raised two thumbs toward the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"They can't be booing him, for God's sake," McEnroe said in commentary.</p>
        
            <p>"He has won this 10 times. Unreal."</p>
        
            <p>Former Australian player John Millman has also slammed fans.</p>
        
            <p>"The crowds have been questioned a lot and rightly so," Millman said on Nine.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't care how much you've spent on your ticket, have some respect."</p>

            <p>In his post-match interview, Djokovic has shed some light on why he retired.</p>
        
            <p>"I did everything I possibly could to manage the muscle tear I had," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"An unfortunate ending, but I tried."</p>
        
            <p>He also described the match as an "uphill battle" and that he didn't hit a ball since his match with Carlos Alcaraz until his warm-up 90 minutes before the semifinals.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if this was his last Australian Open, Djokovic said: "I don't know. There is a chance."</p>
