        <h2>'Continuity is key': How getting a regular GP could help life expectancy</h2>
        <p>
Leading family doctors warn some people are not getting the care they need - or even having their lives cut short - because they cannot find a regular GP.

            <p>Leading family doctors warn some people are not getting the care they need - or even having their lives cut short - because they cannot find a regular GP.</p>
        
            <p>The College of General Practitioners medical director Luke Bradford said there was mounting international evidence that showed "continuity is key" when it came to primary care.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a Norwegian study published last year, involving millions of people, which found those who had the same GP had fewer hospital admissions and used after-hours services less.</p>
        
            <p>"At the 15-year mark, people who have had the same GP - and know that GP and the GP knows them - have a 25 percent decrease in all-cause mortality."</p>
        
            <p>Porirua GP Bryan Betty, chair of General Practice New Zealand, said the Norwegian research confirmed what doctors already knew.</p>
        
            <p>"When you know your patients, you can see changes over time. You know their history."</p>
        
            <p>It also meant patients knew where to seek help when they needed it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kaitaia local Ellen no longer has a regular doctor.</p>
        
            <p>"When you go there it's a fresh trauma because you have to tell your story all over again.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had doctors before, I've had them for years. I don't have to go through that, talking about me and my stuff over and over again like you do here. You get sick of it."</p>
        
            <p>Māori in particular did not feel comfortable discussing health problems with someone they did not know, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The threshold for Māori going to the hospital, the doctor, is high anyway. It just got higher."</p>
        
            <p>The latest Te Whatu Ora data shows preventable hospital admissions (for illnesses which should have been treated earlier) are up nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>For babies and pre-schoolers, the rate shot up by 35 percent in the year to June.</p>
        
            <p>Most of those children were suffering conditions such as skin infections, tummy bugs and pneumonia, which would not have put them in hospital if they had seen a doctor earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland was hit particularly hard with rates soaring by more than 60 percent.</p>
        
            <p>At Dr Mamaeroa David's Henderson clinic, it has eight walk-in appointments every day for children who need urgent care - but it is not enrolling more patients.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a question of, 'do we keep going until we explode?' Or is there a point at which you just say 'stop'. So we've had closed books for more than three months now."</p>
        
            <p>A survey last year by General Practice New Zealand found more than half of its member clinics had closed their books.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Betty said half of all medical graduates should be going into primary care, just to replace those who are retiring - but only about 15 percent have expressed an interest.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not have enough general practitioners in this country therefore the workloads are going up substantially.</p>
        
            <p>"In response to this, a number of GPs are not giving up their practice necessarily, but they are cutting back their hours to make it manageable.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's a hidden problem within the system."</p>
        
            <p>Back in Kaitaia, Ellen feels fortunate to be enrolled with a practice, even though she no longer has a regular doctor.</p>
        
            <p>Her diabetic brother struggled to get a GP after he was deported from Australia, and her granddaughter could not find a doctor who would take on her and her newborn baby.</p>
        
            <p>"She couldn't get her baby into the doctor's so we were left trying to find some way to get her into the doctor.</p>
        
            <p>"The father ended up taking her into the doctor because he had a doctor."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora data showed as of 31 October, there were 4,943,113 people (96 percent of the population) enrolled with a primary health organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Based on the current estimated population of New Zealand at 5,239,017, that means about 295,904 are without a GP - a rise of 144,254 (95 percent) since before the start of the pandemic at 151,650 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>However, the situation has improved since two years ago 2021, when it hit a peak of 344,851 or 6.5 percent of the population. About 17 percent of Māori are not enrolled.</p>
