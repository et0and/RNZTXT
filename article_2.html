            <p>New Zealand police are part of a global operation targeting AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
        
            <p>Led by Danish law enforcement and supported by Europol, 25 arrests were made across 21 countries on 26 February - no arrests were made in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Online Child Exploitation Across New Zealand Team (OCEANZ) are cracking-down and investigating potential offending in New Zealand - no arrests have been made in the country yet.</p>
        
            <p>Detective senior sergeant Kepal Richards, officer in charge OCEANZ, said Operation Cumberland was the first of its kind.</p>
        
            <p>Richards said the operation targeted "a 'professional' producer of fully AI-generated CSAM, based in Denmark, and the individuals across the world who paid for his content".</p>
        
            <p>"A significant amount of work has been undertaken internationally to track and identify individuals distributing the abuse material, which showed disturbing portrayals of computer-generated children of various ages."</p>
        
            <p>He said AI-generated abuse material was a growing issue for police around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"Even when imagery doesn't depict 'real' victims, the material adds to an ecosystem that incites and glorifies the sexual abuse and harm of children.</p>
        
            <p>"AI-generated child abuse material can be so realistic that resources are diverted from identifying real-life child victims, placing those children at ongoing risk of harm."</p>
        
            <p>However, Richards said the focus on arresting those responsible for creating the content was "growing".</p>
        
            <p>Police continue to work closely with international partners to combat the exploitation of children, he said.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, creating, possessing or distributing material that tends to promote or support the sexual exploitation of children is punishable.</p>
