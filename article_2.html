            <p>A Whangaparāoa man watched the famous golden arches at a local McDonald's burst into flames late last night.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand were called to the scene on Whangaparāoa Rd, north of Auckland, at about 11.30pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters had to wait for electricity to be turned off, before they could extinguish the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Andrew Hill said the McDonald's sign was flickering moments before it went up in smoke.</p>
        
            <p>"Within a matter of minutes, it engulfed into flames ... the smoke was just incredibly thick and very, very toxic," Hill said.</p>
        
            <p>He was standing about 15 metres from the sign, but could feel the heat and smell burning plastic, he said.</p>

            <p>"I was quite amazed to see a sign that could just engulf within a matter of minutes," Hill said.</p>
        
            <p>He checked to see if anyone was left in the building, before calling emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>Hill wanted to thank the volunteer fire brigade, which arrived on the scene in about 10 minutes, for being so prompt in getting the fire under control.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a shout out to our volunteers ... many of them have other jobs to do, families to look after, but when it comes to an emergency they're there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was disappointing that the sign, which he said had been flickering since June, was not fixed sooner, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit of a concern from maintenance," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, McDonald's said it was investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The company said the restaurant was closed at the time and staff where finishing up and cleaning when the incident occurred.</p>
