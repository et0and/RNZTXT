            <p>A former staff member of St Bede's College in Christchurch who has been charged with historical sexual offending can now be revealed as Father Rowan Maxwell Donoghue.</p>
        
            <p>The 68-year-old was due to appear in court on 10 March, but now can be named as his fight for name suppression has been abandoned.</p>
        
            <p>His Lawyer, Josh Lucas said that after taking legal advice, he abandoned the appeal against name suppression today.</p>
        
            <p>"Father Donoghue is relying on the justice system to deliver a fair outcome to the charges made against him, for all parties concerned.</p>
        
            <p>"He asks for privacy and will not be available for further comment or information so as to ensure that a just conclusion to these proceedings can occur," a statement said.</p>
        
            <p>The former staff member is facing 11 charges in total, including six counts of indecent assault on a boy between 12 and 16, three charges for indecent assault on a man/boy over 16 and two counts of unlawful sexual connection with a male over 16.</p>
        
            <p>He held a number of positions of responsibility involving young people for many years, including prior to the years in which the alleged offending took place.</p>
        
            <p>Police are now encouraging anyone who has information that could be relevant to the investigation to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand incidents of this kind are traumatic and can be difficult to discuss with anyone, including Police.</p>
        
            <p>"We wish to offer reassurance that you will be treated with dignity and respect, we have detectives dedicated to this case and we will ensure you have a safe space to report offending in confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"You can make a report at your local Police station or contact Police on 105 online referencing file number: 230122/3143," a statement from police said.</p>
