            <p>A lawyer caught with explicit images of children that he shared on social media has been banned from practising again, a move he did not challenge at a disciplinary hearing this week.</p>
        
            <p>Vaughn Hill, 46, was previously the co-director of a Far North general practice law firm specialising in conveyancing, wills, enduring powers of attorney and small business transactions. He did not oppose the ban.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2023, his career abruptly came to a halt when Customs searched his home, seizing electronic devices and arresting him.</p>
        
            <p>According to a Customs statement, forensics specialists established he had shared child sexual abuse material on social media, which included depictions of bestiality, rape and torture.</p>
        
            <p>His offending was discovered after Customs received a referral from the United States-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) after an overseas-based social media platform alleged a New Zealander had exported objectionable publications to its platform.</p>
        
            <p>Hill had also been engaging in chatroom conversations about sexually abusing children.</p>
        
            <p>He was charged with eight counts of possession, export and distribution of objectionable material and sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>His offending triggered the Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal (LCDT) to investigate Hill's fitness to practise as a lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the tribunal decided his fate.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing lasted seven minutes in the absence of Hill, who is still in prison and was represented by Matthew Mortimer-Wang.</p>
        
            <p>"A strike off is the correct outcome," Mortimer-Wang submitted.</p>
        
            <p>Tribunal chairman Dale Clarkson said from submissions filed, Hill had agreed to his acceptance of the charges and his unfitness to practise as a lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>Accordingly, an order that Hill's name be struck off the roll was made.</p>
