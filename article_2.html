            <p>A pair of boots worn by one of rugby league's best on its grandest stage have been stolen from the club they were gifted to.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby league star James Fisher-Harris donated his 2021 NRL premiership-winning boots to the Motukohu Rugby Club in the Far North, the area the powerful prop played his junior footy.</p>
        
            <p>The new Warrior was gutted to hear that someone had stolen the boots along with several other pieces of memorabilia from the club.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty shit aye to be honest. That's our neighbourhood. Pretty disappointed with that. It's a tight-knit community. I don't know why someone would do that.</p>
        
            <p>"Usually we just look out for each other, surely it's not a local."</p>
        
            <p>JFH started at prop for the Penrith Panthers in the final, which they won 14-12.</p>
        
            <p>Of course it's not about any monetary loss for JFH.</p>
        
            <p>"I get boots and stuff, I just have to sign it and give it back. I also got Nath (Nathan Cleary) to sign some boots, but it's just the values and stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"It really pisses me off and everyone from up north."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis captain had a message for the person who took them: "Own up, give it back. If you try sell something, someone's going to see it."</p>
