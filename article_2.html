            <p>Nelson Airport has been evacuated this morning, in the latest email threat to target New Zealand organisations and institutions.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the airport was evacuated as a precaution after an email "of a concerning nature" was received.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working to establish the origin of the email and have yet to establish any actual threat."</p>
        
            <p>Members of the publics have been advised to avoid the airport until the incident is resolved, and travellers have been urged to follow instructions from their airline.</p>
        
            <p>Several schools and courts were evacuated in recent weeks after a flurry of threatening emails were send to the organisations.</p>
        
            <p>"Police acknowledge how unsettling these emails are for all concerned. We'd like to thank all involved for their cooperation as we investigate these emails."</p>
