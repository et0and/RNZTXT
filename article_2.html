            <p>A study has found the cost and effort to roll out the national HPV vaccination programme was "well worth it" and has had a "marked" effect on HPV-related cancer rates.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago obstetrics and gynaecology associate professor Peter Sykes led a study researching the effectiveness of the national HPV vaccination programme.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch-based study revealed the programme, running since 2008, has reduced cervical cancer by more than two-thirds - and showed the vaccine was "incredibly important and makes a real difference".</p>
        
            <p>"It's about a two-thirds reduction, a little bit more than two-thirds, 70 percent. If we compare that to wearing a seatbelt which halves your risk of a serious injury in a road traffic accident, it's a very effective intervention."</p>
        
            <p>The study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand, found that vaccine prevents not only cervical but also other HPV-related diseases - including cancers of the mouth and throat.</p>
        
            <p>It also showed a greater benefit for those vaccinated at a young age, before sexual activity, Sykes added.</p>
        
            <p>"What we really need to do is improve our vaccination rates in that cohort of people. We currently vaccinated about 60 to 65 percent of people. But the [World Health Organisation wants] 90 percent of people.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to invest further to meet the goal of eradicating cervical cancer as a public health problem for all."</p>
