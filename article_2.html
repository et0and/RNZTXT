            <p>Fire and Emergency says the fire burning at a scrap metal yard in South Auckland has been brought under control but is not yet out.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was reported at 4.30pm at a metal recycling plant on Hunua Road in Papakura.</p>
        
            <p>It is now contained, but is likely to take several hours to fully extinguish.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze is understood to be at Global Metal Solutions, which twice caught fire in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commander Chris Delfos saID an excavator at the site is being used to turn over the pile of material that had been burning as firefighters continue working to fully extinguish the fire.</p>
        
            <p>He said this was likely to take several hours.</p>
        
            <p>Delfos said the amount of smoke generated by the fire has reduced significantly, but people who live in areas where the smoke is still present are advised to remain inside with their doors and windows shut to avoid exposure.</p>

            <p>Local resident Sapna lives on Redcrest Ave, close to the scrap metal yard, and said there was a strong smell of chemicals that became worse in the evening.</p>
        
            <p>She came home from work at 4pm, when she saw smoke from the blaze. After going to another suburb, she returned at about 6.30pm and said the chemical smell was stronger then.</p>
        
            <p>Manurewa-Papakura ward councillor Angela Dalton said it was important local people follow the advice to stay inside, particularly those living south of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"Just because of the wind drift. They should stay inside, close all their windows and just stay out of the smoke, until further messaging when it is safe."</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said people should not venture outside to catch a glimpse of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>A FENZ spokesperson said they can't say how widespread the emergency text was sent, but it was targeted at people south of Hunua Road.</p>

            <p>A worker at a fish and chip shop a couple of kilometres away from the fire in Papakura said they are still pretty busy with customers.</p>
        
            <p>Ezra, who works at Opaheke Takeaways, said when the fire first started, around 4.30pm, he could see a cloud of smoke the height of a tall building.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a big cloud of black smoke you couldn't see the hills behind it, it was really thick," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ezra said traffic is still at a standstill but the cloud is now grey.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ journalist said Redcrest Avenue, which runs through the middle of the suburb of Red Hill which is adjacent to the fire, was shrouded in smoke, and residents have all pretty quickly hurried inside as the smoke grew thicker and the smell become quite strong.</p>
