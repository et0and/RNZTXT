            <p>A judge has released the reasons why former Green MP Golriz Ghaharaman failed to escape a shoplifting conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman was ordered to pay a fine of $1600 and court costs of $260 after admitting shoplifting nearly $9000 worth of goods.</p>
        
            <p>She was charged with shoplifting in January, after it was alleged she had stolen items of clothing from three high-end retail stores.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman has expressed her remorse and "deep shame" and all stores had been reimbursed for the total value of the clothing.</p>
        
            <p>Her lawyer, Annabel Cresswell, cited "loss-reactive shoplifting" - when an otherwise law-abiding citizen shoplifts amid a mental health crisis - as an explanation.</p>
        
            <p>The judgment, released by Judge June Jelas on Monday, said her mental health at the time did contribute to the shoplifting, but it was not a causative factor.</p>
        
            <p>Jelas noted at the time of offending, Ghahraman was in therapy and "making good progress", according to a clinical psychologist commissioned by her lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's difficult to reconcile these positive reports with someone so affected by trauma that they would offend in the way Ghahraman did," Jelas said.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's mental health state had made her "more vulnerable" to offend, Jelas noted.</p>
        
            <p>"I accept the Crown submission that this was not spontaneous isolated offending. It occurred over two months. There was clearly an element of premeditation and planning to the offending."</p>
        
            <p>Jelas noted premeditation had been shown by Ghahraman carrying a bag to conceal stolen items.</p>
        
            <p>Jelas said she was also not satisfied a conviction would have a disproportionate adverse consequence on Ghahraman continuing her legal career and applying for a practising certificate from the New Zealand Law Society.</p>
        
            <p>"The entry of the convictions will be a factor undoubtedly considered by the Law Society but not a determinative factor. The factors that would be considered by the Law Society extend well beyond the entry of a conviction.</p>
        
            <p>"I have reached a similar position in respect of consequences for future employment prospects overseas. An international organisation's assessment of Ghahraman's suitability to work as a counsel before an international court or tribunal is an inevitable consequence flowing directly from the offending itself."</p>
        
            <p>The standard of conduct for lawyers was "high", Jelas said, and understandably so.</p>
        
            <p>"They are consequences Ghahraman will encounter primarily as a result of her offending, not the entry of convictions.</p>
        
            <p>"In any event, those consequences are not out of all proportion."</p>
