            <p>New Zealand's Hamish Kerr has been dethroned as the world indoor high jump champion after collecting silver in Nanjing.</p>
        
            <p>Paris Olympic champion Kerr wasn't at his best, managing a best clearance of 2.28m to finish three centimetres behind South Korean Wood Sang-hyeok, who also won the world indoor crown in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr had three misses at 2.31m, but finished second overall on a countback ahead of three other jumpers who had cleared 2.28m.</p>
        
            <p>Bronze went to Jamaican Raymond Richards.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first global event contested by 28-year-old Kerr since he soared to Olympic gold with a best of 2.36m eight months ago.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, New Zealanders struggled to make an impact on the opening day of the meet.</p>
        
            <p>Maddi Wesche and debutant Kaia Tupu-South were 15th and 16th in the women's shot put.</p>

            <p>It was a disappointing outcome for Olympic silver medallist Wesche, who was eliminated at the end of</p>
        
            <p>round three with a lone recorded throw of 16.52m, having registered fouls in her two other attempts.</p>
        
            <p>Maia Ramsden failed to advance in the women's 1500m, finishing sixth in heat in a time of 4min 14.89s, well short of the top three finish needed to automatically advance.</p>
        
            <p>Laura Nagel was eighth in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>Tiaan Whelpton advanced from the 60m heats to the semi-final but went no further, placing last in the latter race in 6.70s.</p>
        
            <p>Britain's Jeremiah Azu later won the gold medal, edging out Australian Lachlan Kennedy in a photo finish.</p>
        
            <p>Alison Andrews-Paul was fifth in her 800m heat and failed to advance.</p>
