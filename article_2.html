        <h2>Mapping Tai Rāwhiti's worst eroding land</h2>
        <p>
Gisborne District Council plans to designate high-erosion areas where farming and forestry must cease.

            <p>Gisborne land adaptation shifts have received positive feedback from both the Eastland Wood Council and an environmental group.</p>
        
            <p>The region's farmers and forestry companies might end up with designated land they cannot operate on under new council plans.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Nedine Thatcher Swann said they were looking at more accurate identification and management of erosion risks across Tai Rāwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>"Overlay 3B" is coined in council reports as "the worst eroding land across the region".</p>
        
            <p>Through identification, Gisborne District Council aims to "landmark" these areas, mandating some pastoral farming and forestry owners to transition their land into permanent vegetation cover.</p>
        
            <p>A council report says the land use changes "crystallised in the wake of cyclones Hale and Gabrielle in early 2023".</p>
        
            <p>Overlay 3B is an extension of the current land overlay framework in the Tairāwhiti Resource Management Plan (TRMP).</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne District Council requested Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research to help identify which areas in the region had a high likelihood of landslides, and whether these landslides would affect waterways.</p>
        
            <p>According to a council report, the map was completed in March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"The model utilises advanced technology and builds on previous regional research," Thatcher Swann said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"It analyses where landslides occur and their potential to impact waterways, drawing on data collected across the region."</p>
        
            <p>Eastland Wood Council (EWC) chief executive Philip Hope said they received the database just over a week ago and were still working through what it meant for EWC members.</p>
        
            <p>"At an initial glance, we believe it is a marked improvement on previously available mapping for Tai Rāwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>"Our industry is working through meetings with Gisborne District Council to better understand the information, including how it was developed."</p>
        
            <p>It would take time to understand the data and talk to their members to form views on this model, Hope said.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect it will have significant implications on how all land is managed in the future and think it could be a useful tool as our district works towards increasingly sustainable land use, such as retirement, rehabilitation and conversion - and where appropriate, the status quo."</p>
        
            <p>EWC would continue to work with the council, iwi and mana whenua on sustainable land use and planning in Tai Rāwhiti, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mana Taiao Tairāwhiti (MTT), a Gisborne group that organised a petition calling for land-use rule changes, said it was pleased the new landslide susceptibility and connectivity map had been released.</p>
        
            <p>"It is great to see the maps compiled by scientists who know this region intimately and have used the latest tools to classify the risk in every square metre of Tairāwhiti," co-founder Tui Warmenhoven said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we can have a robust science-informed debate about what, if any, commercial activities are consistent with the wellbeing of the land, waterways and coastal marine areas."</p>
        
            <p>MTT said it was also encouraged to hear that the council would investigate the economic, social, cultural and environmental impacts of the rule changes.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really important to understand who and what will be affected by these changes - both positive and negative impacts for everyone, from specific streams and rivers to residents, ratepayers, farmers and the overseas owners of pine plantations," MTT spokesman Manu Caddie said.</p>
        
            <p>Local Democracy Reporting approached Federated Farmers for comment but the federation was unable to provide it at the time of the request.</p>
        
            <p>The council will work with tangata whenua, landowners and communities before confirming which land falls into Overlay 3B and will propose options for land management in these areas, according to a council statement.</p>
