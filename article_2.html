        <h2>Evacuations underway as fire threatens homes</h2>
        <p>
Wind and tinder-dry hedgerows likely contributed to the Bay of Plenty blaze, a witness says.
</p>
        
            <p>Evacuations are underway as a large fire threatens properties in Te Puna, Western Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said crews were called about 3.20pm to "reports of multiple shelter belts on fire" near Snodgrass Road. Shelter belts are rows of trees planted to provide wind breaks and improve micro climates.</p>
        
            <p>Seven crews are in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Newnham Park Innovation Centre managing director Ian Jeffrey said the fire was still flaring up at 5.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Wind and the tinder-dry hedgerows were two reasons the fire was still burning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire brigade will be there for a while," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His business was near to Snodgrass Road, but he was not worried about the fire getting out of control, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police have advised the community to avoid the area as emergency services work to control the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"If your home is impacted by smoke, please keep your windows and doors closed, and turn off any air conditioning units," FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Snodgrass Road is currently blocked and police are considering other road closures.</p>
        
            <p>A manager at a Te Puna business said the fire was far from the village centre, but they could see smoke.</p>
