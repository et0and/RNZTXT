            <p>A small group of Palestinians who now call Nelson home have been holding weekly peace rallies calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, vowing to continue for as long as the conflict does.</p>
        
            <p>Rajai Shram and his wife Fadia Muhssen are Palestinians who have lived in New Zealand for the last 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>For the past three months, they have been part of weekly rallies held at the top of Trafalgar Street each Saturday. The Te Tau Ihu Palestine Solidarity Group has been organising the rallies.</p>
        
            <p>Shram said they wanted to see action from the government and would continue to meet each week until the conflict came to an end.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the government to hear our voices and take action to stop the genocide in Gaza and Palestine and stop this war."</p>

            <p>Muhssen said the rallies had started a broader discussion about Palestine, and shown just how much support there is for the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Two years ago, I wasn't able to say anything because nobody was talking about it, this year you can't imagine the relief that I got from Saturday to Saturday that I could let my tears out and I could let my feelings out and someone else could feel the pain I was holding for all these years."</p>
        
            <p>In recent weeks, there have been around 150 people of different nationalities showing up in support, some travelling from other cities to attend.</p>
        
            <p>The March for Justice in Palestine is held at the 1903 Square in Nelson every Saturday at 10.30am.</p>
        
            <p>
More than 100 people joined a previous rally.
