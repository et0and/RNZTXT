            <p>People who tasted wallaby quesadillas at the recent Northland Field Days are still talking about the rich meaty snack one week on from the event.</p>
        
            <p>In past years, possum pâté, goat pies and wasp larvae ice cream have been on offer at the Northland Regional Council's marquee at the annual agricultural event in Dargaville.</p>
        
            <p>One taste tester who dived in to try the classic Mexican street food with an Australian twist was Local Democracy Reporter, Susan Botting.</p>
        
            <p>"These triangle morels were delicate minced wallaby meat, minced up in the south island.</p>
        
            <p>"They had a little bit of parmesan, and little bit of this and that and the other thing. The secret ingredients were made by the local polytech (North Tec) senior cooking students," said Botting.</p>
        
            <p>"They weren't subtle, they weren't loud, they were kind of in between."</p>
        
            <p>Botting said the quesadillas, with wallaby meat sourced from Blenheim, were part of an eye-catching conservation campaign from the Northland Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>They conveyed the message for people to keep an eye out for Wallabies.</p>

            <p>Botting said she had been put off eating the rich meat again. In fact she was won over by the catchy campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a completely different access into the messaging through your senses, by getting something yummy to taste, and people from all walks of life were stopping."</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara Council constituency representative John Blackwell said there were no known wallaby populations in Northland but they could potentially spread from "nearby areas like Kawau Island and Rotorua Lakes."</p>
        
            <p>He said the animals were classified as an exclusion pest due to their potential to cause environmental harm.</p>
        
            <p>"They threaten native bush by eating seedlings, hindering regeneration, and also impact farming and forestry by consuming pasture and exotic seedlings," Blackwell said.</p>
        
            <p>The wallaby meat was sourced from Blenheim company Premium Game because there was no local wild wallaby stock in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>This year's Field Days, the largest annual agricultural event in Northland, was attended by about 20,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>Exactly how many of those tried the wallaby on offer is unknown, but the tent was a popular attraction.</p>
        
            <p>A joint creation by the Northland Regional Council, NorthTec | Tai Tokerau Wānanga Level 4 cookery students and their tutor Hughie Blues, the council anticipated it would give away about 1800 portions of quesadillas over the three days.</p>
