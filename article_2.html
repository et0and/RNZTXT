            <p>Fishermen in the Bay of Islands got far more than they bargained for today when a 300 kilogram dolphin leapt out of the water and straight into their boat.</p>
        
            <p>The bizarre wildlife encounter, which occurred around lunchtime off Cape Brett, knocked one of the boaties over and left him with bruising to one arm.</p>
        
            <p>It also left the trio - young men from Warkworth on a fishing trip they won't forget - with the dilemma of what to do with a dolphin almost as long as their vessel.</p>
        
            <p>DOC Bay of Islands manager Bronwyn Bauer-Hunt commended the fishermen for "doing everything right".</p>
        
            <p>First they sought advice via Russell Radio, a maritime radio service, about what to do with their unintended catch.</p>
        
            <p>The radio operator put them in contact with a DOC ranger, who advised them to keep the dolphin cool and shaded, and motor back to Waitangi jetty so their surprise passenger could be given a health check.</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt said they used an umbrella and a hose to keep the dolphin cool, taking care not to get water in its blowhole.</p>
        
            <p>Men and marine mammal were met at the wharf by DOC staff and hapū members, who gave the dolphin a thorough check-up.</p>
        
            <p>She said the juvenile male bottlenose dolphin had a few scratches where it had landed on the metal deck, but was otherwise unhurt.</p>
        
            <p>"No one was seriously injured, including the dolphin, which was a great outcome," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt estimated the dolphin weighed 300kg and if stretched out - it had landed with its tail curled up - it would have been almost as long as the Stabicraft fishing boat.</p>
        
            <p>The dolphin was given the name Tohu, meaning 'sign'.</p>
        
            <p>Following its health check, Tohu was winched onto a pontoon and towed back out to sea by a DOC vessel.</p>
        
            <p>Once released, DOC staff followed Tohu until they were confident it was swimming strongly and behaving normally, despite its misadventure.</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt said DOC appreciated the young fishermen for thinking quickly and seeking expert advice to ensure the dolphin's welfare.</p>
        
            <p>She said anyone involved in a marine mammal incident should report it by calling 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 468).</p>
        
            <p>A similar incident off Slipper Island in the Bay of Plenty in 2006 had a less happy outcome.</p>
        
            <p>In that case a woman sitting on the bow of a pleasure boat suffered serious injuries after a dolphin apparently misjudged a jump and landed on top of her.</p>
        
            <p>The dolphin, however, was unhurt.</p>
