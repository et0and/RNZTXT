Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan - reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl, " he posted to X. "Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition, Canada is making new commitments to appoint a Fentanyl Czar, we will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the border, launch a Canada- U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering. I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl and we will be backing it with $200 million.</p>
        
            <p>"Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
