            <p>A forensic accountant has told a court a murder-accused former surgeon paid Sydney escort Madison Ashton $106,000 before his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne is on trial for the murder of his wife, Pauline Hanna, in 2021 and staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court in Auckland heard on Wednesday, $106,131 was sent to Ashton, who has been mentioned earlier in the trial as staying in Mt Cook with Polkinghorne in the weeks after Hanna's death, ending on 5 January, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>A forensic accountant working in the police financial crime unit, Margaret Skilton, told the court a bank account owned solely by Polkinghorne had sent thousands of dollars to multiple women.</p>
        
            <p>Skilton said when she analysed accounts she looked for "trends" and noticed a significant number of cash withdrawals.</p>
        
            <p>It was also noticed there were weekly automated payments of $500 per week sent to the "Alaria Family Trust", of which a woman who Polkinghorne would visit on the North Shore was a trustee.</p>
        
            <p>The amount was reduced to $350 but ceased altogether on 24 March, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Various one-off transfers were also sent to this woman, totalling more than $55,000.</p>
        
            <p>A woman named Jody Kelly was transferred a total of $72,100, while another woman, named Lee, was paid a total of $35,905. Two other women received $7160 and $13,550.</p>
        
            <p>Between February 2018 and 2019, Skilton said approximately 120 cash withdrawals from ATMs in Australia were made, totalling about $115,000.</p>
        
            <p>Skilton noted Ashton lived in Australia and most withdrawals were made while Polkinghorne was in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Those withdrawals stopped when Polkinghorne began sending international transfers to Ashton's account.</p>
        
            <p>Skilton said Pauline Hanna had only one account solely owned by her, which she had set up in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of her death, this account was overdrawn by just over $90.</p>
        
            <p>Skilton said before Hanna created her own account in 2020, she used a joint account she shared with her husband as her main account where her salary was paid.</p>
        
            <p>It was noted by Skilton that Polkinghorne had "authority" of that account.</p>
        
            <p>Something Skilton said was "unusual" was that Hanna had no credit cards, while Polkinghorne had three.</p>
        
            <p>As a couple, the pair's assets were worth almost $10.5m.</p>
        
            <p>During cross-examination by the defence, Ron Mansfield KC, he noted for couples who had been together as long as Hanna and Polkinghorne, any assets in a divorce would usually be divided 50/50.</p>
        
            <p>"So it doesn't really matter what name a particular asset is held in?" he asked Skilton.</p>
        
            <p>She replied "from that perspective, no".</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
