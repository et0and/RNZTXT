        <h2>Hipkins blasts coalition government in state of the nation speech</h2>
        <p>
"In the face of the havoc this government is wreaking, Labour must provide New Zealanders with hope," the Labour leader says.
</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has given a speech about the state of the nation, saying the party stands for different values than the coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the coalition government's proposed cuts to the public service means everyday New Zealanders will suffer.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government is "a government of entrenched privilege and entitlement. A government for the few, not the many."</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, he accused National of creating a fiscal hole, adding New Zealand could not afford tax cuts and must borrow more money to bring infrastructure up to scratch.</p>
        
            <p>Labour also conceded it could have done more to deal with disruptive state housing tenants while in government, but said the current coalition was going too far with its directive to KƒÅinga Ora.</p>
        
            <p>Ministers on Monday demanded the housing agency take a tougher line on tenancies, evict the worst offenders and chase down overdue rent.</p>
