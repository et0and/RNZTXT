            <p>Street racers were out in force again around the country overnight - despite police cracking down on antisocial vehicle behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter was deployed in the lower North Island and police responded to gatherings in Wellington, Canterbury, Bay of Plenty and Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, police 138 infringement notices were issued and 19 more vehicles were taken off the streets overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Five vehicles were seized by bailiffs due to unpaid fines, three were impounded, and 11 were either pink or green stickered due to compliance issues.</p>
        
            <p>420 people were breathalysed passing through checkpoints and two drivers were found to have excess breath alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>One person was arrested after failing to stop and fleeing from police, and a stolen Subaru seized.</p>
        
            <p>"Police Air Support Unit helicopter known as Eagle, supported our staff on the ground in successfully dispersing around 300 vehicles over the course of the evening," said Acting Wellington District Commander Nick Thom.</p>
        
            <p>"These events are dangerous and will not be tolerated in Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>In Canterbury 171 infringement notices were issued and 33 vehicles pink- or green-stickered due to safety issues on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people were arrested for disorderly behaviour, four people summonsed for excess breath alcohol and one person had their license suspended.</p>
        
            <p>An additional six vehicles were impounded by police and four were seized by bailiffs for failing to pay fines.</p>
        
            <p>"The community can expect we will continue to be out there, disrupting this behaviour," said Acting Canterbury District Commander Superintendent Lane Todd. "It will not be tolerated."</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Plenty police had checkpoints set up at entry points to Rotorua to intercept groups taking part in illegal activity before they started on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>163 infringement notices were issued, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Four vehicles were impounded and 14 green stickers issued, ordering vehicles off the road, with two drivers receiving multiple tickets for failing to comply with directions.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were arrested, seven summonsed for driving with excess breath alcohol and one person's license was suspended.</p>
        
            <p>"More importantly we have also prevented a young person or persons getting killed or seriously injured as a result," said Inspector Phil Gillbanks.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear we do not want anti-social road users here, and we will continue to act until that message sinks in," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Two illegal radio devices were also found among the vehicles that went through the checkpoints.</p>
        
            <p>"These devices could disrupt operational police channels, which could have catastrophic consequences and charges are being considered."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were also aware of a "planned meeting of car enthusiasts" in Albany on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff had been deployed to monitor and the large crowd was generally well behaved. When undesirable activity was identified, staff attended and the individuals involved left the area."</p>
