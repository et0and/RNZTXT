        <h2>Bringing the community back to Christmas 'one hamper at a time'</h2>
        <p>
What started ten years ago as a one-off idea dreamed up by two Wellington locals has grown exponentially with 2030 hampers needed this Christmas.

            <p>A delighted mum getting to share chocolate with her kids. Mashed potatoes and the first taste of scrambled eggs. A full pantry so there's money for a small Christmas gift. Knowing your neighbour is thinking of you.</p>
        
            <p>This is what a charity's Christmas-time hampers are all about.</p>
        
            <p>What started ten years ago as a one-off idea with 21 hampers has exponentially grown with 2030 hampers needed this Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The project, Nourish Christmas, is run by Wellington residents Gabe Ralph and Claire Turner.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, it's about spreading some Christmas sparkle," Ralph said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to let families in our community know we are thinking of them."</p>

            <p>In the last decade, they have provided 6387 hampers of food to families in Wellington city stretching all the way up Kāpiti Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Turner had been volunteering at a Lower Hutt school where she saw firsthand, ākonga needing the breakfasts, fruits and milk provided by Kids Can.</p>
        
            <p>"I started thinking, when they're not at school and are at home over the Christmas holidays, how hard it must be on the parents," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know what my two teenage boys are like, how much time they spend in the pantry and the fridge."</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to fundraise and try help out "a few families" in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"We were stoked to raise enough money to do 21 hampers that year," Turner said.</p>
        
            <p>"And so the next year, we thought, let's try again."</p>
        
            <p>The project has been growing ever since, with a whole warehouse loaned by Farrah's needed to pack the Christmas hampers.</p>
        
            <p>The hampers are valued at $150 each. They are made up of fresh fruit and vegetables, a dozen eggs and pantry staples.</p>

            <p>Ralph said initially the hamper's purpose was to provide a Christmas spread.</p>
        
            <p>In the first year of hampers, they provided roast chicken and butter.</p>
        
            <p>"But then one of the kids who got a hamper said they didn't have power at their house, so they couldn't run a fridge," Ralph said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we changed pretty quickly to focus on filling the pantry rather than putting a Christmas spread on the table."</p>
        
            <p>With the pantry filled, money is freed for small Christmas gifts.</p>
        
            <p>They get amazing feedback every year from the schools and whanau they provide.</p>
        
            <p>"One school said to us that every year that we make big men cry," Turner said.</p>
        
            <p>"The food's important, but we also get a lot of feedback about the fact that people care."</p>
        
            <p>Ralph said the growth was organic; it was never planned.</p>
        
            <p>Nourish now approaches every primary school in the Greater Wellington region.</p>
        
            <p>"The schools tell us how many families need a hamper and then we do our very best to raise that amount," Ralph said.</p>
        
            <p>This year they need to raise $304,500 and they are currently facing a shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>The need for hampers has increased year on year - in 2023, they had requests for 1780 hampers, with 1207 needed in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>But this is the first year the team is really worried. They're about 600 hampers short of reaching all their families in need.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been huge pressure on grant fundraising, raising money from businesses and donations, and then just the cost of the groceries - it's all gone up," Ralph said.</p>
        
            <p>"And we're seeing that families are doing it tougher than ever and every stress seems to be amplified around Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>Turner said, as an entirely volunteer-run charity, they fly under the radar. But they're not giving up.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone wants to support us, spread the word about what we do. We have some amazing business sponsors, so why not sponsor us too," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Tui Glen School principal Jessica Meates said Nourish has helped hundreds of their families over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"These hampers take some financial strain off households, and that isn't to be underestimated, there are often tears when whānau come in to pick hampers up."</p>
        
            <p>Turner and Claire previously used to "feed the whole school" every Friday ("out of their own pockets"), Meates said. They would bring sandwiches and home baking before the lunches in-schools programme. She said attendance even improved.</p>
        
            <p>Their work continues.</p>
        
            <p>"Our target is huge to reach, but we think about it one hamper at a time. So if someone can donate just one hamper, we'll get closer and closer to our target," Turner said.</p>
