            <p>Police have named a "dangerous" suspect they are seeking over a kidnapping earlier this week in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Ralph Park, 25, is wanted over the 2 April incident, police said, and may be trying to seek medical attention.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Callum McNeill of WaitematƒÅ CIB said the investigation team has obtained a warrant to arrest Park and is releasing further information to assist in locating him.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team has been undertaking a number of enquiries to locate Park so far, including search warrants in the Auckland area."</p>
        
            <p>Police believe Park will likely be trying to seek medical attention for an injury he sustained Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe Park was shot - either by his own achievements or accidentally by his accomplice," McNeill said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has come to light during the investigation this week, including reviewing CCTV footage and forensically examining the vehicle involved in the kidnapping."</p>
        
            <p>Police are continuing to make enquiries to locate Park, including healthcare facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not uncommon in these situations where people evading accountability try to use a false name.</p>
        
            <p>"While I can't go into details around the specifics of our enquiries, we are absolutely committed to locating and arresting him."</p>
        
            <p>Park is described as being 166 centimetres tall and is of thin build.</p>
        
            <p>Two other people were arrested in connection with the case on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man also accused of kidnapping the woman on Auckland's North Shore appeared in court Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A 28-year-old woman arrested in relation to the case also appeared in court and faces three charges relating to methamphetamine and failing to carry out police obligations.</p>
        
            <p>Police say a gun was discharged at a property on Sunhaven Avenue in Beach Haven on Tuesday and a woman was forcibly put in a car.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who sees Ralph Park should call police on 111 immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"You should consider him dangerous, and we advise that you do not approach him."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with general information on Park's whereabouts can also contact police via the 105 phone service or anonymously through Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
