            <p>Auckland's mayor and the Minister of Transport agree - the reins need to be tightened on Auckland Transport.</p>
        
            <p>In a 19 July letter from mayor Wayne Brown to Simeon Brown released through the Official Information Act, the two found agreement on reform of transport governance.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown is minister of transport, minister of auckland, and minister of local government.</p>
        
            <p>In the letter, Wayne Brown says they "agreed that the culture of independence pervading Auckland Transport is unacceptable, and that Aucklanders deserve better", and that Auckland Transport should be "purely a delivery agency".</p>
        
            <p>Work is to be done on options to reform Auckland Transport.</p>
        
            <p>The first involves moving responsibility for the Regional Land Transport Plan - currently prepared by Auckland Transport every year, with consultation from the community and approval by Auckland Council - to Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>The second is to explore additional powers that could be given to the mayor and Auckland Council to control the transportation authority.</p>

            <p>The third involves repealing or changing part 4 of the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act, removing Auckland Transport's independent role in planning and strategy and making it "purely a delivery agency".</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport has a low rate of trust and confidence from the public - coming in just under its target of 30 percent in the last chief executive's report.</p>
        
            <p>And, a bill recently introduced to Parliament's biscuit tin proposed to disestablish Auckland Transport entirely.</p>
        
            <p>Advice on the three options was prepared by Ministry of Transport and Auckland Council officials by the end of August.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Auckland Transport said it "welcomes the opportunity for an evidence-based discussion with the governing body about the effectiveness of the [council-controlled organisation] model in delivering services for Auckland, and the chance to consider options for how it can be improved on".</p>
        
            <p>"We will be working very closely with Auckland Council to provide it with advice on each of the options it could consider, ahead of the annual plan being developed."</p>
