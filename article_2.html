            <p>Police have confirmed a plan to shed more than 170 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>In August it consulted with staff on a proposal to cut 170 jobs, and it confirmed on Wednesday that last week it landed on cutting 173.</p>

            <p>"For positions being disestablished, we are now skills-matching affected staff to potentially reassign them into new and vacant positions included in the consultation."</p>
        
            <p>The changes would save police $51.6 million over four years.</p>
