            <p>Police are investigating the theft of several items from Hagley Oval overnight on Friday, where the New Zealand versus England cricket Test is being played.</p>
        
            <p>UK broadcaster TalkSport reported on X that it had two cameras stolen, which meant it would not be able to provide images of Day 3 of the cricket Test on its Youtube channels.</p>

            <p>The venue owner, Venues Ōtautahi, confirmed there was a security breach and the cameras were among several items taken from a locked area.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the things we are aware of are some Venues Ōtautahi technology equipment like laptops, we've had a TV taken from one of the corporate areas, we've had alcohol taken, we've had some food taken, and we are just working through that full list with police on that," said Venues Ōtautahi chief executive, Caroline Harvie-Teare.</p>
        
            <p>Harvie-Teare said the company has 24/7 security at the site, and is disappointed the break-in occured.</p>
        
            <p>"It was all locked up, so obviously we are concerned about what's happened, this is not something that has happened before - certainly not in my tenure."</p>
        
            <p>Harvie-Teare said it had comprehensive CCTV footage which was being looked at by police, and Venues Ōtautahi was working to find out what happened and how it could prevent it happening again.</p>
        
            <p>She said its immediate focus was ensuring adequate security was put in place for the next few days, and that New Zealand Cricket, both teams and the media were comfortable with those arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, New Zealand said it was shocked to hear of the break-in and theft of the TalkSport cameras.</p>
        
            <p>"We take our hosting responsibilities very seriously and are sorry such a talented team of storytellers have been inconvenienced," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've reached out to express our disappointment over the theft and to offer them every assistance in accessing equipment in the interim."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket said it is working with relevant authorities to ensure there is no repeat of the incident.</p>
