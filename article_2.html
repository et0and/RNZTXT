            <p>Lightning, thunder and heavy rain are lashing Auckland, as a storm that knocked out power and cancelled flights in the capital blankets parts of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklanders are reporting massive downpours and thunderclaps so loud that they rattle windows.</p>
        
            <p>MetService's rain radar showed a heavy band of rain sitting over the city's central and western suburbs about 6.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>The forecaster said the storm could be accompanied by wind gusts and hail.</p>
        
            <p>It could be a wet journey home for Aucklanders and Wellingtonians. Find the latest radar images here https://t.co/q7Eu5UKdtF</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, strong winds at Wellington Airport had caused 15 flights coming in and out of the capital to be cancelled, and hundreds in the city were earlier without power.</p>
        
            <p>Most flights had been able to operate normally, but wind gusts were causing landing difficulties for some flights, the airport said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Air New Zealand said flight NZ417 was returned to Auckland after it was unable to land from gusty weather, and customers would be accommodated on the next available service.</p>
        
            <p>Customers were advised to check their flights on the Air New Zealand app and website for updates.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 250 properties were earlier without power in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were working to fix the fault after the outage happened at 11.30am, affecting more than 20 streets in Petone.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Electricity said the outage was caused by damage to its overhead network equipment.</p>
        
            <p>The power was estimated to be restored by 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService had forecast a heavy rain watch and a strong wind watch with gusts expected to reach up to 100km/h for Wairarapa, Wellington and the Marlborough Sounds through to 4pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The north-to-northwest winds may approach severe gale in exposed places, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain watches were also in place for the Westland ranges and the headwaters of the Canterbury lakes until 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, there was a strong wind watch for the Canterbury high country which expired at 3pm.</p>
