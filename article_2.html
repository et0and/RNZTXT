            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has dismissed a suggestion by US President-elect Donald Trump that he might use "economic force" to make Canada the 51st US state.</p>
        
            <p>"There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States," he said in a post on X.</p>
        
            <p>"Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner."</p>

            <p>Trump, speaking in Mar-a-Lago, was asked if he was considering using military force to acquire Canada.</p>
        
            <p>"No, economic force," he responded. "Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something."</p>
        
            <p>Trump, who has long complained about Canada's trade surplus with the US, had earlier told reporters the border was an "artificially drawn line."</p>
        
            <p>Trump has threatened to impose a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada, which sends 75 percent of all goods and services exports south of the border.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said Trump's comments "show a complete lack of understanding of what makes Canada a strong country ... We will never back down in the face of threats."</p>
