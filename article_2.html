            <p>Liam Lawson believes he's done all he can and now it is up to others to decide his future in Formula 1.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old New Zealand failed to finish the [ttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/536051/norris-wins-in-abu-dhabi-mclaren-are-f1-champions-lawson-dnf season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Monday] which completed his six race stint with RB.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson now has to wait to find out if he has a seat with either Red Bull or RB in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know," was Lawson's reaction when he was asked after Monday's race if he felt he'd done enough to warrant a new contract.</p>
        
            <p>"I've given it everything in every single session I've driven the car so the decision is up to them so we'll see."</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull principal Christian Horner is scheduled to meet with Mexican driver Sergio Perez to discuss his future after he had a disappointing season in the top team.</p>
        
            <p>Perez had another DNF in Abu Dhabi, meaning he picked up just nine points in the last eight GP's, finishing eighth in the drivers' championship.</p>
        
            <p>That has left him in danger of being cut by Red Bull despite having a contract for the next two years.</p>
        
            <p>After Monday's race, Perez, who has won six GP's across 14 seasons, admitted his future was uncertain.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, at the moment, I don't know," he said. "I just know I've got a contract to race next year. Unless something changes in the coming days, that's going to be the situation for next year.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to be talking in a couple of days. We will discuss what is the situation for both parties and see if we're able to reach an agreement.."</p>

            <p>World champion Max Verstappen will be driving for Red Bull in 2025, but the makeup of the other three seats (including RB) are yet to be confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The possible departure of Perez opens up a seat in the top team most likely for either Lawson or his RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda.</p>
        
            <p>The Japanese driver, who has a contract, has outscored Lawson in the last four races.</p>
        
            <p>Horner does appear to be a fan of Lawson, but Tsunoda also has his backers and engine manufacturer Honda would be keen to have a Japanese driver in a competitive car in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who Lawson replaced for the last six races, also remains a contender for next year along with Red Bull Junior driver Isack Hadjar.</p>
