        <h2>Laos govt document points to rundown factory as source of methanol poisoning</h2>

            <p>A Laos government document obtained by the ABC suggests the source of a methanol poisoning outbreak that killed six tourists is a rundown factory outside the capital, Vientiane, that was making vodka and whisky.</p>
        
            <p>The document from the Ministry of Health's Department of Food and Drugs says their analysis had shown "contamination that may pose a risk to public safety" and ordered the prohibition of selling or consuming Tiger Vodka and Tiger Whisky.</p>
        
            <p>The notice also ordered the closure of the factory that was making the two products "until the manufacturer improves the factory production process to ensure safety and quality according to standards".</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Australian government website Smartraveller issued a fresh warning about drinking in Laos - urging Australians to avoid Tiger Vodka and Tiger Whisky due to "serious safety concerns".</p>

            <p>The ABC visited the factory and was told by locals that it had been closed after visits by health inspectors and police.</p>
        
            <p>Blue plastic had been draped over stacks of empty bottles outside and Tiger Whisky packaging could be seen on the ground beside the remnants of a small fire.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC learned on Saturday that the owner of the factory had been arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the document seeming to point the finger at the factory, the ABC has also confirmed Laos police have arrested three more foreign nationals who were working at Nana Backpackers Hostel.</p>
        
            <p>Two Indian men, aged 24 and 30, and a 35-year-old Filipino woman have joined the eight Vietnamese staff members who were arrested earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>No charges have been laid.</p>
        
            <p>The hostel manager, Duong Duc Toan, earlier told the Associated Press he gave away free shots of Tiger Vodka to about 100 guests as a gesture of hospitality on the night more than a dozen tourists fell ill.</p>
        
            <p>Duong Duc Toan told AP the hostel served the shots but denied it was the Tiger Vodka that made the girls sick.</p>
        
            <p>He said he bought the alcohol from a certified distributor and insisted it had not been tainted by himself or his staff.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of the hostel, Duong van Huan, has repeatedly denied to the ABC that the poisoned drinks came from his bar.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had been in business for almost 11 years and it was the first time something like this had happened.</p>

            <p>Six people, including Australians Holly Bowles and Bianca Jones, died from suspected methanol poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed all were staying at the hostel.</p>
        
            <p>A third Australian who fell ill has now returned home.</p>
