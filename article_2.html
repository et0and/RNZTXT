            <p>The driver of a council work car clocked at 145 km/h may never have been identified because the system didn't log the person behind the wheel.</p>
        
            <p>Gore District Council revealed the incident was one of 165 speeding violations where people drove 10 km/h or more over the speed limit during a six-month period.</p>
        
            <p>Both Southland District Council and Invercargill City Council have also released information on speeding in council cars, showing limits were broken by at least 40 km/h at both councils.</p>
        
            <p>Across the three councils, drivers were recorded exceeding the speed limit by at least 10 km/h more than 1400 times during a six-month period.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Gore District Council said despite most of the council's cars being part of a pool, there was no system in place to officially log who was driving a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"However, if we become aware of an overspeed, and can identify the driver, then a conversation is had with them in the first instance and if it continues further action can be taken."</p>
        
            <p>The council would not provide comment on individual situations, saying disciplinary action was an employment matter.</p>
        
            <p>It did not say whether it identified the driver clocked at 145 km/h.</p>
        
            <p>At Invercargill City Council, group manager finance and assurance Patricia Christie said there were 10 fleet vehicles fitted with speed monitoring software.</p>
        
            <p>In the six months to the end of September - the period Local Democracy Reporting requested information on from the three councils - there were 633 exceedances of over 10 km/h, Christie said.</p>
        
            <p>The fastest speed was 41 km/h over the limit.</p>
        
            <p>"It is council's policy to work with staff and educate them prior to taking disciplinary action," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Southland District Council logged 615 speeding incidents of vehicles travelling at 10 km/h or more over the limit.</p>
        
            <p>There were two instances of the limit being broken by 40 km/h at the entrance to towns.</p>
        
            <p>The maximum speed recorded was 131 km/h on a state highway which was sustained for a 29-second period, "consistent with an overtaking manoeuvre", a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Discussions have been held with staff members. At this time no disciplinary actions have been undertaken".</p>
        
            <p>In September, an Environment Southland report revealed 856 speeding events for a three-month period to June where drivers had gone over the limit by more than 10 km/h.</p>
        
            <p>The fastest speed recorded during that period was 126 km/h.</p>
        
            <p>Organisational failure saw Environment Canterbury fail to reprimand chairperson Peter Scott after he clocked almost 700 speeding incidents.</p>
        
            <p>Scott, who stepped down from the role, exceeded the speed limit in a council-provided car 678 times since January, with a top speed of 157km/h.</p>
