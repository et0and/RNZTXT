It's that one night of the year where parents send their kids out at dusk and green light them taking lollies from strangers.

            <p>It's that one night of the year where parents basically throw out the stranger danger warning, send their kids out at dusk and green light them taking lollies from random people, potentially wearing disguises; Halloween.</p>
        
            <p>Adding to that, there has been some anxiety about meth laced Rinda brand pineapple flavoured sweets potentially still circulating, after turning up earlier this year in Auckland City Mission food parcels.</p>
        
            <p>Police Inspector Brett Callander told Checkpoint Halloween was a good opportunity for people to get together in their own communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus for everybody is that you know community safety and that people look after each other," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, children younger than teenagers should not be out on their own, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we'd ask is that parents and caregivers either supervise their child at all times and not let him go off to people that they don't know, or if you're out with a group of friends, look after each other and stick together."</p>

            <p>He said regarding anxiety in the wake of the meth lolly incident, people should use common sense.</p>
        
            <p>"If parents are out with their young children, then they should be able to monitor what they're getting and have a look at it.</p>
        
            <p>"If in doubt, throw it out."</p>
        
            <p>Due to Halloween becoming more well-known, people knocking on houses of people they did not know was becoming more common, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're suggesting to people is that if for whatever reason you don't want people coming and knocking on your door, just put a note on the front door or the gate saying that you're not involved in Halloween.</p>
        
            <p>"We're asking young people and their parents to respect those people because not everybody wants to celebrate."</p>
        
            <p>He said for his own kids, he preferred that they stay within their own neighbourhood streets.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd prefer that they be in their own streets and with people that they know in their area and just not going off to areas where they don't know people. Your community is usually a pretty safe place."</p>

            <p>Costumes that may scare people could be left at home, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously people want to have the best sort of outfit that they can have, but they need to think and certainly parents can help out here that if it is something that's going to scare somebody or make them think that it's realistic, then maybe they should rethink that or keep that at home."</p>
        
            <p>He said the difference between the trick part of trick or treating and criminal offences, was not taking it too far.</p>
        
            <p>"If you wouldn't want someone to do that to your house, then probably that's a fairly good idea of what not to do to someone else's house. But certainly, if you don't want the police turning up in our costumes, then I'd suggest that you do things that are fun and not that are going to really upset people."</p>

            <p>If children were trick or treating after dark, they should have an adult with them, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're certainly aware that you know the situations that could come out of a night like tonight, but we're just hoping that people are sensible, have some fun and enjoy themselves."</p>
        
            <p>"But certainly, if you see something that you don't think is right, then please call and we'll turn up."</p>
