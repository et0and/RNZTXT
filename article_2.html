        <h2>'So cool to do it together' - Lisa Carrington wins 7th gold medal</h2>
        <p>
Her first thought at the finish line wasn't relief for her aching muscles - instead, it was of her boat-mate, the "awesome" Alicia Hoskin.

            <p>When Dame Lisa Carrington crossed the finish line in the women's kayak doubles to claim her seventh Olympic gold, her first thought wasn't relief for her aching muscles - or even pride in herself.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, she was thinking of her boat-mate, Alicia Hoskin, and their shared achievement.</p>
        
            <p>"Crossing the line, it wasn't relief or 'wow', it was more like 'that is so cool to do it together'," Dame Lisa told RNZ shortly after the win.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure Alicia doesn't even realise she's going to have two gold medals around her neck, so it's amazing."</p>
        
            <p>The pair produced one of the biggest performances of their careers - not just in the result, but in the margin of their victory.</p>
        
            <p>The race was close for the first half on the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium course, but then the New Zealanders blew away their opposition to win by more than a boat length - a rare feat in a K2 500-metre race.</p>
        
            <p>"We went in with a strategy and we just had to put a lot of trust in that," Hoskin told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>There was no sign of fatigue near the end, although Dame Lisa did not bother with the last stroke as they went across the line.</p>

            <p>The German and Hungarian crews battled it out for the minor placings, with Hungary taking second and the German and second Hungarian crew sharing the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Hoskin did not expect the New Zealand boat to be so far ahead at the finish.</p>
        
            <p>"To look back and see them battling it out I was just super proud of the way we paddled together because it could have been very easy to get caught up in the moment in the pressure."</p>
        
            <p>The pair were prepared for the windy and choppy conditions, having trained a lot on Lake Pupuke in Auckland where the going can be similar.</p>
        
            <p>"We just had a plan, stuck to our strategy and our strengths and it's amazing we could pull out that performance under pressure.</p>
        
            <p>"We made sure we could do everything to make it the best race possible. "</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa, who is now in the twilight of her career, was full of praise for all the members of the women's squad and in particular with Hoskin.</p>
        
            <p>"The love of paddling Alicia has is awesome to be a part of and the passion of doing it together and keeping that mindset helped us lean into the pressure."</p>
        
            <p>She has one more race to go in the K1 and a gold medal there would result in her joining the most successful kayaker ever, with eight Olympic titles.</p>
        
            <p>Germany's Birgit Fischer won eight gold medals at six Olympics between 1980 and 2004.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa will come up against fellow New Zealander Aimee Fisher in the K1.</p>
