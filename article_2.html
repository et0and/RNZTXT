            <p>Three patched members of the Tribesmen have been arrested for allegedly driving dangerously in South Auckland on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Five people were arrested following the incident, including the three members and two young people, Counties Manukau road policing manager Inspector Tony Wakelin said.</p>
        
            <p>Six motorbikes were also impounded and were ordered to be off the road for six months, Wakelin said.</p>
        
            <p>Police first saw a group of gang members allegedly speeding on State Highway 1 near Pōkeno at about 6pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"They were driving dangerously at high speeds and intimidating other road users with their reckless behaviour," Wakelin said.</p>
        
            <p>The police Eagle helicopter followed the group until they exited the motorway near Ōtara.</p>

            <p>Wakelin said police on the ground signalled to the group to stop but they didn't.</p>
        
            <p>"Disappointingly the group disregarded this, and they fled from police towards Ōtara, travelling at well over twice the legal speed limit and through a red light."</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter followed the group to a house on Berrett Place, where Wakelin said, officers were able to identify some of the bikes and riders allegedly involved.</p>
        
            <p>Three patched gang members ages 24, 28 and 38 were arrested and will face charges of failing to stop for police and dangerous driving in Manukau District Court at a later date.</p>
        
            <p>Wakelin said two young people were arrested and charged with breaching bail and obstructing police.</p>
        
            <p>Investigations were continuing to find the other motorbikes and riders involved.</p>
