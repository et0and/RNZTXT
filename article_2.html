            <p>The skipper of a Coastguard boat who rescued two divers after they became separated from their boat in waters near Kāpiti, north of Wellington, says the scenario is the stuff of nautical nightmares.</p>
        
            <p>The divers were dragged south in swift currents, but managed to swim to a nearby island and even had provisions to light a fire, alerting the Westpac Rescue Helicopter to their location.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard skipper Mark Davidson told Checkpoint police were alerted by the diver's partners - who were waiting on the diver's boat - that they had lost contact with the men about 5pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"Finding a boat out here for us is easy. We've got radar, boats are big and generally you can plot where you know where they may be.</p>
        
            <p>"But for divers, there are a number of things that can happen when they're underwater. They can become disorientated or the tides are running quicker than they suspect.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case it was an outgoing tide, which runs quite strong out here.</p>
        
            <p>"So you've then got a northerly wind that's pushing towards the south and then you've got a reasonably strong current pushing towards the south as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes it pretty difficult."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the divers surfaced and realised they had been pushed far from their support vessel.</p>
        
            <p>They made the call to swim for more than an hour to Motungārara, or Fisherman's Island.</p>
        
            <p>"They tried to contact their two offsiders on the boat. But the distance was growing [and] the light was starting to dim.</p>
        
            <p>"They had to make a decision themselves to self-rescue, which they did. They're going against a very strong tide here, which swirls around those islands. So they would have been working hard."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the men were well-equipped with high-quality gear, buoyancy aids and personal rescue kits, which included the matches they used to light a fire once ashore.</p>
        
            <p>"Worst-case scenario for us was that they'd washed past the islands and were heading south. So we were set up to do a long, creeping line search orientating south and - given the conditions - we could have expected them probably to float for four nautical miles, which is a long way.</p>
        
            <p>"We were well-assisted by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter out of Wellington. They spotted the fire. They couldn't get down low to see but - from our local knowledge - we knew that there was nobody else on that island so it had to be the divers," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>Once found, the men were well and in good spirits, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were more interested and concerned about their girlfriends in the tender boat, because they knew the girls would be worried sick about them.</p>
        
            <p>"But physically, they were in terrific shape because they had good gear and they'd looked after themselves."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said he was grateful for the work of the police, Westpac Rescue Helicopter and local Coastguard volunteers - both at sea and on land - who all came together for a great result.</p>
