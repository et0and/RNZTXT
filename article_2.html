        <h2>Live: Thousands of homes lose power in Hamilton</h2>
        <p>
Supplier WEL Networks says the storm is causing "widespread damage" and falling trees have caused many of the outages.
</p>
        
            <p>About 17,500 households in Hamilton have had their power cut this afternoon as the city is battered by bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>Supplier WEL Networks says the storm is causing "widespread damage" across its network.</p>
        
            <p>Falling trees have caused many of the 27 unplanned outages and crews are trying to restore power as quickly as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the squalls of stormy weather and lightning do mean that our crews need to remain safe and pause work as necessary," general manager WEL services George Pirie says.</p>
