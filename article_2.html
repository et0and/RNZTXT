            <p>The Waikato Regional Council is investigating whether an old mine shaft might be the cause of discolouration of the Ohinemuri River.</p>
        
            <p>The water turned bright orange on Friday afternoon. The incident was reported to authorities at about 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>The council urged people not to swim in, touch or fish in the water until the results had been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The Ohinemuri River runs through eastern Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Regional compliance manager Patrick Lynch said the contamination could be due to an old Karangahake Gorge mine shaft that had collapsed, possibly leeching heavy metals and other contaminants.</p>
        
            <p>Other potential scenarios included a collapsed forestry dam or other erosion.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as we can determine, the likely thing that has happened is that some kind of old gold mining asset up in the gorge has failed or collapsed in some way and has discharged a bunch of contaminant," Lynch told RNZ on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts were being made to understand what the effects might be on the river and the Firth of Thames.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't touch the water. There's some chance that there may be fish killed in the river as a result of that - not touching the fish, certainly not eating it."</p>
        
            <p>The plume was expected to reach the ocean in the Firth of Thames by 10am Saturday.</p>
