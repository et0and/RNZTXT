            <p>The owner of a motel that backs on to the Roxburgh Town Hall that was engulfed in flames on Thursday said there is nothing left of the building but a few walls.</p>
        
            <p>A total of eight crews of firefighters responded to the blaze in the middle of the central Otago town, which destroyed the town hall, including its 128-year-old cinema.</p>
        
            <p>The movie theatre was first built in 1897 and had previously been part of a Guinness World Records claim of possibly being "longest continuously running movie theatre in the world".</p>
        
            <p>The fire broke out shortly before 12pm, forcing neighbouring properties to evacuate.</p>

            <p>Roxburgh Motel owner Rudi Kats said the fire spread quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"I was here when it started, I was actually making beds in the motel. Somebody yelled that everybody had to get out and so I had a look and it didn't seem to be a serious fire.</p>
        
            <p>"About six weeks ago, we had a small fire like that. It was just an electrical fire, they had it out in no time, so I didn't think much of it but it turned into a really big fire, very quickly."</p>
        
            <p>Kats said today crews knocked down a wall of the town hall that had been left between his property.</p>
        
            <p>"They are literally now taking the wall down that's left between the motel and it used to be the town hall.</p>
        
            <p>"They're taking it down now with a big digger to to secure the site."</p>
        
            <p>Kats said the building is in ruins.</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing left of the town hall or the picture theatre, other than in the picture theatre, there is a couple of walls standing up which are being assessed if they can be retained or not because it's a very old building, and dear to the hearts of many people in Roxburgh.</p>
        
            <p>"So yeah, the fire is gone right through. Nothing left of it."</p>
        
            <p>Kats said all of his guests had checked out when the fire started, but guests staying on Thursday night had to be relocated.</p>
        
            <p>"We had to find alternative accommodation for our guests, which we did, which is all worked out fine. Small town, you know, come to the party. People offering accommodation and stuff. You know, it's just been amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Kats said the firefighters were amazing.</p>

            <p>"Most of the volunteers were working their butts off and and our motel was only touch and go.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire was right beside it and when the big truck from Dunedin arrived, then they got the fire under control. If they been half an hour later, I'd say the motel would have been very badly damaged."</p>
        
            <p>Kats said the motel had suffered smoke and water damage.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency is appealing to the public for information as to what started the fire.</p>

            <p>Fire investigator John Smalls said people in Roxburgh may be able to help determine how and where it started.</p>
        
            <p>"We really feel for the community, who are clearly devastated by the loss of their historic building," he said</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we're doing everything we can to get a clear picture of what was happening to the building before and during yesterday's fire.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have any photographs or footage of the Town Hall from 11am onwards yesterday, please send them through to OtagoRiskReduction@fireandemergency.nz.</p>
        
            <p>"We're especially looking for any images that show the back and sides of the building."</p>
        
            <p>Smalls said the call went out to the community on Friday morning and the response had already been terrific.</p>
        
            <p>"We know how much this building means to local people, both for its current use, and as an important link to Roxburgh's long history."</p>
        
            <p>Central Otago District Council is also warning members of the public to stay away from the site of the fire.</p>
