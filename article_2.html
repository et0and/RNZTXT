            <p>The Indian High Commission in Wellington has warned nurses against coming to New Zealand unless they have a genuine job offer.</p>
        
            <p>"It has come to the notice of the High Commission of India that a number of Indian nurses are facing difficulties in securing jobs in New Zealand, even though they may have successfully completed the Competency Assessment Programme (CAP) and registration with New Zealand Nursing Council," the Indian diplomatic mission said in a statement on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] would like to advise the Indian nurses that they should not travel to New Zealand unless they have a genuine job offer. It is also advisable to get the genuineness of the employer checked by the High Commission by emailing at pol.wellington@mea.gov.in ."</p>
        
            <p>The Indian High Commission also warned nurses to refrain from paying agents who promised "guaranteed" jobs.</p>
        
            <p>"Indian nurses and their spouses are requested not to leave their current jobs until the job process with the prospective employer in New Zealand [has been] formalised," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>The development comes after a spate of media reports documenting the struggle that hundreds of experienced nurses from India face in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has also reported on how flaws in the accredited employer work visa have spread to the health sector, leading to an influx of Indian nurses.</p>
        
            <p>In January, India's External Affairs Ministry issued an advisory on the rise of unregistered recruitment agents who charged exorbitant fees.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry advised prospective migrants to seek jobs overseas through registered recruitment agents.</p>
