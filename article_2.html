            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sys his clash with Donald Trump last week was "regrettable", that he was ready to work under the US president's leadership to bring lasting peace, and that it was "time to make things right".</p>
        
            <p>The statement came after Washington paused military aid to Kyiv in a stunning move overnight, days after Zelensky's talks with Trump descended into acrimony, prompting the US secretary of state to call on the Ukrainian leader to apologise.</p>
        
            <p>"Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right," Zelensky posted on X.</p>
        
            <p>"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His statement made no mention of the US suspension of military assistance, the latest move by Trump's administration that has upended US policy on the war in Ukraine and adopted a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow.</p>
        
            <p>The Ukrainian leader said Kyiv was interested in future cooperation and communication with the United States.</p>
        
            <p>"We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"None of us wants an endless war. Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians," he said.</p>
        
            <p>I would like to reiterate Ukraine’s commitment to peace. None of us wants an endless war. Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under…</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky had been in Washington to sign a deal to give the US access to Ukrainian minerals, but left without signing it.</p>
        
            <p>White House national security adviser earlier Mike Waltz told Fox News that Zelensky must apologise.</p>
        
            <p>"What we need to hear from President Zelensky is that he has regret for what happened, he's ready to sign this minerals deal and that he's ready to engage in peace talks," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think that's too much to ask. We'll see what happens in the next 48 hours, but we are certainly looking to move forward in a positive way."</p>
