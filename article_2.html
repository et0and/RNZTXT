            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis has implored public servants to bring bold new ideas to the table, while acknowledging the government was "asking a lot" of them at an "unsettling" time.</p>
        
            <p>Willis' speech to the Institute of Public Administration comes as the coalition is driving a major cost-cutting exercise across the public service, axing thousands of jobs and initiatives.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at Parliament's Banquet Hallon Thursday morning, Willis began by thanking the "wise and experienced" public servants for assisting the government during tough economic circumstances, noting their "thoughtfulness, tenacity, and earnestness".</p>
        
            <p>She reiterated the coalition's consistent position that the public service savings drive would continue, describing fiscal discipline as good practice.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not a one-off, one-Budget affair. It is an ongoing state of mind."</p>
        
            <p>Willis stressed, however, that the government's aspirations went far beyond getting the books in order: "We are intent on improving lives."</p>

            <p>She called on those attending to bring their "best and boldest ideas" for tackling the country's most entrenched challenges, saying the government was open to change.</p>
        
            <p>Willis cited the government's 'social investment' approach, saying robust data analysis would help the government make targeted interventions.</p>
        
            <p>"No country can afford to fund every good thing. Every dollar spent comes at the opportunity cost of a dollar spent elsewhere. We must always be working to focus funds where they can have the most profound and enduring impact.</p>
        
            <p>"The prize for that effort is the most important prize of all: it is a child fulfilling the full human potential with which they entered this world."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said the government also wanted to work more closely with community-based providers and had asked the Social Investment Agency to improve the existing "criss-crossing and overlapping" contracts used.</p>
        
            <p>"We know change can be unsettling and we know we are asking a lot of you and your colleagues in the public service.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time that we're making savings across the public sector, we're not just asking you to deliver business as usual - we're challenging you to think and operate differently.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, wrestling with that reality conjures up a phrase attributed to that great New Zealand pioneer, Ernest Rutherford: 'We haven't got the money, so we'll have to think.'</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident in your ability to rise to the challenge."</p>
