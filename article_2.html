        <h2>Builders keen on RMA change to push papakāinga housing</h2>
        <p>
The coalition government agreement suggests removing the need for consent for dwellings less than 60 square metres.

            <p>A small sentence in the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement could speed up development of papakāinga and address overcrowding, builders say.</p>
        
            <p>The line suggests removing the need for consent for dwellings less than 60m2, instead requiring only an engineer's report.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First deputy leader Shane Jones, who is the minister of regional development, said It was intended for granny flats.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason why we've promoted the 60 square metre cottage option is a practical response to the large number of Kiwis in their 60s who will require rental accommodation and who have never managed to purchase a home themselves."</p>
        
            <p>But there were other benefits, including for iwi who had land and wanted to expand papakāinga - multiple homes on a single title with some communal facilities, Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're ready to go, and in many cases they're working with the owners of factories, who can mass produce these types of dwellings.</p>
        
            <p>"And if you can free them from the RMA [ Resource Management Act] restrictions, then it's going to reduce price, and it's going to deliver, in a short period of time, a practical response to the housing dramas."</p>
        
            <p>In Ngāwhā outside Kaikohe, Ngāpuhi kaumātua Ivan Hauraki, from Oraruwharo Ahu Whenua 2A Trust, has recently finished building a papakāinga for his whānau, made up of 10 transportable homes.</p>
        
            <p>Consent was a major obstacle, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believed the five-year project could have been completed in half the time, without the need for consent.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a bit of a jam up in that department, on getting resource consent.</p>
        
            <p>"But it would work really good if we could carry on and build these papakāinga around marae, for kaumatua and kuia."</p>
        
            <p>The new rule would help whānau help themselves, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know what we're doing, we know how to do it.</p>
        
            <p>"I've built a place here that any developer would be proud of."</p>
        
            <p>It was not just about bricks and mortar, he said. Being able to have whānau return home to their whenua had made huge improvements to their health and wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>"Wellbeing is probably the number one advantage that we get.</p>
        
            <p>"Once they got into this environment ... these people are really healthy and happy."</p>
        
            <p>On the East Coast, Willie Te Aho is a director at Toitū Tairāwhiti Builtsmart, which builds affordable homes locally - intended for low-income whānau who have access to land.</p>
        
            <p>Ditching the need for consent for small dwellings would be a great solution to overcrowding, which was a major problem, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a part of homelessness, and it's the hidden homelessness. We've got some families of up to 20 people in Gisborne living in a three-bedroom home."</p>
        
            <p>"Where we have the opportunity to put a fully serviced, 60 square metre house on their land, that will relieve a lot of pressure."</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop said he intended to introduce the change as part of a Resource Management Amendment Bill this year.</p>
