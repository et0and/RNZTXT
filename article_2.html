            <p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has addressed supporters at a convention centre in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>A smiling Trump has told supporters: "This is the greatest political movement of all time."</p>
        
            <p>He said this "would the golden age of America".</p>
        
            <p>While some swing states are still counting votes, his rival Democrat Kamala Harris has almost no path to victory left, while Trump is on track to win significantly more of the electoral college votes needed for victory.</p>
        
            <p>Trump said he would help the country heal after a divisive election.</p>
        
            <p>"We made history tonight."</p>
        
            <p>Trump said America had given the Republicans a powerful and unprecedented mandate.</p>
        
            <p>He has told cheering supporters in Florida that he is winning in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Alaska - all states which are still counting their votes, although he appears to be significantly ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a magnificent victory for the American people."</p>
        
            <p>Harris is not expected to speak tonight.</p>
