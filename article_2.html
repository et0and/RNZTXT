            <p>An Auckland restaurant is inviting cash-strapped customers to bring their own raw fish to be cooked into dinner dishes for a fee of $30.</p>
        
            <p>Owners of Zhu Kitchen on Dominion Road told the Herald business has been "extremely slow" lately, and it was a way for them to compete for budget-conscious customers in the face of reduced consumer spending.</p>
        
            <p>In response, the Ministry for Primary Industries is reminding businesses selling higher-risk foods to have food control plans that set out steps to manage food safety - and check whether they needed to be registered.</p>
        
            <p>Queenie Chia, who co-owns Zhu Kitchen, said their innovation began in August, when the restaurant collaborated with a fishing charter company to allow anglers to bring their catch to the restaurant to have it cooked.</p>
        
            <p>"It worked out well, so we decided to allow [all] customers to bring in their own fish and crayfish," Chia said.</p>
        
            <p>She said customers could get their fish steamed, or fried Chinese salt and pepper-style, for $30 instead of paying $78.80 for the same dish with a restaurant-supplied whole fish.</p>
        
            <p>"We charge $50 per kg to cook a crayfish that customers brought in ... compared to the $220 per kg if they got the crayfish from us," she said.</p>

            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said food businesses doing this had to be registered with a food control plan to manage hazards involved in making their food.</p>
        
            <p>"If it is something the business wants to do, they can cook someone's recreational catch ... and manage any hazards under the business's food control plan," Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>"The chef must make sure the supplied ingredients are only served to the relevant customer and their party, and don't get mixed up with regulated food sold to other customers."</p>
        
            <p>Arbuckle said separate pots, pans and utensils must be used to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
        
            <p>He said these precautions are important because it is illegal for businesses to sell home kill and recreational catch on to other customers.</p>
        
            <p>The Restaurant Association says it has become common for businesses to innovate and adapt to economic pressures by offering affordable dining options.</p>
        
            <p>Since August, several Asian restaurants including Zen-E Private Kitchen, Bento Express, and Duck Duck Goose started offering set meals for less than $10.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, Lucky Grill Seafood Restaurant in Highland Park offered customers the option to bring their own ingredients - however, that business closed down last year.</p>
        
            <p>The latest quarterly report by the Restaurant Association found sales revenue in Auckland for the second quarter dropped 0.7%, and 76% of those surveyed reported worse or significantly worse profitability compared to the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>Mental health and wellbeing were also under strain in the sector, with 54% of owners indicating a negative impact on their health compared with 42% in the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>"Many restaurants have reinvented themselves to cater to budget-conscious diners who are prioritising quantity over luxury," said association chief executive Marisa Bidois.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Armitage, Hospitality New Zealand chief executive, said Auckland is continually evolving as a global culinary hub and ethnic restaurants play an important role.</p>
        
            <p>"The current economic climate has seen many of these establishments reinvent themselves, offering a wider range of dining experiences focusing on low-cost options and new innovations to encourage locals and visitors to dine out during the cost-of-living crisis," Armitage said.</p>
        
            <p>"Although margins will be incredibly tight, retaining a loyal customer base in this environment is likely to pay off in the long run through repeat visitation, and may also attract new customers drawn to budget-friendly options."</p>
