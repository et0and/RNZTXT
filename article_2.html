        <h2>Watch: Luxon, Peters dismiss Treaty Principles debate at Rātana</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister says he can mend the relationship with Māori after the bill is voted down, and he would refuse a future referendum in the next election's coalition negotiations.
</p>
        
            <p>A string of politicians have cast doubts on the future of the contentious Treaty Principles Bill, during speeches at Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill is "dead in the water", New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The bill will "never going to go past the first reading," he told those in attendance on Friday at the movement's largest gathering for the year.</p>

            <p>In his turn at the podium, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated his earlier stance against the bill's future prospects: "National won't support the bill - it will be voted down and it won't become law."</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Teanau Tuiono said that while political parties present today at Rātana have many differences, all had no love for the Treaty Principles Bill, and the fight had just begun to stop it.</p>
        
            <p>It followed New Zealand First's Shane Jones telling people not to waste any more energy opposing the controversial bill, because it will never see the light of day.</p>
        
            <p>Followers of the Rātana Church, called mōrehu, gather at the small settlement south of Whanganui each year in January to celebrate the birthday of the movement's founder, Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, on 25 January.</p>
        
            <p>The event traditionally marks the start of the political year, as politicians pay tribute to the movement and engage with Māori leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister was welcomed to Rātana on Friday morning, along with Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins, other National and Labour MPs, and members of New Zealand First and Green Party.</p>
        
            <p>ACT was the only party not attending the celebrations.</p>

            <p>Various speakers on Friday expressed concern to the government at the state of Māori-Crown relations.</p>
        
            <p>Rātana was known for its longstanding alliance with the Labour Party, with candidates from a Rātana background holding the Māori seats for several decades. Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer won the Te Tai Hauāuru seat, of which Rātana Pā is a part, at the last election.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Tainui leader Tuku Morgan told RNZ the gathering would be a chance for the prime minister to front up to Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"He may not be fronting up in Waitangi, he made that clear, but he can't run forever."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's decision to skip Waitangi commemorations was a symbol of the government's inability to find "meaningful solutions" for Māori issues, Morgan said.</p>

            <p>"Right now, anything meaningful has been crushed and annihilated."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's state of the nation speech on Thursday did not mention Māori issues.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking during the pōwhiri to mōrehu on Friday, Luxon reflected on the founder of their faith - Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana - who he said may have been a National party supporter.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon spoke about Rātana's focus on improving the lives of Māori, and said that is also what his government was focused on.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe Rātana was an entrepreneur - and possibly a National Party person.</p>
        
            <p>"He actually believed in actually creating the economic wealth, so that he actually had it, so that he could invest it in the well-being of his people."</p>
        
            <p>The acknowledged the frank "open dialogue" and opinions he had often received from Māori leaders during his time as prime minister, including frequent comments from one that prime ministers will come and go.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media, Luxon acknowledged the "anxiety" the Treaty Principles Bill had caused for Māori - and for "all sides of the debate", but said it simply would not become law.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "real common ground in the values of [Māori] and the National party, and National wanted Māori participating in the economy, which would help them support their people.</p>
        
            <p>National was working to grow the economy, accelerate development of social housing and infrastructure, and focusing on health and education. While a significant reduction of the numbers of households in emergency housing was also a benefit to Māori, and he wants to see more Treaty settlements during his time in the top job.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Prime Minister said he enjoyed going to Rātana, adding it was not a deeply political occasion: "My message will be really about how do we move forward as a country a little bit, how do we make sure we respect the Treaty, how do we respect each other? It doesn't mean we're going to agree on everything, but actually it means we should still be very focussed on the goal of making New Zealand better."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were "a number of opportunities" regarding where he would attend Waitangi commemorations, which would be confirmed closer to the time.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said the prime minister was being led by ACT, pointing to recent appointments at the Waitangi Tribunal - among them, former ACT leader Richard Prebble.</p>
        
            <p>"The political landscape has shown us that the legacy of Luxon isn't a legacy that will be largely remembered positively by te ao Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Many of the politicians' speeches went down poorly with the hosts, and many of those at the Rātana celebrations remained concerned about the Treaty Principles Bill, despite National and New Zealand First's assurances, Ngarewa-Packer said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone was saying ...[if National was convinced the Treaty Principles Bill would go nowhere] then why did you agree to it and why are you here defending that you agreed to it? ... Why did you allow the Prime Minister to trade off our rights and the dignity to live with peace and aroha together in New Zealand."</p>

            <p>Rātana spokesperson Kamaka Manuel told those gathered that Rātana has been a space that provides for Māori and non-Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"We all know that in recent times there has been a rocky ship from our point of view, but you have seen that there has been collaboration also - let that collaboration ... not fall upon painted ears, please."</p>
        
            <p>Former Te Pāti Māori co-leader Tariana Turia was still being mourned at Rātana Pā. Both speakers from the hau kāinga (the home side) paid tribute to Turia in their kōrero.</p>
        
            <p>The office of the Governor-General said a miscommunication was behind Dame Cindy Kiro's absence at Rātana this morning, where she was expected.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Kiro said she recognises the significance of the annual Rātana celebrations, and she "wishes all those involved well for the celebrations."</p>
