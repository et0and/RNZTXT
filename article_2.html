            <p>About 20 runners and walkers in the Emerson's Dunedin Marathon were forced to scatter mid-race this morning, when a vehicle veered off Harington Point Road and into the path of the competitors.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Senior Sergeant Blair Dalton said the incident happened about 9am Sunday, when the driver was believed to have had a "medical event".</p>
        
            <p>He said the vehicle collided with a number of road signs before forcing 20 competitors in the marathon to scatter for safety.</p>
        
            <p>While this had the potential to be a serious incident, none of the competitors were hurt, Dalton said.</p>
        
            <p>He praised members of the public who came to the aid of the driver.</p>
        
            <p>"Understandably, Police have had calls from people who were close to being run over, wanting to know what happened, and asking whether the driver was okay.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver was assessed by St John and taken to Dunedin Hospital in a moderate condition for treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial indications suggest this was a medical event, and it's incredibly fortunate nobody was hurt as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"On behalf of Police, we want to say thank you to the people who went to the woman's aid after she crashed and to those who called for help."</p>
