        <h2>'Assault on nature': Environment loses in Budget 2024</h2>
        <p>
The government's only new environmental funding will go to resource management reforms, which have been relaxing rules for natural protection.

            <p>The only new money in the Budget earmarked for the environment will go towards resource management reforms, an area which so far has relaxed rules for natural protection.</p>
        
            <p>The government has committed $92 million over four years "to deliver the government's resource management reforms, including fast-track consenting legislation, Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991 amendments, updates to national direction and RMA replacement legislation".</p>
        
            <p>The Fast-Track Approvals Bill would give three ministers, none of them the environment minister, the final say on whether or not to green-light infrastructure projects, even those denied resource consent or halted in the courts.</p>
        
            <p>Proposed freshwater amendments have been criticised by environmental groups as a continuation of a "war on nature", as they would relax rules for farmers and instruct councils to deprioritise the natural environment when issuing consents.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, the cuts in Budget 2024 are larger than the gains.</p>
        
            <p>Job cuts at the Ministry for the Environment will save $22m by 2028, and by reducing funding for freshwater programmes the government would save more than $23m within the same timeframe.</p>

            <p>Green Party environment spokesperson Lan Pham said that was "a real hit" to both the projects it funded, and the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"It means less jobs for people, it means less connection with nature."</p>
        
            <p>A further $9m has been cut from funding for evidence and data, in the form of consultants, external agencies and specialists that supply a range of services, including updates to environmental standards, monitoring, reporting, policy work and science assurance.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace was critical of the move, saying it would make it "harder to document the impact of the government's policies".</p>
        
            <p>While conservation is being funded to the tune of nearly $32m, there is no new spending on the table.</p>
        
            <p>Rather, more savings will come from the decision not to continue funding Jobs for Nature, a programme set up by the former government to create nature-based jobs to improve native biodiversity and employment prospects, following Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>It was due to wrap up in 2026, but by stopping the programme now and returning the funding not yet committed to any specific project, the government saved $55m.</p>
        
            <p>Read more on Budget 2024:</p>
        
            <p>The government is going to save another $17m by deciding not to go ahead with the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary, almost a decade after former prime minister John Key first announced plans for the 620,000-square-kilometre project in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Another $6.5m was saved by cutting funding for legal and regulatory services, among other things, at the Department of Conservation, which Forest & Bird said would reduce the department's ability to advocate for nature through the legal system.</p>
        
            <p>Forest & Bird conservation advocacy group manager Richard Capie said the government was "effectively raiding the conservation budget to pay for its assault on nature".</p>
        
            <p>Pham said the budget showed the government had misunderstood its role and duty of care in protecting the environment.</p>
        
            <p>"When these agencies that are so critical to the protection and restoration of our natural environment are so underfunded, they just can't respond, they're essentially crippled," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's exactly what this government wants, because they are pushing ahead with really environmentally damaging, and actually very anti-democratic bills ... which they don't want anyone to be able to challenge them on."</p>
