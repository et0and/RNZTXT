            <p>Storms have eased overnight though parts of the country may still experience strong winds and showers today.</p>
        
            <p>The lower North Island and far north of the South Island will see showers and strong winds as a low pressure system crosses the country, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>A watch is in place for heavy rain about the west of the Tasman District.</p>
        
            <p>South Taranaki, coastal Whanganui, Manawaū and the Tararua District may experience severe gale west to northwest winds and watches are in place in these regions.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, the weather was expected to settle down as the low pressure system moves off the country.</p>

            <p>Westland Mayor Helen Lash said the effect weather-induced road closures on tourism businesses in Franz Josef and Fox Glacier will be significant.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple slips closed State Highway 6 -- the only route connecting the two glacier towns -- as heavy rain battered the region this week.</p>
        
            <p>All roads in the region have now reopened but Lash said the three-day closure of the main highway has affected tourism operators.</p>
        
            <p>The region was recovering quickly, and was open for business, she said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile a tiny township on the West Coast could be left without power for days after stormy weather took down some poles.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Energy, the provider for Hannah's Clearing near Haast, said three poles fell on Wednesday and several more came down the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Outages were affecting the south of the township.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Energy said crews were trying to restore power under extreme conditions.</p>
