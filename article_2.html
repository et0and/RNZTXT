            <p>A Wellington IT worker accused of leaking Te Whatu Ora vaccine data has not breached his bail conditions by doing an interview with a United States-based conspiracy website, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Young, 56, was arrested on Sunday and charged with accessing a computer system for dishonest purposes.</p>
        
            <p>After his release on bail on Tuesday, he did an interview with Alex Jones on his website InfoWars in which he described trying to alert officials and politicians to his findings before going public.</p>
        
            <p>During the interview he said his arrest at gunpoint was an overreaction.</p>
        
            <p>Eight police officers had arrived at his home to arrest him and search his house, he told InfoWars.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson has told RNZ Young has not breached his bail conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand has described its employee's actions as "a gross breach of trust" and said there was no truth to the claims that Covid-19 vaccines have caused excess deaths.</p>
