        <h2>Everyone must… joke? Listeners mock new tourism slogan</h2>
        <p>
Critics say the new phrase, 'Everyone Must Go', sounded like a clearance sale - so they came up with alternatives. Audio

            <p>Some of New Zealand's best creative minds - Morning Report listeners - have been brainstorming alternatives to the newly unveiled 'Everyone must go' tourism campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christoper Luxon and Tourism Minister Louise Upston launched the $500,000 'Everyone Must Go' campaign on Sunday, which will hit Australian airwaves and social for about a month, starting this week.</p>
        
            <p>But critics like Labour Party tourism spokesperson Cushla Tangaere-Manuel said the new slogan sounded like a clearance sale.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism New Zealand chief executive René de Monchy said it was designed to promote urgency for Australians - our only short-haul market - to visit.</p>
        
            <p>One RNZ listener hinted at an ulterior motive.</p>
        
            <p>"Surely 'Everyone Must Go' is a subtle dig at the Australian government's intransigence concerning 501 deportees", Micheal asked.</p>
        
            <p>Another listener expressed concern at the cost - and quality - of the campaign slogan.</p>
        
            <p>"Can't believe that slogan cost half a mill. Is that the best our tourism can offer?"</p>
        
            <p>That critic did offer an alternative, suggesting flipping a classic of Australia's tourism industry.</p>
        
            <p>"There's more besides the snow, mate, so.... where the bloody hell are YOU?"</p>
        
            <p>Hilda suggested there was no need to lure people over, because there would be thousands of Aussies visiting New Zealand with or without a marketing blitz - "the families of the Kiwis that used to live here".</p>

            <p>Another suggested a more direct comparison was appropriate: "No crocs, no snakes, no killer spiders, no cane toads, no 50C heat, no red dirt - see you soon."</p>
        
            <p>While another raised concerns of some of the country's most popular tourism spots, and their infrastructure woes.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody's got to go is exactly the problem, as Queenstown's sewerage system struggles to cope."</p>
        
            <p>Listener Madeline underscored the point, and asked if encouraging mass tourism would only exacerbate existing issues of over-tourism and environmental degradation.</p>
        
            <p>"Flooding New Zealand with tourists is not the answer to this country's woes. It wrecks the country and communities, drives up prices for locals and [brings] us an environmental disaster. This flailing government is grasping at polluting straws."</p>
        
            <p>Professor of Marketing Analytics at Massey University, Dr Bodo Lang, told Morning Report it is a good slogan.</p>
        
            <p>"I think short is good, and something that has a call to action is a good thing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I like that there's a sense of urgency."</p>
        
            <p>However, Lang said it did sound a bit like a command, and like there was a sale on.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the last thing we want. We want high value tourism, not low value tourism."</p>
        
            <p>While he said $500,000 may seem like a lot of money, it would be worth it to target the more than 25 million people in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"If we could convince 10 percent to come over, they all spend $2,000 here, that's $5 billion."</p>
        
            <p>Lang added that reminder advertising was important.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, Australians know where New Zealand is, and they know broadly what it has to offer, but they may not quite realise how varied the country is," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think New Zealand's unbelievably diverse, and its flora and fauna and landscapes, and it's such a small country and has such diversity.</p>
        
            <p>"So, to me, I think that type of campaign can really pay off.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely think we can certainly get a payback from half a million dollars.</p>
        
            <p>"It does sound like a lot of money, but actually it's not."</p>
