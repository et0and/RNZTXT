        <h2>Live: Power cuts as fast-moving storm sweeps over Auckland</h2>
        <p>
A rapidly moving storm has cut power to homes before passing, while heavy wind still looms.
</p>
        
            <p>Severe thunderstorms and strong winds set to hit Auckland to Waikato are arriving earlier than forecast.</p>
        
            <p>The Metservice has issued a red thunderstorm warning across Auckland, Thames Coromandel, Kaipara, Auckland and Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Gusts are also expected to reach 120km/h in some parts.</p>
