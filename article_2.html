        <h2>Wall almost crashes Ruthe's magical mile celebration</h2>
        <p>
The middle-distance journeyman quietly became New Zealand's 50th four-minute miler behind the teenage prodigy.

            <p>This weekend, Ben Wall ticks off a big item off from his bucket list, when he attends the China Formula One Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a bit of an F1 fan," he admitted from outside the Shanghai International Circuit. "I've been wanting to go for a race for a while and saw there was an Air New Zealand sale to China around the time of this race, so I thought I'd take the opportunity and go for it."</p>
        
            <p>Consider it an unexpected reward for achieving another life ambition just three days ago, as the Fielding middle-distance journeyman dipped under four minutes for the mile for the very first time.</p>
        
            <p>As Olympian Sam Tanner stepped aside to usher teenage Sam Ruthe into history, attention briefly turned to the interloper threatening to crash their party down the homestraight of Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"After 800 metres, I was starting to feel the pace a bit, but managed to relax and hang on there nicely," Wall recalled. "With 200 metres to go, I was still feeling pretty good and thought I'd see what I could do.</p>
        
            <p>"At 150, I improved up onto Sam Ruthe's shoulder, and he noticed that and ran a bit wider. That was when he started to take off.</p>
        
            <p>"Sam Tanner was always going to run wide to let him through, because that was the plan. I didn't quite have enough in the tank, but it was a pretty substantial personal best and everything I had."</p>
        
            <p>Tanner would win the race in lane three, clocking 3m 58.29s - nine seconds slower than his best - as he encouraged his training mate to the finish-line. Ruthe, 15, became the youngest to ever break four minutes with his 3m 58.35s, as Wall chased him home in 3m 59.00s.</p>
        
            <p>While everyone else celebrated Ruthe's amazing feat, Wall was left to quietly relish his own personal milestone, as he became New Zealand's 50th man under four minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The benchmark has become more commonplace since Sir Roger Bannister first flew around Oxford's Iffley Road Track in 1954, but it still holds a certain mystique that differentiates between a serious miler and a pretender.</p>
        
            <p>During his illustrious career, former world recordholder Sir John Walker - whose 3m 49.08s still stands as our national mark - became the first to run 100 sub-fours, while two-time Olympic 1500m medallist Nick Willis broke the barrier over 20 consecutive years, aged 38.</p>
        
            <p>The mile is as much part of Kiwi sporting folklore as the All Blacks, so Wall, 23, now finds himself in exclusive company.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty significant to me," he said. "It's something I've always wanted to do and I'd always said, if I finished my career without doing it, I would have been quite disappointed."</p>
        
            <p>His breakthrough did not overly surprise Wall, who had clocked 3m 43s over 1500 metres last month.</p>
        
            <p>"That's like a 4.01 equivalent over a mile, so I thought, on a really good day, I could get close to four flat or sneak under," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I always had a feeling that it was there and I hadn't executed some of my previous races as well as I should have, but I also wasn't expecting to do it.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a feeling I could do it, but wasn't sure if it would happen."</p>
        
            <p>Wall's previous best was 4m 03.1s, and he partly credits the atmosphere and hype around Ruthe's age record attempt for his performance, but he must now reset to focus on a new goal.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to break 3m 40s for 1500 metresâ€¦ get into the 3m 30s," he said. "Sub-four equivalent is around 3m 42s, so I need to be a little bit quicker than that.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't left the country to race, so I'd like to go to Europe and get into some races there."</p>
        
            <p>Maybe Wall can work that around his next visit to the Formula One circuit.</p>
        
            <p>"It may be a couple of years before I get to another one," he admits.</p>
