            <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen has 'liked' an Instagram post by former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde criticising the team for dropping New Zealander Liam Lawson just two rounds into the season.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's demotion back to the Racing Bulls sister outfit, in a straight swap with Yuki Tsunoda, means Verstappen will have his third teammate in four races in Japan next week.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen's Dutch compatriot Van der Garde, who raced 19 times for now-defunct Caterham in 2013, said he was "getting a bit tired of" the narrative of having to deliver under pressure or face the consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, you gotta perform. Yes, the pressure is insane. But in my opinion this comes closer to bullying or a panic move than actual high athlete achievements," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They made a decision - fully aware - gave Liam two races only to crush his spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't forget the dedication, hard work and success Liam has put in his career so far to achieve the level where he is now... yes, he underperformed the first two races - but if anyone's aware of that it's himself."</p>
        
            <p>Van der Garde urged Lawson to "trust yourself, get your head up, prove them wrong".</p>
        
            <p>Those who liked the post included Verstappen's Instagram account and that of former Red Bull driver Pierre Gasly, who also lost his place alongside the now-four times world champion in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Dutch media have reported that Verstappen, who has not commented directly, was unhappy with the decision to drop Lawson.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson, preferred to the more experienced Tsunoda when former champions Red Bull dropped Mexican Sergio Perez at the end of last year, has yet to score as teammate of Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>Tsunoda started the season strongly and has shrugged off an early career reputation for being excitable and erratic. The 24-year-old has been itching for the chance to show what he can do at a top team.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the RB21 at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch," Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

            <p>"We came into the 2025 season with two ambitions; to retain the world drivers' championship and to reclaim the world constructors' title and this is a purely sporting decision.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21 and Yuki's experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car," added the Briton.</p>
        
            <p>"We welcome him to the team and are looking forward to seeing him behind the wheel of the RB21."</p>
        
            <p>Tsunoda has been backed through his career by Honda, Red Bull's engine partner until the end of this season and also owners of the Suzuka circuit that hosts the Japanese Grand Prix on 6 April.</p>
        
            <p>Honda are switching to Aston Martin in 2026, however, and Tsunoda's future beyond this year has looked uncertain with last year's teammate Lawson promoted over him and the Japanese repeatedly snubbed.</p>
        
            <p>Horner had questioned the sense of keeping Tsunoda on after 2025 at Racing Bulls given that the team's main purpose is to prepare young drivers for the step up, with others in the pipeline.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't have a driver in the support team for five years. You can't always be the bridesmaid. You've either got to let them go at that point or look at something different," Horner told reporters in December.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's very determined. He knows that things change very quickly," Horner added then. "Who would have thought nine months ago that we'd be sitting here talking about Liam Lawson being our driver for 2025?"</p>
        
            <p>Thursday's decision, which will be seen as brutal after just two races, added Lawson to a list of young drivers who have been found wanting and been shipped out after going up alongside Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>Alex Albon, now at Williams, and Pierre Gasly, racing for Alpine, are two such drivers who have rebuilt their reputations after leaving Red Bull.</p>
        
            <p>Horner said after last weekend's Chinese Grand Prix that Red Bull would support Lawson as best they could and he reiterated that sentiment.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And together we see that after such a difficult start it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with... Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well."</p>
        
            <p>Lawson will join French rookie Isack Hadjar at the Italy-based team.</p>
