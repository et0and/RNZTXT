            <p>A man called Parliament House and threatened to go to schools and start "killing kids" after seemingly becoming frustrated at people "taking advantage" of his family.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton man Abdul Shamil Javed's 26 February threat was taken so seriously that Wellington security staff immediately called the police, and his phone number was traced.</p>
        
            <p>Police went to Javed's house and his father gave the officers consent to search his room where his phone was found under a cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old appeared in the Hamilton District Court last month where he vacated his not-guilty plea, and admitted a charge of "causing a significant disruption to the activities of the civilian population of New Zealand by threatening to kill school children, an act likely to create a risk to the health of children".</p>
        
            <p>The charge carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>At the hearing, Judge Philip Crayton convicted the car detailer on the charge but delayed the release of court documents relating to his case for two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>NZME can now reveal Javed had made several phone calls to the police and the Parliament House in the early hours of that morning.</p>
        
            <p>However, the contents of a phone call made at 7.15am, in which he references the Christchurch mosque attacker, is what has led to his criminal conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Javed told Parliament House security staff he planned, from that day, to go to schools and kill children because people were "f***ing taking advantage of my family and kids, bro".</p>
        
            <p>"It's the community, the community is f***ing people's head up with torturing their kids and families, bro," he told the staff.</p>
        
            <p>"And people around the neighbourhood thinks [sic] that's very funny our family is going through stress and hardship and all this torture from others."</p>
        
            <p>During Javed's tirade, he continued to allude to a perceived personal issue and mentioned needing help.</p>
        
            <p>"They think it's easy. They didn't realise it's kids [sic].</p>
        
            <p>"People like that creates people, you know?</p>
        
            <p>"Now I know that Christchurch killer was killing because he had people like s*** people in his life, you know?</p>
        
            <p>"I, I've spoke about my kids, my family issue, no one f***ing helps, bro."</p>
        
            <p>Javed believed "everyone" was "laughing" at his family and threatened that now he was "f***ing gonna blow."</p>
        
            <p>When questioned by police, Javed denied making the phone call and claimed his phone had been missing for the last few days and he didn't know where it was.</p>
        
            <p>Javed first appeared in court in May and remained in custody until October, when he was released on electronically monitored bail.</p>
        
            <p>He will be sentenced in March.</p>
