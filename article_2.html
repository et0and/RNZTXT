            <p>The ACT Party is criticising Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi over a social media post that says his lawns are getting a "good ... hiding" because he's treating them like David Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>Waititi's wife shared the post featuring a photo of him with a weedeater, saying she had told him to behave as though the grass was his ACT counterpart.</p>
        
            <p>"Home after 3 weeks away, Lawns had a big rest and are now taller than me, I told him to just behave as though every piece of grass is a David Seymour, Lawns are getting a good fkn (sic) hiding," she wrote.</p>

            <p>He then re-shared his wife's post.</p>
        
            <p>An ACT Party spokesperson criticised the post.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, New Zealand needs to face up to a very sad and serious reality. We have a race-based party that preaches racial supremacy and violence, and we've turned a blind eye to it because they're Māori."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time Waititi and Seymour have clashed over one another's rhetoric.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori has not responded to requests for comment.</p>
