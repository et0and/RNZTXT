            <p>Instead of their regular duties, this week the Anderson whānau stepped in to volunteer at Te Matatini.</p>
        
            <p>Theodore Anderson would normally be scaffolding, but he is now carting kaumātua up and down the steep Bowl of Brooklands hills from dawn to dusk.</p>
        
            <p>"The same reason's there [at mahi], the passion's there, but this moment here is the kaupapa Māori, is the kaupapa o te ao."</p>
        
            <p>He is up at 5am to be on the job at 6am, riding around on buggies until he clocks off at 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good kaupapa and the wairua is there to carry us through to the next day. Really, it's all the kaupapa and the wairua that drives us every single day and the people here have been awesome - the mauri - I love it."</p>
        
            <p>Everyday is different. He meets and greets new 'aunties and nannies' with a grin and a 'kia ora'.</p>
        
            <p>"Give them a mean tour of the ngahere and just hear their comments about it all. Loving each moment and when I drop them off they're getting into the bush and they've never seen something like this before."</p>
        
            <p>
There were over 10 buggies roaming freely around the Bowl of Brooklands, all kitted out with a squeeky pink bike horn.

            <p>Some people loved the ride a little too much.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't want to get off. They're taking me to the wrong entrance all the time, but it's been good. It's been awesome, but that's what I love about the moment."</p>
        
            <p>One of the many reasons that he wanted to help out was for the rangatahi.</p>
        
            <p>"I do it for our kuias and the next generation coming through, and be out there drive our kaupapa."</p>
        
            <p>"You know, if I can do it everyone else can follow their dream-papa."</p>
        
            <p>There were over 10 buggies roaming freely around the Bowl of Brooklands, all kitted out with a squeeky pink bike horn that was used to warn the walkers.</p>
        
            <p>"Pink is for the boys," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His wife Paula Anderson was the Pouako at Te Pi'ipi'inga Kakano Mai i Rangiatea kura kaupapa Māori, but this week she was the managing the Marketplace. Paula said she had been working tirelessly behind the scenes and allowed her son to speak on behalf of her.</p>
        
            <p>Their sons Tuterangi, Autahi, and Tamaiti were helping out where they could. Meanwhile their oldest child and only daughter, Mereana had stuck to her regular mahi, teaching kids, although she had helped out at the festival when able.</p>
        
            <p>Eldest son Tuterangi said for the whānau to be ringa hāpai was a no brainer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to get the whānau in to just help out with the kaupapa."</p>

            <p>"We've just been helping at the Marketplace, helping at the tents, and just helping out wherever we need to be."</p>
        
            <p>It was also a moment for him to absorb the atmosphere of rangatahi and tamariki speaking their native tongue, he said.</p>
