            <p>Boeing has told airlines operating 787 Dreamliners that pilots need to check their seats as an investigation into an incident on a LATAM flight continues.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after 50 people were hurt this week when a 787 dropped suddenly during a LATAM Airlines flight.</p>
        
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that a flight attendant accidentally hit a switch on the pilot's seat, which pushed the pilot into the controls, forcing down the plane's nose.</p>
        
            <p>LATAM is supporting investigations.</p>
        
            <p>During the incident people were thrown against the roof of the plane, which was travelling from Australia to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Passenger Brian Jokat said at the time that a number of people suffered head injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to the BBC, Jokat revealed that people had hit the ceiling with such force "some of the roof panels were broken".</p>
        
            <p>The person next to him, he added, appeared to be "glued to the ceiling".</p>
        
            <p>"I did think for a split second: 'This is it'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services later said one person was in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation of Flight LA800 is ongoing and we defer to the investigation authorities on any potential findings," Boeing said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have taken the precautionary measure of reminding 787 operators of a service bulletin issued in 2017 which included instructions for inspecting and maintaining switches on flight deck seats."</p>
        
            <p>It recommended that operators perform an inspection of the switches "at the next maintenance opportunity".</p>
        
            <p>Chilean-Brazilian carrier LATAM Airlines said it "continues to work in coordination with the authorities in order to support the ongoing investigation".</p>
        
            <p>The aircraft was scheduled to fly on from Auckland to Santiago, the capital of Chile.</p>
        
            <p>The departure was cancelled and a new flight scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The incident comes after a door panel came off a Boeing plane in January this year, with a report in February finding bolts meant to secure the panel were missing.</p>
        
            <p>And this week, a former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firm's production standards was found dead in the US.</p>
