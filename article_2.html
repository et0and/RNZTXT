        <h2>Lower Hutt's Twilight Christmas Parade cancelled</h2>
        <p>
An organiser said the accident at the Avondale Christmas Parade last weekend in which six people were injured after a car rolled into the crowd was a factor in the decision.

            <p>Organisers of a popular Lower Hutt Christmas parade have reluctantly cancelled the event because of traffic safety worries.</p>
        
            <p>Petone's Jackson Street Collective co-ordinator Hellen Swales said the accident at the Avondale Christmas Parade last weekend in which six people were injured after a car rolled into the crowd was one factor in the decision.</p>
        
            <p>The Twilight Christmas Parade was originally supposed to go ahead last Friday, but was postponed until today due to bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, half our volunteer marshalls were unable to make it this week."</p>
        
            <p>The marshalls were needed to control the crowds, with 36 entry points along the parade route down Jackson Street, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"People always move the traffic cones. They're really keen to see the next float coming down and there's a gradual creep onto the road.</p>
        
            <p>"And if we don't manage that well, my fear is we might have an accident similar to what happened up in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't easy, but we had to make that call from a health and safety perspective."</p>
        
            <p>Swales admitted it was disappointing for all the community groups, businesses and schools, which had prepared floats, as well as the public.</p>
        
            <p>However, there were still many Christmas events planned for Petone, including Santa's Grotto, a Christmas window competition and a treasure hunt, she said.</p>
