        <h2>'That process could have been better' - Robertson on controversial try</h2>
        <p>
All Black coach Scott Robertson has spoken out out on the controversial call in the loss to the Springboks.
</p>
        
            <p>All Black coach Scott Robertson cut a disappointed but measured figure as the fallout from the first test against the Springboks showed no signs of dissipating.</p>
        
            <p>The highly entertaining match was marred by an obvious blunder by the reffing crew, who chose not to take a second look at Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi's 16th minute try. Mbonambi clearly lost the ball in Jordie Barrett's tackle as he crossed the line, something that Robertson confirmed that the All Blacks will be seeking a 'please explain' from World Rugby's officiating department.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll wait to hear back from them," said Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"They review first, and then we pass our review on too. So officially, then there's no double ups. And we will ask the question if they if they haven't given the answer or cover that point."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson was diplomatic about his feelings on the on-field chain of events between referee Andrew Brace and TMO Brian MacNeice, saying:</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like that process could have been better."</p>
        
            <p>There had been no contact with Brace or the officials after the game.</p>

            <p>"I haven't had a chance to have a beer or a coffee with Mr Brace or anything around it, and you know it's a sign of respect and a little bit of etiquette around it."</p>
        
            <p>As for the rest of the officiating efforts, which saw a lopsided 14-5 penalty count cost the All Blacks precious field position and gave the Springboks a massive favour in their eventual comeback, Robertson said that:</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to show the pictures he (Brace) needed and, you know, it's a chance for us to have a look at ourselves and ask questions of him as well. But it's a lot of penalties, a lot of the individual stuff we can sort out though."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the All Blacks may be sweating on a judicial review of their own after Springbok captain Siya Kolisi suffered a broken cheekbone during the 31-27 Springbok victory. Replays suggest that it was due to a collision with Sam Cane during the second half, and although it was cleared by the in-game citing commissioner, it can be cited on a second review.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't seen any foul play," said Robertson of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"All I heard was that there was a dipping, glancing head clash…the in-game officer hasn't come up with anything."</p>

            <p>When pressed about any changes for the second test in Cape Town this weekend, he simply stated that he will "always look at the squad."</p>
        
            <p>"Your team wants to be for this weekend. Look, we're also mindful of going to win the test in front of you, but also you look long term… we've got we've got depth. And in our squad we've got guys in a you might impacts that come off the bench."</p>
        
            <p>While the loss is a serious setback to the All Blacks' hopes of retaining The Rugby Championship, Robertson saw a great deal of positives in a test match that was fought with an often-ferocious intensity between rugby's greatest rivals.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, probably the biggest test and the hardest place to win a test in rugby, which is Jo'burg. And you know there's so much good (in the performance). And then there's a couple of moments that didn't quite go our way. A couple of swing moments and that's footy. That's test footy."</p>
