        <h2>A year on, Albany axe attack witnesses start to put incident behind them</h2>
        <p>
"Every worker here has experienced some degree of psychological trauma."
</p>
        
            <p>A few months after a man injured six people with an axe in a frenzied attack on diners at three Chinese restaurants in Albany, customers began to return to outlets in the area but avoided sitting close to the door.</p>
        
            <p>One year on from the attack on the evening of 19 June 2023, business owners and workers at the scene say the community has started to move on.</p>
        
            <p>China-born Fanrong Meng, 25, was arrested after entering Zhangliang Malatang and attacking his final victim.</p>
        
            <p>He had earlier injured three diners at Maya Hotpot in Albany's Corinthian Drive and another two at nearby Yue's Dumpling Kitchen after entering the establishments wielding a pole and long splitting axe.</p>
        
            <p>In November, Auckland District Court Judge Stephen Bonnar KC acquitted Meng on all charges on the grounds of insanity.</p>
        
            <p>In April, the court ruled that he should be detained as a special patient in a secure psychiatric facility under the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 due to concerns over public safety.</p>
        
            <p>Meng, who had arrived in New Zealand in March 2023 on a three-year work visa, is believed to suffer from schizophrenia.</p>
        
            <p>He reportedly stopped taking anti-psychotic medication before immigrating to New Zealand, citing the financial cost.</p>

            <p>Witnesses to the attack hope the area never experiences such violence again.</p>
        
            <p>Steven Jin, owner of Zhangliang Malatang, said the incident had affected his business and his employees' well-being.</p>
        
            <p>"Businesses in our block, including those across the street, likely saw a 50 percent drop in revenue after the incident," Jin said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some employees took annual leave. Every worker here has experienced some degree of psychological trauma."</p>
        
            <p>He said customers began to return gradually three or four months after the attack, but some preferred to sit some distance from the door.</p>
        
            <p>In more recent times, Jin said the fear had subsided and many felt it was an isolated incident that wouldn't happen again.</p>

            <p>Guangqin Yin, owner of Chongqing88 Noodles and 2AM BBQ in the same block of restaurants, said his business had also been significantly impacted by the attack.</p>
        
            <p>"No customers came on the second or third day after the incident. They started to return slowly after three to five days," Yin said. "I hope similar incidents will not happen again. We all look forward to a stable and peaceful environment."</p>
        
            <p>Yin said he remained confident in the area's overall safety.</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident in the security of Albany Cuisine Centre," he said. "After the attack, public security measures were strengthened, and many surveillance cameras were installed.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a year, and I feel the impact of the incident has passed. People's vigilance has gone, and life has returned to normal."</p>
        
            <p>"Long" Chen, who spoke on condition of not using his full name, found himself face to face with the assailant on the night of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>The chef at Double Happy restaurant felt lucky to escape injury in the attack, saying the anxiety he experienced after the incident took about two months to ease.</p>
        
            <p>"I was taking out the garbage after finishing my shift at the restaurant that day [on 19 June 2023] and saw a man carrying an axe," he said. "Startled, I ran away as he approached me."</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't tell my family [about the attack], but they found out later. ... They were a little shocked," he said. "It felt like security in New Zealand was really bad at that time."</p>

            <p>Given Meng's documented history of mental health issues, people in Albany expressed concern about his eligibility to enter New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Jin questioned how Meng had obtained a work visa despite being diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p>
        
            <p>"If a person has mental issues and has been taking medication, why was it not discovered during his health examination or during his visa application?" he asked. "Why did Immigration New Zealand issue him a work visa?"</p>
        
            <p>Stephanie Greathead, national manager of immigration compliance at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, which includes Immigration New Zealand, said Meng did not declare his health status in the application process.</p>
        
            <p>"We are unable to comment on the state of Meng's health but can confirm that he did not declare any mental health issues on his application form," Greathead said.</p>
        
            <p>Greathead said anyone applying for a visa was required to make a truthful declaration about their health status to Immigration New Zealand, while most people intending to stay for longer than a year must undergo a medical examination and provide detailed health and medical histories.</p>
        
            <p>"Where applicants are required to have a medical examination, they are required to be upfront about their medical history and to provide relevant medical records," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"INZ's medical assessors will then review the information provided to determine whether the applicant has an acceptable standard of health for their intended length of stay and purpose for being in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Greathead said Meng was being detained at Mason Clinic, and his classification as a special patient meant he could not currently be deported.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we are working with the medical team at the Mason Clinic to clarify what this means in terms of future prospects for his deportation," she said. "At this stage, we do not know what that timeframe may be."</p>
