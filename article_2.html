            <p>The dual leader model at the Human Rights Commission honours Te Tiriti o Waitangi and is what the public wants, the commission's chief executive says.</p>
        
            <p>The commission has just introduced a co-chief executive position, appointing Julia Amua Whaipooti to the role on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Whaipooti is an expert on the Treaty and the rights of Māori and will start in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>The commission says no new funding was needed to establish the role.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith thinks having dual leaders in the public sector is not appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>Human Rights Commission chief executive Meg de Ronde told Morning Report the commission is a Treaty based organisation and requires partnership between Māori and Pākehā.</p>
        
            <p>"This is part of a commitment to a Te Tiriti based organisation which is really crucial if you're working in human rights in Aotearoa because Te Tiriti o Waitangi is our founding human rights document so it's what gives us rights and duties to each other and it's really important in terms of our legislation as well."</p>
        
            <p>The decision was not taken lightly, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But what's been missing from some of the political rhetoric flying around is we've actually disestablished a deputy role so I won't have a deputy, I'll have a shared leader to work alongside and we're really excited to bring this new model to fruition," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're hearing from New Zealanders, and we've recently done some polling on this, what's not sustainable is divisive rhetoric around race and New Zealanders are really calling for a reasoned and respectable approach, they're calling for Māori and Pākehā to work together.</p>
        
            <p>"So what we're trying to do with this model is to walk that talk."</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party said Whaipooti's appointment was "just the latest example of a taxpayer-funded bureaucracy serving itself at the expense of delivery for New Zealanders".</p>

            <p>The new government wants to change the inner-workings of the Human Rights Commission.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has said he disagrees with the organisation's staffing allocations and is also refusing to express confidence in the agency's Chief Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt.</p>
        
            <p>ACT is reigniting calls for the commission to be abolished entirely.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said he was not planning to do that but said the government was planning on making changes across the commission.</p>
        
            <p>The Human Rights Commission is Crown funded but independent and governed by the Paris Principles, de Ronde said.</p>
        
            <p>Monday will be the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
