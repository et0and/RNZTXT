            <p>Watch live: New Zealand company Rocket Lab is aiming to launch a small Earth-imaging satellite for a Japanese company from Māhia this evening.</p>
        
            <p>The take-off is due to happen some time around 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>Watch it live here:</p>
        
            <p>It held a dress rehearsal for the launch last week - the company's first mission since a rocket failed in September shortly after take-off.</p>
        
            <p>The mission will be Rocket Lab's 10th launch of the year, beating the previous annual launch record of nine.</p>
        
            <p>The mission's name 'The Moon God Awakens' is in honour of a Japanese god.</p>
        
            <p>The satellite will join another one already in orbit. Both belong to Japanese firm iQPS which is aiming to have a 36-satellite constellation capable of monitoring Earth at specific fixed points every 10 minutes.</p>
