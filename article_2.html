            <p>A survivor of Christchurch's infamous Mama Hooch sexual assault case believes it is likely there are more women who are yet to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating three fresh complaints in connection to "historical incidents" at the notorious central Christchurch bar Mama Hooch.</p>
        
            <p>Brothers Danny and Roberto Jaz were sentenced last August to lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of nearly 70 crimes, including rape, sexual violation and stupefying.</p>
        
            <p>Roberto was given 17 years in prison, with a minimum non-parole period of 8.5 years.</p>
        
            <p>Older brother Danny was given 16.5 years, with no parole available until at least eight years had been served.</p>
        
            <p>If followed a nine-week judge-alone trial earlier this year, where it emerged the Jaz brothers had targeted 32 people, mainly young women aged between 18 and 24.</p>
        
            <p>The pair used their positions at family businesses, including Mama Hooch and neighbouring Colombo Street restaurant Venuiti, to commit the slew of acts.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Brown, who waived her name suppression, admitted she was not surprised new allegations had surfaced.</p>
        
            <p>"Statistically, one in three or four sexual assault cases actually get reported to police," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So the chances were incredibly high that there were other women that were impacted by these men that weren't captured in the trial.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awesome to see other women coming forward, whether it was seeing the trial, or something that [has] compelled them to do it, it's amazing they've felt that they're able to."</p>
        
            <p>Brown recounted to the court last year "picking up the fragments of her life" after she was drugged and sexually violated in 2017</p>
        
            <p>Waiving her rights to name suppression, she was one of several survivors who delivered powerful impact statements as the Jaz brothers learned their fate.</p>
        
            <p>Although conceding it would be speculation, she said there could be more survivors out there who had been impacted.</p>
        
            <p>"Reporting isn't everyone's journey of healing, and some women won't and that's okay.</p>
        
            <p>"But I would definitely say there could be more."</p>
        
            <p>She added she felt proud that others had "found their voice" to the point where they felt they could report their experiences to police.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone else is suffering with this, and tossing up with the idea of reporting or not reporting, just understand it's absolutely your personal decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope these women are looking after themselves and doing what's right for them."</p>
        
            <p>Victims advocate Ruth Money also said further complaints materialising was "sadly not surprising".</p>
        
            <p>"It's very rare that we will see this level of offending just being that first group of survivors who came forward," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Money acknowledged all "the brave ladies" who had taken the brothers through the justice system and the new complainants coming forward.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually a catch-22 situation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any survivor is triggered by the coverage of something that is similar to what they have experienced.</p>
        
            <p>"The trial itself was triggering for a number of people, particularly those who were the survivors who had disclosed at the time, but also these new ones who hadn't disclosed yet.</p>
        
            <p>"But what it says is that 'you're not alone'."</p>
        
            <p>Money said she took solace in the fact the new survivors had been brave enough to endure the justice process for something that had already been through the courts.</p>
        
            <p>Both venues have since closed, and the company, Jaz Holdings Limited, was put into liquidation in early August.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said since the Operation Sinatra trial last year, they had received three complaints relating to historic incidents at Mama Hooch.</p>
        
            <p>"Police won't comment on the specifics of the complaints but they are continuing to investigate."</p>
        
            <p>Both brothers were appealing their convictions, but it was unclear what grounds the pair had.</p>
