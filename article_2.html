            <p>Two people have been arrested after a police chase across Auckland involving two stolen cars - one of which caught fire.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called about a car being stolen in the North Shore suburb of Hauraki about 5.20am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>They said the police helicopter found the car, but it drove away from officers who signalled it to stop.</p>
        
            <p>Even after being caught in police spikes, it continued to drive through the city and onto the Southern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Rod Carpinter said the car was dumped in Botany, and the pair inside stole another one.</p>
        
            <p>He said that car was spiked in ÅŒtara and caught fire.</p>
        
            <p>The pair then surrendered to police.</p>
        
            <p>"Police inquiries are continuing," Carpinter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are aware of the hazards these types of events can cause and we thank the public for their cooperation this morning in allowing police to bring this incident to a close safely."</p>
