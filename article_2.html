            <p>The former government replaced the Defence Force's Orion and Hercules because they were in worst state than the 757s, Labour leader Chris Hipkins says.</p>
        
            <p>The condition of the two Boeing 757s is back in the spotlight after Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had to take a last minute commercial flight to Australia on Tuesday because of a maintenance fault on one of the aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins has indicated that replacing the planes is too expensive.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins told Morning Report the previous government replaced the Defence Force's surveillance aircraft and helicopters.</p>

            <p>"We had a prioritised list and the Orions and the Hercules were actually in worse condition so that's where we directed the additional investment we made in the Airforce."</p>
        
            <p>At the time the 757s were the youngest aircraft in the fleet, but they now needed replacing too, Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged under-investment in Defence Force infrastructure for three or four decades.</p>
        
            <p>"Those 757s they were second hand planes when they were purchased and they're old planes and so they do need to be upgraded or replaced."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the Defence Force did need some capacity to carry passengers.</p>
        
            <p>The former Defence Minister Ron Mark told First Up the Boeing 757s should have been replaced years ago.</p>

            <p>"There's a long line of former prime ministers who would agree [it's embarrassing] but part of the reason we have the problem is there's a long line of former prime ministers who refused to deal with it."</p>
        
            <p>Mark said the aircraft were part of the Defence Force's strategic lift capability and not only flew politicians and official delegations but also deployed troops and supplies and aided research in Antarctica.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Force personnel had done a great job keeping them flying, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand Airforce personnel are renowned internationally for their skill.</p>
        
            <p>"Most countries look at our aircraft, scratch their head, and think 'crikey, how do these Kiwis do it'."</p>
        
            <p>The 757s needed to fly regularly and the question was when New Zealand would replace them with something more appropriate, Mark said.</p>
        
            <p>That could include buying or leasing, and should consider whether VIP transport could be separate from the military needs, he said.</p>
