        <h2>'Miles different': Water park owner feels 'victimised' by iPhone weather app</h2>
        <p>
Emily Rutherford says the app keeps reporting the temperature in her part of Central Otago is up to 5C cooler than MetService predicts - and even that is underestimating the summer heat.

            <p>Emily Rutherford says she feels "personally victimised" by iPhone's weather app.</p>
        
            <p>Rutherford, who co-owns the Kiwi Water Park in Lake Dunstan, Central Otago, said the app kept reporting the temperature in her area was up to 5C cooler than MetService predicted - and even MetService could be under-estimating the summer heat.</p>
        
            <p>She worried it was putting off potential customers.</p>
        
            <p>"It keeps saying the weather is awful in my location and it means people think it's awful… they aren't coming along on the days that it says it's awful.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment it says it's 18C and raining - but at the moment it's 25, warm, a little bit cloudy but still sunny and warm. The weather keeps being miles different to what it is."</p>
        
            <p>WeatherWatch head forecaster Philip Duncan said it was a known issue. International firm The Weather Company provided data to Apple, Samsung and Google, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They get weather data from satellites, from weather observations - they've got thousands of them in New Zealand - aircraft and cellphones themselves."</p>
        
            <p>But he said unlike other countries, where more local data was available to be overlaid to provide a more detailed picture, in New Zealand the structure of Niwa and MetService data made that harder.</p>
        
            <p>"In Sydney you get 'there's a downpour coming in one minute' and it nails it. In New Zealand, the Government has chosen to let Niwa and MetService be the gatekeepers of that.</p>
        
            <p>"The Government doesn't understand what New Zealand is missing out on by letting NIWA and MetService have commercial privilege to public data. Most people don't log on to the MetService - if you're an 18-year-old going to the beach, you grab your phone."</p>
        
            <p>NIWA meteorologist Tristan Meyers said he was not convinced that was the reason.</p>
        
            <p>"Australia is commercialised too - it's a cost-recovery. It costs a lot to put weather stations everywhere and catalogue data. They all have different ways of accessing that data and getting that data."</p>
        
            <p>The data was just one part of a forecast, Meyers said. The other part was the prediction model being used.</p>
        
            <p>"The weather model Apple uses might not be as good for that location... some models don't perform that well in some areas. Others perform better in other areas.</p>
        
            <p>"For instance, the Met Office, the Bureau of Meteorology and NIWA, we all run local, high-resolution weather models. The apps - NIWA weather or even MetService - they're underpinned by those more local high-resolution tailored forecasts.</p>
        
            <p>"Apple wouldn't be using those. If she was using a different app like NIWA's or MetService's it might be more accurate in some ways and less in others.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nothing to do with commercialising data... New Zealand is definitely not the only place where you have to pay some cost-recovery to access it."</p>
        
            <p>Duty Minister Nicola Grigg said it was not something she could comment on.</p>
        
            <p>Apple also did not want to comment.</p>
        
            <p>In September, Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins announced a merger of weather forecasters, with NIWA taking over MetService. However, MetService would remain New Zealand's authorised meteorologist, responsible for providing warnings and advice on severe weather.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached MetService for comment.</p>
