            <p>Woolworths says there has been a 131 percent rise in physical assaults against its staff in the last six months, compared to the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>The supermarket chain, formerly known as Countdown, is launching a campaign calling for respect in the lead up to the holiday period.</p>
        
            <p>It's also spending tens of millions of dollars on safety measures such as walkie-talkies, fog cannons and body cameras.</p>
        
            <p>Head of health, safety and wellbeing Denva Wren said in the last week alone staff have been spat at, called names and shoved. She has told customers to stop it.</p>
        
            <p>"Actually [customers] considering their body language, their tone and how they approach a situation - whether that's a gap on a shelf, product quality or a genuine query. Just actually thinking and considering how you might do that when you follow up with one of our team".</p>
        
            <p>As for the additional safety initiatives, Wren said she was sad things have got so bad, $45 million has to be spent to ensure stores are safer for staff and customers.</p>
        
            <p>She said the initiatives also included double entry gates at storefronts, new cameras at checkouts and trolley-locking systems.</p>
        
            <p>Fog cannons will be trialled in some stores.</p>
        
            <p>"Fog cannons are being implemented in stores that have had multiple break-and-enters. We're obviously seeing break-and-enters feature in the media over an extended period of time, probably since the beginning of the year."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths stores will give out one gift card a day this week to a customer who shows kindness.</p>
