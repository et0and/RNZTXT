            <p>Household lending activity is starting to rise again, but new borrowers are likely to continue to face higher mortgage rates for longer.</p>
        
            <p>Reserve Bank data shows gross new lending flows between August and October were 4 percent higher than a year ago, after a subdued 12 to 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>Property research firm CoreLogic, which analysed the data, said the total value of lending ($16.8 billion) was still well below levels seen in 2020 and 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Chief property economist Kmormorelvin Davidson said new borrowers would need to be prepared for high interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably fair to assume mortgage rates might not go up very much further, but also, we are in a higher for longer environment. Even if we see wholesale rates come down a bit, it might not necessarily be very big," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said with the Reserve Bank talking tough on inflation, he expected mortgage rates next year to be similar to current levels.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the lack of low-deposit home loans ensured borrowers had not fallen behind as they faced higher interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Recent data from Centrix showed mortgage arrears remained low in October, despite arrears climbing from 1.25 percent of mortgage holders to nearly 1.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Loan-to-value ratio rules continued to bite hard, with just 0.3 percent of investors receiving a loan in October with less than a 35 percent deposit, CoreLogic said.</p>
        
            <p>When it came to owner-occupiers, only about 7 percent borrowed with less than 20 percent deposit.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic said mortgagee sales remained low as borrowers continued to meet higher financing costs, despite interest rates climbing.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the loan-to-value ratio rules were helping.</p>
        
            <p>"It's 10 years now in New Zealand that we've had loan-to-value ratio rules in some shape or form. So I think the macroprudential rules, as they call them, have given the housing market a degree of insulation."</p>
        
            <p>The most recent CoreLogic data showed there were 41 mortgagee sales in the third quarter.</p>
        
            <p>During the global financial crisis, mortgagee sales peaked at about 700 to 800 in a quarter.</p>
