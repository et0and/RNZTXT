            <p>An ambulance worker says stab-proof vests, which are meant to be available to staff responding to mental health callouts, are not available at all stations.</p>
        
            <p>Police are set to pull back from attending mental health callouts from November, meaning ambulance workers will not have their support.</p>
        
            <p>The Ambulance Association is warning someone could be killed if stab-proof vests are not made more available.</p>
        
            <p>The ambulance worker, who cannot be identified because their contract prevents them speaking to media, works at a rural station in Tākaka.</p>
        
            <p>He said his station had training on how to use stab-proof vests about three weeks ago,</p>
        
            <p>He said the vests were brought over from Nelson, then taken back at the end of the training.</p>
        
            <p>"What this means in essence is that if we're in a situation where we need stab-proof vests, we've got to wait two hours for someone from Nelson to bring them over to Golden Bay, which kind of defeats the purpose - and I'm sure this is typical of all the rural stations."</p>
        
            <p>He said rural stations like his already responded to mental health callouts without police, due to resourcing.</p>
        
            <p>Ambulance Association secretary Mark Quinn told Morning Report that it was a huge concern that ambulance staff did not have the same physical protections as police did - and that stab-proof vests were sometimes hours away.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff need to have access to these vests."</p>
        
            <p>St John general manager ambulance operations - integrated operations centre Doug Gallagher told Midday Report there were around 600 vests currently for more than 2000 staff, that were handed out when they heard a weapon was involved.</p>
        
            <p>"While we aspire to make stab-proof vests more readily available, particularly in rural areas, we believe that wearing these vests should be viewed as a last line of defence for our staff."</p>
        
            <p>He said St John did not want staff to be in the unsafe situation in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"But we do have [the vests] there so that they can be used once police are on scene."</p>
        
            <p>First Union national ambulance coordinator Faye McCann said ambulance workers should not be put in situations where they needed a stab-proof vest.</p>
        
            <p>"If there's an indication that someone should be wearing a stab proof vest, then that's a big enough indication to say that 'this isn't for you to go, and you need to wait for police'."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said he was aware ambulance staff, along with other first responders, were experiencing more violence and abuse than ever before.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report he understood paramedics, ambulance drivers and firefighters were all now experiencing the sorts of abuse that would normally just be directed at police.</p>
        
            <p>But he said it was not for him to comment on whether stab-proof vests should or could be issued to all ambulance workers.</p>
