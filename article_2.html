            <p>The daughter of a former All Black has been charged in relation to an alleged hit-and-run death in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Helena Cribb, the 22-year-old daughter of Ron Cribb, was charged earlier this year, following the death of Jason Collins.</p>
        
            <p>Collins, 65, was found dead by a member of the public on O'Brien Road in North Shore's Lucas Heights, in the early hours of 7 December.</p>

            <p>Cribb's lawyer, Adam Holland, confirmed her name suppression had now lapsed.</p>
        
            <p>She is facing a charge of operating a vehicle carelessly, causing a death while under the influence of a drink or drug.</p>
        
            <p>A statement released earlier this year by Collins' family said his death had left an "unfillable void in their hearts".</p>
        
            <p>"As a devoted father, husband, and trusted friend to many in our community, his absence is a constant ache, a relentless reminder of what we've lost.</p>
        
            <p>"Taken from us too soon, his departure is a profound and senseless blow that we struggle to comprehend."</p>
        
            <p>Cribb will next appear in the North Shore District Court in September.</p>
