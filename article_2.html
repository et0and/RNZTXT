        <p>
Major dairy companies from around the world have pledged to disclose and tackle methane emissions - but not Fonterra.

            <p>Major dairy companies from around the world have pledged to disclose and tackle methane emissions - but Fonterra is noticeably absent.</p>
        
            <p>Big names in the industry like Bel Group, Danone, Lactalis US and Nestle committed at COP28 this week to publicly disclosing their dairy-related methane emissions and drawing up detailed plans of action.</p>
        
            <p>The commitment is in partnership with global nonprofit, Environmental Defence Fund (EDF).</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra director of sustainability Charlotte Rutherford said they had talked with the EDF and continue to engage with them, but the timing was not quite right for the dairy co-op.</p>
        
            <p>"Our recent focus has been on announcing our on-farm emissions target and working with farmers to help them understand this.</p>
        
            <p>"We decided that the timing just wasn't quite right as it may cause confusion - this doesn't mean that we're not committed to reducing methane, which is why our work through AgriZeroNZ to find a solution to methane is so important."</p>
        
            <p>Dairy Farmers of America and Danish dairy giant Arla also did not sign the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>But Nestle - Fonterra's biggest customer - did, so what implications are there for Fonterra?</p>
        
            <p>Rutherford said Fonterra looked forward to partnering with Nestle to achieve its ambitions.</p>
        
            <p>"They are complementary to ours, we report on our methane emissions as part of our on-farm emissions life cycle assessment annually and our recently released climate roadmap and emissions reduction targets also support our customers like Nestle with transparency for their own reporting."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, New Zealand was awarded the first "fossil of the day" award of COP28 - a mark of dishonour in recognition of the new government's decision to reverse the ban on offshore oil and gas exploration.</p>
