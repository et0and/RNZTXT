            <p>A second person has died from their injuries after a stolen ute crashed in the Kāpiti Coast District last week, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The truck was driving the wrong way up State Highway 1 on Friday last week, when it was involved in a fatal head-on collision.</p>
        
            <p>Acting central district commander Inspector Clifford Brown said the stolen ute, wanted in connection to a robbery in Ōtaki on Friday evening, was signalled to stop just south of Levin shortly after 10.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police pursued the ute but abandoned the chase "within several minutes" due to the manner of driving.</p>
        
            <p>The ute continued heading south "at speed" on State Highway 1, and about 10.50pm was spotted turning back onto the highway from Waikanae, heading north in the southbound lane.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen minutes later, the ute collided head-on with another vehicle, just south of Lawlors Road.</p>
        
            <p>The ute's driver was pronounced dead at the scene, whom police have named as 16-year-old Reihana Horohau Hawea from Levin.</p>
        
            <p>The passenger, who was taken to Wellington Hospital in a critical condition, died yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A third passenger in the ute remains in hospital in serious condition, and two of the four people who were in the car that was hit also remain in Wellington Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The incident remained under investigation.</p>
