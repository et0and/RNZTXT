            <p>Police investigating a shooting on Auckland's Ponsonby road last month have found two pistols in Taupō, possibly linked to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Hone Kay-Selwyn was found dead near Taupō three days after fatally shooting 33-year-old Robert Sidney Horne.</p>
        
            <p>A firearm was not found with Kay-Selwyn, a member of the Killer Beez gang, and no shell casings were recovered at the scene of the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Chris Barry said on Sunday police were undertaking forensic testing of the two pistols to establish a link to the Ponsonby shooting.</p>
        
            <p>They are continuing to work out how Hone Kay-Selwyn obtained the firearm, he added.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported the pistols were cut-down Alfa carbine rifles, popular with criminals because they do not leave behind shell casings, which can be used as evidence.</p>
