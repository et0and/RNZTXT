            <p>Police are investigating fresh complaints in connection to "historical incidents" at the notorious central Christchurch bar Mama Hooch.</p>
        
            <p>Brothers Danny and Roberto Jaz were sentenced last August to lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of nearly 70 crimes, including rape, sexual violation and stupefying.</p>
        
            <p>The pair used their positions at family businesses, including Mama Hooch and neighbouring Colombo Street restaurant Venuiti, to commit the slew of acts.</p>
        
            <p>Both venues have since closed, and the company Jaz Holdings Limited was put into liquidation in early August.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said since the Operation Sinatra trial last year, they had received three complaints relating to historical incidents at Mama Hooch.</p>
        
            <p>"Police won't comment on the specifics of the complaints but they are continuing to investigate."</p>
        
            <p>Both brothers have appealed their convictions.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
