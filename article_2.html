            <p>A Hastings resident baffled by the approval of the region's new Gateway signs has whipped up a storm on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Yvonne Lorkin said while the region boasts an impressive tapestry of natural beauty, the new branding has been presented in the colour of "old porridge with a hideously old-fashioned font."</p>
        
            <p>"My whole life I have been fiercely proud of my place, my turangawaewae, this profoundly wonderful region. Now every time I drive past one of these signs my toes curl in embarrassment that that's the image our authorities chose to represent us.</p>
        
            <p>"How and why was this approved? I'm baffled," Lorkin said.</p>
        
            <p>Lorkin's post on social media about the signs which she headed "worst regional branding yet" drew some scathing comments including "Good Lord that's atrocious", "Huge fail H for Horrendous. I'm guessing it cost $10 or so" and "Well worth the rates increase said no one ever."</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said everyone is entitled to an opinion.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be impossible to achieve a single design that resonates with everyone. We have also had positive feedback about the unique signs and the fresh, bold feel they bring to the district."</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council group manager marketing, communications and engagement Naomi Fergusson said the gateway signs had been replaced with a new design that was within part of the new Heretaunga Hastings brand that began to be rolled out last year.</p>
        
            <p>"The gateway sign replacement was originally planned as a staged approach for aged or worn signs, however as some of them were damaged during Cyclone Gabrielle, these installations were bought forward," Fergusson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Gateway signs are placed on boundaries of regions, cities and towns all around New Zealand and their primary purpose is to make people aware they are entering a destination (in our case Heretaunga Hastings), and welcome them accordingly (within approx. three to five seconds as people drive past)."</p>
        
            <p>She said the 'H' was an asset designed as part of the overall Heretaunga Hastings rebrand project.</p>
        
            <p>"We chose to use this asset as the basis for our gateway signs. The creative agency that designed it was a Wellington-based agency called Strategy & Creative who won the project via a tender process (no Hawke's Bay agencies submitted a tender)."</p>
        
            <p>Printing of the eight gateway signs was budgeted at $41,446, and additional reinforcement of the steel supports as per engineering requirements and installation cost $33,923, bringing the total cost to $75,639 which was covered off by existing operational budgets (2023/24).</p>
        
            <p>Late last year a rebrand of Hastings and Hastings District Council cost around $70,000.</p>
