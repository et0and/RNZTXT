        <h2>All Blacks to wear white for Sunday morning’s test</h2>
        <p>
The All Blacks will be in their change jerseys for the clash against the dark blue-clad French, for a challenge the French coach is calling "immense".

            <p>The All Blacks will once again be forced into their alternate white jerseys for Sunday's test against France in Paris. This is despite a long-standing test rugby tradition that the home side wears their alternates in the event of a kit clash, something that France adheres to annually in the Six Nations when they play Scotland and Italy.</p>
        
            <p>However, this is not the first time this has happened, with the All Blacks wearing white when the two sides met in Paris three years ago. The 40-25 defeat was the first time the All Blacks had lost in a white jersey since 1930.</p>
        
            <p>The other most notable failure in an alternate strip was in 2007, when France beat the All Blacks 20-18 in their World Cup quarter-final. The All Blacks wore a now infamous grey jersey for that game.</p>

            <p>The current French jerseys are dark blue and are manufactured by adidas, the same apparel sponsor as the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, French coach Fabien Galthié has said that he rates the All Blacks alongside the Springboks right now in the world rugby hierarchy. The French side was hit with drama this week as first five Matthieu Jalibert withdrew from the squad after being informed he would not start this test match.</p>
        
            <p>"The competition in this team is important, our project is a collective one," Galthié told media in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>"Building a team, what's important for us is the determination…everyone has the right to have their emotions, to share them. We need players with strong determination. Until now, even if his path in the team hasn't always been straightforward, he's always tried to give the French national team his talent and has always tried his best, and he always will do if he wishes, of course. Everyone is allowed to make their choice."</p>
        
            <p>There is no recognised back up for starting 10 Thomas Ramos on the French bench, as Galthié has opted for a six-forward, two-back bench split.</p>

            <p>Galthié noted that the task facing the French will be "immense but at the same time fantastic" against an All Black team that has already played 12 tests this year.</p>
        
            <p>"The All Blacks right now are in their sixth month of competition, they came off the plan they beat England at Twickenham. They then beat Ireland with a 10-point advantage, which hasn't happened in a long time at their place, the Irish who beat South Africa this summer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a team, knowing their people, are in the process of putting things back in order. They want to return to being the best in the world, the structure of the schedule helps too. An English tour down there, the Rugby Championship, it allows them to have a team that works."</p>
        
            <p>France won the last meeting between the two sides 27-13 in last year's World Cup opener at Stade de France, a record winning margin. However, Galthié has seen change in new coach Scott Robertson's All Black side this year.</p>
        
            <p>"They're capable of responding of every type of rugby. They're very good at set-piece, the battle up-front, at the breakdown, in the air. They still have the same speed in their backs and their back-row movement. It's been a while since we've played this standard of All Blacks."</p>
