        <p>
She said she supported the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects the right to gun ownership.

            <p>Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday issued a warning to any potential home intruder: "If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot."</p>
        
            <p>The Democratic presidential candidate and gun owner made the seemingly unguarded comment in an interview with Oprah Winfrey before a live studio audience when the conversation turned to gun laws.</p>
        
            <p>"I probably should not have said that. But my staff will deal with that later," Harris said, laughing.</p>
        
            <p>Harris, who has robust protection from the US Secret Service, made the statement amid heightened concern about political violence after a second potential assassination attempt against her opponent in the 5 November presidential election, Republican Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Trump favors few restrictions on arms and ammunition while Harris supports a ban on assault weapons, stricter background checks for gun buyers, and "red flag" laws that can temporarily take guns away from those deemed dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>Harris told Winfrey she supported the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects the right to gun ownership.</p>
        
            <p>Harris mentioned her gun ownership in 2019 when she was a US senator and again in last week's debate with Trump in what seemed like an appeal to more conservative voters.</p>
        
            <p>Harris owns a handgun for personal safety reasons, and it is stowed away in a secure location at her California home, a White House source told Reuters earlier. The source declined to identify the make of gun, but said it is the same gun Harris mentioned in 2019 on the campaign trail.</p>
        
            <p>Harris, the former district attorney of San Francisco and California attorney general, told reporters in 2019: "I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do - for personal safety. I was a career prosecutor."</p>
        
            <p>One-third of Americans own a gun and about two-thirds of Americans support stricter gun laws overall, with nearly 90% supporting policies that would prevent mentally ill people from getting guns, Pew Research shows.</p>
