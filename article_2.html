            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has told Kim Dotcom, the former Mega Upload owner, that New Zealand will deport him to the US.</p>
        
            <p>Dotcom, a rich lister who the US Government alleges made his fortune from digital piracy, moved to New Zealand in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>As chief executive of Megaupload, a file sharing website which was often used to share pirated movies and music, Dotcom was charged by American authorities on a range of indictments in the early 2010s.</p>
        
            <p>But Dotcom moved to New Zealand, and spent years fighting extradition.</p>
        
            <p>His fight to stay out of the US, and out of its court system, saw him become a colourful figure in New Zealand's political history.</p>
        
            <p>In 2012, New Zealand police raided Dotcom's Auckland mansion - using helicopters and more than 70 officers to arrest him and others connected to Mega Upload.</p>
        
            <p>But the US attempt to have him extradited failed.</p>
        
            <p>Dotcom went on to launch his own political career, founding the Internet Party. He recruited Laila Harré to lead the party, and then joined forces with former Māori Party MP Hone Harawira to form the Internet Mana Party.</p>
        
            <p>Their 2014 election campaign failed, however, and Harawira never returned to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>A decade later, Dotcom remains in New Zealand. But his time in Aotearoa may be coming to an end.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith confirmed to Stuff on Thursday that he had signed a warrant for Dotcom's deportation.</p>
        
            <p>"I have received extensive advice from the Ministry of Justice on this matter," Goldsmith said.</p>
        
            <p>"I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial."</p>
        
            <p>But Dotcom can appeal this decision, and in a statement he said he would.</p>
        
            <p>In a post to social media, Dotcom said Goldsmith's decision showed New Zealand was an "obedient US colony in the South Pacific".</p>
        
            <p>He said he had no control of what Mega Upload's users decided to upload.</p>
        
            <p>Dotcom has started a family in New Zealand. He lives with his youngest child, and his second wife Elizabeth, in Queenstown.</p>
