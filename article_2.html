            <p>Netball coaches are calling for greater policing of foul play during the ANZ Premiership.</p>
        
            <p>In the lead-up to the start of the ANZ Premiership, RNZ surveyed the head coaches of all six franchises on a range of issues, from two-point shots to import rules and video technology.</p>
        
            <p>While most of the coaches are lukewarm on the introduction of video technology to assist umpires with play-by-play calls, they can see the benefit of video replays for post-match sanctions and to assess heavy hits which lead to concussions.</p>
        
            <p>A shake-up of the import rule is favoured, but not everyone thinks more is better.</p>
        
            <p>The eighth edition of the ANZ Premiership starts on the 13 April when the Magic host the Mystics in Hamilton. The regular season will come to a close on 22 July, when the focus shifts to an elimination final leading into the grand final.</p>

            <p>"I'm a supporter of the two-point shot - it makes the game interesting, and it allows us to play a different game style if that's introduced. I'm a supporter of game innovation and how we play the game, and I think it would give us different opportunities to play a different style of netball compared to just playing with the one shot."</p>
        
            <p>Stars coach Kiri Wills</p>
        
            <p>"Yes - we need to add something to our competition to create more interest for our loyal followers. We are a small competition with a small player pool, so anything we can do to change things up should be seriously considered by Netball New Zealand administrators."</p>
        
            <p>Magic coach Mary-Jane Araroa </p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely, support the introduction of the two-point shot. This will provide an ability to grow our shooters across the country, whereby they are able to shoot from range."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse coach Anna Andrews-Tasola</p>
        
            <p>"No."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, I would like to see the two-point shot introduced. We really enjoyed it at Otāki during pre-season. It changes up the game and brings another entertainment factor for the crowd. When a game has a tall shooter in it, it becomes a bit one-dimensional, but with the two-point shot you need all of your shooters able to put up those long shots.</p>
        
            <p>"I can see from an entertainment perspective that it really brings the crowd into the game."</p>
        
            <p>Steel coach Reinga Bloxham</p>
        
            <p>"For me, I would need to understand the 'why' behind it. What are we trying to achieve by doing this? I can see that some people may think it is more entertaining, it could also promote long-range shooters, but I think accuracy is more important no matter where they shoot it from."</p>

            <p>"I think the import rule in New Zealand is tricky, and the tricky part is around the contracting. In New Zealand we can't contract on the highest tier for imports, so it's a difficult situation if we're competing with the Super Netball in terms of what we can offer the best imports that we might look at across the world.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's a challenge that we face just with the way imports are contracted into New Zealand. So for me, I would start there rather than with the number, to consider how that might impact the strength of the competition and the quality of the imports that we are able to get in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Stars coach Kiri Wills</p>
        
            <p>"Yes - more imports equals added interest in the competition. It also adds pressure for spots in teams which means greater accountability from the player pool to be the best that they can be.</p>
        
            <p>"I also think that imports should be able to contest for Tier 1 and Tier 2 retainers - currently this is capped at Tier 3. Ideally we should look to two imports, which would mean our pathway is still somewhat protected, but thought must be put into how the positions are managed - ie. I would suggest you cannot get two imports in the same area of court. This would avoid some areas of court, traditionally the shooting end, being blocked by imports and also mean that a New Zealand player is partnered with a talented international to help build their game."</p>
        
            <p>Magic coach Mary-Jane Araroa </p>
        
            <p>"No, would only support one import as our focus is on developing Zone/NZ players."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse coach Anna Andrews-Tasola</p>
        
            <p>"No."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure it's a question about how many imports we should allow, it's more about the quality of imports we are attracting and that's due to the tier of contract teams can offer. I would say no more than two imports, but maybe it's more to do with the level of players from overseas coming into our game."</p>
        
            <p>Steel coach Reinga Bloxham</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to see there be a change for players who are Pacifika and considered to be imports. If they have gone through our pathways here in New Zealand then choose to play for their country at a pinnacle event, I would like us to consider allowing them into ANZP teams, and maybe there could be a limit on one per team."</p>

Video technology is used in some sports but not yet in netball.

            <p>"That's an interesting question. Netball is so fast, but I think there is an opportunity for a third umpire with a video for things like if it's a tight situation and there's an offside or a ball goes out, and the umpire's made an error in who gets the ball next, would be a useful use of that type of technology courtside.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be difficult to check everything, as is the way in other sports such as rugby or rugby league, because of the time delay that's taken to reset play. And netball, through the rules and the way we play the game... there is a pace that it is played at that I think video technology could interrupt if we used it the same as other sports do.</p>
        
            <p>"There is definitely an opportunity for a third umpire to review things that are quick to make decisions on.</p>
        
            <p>"The other place that I think it could be used and this would be post-game with an independent panel… where we have collisions that are game management decisions that need to be made post-game, with the emphasis on concussion and dangerous play being a high consideration within the game. I think there is room for analysis post-game by an independent panel on what actually happened."</p>
        
            <p>Stars coach Kiri Wills</p>
        
            <p>"Yes and No. No because our game is stop start enough with umpire whistle. Yes- for the changes to the foul play rules and determining whether or not a player should be suspended."</p>
        
            <p>Magic coach Mary-Jane Araroa </p>
        
            <p>"Definitely, having video technology available throughout the game and inside our changing rooms would be an advantage - as we could look to play some quick video clips to improve court performance during half-time."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse coach Anna Andrews-Tasola</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek</p>
        
            <p>"That's a tough one, but I could maybe see a challenge system being used which again, could bring the crowd into the game. You see it in cricket how the crowd becomes involved with the use of the challenge system, and maybe that could be used to an advantage in our game, especially when some of those decisions at the end of a game can be crucial."</p>
        
            <p>Steel coach Reinga Bloxham</p>
        
            <p>"I think the game is too quick for this to happen. It would slow things down. However, with the new warning and send-off rules, it could be used there to help decide if it should be a two-minute send off or four-minute, then out of the game."</p>

            <p>Mystics coach Tia Winikerei </p>
        
            <p>"I think it would make for a more rounded discussions, and it would allow both the team and the player to consider what the options are in a deeper way if there was a longer period of time."</p>
        
            <p>Stars coach Kiri Wills</p>
        
            <p>"Unsure what the advantage would be on making this period longer. It would be good if it could line up with SSN and VNL contracting. I would also like to have the ability to sign players for more than one season at a time. Especially those who are committed to moving cities to be with us, it would be great to give them some security."</p>
        
            <p>Magic coach Mary-Jane Araroa </p>
        
            <p>"Yes, extend approximately three to four weeks."</p>
        
            <p>Pulse coach Anna Andrews-Tasola</p>
        
            <p>"If referring to the current contract period allowing full year-round access to athletes, I would support as that would ensure superior athlete preparation."</p>
        
            <p>Tactix coach Marianne Delaney-Hoshek</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, I'd like a longer player contract signing period than we currently have. It's very rushed at the moment and we don't have the opportunity to see players in our national championships, or other competitions, before we have to finalise squads."</p>
        
            <p>Steel coach Reinga Bloxham</p>
        
            <p>"Player contracting is always a stressful time for all involved. I would like to see alignment with other competitions to allow franchises, coaches and CEO's to scout players who may not be in the ANZP or NNL, but might go to the national senior championships to be spotted."</p>
