        <p>

            <p>Business is "off the charts" for a water tank manufacturer as Wellington runs low on water this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The region is in for water restrictions next week banning the use of irrigation and sprinklers - which Wellington Water admitted was mostly due to water being drained by thousands of leaks across ageing infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonians queued in the hot sun for discounted water storage tanks this week, after warnings everyone should have emergency water storage at home.</p>
        
            <p>The 200-litre tanks were made by The Tank Guy, and sold by councils for $115 - significantly cheaper than the $265 retail price.</p>
        
            <p>
Long queues of people waited for hours to buy discounted water tanks at Wellington southern landfill's Tip Shop on Tuesday.

            <p>The Tank Guy owner Gary King said demand had skyrocketed since December, but he was confident he could meet it.</p>
        
            <p>Councils and civil defence gave King a heads up in September that Wellington could be "heading for some issues", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've ramped up as much as we can, and we're running slightly ahead of our production targets," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Each council in the Wellington region was receiving weekly deliveries of the 200 litre tanks, with 90 tanks in each batch - which should be enough to meet demand, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I expect it'll get a lot stronger through February if the weather patterns continue.</p>
        
            <p>"It's way above for what it has been for the last five summers."</p>

            <p>The business had managed to outsource manufacturing of other products, freeing them up to focus on the tanks.</p>
        
            <p>The Tank Guy had been manufacturing for Wellington's councils for more than 10 years, and there were about 30,000 tanks at homes across the region.</p>
        
            <p>The last big peak in demand followed the 2016 Kaik≈çura earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>King said the popular 200-litre tanks were suitable for one to two people, but 800-litre tanks were recommended for families.</p>
