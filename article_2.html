            <p>A trending drink, strawberry matcha, has given Auckland coffee shops a much needed pick-me-up.</p>
        
            <p>Posts about the bright green and pink beverage gained almost 70 million views on TikTok.</p>
        
            <p>Now Aucklanders are joining the trend, using social media to find the best strawberry matcha in their city.</p>
        
            <p>Local cafes said despite initial hesitancy, customers were now lapping the drink up at around $9 a cup.</p>
        
            <p>Head barista at Blackdrop Eatery in Newmarket King Tee said the strawberry matcha iced latte is now its best-selling drink.</p>
        
            <p>"When we first started serving it, it piqued curiosity in people, but they weren't very keen to try it.</p>
        
            <p>"Then it started getting popular on TikTok and everybody had to have one. People started coming in every single day. I've been making more matcha strawberry than coffee."</p>

            <p>He said the business sold up to 80 cups of matcha strawberry a day and sales had more than doubled in the past few months.</p>
        
            <p>"One 500 gram bag of matcha used to last six months. Now we are going through one bag a week."</p>
        
            <p>Tee said the drink's biggest adopters were Gen Z and millennials who had never had matcha, but saw it online.</p>
        
            <p>"Matcha is not a new thing. But for the younger generation it's new and trendy."</p>
        
            <p>While most were enticed by the drink's aesthetic appeal, he said first-time matcha drinkers were pleasantly surprised by the taste.</p>
        
            <p>"Feedback I've received is that it's really refreshing and easy to drink.</p>
        
            <p>"Matcha strawberry is one of the easiest ways to get into matcha because matcha itself is a really earthy umami drink, but the strawberry balances it out."</p>
        
            <p>According to Tee, many cafes that wanted to capitalise on matcha's growing popularity were not using high-grade matcha in their drinks.</p>
        
            <p>"Most cafes in Auckland are still trying to catch up and are using a baking-grade matcha. If you're drinking it, it's better to have a higher grade matcha which has more umami.</p>
        
            <p>"A baking matcha is more yellow, a high grade matcha is usually a neon-ish green."</p>
        
            <p>The owner of Luna Bakehouse, Malisa Nguyen, said the business had also seen a recent spike in strawberry matcha sales.</p>

            <p>She said staff paid close attention to online trends when choosing new menu items.</p>
        
            <p>"We're quite focused on social media in general and strawberry matcha is one of the prettiest drinks. It has three different layers and the colour combination looks really cool."</p>
        
            <p>Nguyen said strawberry and matcha was a common flavour combination in Japan, but the social media hype had seen more cafes offer it worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>The Asian community had enjoyed matcha well before it became 'trendy'.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in the day, we used to have to convince people to give it a shot and that matcha is really good."</p>
        
            <p>More people in New Zealand had started to embraced matcha, with some customers choosing it over their usual coffee.</p>
        
            <p>"We're definitely starting to see more matcha drinkers. A lot of people are swapping from coffee to matcha at the moment. It's reaching a ratio of one matcha drinker to three or four coffee drinkers.</p>
        
            <p>"Now people are more open-minded and willing to give it a go."</p>
        
            <p>The owner of Issy's in Milford, Issy Williams, who has been a matcha-lover for almost a decade, said she was inspired to sell strawberry matcha at her cafe after trying it during a trip to New York last year.</p>

            <p>She launched the drink as a limited-time special but it was now a permanent menu item.</p>
        
            <p>"The strawberry matcha has really taken off. Some weekends we sell more matcha than coffee which is crazy to think because it was more of a special we were going to do. But it has now been on our menu for nearly a year."</p>
        
            <p>She said many new customers from around the city who heard about the drink on social media had become regulars.</p>
        
            <p>TikTok posts about the cafe's strawberry matcha had been a huge help for her business.</p>
        
            <p>"TikTok is probably the biggest platform for us. It has that younger generation that's into new fads and trends and matcha has become really popular lately.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people have posted our strawberry matcha on social media because it does look quite aesthetic and people have travelled from all around Auckland to try our matcha."</p>
