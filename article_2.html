            <p>Transpower is asking Northland to conserve power as they work to fully restore service to the region.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of people had their power cut on Thursday after a pylon tower fell over with about 200 homes still in the dark on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Power is still on limited supply meaning that there's risk of further outages particularly around peak usage this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Energy Minister Simeon Brown was currently travelling to Te Tai Tokerau and says getting answers about the outages is a top priority.</p>
