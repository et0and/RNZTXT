            <p>Another scrub fire has broken out on Māngere Mountain in Auckland, just hours after a previous blaze was contained.</p>
        
            <p>Nineteen crews fought an overnight fire that broke out Saturday just before 9.30pm, eventually destroying more than three hectares of vegetation overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Users on social media had posted images of the evening blaze, which sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>
        
            <p>Although Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said the fire was contained by early morning, it appears a second fire has now broken out on the mountain's ridge at about 3.15pm this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the blaze is burning through a grass area measuring 30 square metres.</p>
        
            <p>Three fire trucks are currently at the scene.</p>
