            <p>Prosecutors in South Korea have indicted the impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, the main opposition party said.</p>
        
            <p>"The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection," Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally."</p>
        
            <p>Yonhap news agency reported that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office indicted Yoon over rebellion in connection with his 3 December decree that plunged the country into massive political turmoil.</p>
        
            <p>There was no immediate comment from the prosecutors' office.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
