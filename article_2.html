            <p>Waitangi Day is due to bring hot and dry weather across most of the country, with some areas expected to reach into the mid 30s.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the public holiday will be marked with sunshine at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds and all across the North Island, with temperatures of mid-to-high 20s from Kaitaia to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"High pressure will mean that for much of Aotearoa New Zealand, Waitangi Day will be a dry one with fine weather on the cards for those on the North Island," meteorologist John Law said.</p>
        
            <p>Law said the South Island is mostly in for the same, with highs of 34 through parts of Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>"The combination of dry conditions, high temperatures and strong winds through parts of Canterbury add to the fire risk for the region," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, not everyone was destined for the beach with their day off, as MetService issued severe weather warnings for Fiordland.</p>
        
            <p>"Fronts moving up the country are set to bring rain into Fiordland and Southland for Waitangi Day," Law said.</p>

            <p>Fiordland and Southland also had strong wind watches in place, and stronger winds were also expected in inland parts of Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the gusts could elevate to severe gales in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Fire and Emergency said the risk of wildfires is extreme in Northland, Auckland, Waipara, Canterbury and Otago because of the soaring temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ has already contained two wildfires in the Canterbury region on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>National wildfire specialist Tim Mitchell said the fire danger rating has gone into the extreme level in some spots.</p>
        
            <p>He said 98 percent of all wildfires in New Zealand are caused by human activity, so if people take precautions, the country can live with quite a high level of risk.</p>
