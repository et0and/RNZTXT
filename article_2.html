        <h2>Mining for local fertiliser better than buying 'blood phosphate' - report</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand farms could stop buying 'blood phosphate' and lower their greenhouse gas emissions by getting a common fertiliser from local mines, a report says.

            <p>New Zealand farms could stop buying 'blood phosphate' and lower their greenhouse gas emissions by getting a common fertiliser from local mines, a report says.</p>
        
            <p>The report was written by mining company L&M Group and consultancy Agribusiness Group, but funded and released by the publicly funded Our Land and Water National Science Challenge.</p>
        
            <p>About half the fertiliser used in New Zealand is phosphate, which boosts plant growth but also pollutes waterways when farmers use too much of it.</p>
        
            <p>A separate, international study by New Zealand and UK authors - released at the same time - showed many farmers globally overuse phosphate, creating avoidable pollution, while others did not have enough to grow maximum food from their land.</p>
        
            <p>The authors of the international peer-reviewed study in Nature Food warned people needed to ration it more carefully to make its benefits last more than 500 years, given it was not renewable.</p>
        
            <p>As of 2021, New Zealand was the ninth biggest importer in the world, shipping in around 700,000 tonnes, with 51 percent of that coming from Morocco, followed by Togo and China.</p>
        
            <p>The Moroccan supply was probed in series of reports by Stuff in 2018, which traced the fertiliser's links to a long-running humanitarian crisis in a bitterly disputed area, Western Sahara, annexed by Morocco in the 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>Monday's New Zealand study for Our Land and Water was finished in December and looked into options for mining phosphate locally, something L&M Group has been investigating.</p>
        
            <p>It said mining phosphate in New Zealand would have around half the planet-heating effect of mining and transporting the imported stuff on which farmers currently rely.</p>
        
            <p>Nitrous oxide from nitrogen-based fertiliser is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand, but that is a different type of fertiliser.</p>
        
            <p>The report cited ethical benefits from opening local mines, saying: "Political and social issues relating to the use of 'blood phosphate' from the contested Western Sahara would be effectively addressed."</p>
        
            <p>There would be environmental effects from open-cast mining, similar to quarrying limestone, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>It said New Zealand could potentially produce a slower-release form of the fertiliser, which would be less prone to being washed into lakes, rivers and aquifers.</p>
        
            <p>According to Stats NZ, 64 percent of river lengths have phosphorus concentrations at levels posing an environmental risk.</p>
        
            <p>L&M Group has identified deposits in Clarendon, Otago as well as North Canterbury and Kaik≈çura.</p>
