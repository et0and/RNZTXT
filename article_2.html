            <p>More than three tonnes of methamphetamine seized by Fiji police on 14 January remains under 24-hour surveillance, the country's Home Affairs Minister Pio Tikoduadua says.</p>
        
            <p>Tikoduadua told state broadcaster FBC on Friday that meth mountain is "securely under lock and key".</p>
        
            <p>FBC reports him saying that "stringent security measures have been implemented to safeguard the seized drugs".</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, assistance police commissioner of crime Mesake Waqa confirmed to local media that one police officer is facing charges after he allegedly scooped spilled crystal meth power while almost 800 medium-sized containers which contained the confiscated drugs were being unloaded at the Namaka Police Station, before fleeing the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The officer remains in police custody.</p>
        
            <p>"According to the Minister, the containers are reportedly being held in Nasova, where guards and 24-hour CCTV cameras are in place to monitor any potential tampering," FBC reported.</p>
        
            <p>Tikoduadua is urging the Fijian people to come forward with information implicating police involvement in the drug trade.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely worried that some police may be involved," he said, adding "because there's been allegations of all sorts in the past, so that we must weed out".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm appealing for the professionalisation of the police and this we can only do with the help of the people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities continue to gather information, he added.</p>
