        <h2>Survey reveals many food allergic reactions on flights go unreported</h2>
        <p>
Almost 70 percent of survey respondents from Australia and New Zealand reported flying with a food allergy adds "a lot" of anxiety to their experience.

            <p>When Lianne Mandelbaum approached a flight attendant to notify them of her son's life-threatening peanut allergy, she wasn't expecting any pushback.</p>
        
            <p>She was travelling with her husband and their 17-year-old son Josh on a flight from Texas to New York in 2023, and had made similar requests before.</p>
        
            <p>But this time, instead of addressing her concerns about Josh's safety, Mandelbaum claims she was summoned by another staff member before take-off and spoken to rudely, leaving the family embarrassed and distressed.</p>
        
            <p>Mandelbaum said flying with a food allergy was like "a game of roulette, each flight a random spin around the wheel".</p>
        
            <p>"On every flight, it is uncertain if and how crew members will accommodate nut allergies, and this adds tremendous unnecessary stress," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Her family is not alone.</p>
        
            <p>A new study, co-authored by Mandelbaum and published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, found airline travel could contribute to "excess anxiety" for people affected by food allergies.</p>
        
            <p>It reflected survey responses from more than 4700 food allergy patients and families across the world, including more than 300 people from Australia and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Northwestern University population health researcher Chris Warren, who is the lead author of the study, said "the most crystal-clear result" of the survey was "98 percent of respondents declaring that having a food allergy added anxiety to the air travel experience".</p>
        
            <p>Almost 70 percent of survey respondents from Australia and New Zealand reported flying with a food allergy adds "a lot" of anxiety to their experience, while another 22 per cent said it added "some" anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>The survey also uncovered what Dr Warren called a "concerning trend" of people deliberately choosing not to tell airline staff about their life-threatening food allergy.</p>
        
            <p>"They see it as potentially more likely to lead to inconvenience or unwanted intervention versus a helpful, informed effort to facilitate their chronic disease management," he said.</p>
        
            <p>More than a third of participants also reported experiencing "unprofessional or insensitive behaviour" from airline staff regarding their food allergy, with 76 percent saying these experiences affected, for instance, their choice of airline.</p>
        
            <p>"The consistency of these findings across all the countries and demographic groups we surveyed is remarkable - including Australians," Dr Warren said.</p>

            <p>Australia is often known as the "food allergy capital of the world", with more than 1.5 million affected by at least one food allergy.</p>
        
            <p>Maria Said, chief executive of Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia, said there was a lot of fear and anxiety about flying with food allergy.</p>
        
            <p>"There has certainly been reports of [allergic] reactions that have happened in the air."</p>
        
            <p>The new study found almost 10 percent of participants reported experiencing an accidental food-related allergic reaction during a flight, with the most common allergen being peanuts.</p>
        
            <p>Of those reactions, about 40 percent were not reported to either flight crew or the airline.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen Adelstein, a clinical immunologist and allergy specialist at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the study provided useful insights into the real-life travel experiences of people with food allergies.</p>
        
            <p>"The low rate of respondents reporting their reactions to flight personnel during the flight is concerning," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"More education is evidently necessary to ensure that food-allergic individuals appreciate the potential significance of reactions and that alerting aircrew during a flight would be a sensible undertaking to ensure enhanced monitoring and surveillance and treatment where necessary while in flight."</p>
        
            <p>However, Dr Adelstein cautioned that there may have been potential biases in the data, given it was predominantly sourced from advocacy organisations and may reflect a more severe or affected population.</p>
        
            <p>It's a limitation the study's authors also note.</p>

            <p>Dr Warren said the research showed the food allergy community - a large and growing group - made travel decisions based on factors related to food allergy.</p>
        
            <p>"However, respondents also shared their belief that, with consistent implementation of appropriate food allergy policies, this anxiety would substantially decrease and for some be almost entirely eliminated," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This highlights how improving the consistency and quality of accommodations for travellers with food allergy can potentially pay dividends for these airlines down the road."</p>
        
            <p>He added no airlines were interviewed for the survey: "We focused purely on the perspectives of food allergy patients and their parents/caregivers."</p>
        
            <p>One piece of advice all experts offered is that anyone travelling with a food allergy should notify the airline and flight crew beforehand, even if they feel embarrassed doing so.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Warren said it was also critical to not store any life-saving medicine in your checked or hand luggage and instead keep it in the pocket in front of your seat.</p>
        
            <p>While it's important to eat while flying, especially over long distances, people with a food allergy should try not to eat airline food, and bring allergy-safe food instead, Said, who is also a director of the National Allergy Council, said.</p>
        
            <p>If you think you're experiencing an allergic reaction, she said to "err on the side of caution" and let the flight crew know immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"The sooner you communicate, before you deteriorate even further, the better - and please don't take yourself to the bathroom on your own," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're going to be sick, it's best to be sick where you are, because standing up and walking to the bathroom and then sitting upright in a bathroom where you could collapse is not a safe thing to do."</p>
        
            <p>Administer medication immediately, she added, and remember to stay calm, lay down if you can, and follow the instructions on your emergency response plan.</p>
