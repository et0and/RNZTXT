            <p>The 34th season of the World of Wearable Art has kicked off in the capital - an annual spectacle of fashion, art, circus, dance and music. </p>
        
            <p>This year’s theme is Dream Awake, and the competition has 91 finalists from 15 countries. </p>
        
            <p>Joining Culture 101 to discuss the spectacle of WOW is Stuff arts journalist Andre Chumko and theatre maker and writer for Wellingtonista, Emma Maguire.</p>
        
            <p>US designer Grace DuVal won the Supreme WOW Award for her garment, ‘Curves Ahead’, made from reflective vinyl construction signs with a stunning road-cone headpiece. </p>
        
            <p>DuVal was inspired by a road trip to New Zealand, following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquakes where she says she witnessed the strength and resilience of the rebuilding efforts. The designer noticed the striking juxtaposition between natural landscapes and the neon ensembles of the Kiwi road workers. </p>

            <p>The world's leading wearable art competition has been running for 37 years and moved to Wellington in 2005. More than 300 people are employed for the show each year and in 2023, almost 30,000 visitors flocked to the capital specifically to see the show. </p>
        
            <p>The Tall Poppy People's Choice Award is open for audiences to vote throughout the season and will be announced mid-October.</p>
