            <p>Security concerns at Auckland Airport forced the cancellation of an Air New Zealand flight late on Friday evening, leaving a number of Dunedin-bound passengers stranded.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ677 was due to depart from Auckland before the aircraft returned to the gate due to security reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers remained onboard for a period before they were disembarked safely, Air New Zealand's chief operational integrity and safety officer David Morgan said.</p>
        
            <p>The airline was working with passengers to reaccommodate them, he said.</p>
