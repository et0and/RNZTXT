            <p>ACT leader David Seymour says it's "very possible" the leaders of the three parties looking to form a government will meet today.</p>
        
            <p>Arriving in Wellington on Tuesday, Seymour told waiting reporters each party has issues the others do no like very much, and each knows they will have to come to a compromise.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hope is that happens as rapidly as possible.</p>
        
            <p>He was asked if they would all be meeting together today.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's very possible, we're certainly very happy to meet anyone, anytime, and we're all in Wellington now so that's got to make it easier.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there may well be a meeting of three, yes."</p>
