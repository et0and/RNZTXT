            <p>Several Kiwi families say they are okay with their children bunking school to go on holiday early because flights are cheaper.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday - one day before the holidays began - dozens of travellers at Auckland International Airport told First Up they were checking in early for flights to the Pacific Islands, United States and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>One woman heading to Rarotonga said she would have to pay at least $500 more if she travelled after school holidays started.</p>
        
            <p>Another whānau said their children were skipping two days of school so they could save $2000 on airfares.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile last week, Associate Education Minister David Seymour announced parents who allow their children to take more than 15 days off in a single term face possible prosecution by the Ministry of Education.</p>
        
            <p>One mother said she was all for children being in class, but she thought skipping two days was not a big deal.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not the kind of parent that would keep my kid out of school just to make it cheaper on the pocket."</p>
        
            <p>But they were not the only ones.</p>
        
            <p>One man headed to Brisbane with his family said airfares seemed to go up as soon as holidays began, so he had no choice but to travel early.</p>
        
            <p>"It's significantly cheaper. We're also coming back a day after school starts, so we're coming back Monday and that's saved $1400.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems that they [airfares] go up dramatically as soon as school holidays start.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just price gouging."</p>
        
            <p>Another whānau headed to the United States said leaving early was not about the cost but spending extra time overseas.</p>
        
            <p>And it was no problem getting their daughter off school early.</p>
        
            <p>"I just emailed school that we're taking a couple days off and that's it."</p>
        
            <p>Several other travellers also said they too they had no problem getting their children excused from school a couple of days early.</p>
        
            <p>"We told them it was happening. They're in primary school, so it's it's ... it's no major deal," one father said.</p>
        
            <p>But most families did not like the idea of potentially being prosecuted if their children missed 15 days of school during a term.</p>
        
            <p>"I think travel is an education. I wouldn't take them out all the time, but I know my children work hard during the rest of the time. I'm not bothered to take a week here and there to go and travel," said a mother-of-two.</p>
        
            <p>Another woman said it was not fair to penalise parents for airlines that made it expensive to travel during the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand has been asked for comment on travellers' concerns that fare rises amounted to price gouging.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said not enough people were taking education seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"School is open for about 180 days a year, that leaves another 185 days a year for family, cultural events, holidays and anything else that people would like to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I I think when people say that school being open 180 days a year is too much and they need to nickel and dime a day here and there for a holiday it shows that education has been seen as dispensable, too dispensable in our society."</p>
        
            <p>And although fines were a last a resort, they may just have to be implemented to catch repeat offenders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to remember that you only get fined as a last resort if you're, if you're chronically absent and you're judged to be more of a won't than a can't. If you miss a few days a term, you won't fall into the chronically absent category where fines are a possibility. But that doesn't mean that it's okay."</p>
