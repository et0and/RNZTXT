            <p>The government is funding 50 new senior doctors, and more nurses, to fix critical shortages in rural, mental health, maternity and critical care specialities.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand estimates the new frontline doctors will cost $20 million, depending on the specialities of the doctors and their experience.</p>
        
            <p>Funding of $10m will be made available for new nurses.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti says the investment will reduce wait times, improve patient safety and support vulnerable specialities like dermatolgy that are in need of more clinical staff.</p>
        
            <p>"This funding will help fill critical workforce gaps and support the health workforce to deliver on the Government's health targets, particularly in regional or provincial hospitals," Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>"While Health New Zealand has made significant progress recruiting nurses in the last 12 months, there are critical shortages."</p>
        
            <p>"Setting aside funding specifically to employ senior specialist nurses and allied health professionals will help sustain services that are struggling because of a lack of specialist skills," Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>A separate $12m fund is also being set up to pay for minor repairs, replacement appliances, and new books and toys for children undergoing treatment.</p>
        
            <p>It will be up to each region to decide how to spend the money, "but I expect them to be able to access it quickly and easily, so they can get recruitment and minor repairs underway", Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported on Monday that patients who need hospital treatment are increasingly not even making waiting lists. An excerpt of a letter to a GP from Palmerston North Hospital's orthopaedic clinic earlier this year - obtained by RNZ - confirmed some referrals are being knocked back due to "lack of resources".</p>
        
            <p>Meawhile Te Whatu Ora accepted more than 400 voluntary redundancies in October, as part of efforts to cut costs to ease a huge deficit. On Monday, staff in its IT department were told of a new proposal to disestablish more roles at the agency.</p>
