            <p>Police have released a CCTV image of a car seen in Miramar in the early hours of the morning when 63-year-old Abdul Nabizadah was found with serious head injuries and later died.</p>
        
            <p>They were continuing to investigate the homicide and an aggravated burglary in Miramar on 17 March, and were appealing to the public for information about the car and items of clothing found near the house that was burgled.</p>
        
            <p>Nabizadah was found at the intersection of Camperdown Rd and Totara Rd at 2.20am, about twenty minutes after a burglary on Darlington Rd where occupants found an intruder inside their home.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard said they're still trying to establish whether the two incidents were linked.</p>
        
            <p>A 28-year-old man has been arrested and charged with aggravated burglary in relation to the burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police released a CCTV image of a car seen in the area on 17 March, and a reference image of the model of the car.</p>

            <p>"We wish to speak to the driver of a Grey or Silver Mazda Atenza / Mazda 6, 2006 model that was seen driving through Darlington Rd / Camperdown Rd intersection several times between 11.50pm Sunday 16 March and 2.17am Monday 17 March," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he hoped the driver of the car could assist police with their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"If this was you or if you recognise this vehicle and know who the driver is, please contact police," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard said they're also interested in any information about a white baseball hat with a red swastika on the front, and a pair of H&H brand size 8 women's gumboots, left at the Darlington Rd burglary scene.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that both items were left by the burglar and, while a person has already been charged in relation to the burglary, we continue to seek any information about the clothing items," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, police were continuing to appeal for information about a man seen walking down Camperdown Rd from Totara St, and who turned right in to Darlington Rd at 12.28am.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man was wearing a light-coloured top and dark pants.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were thankful to the community who had helped with identifying a man running on Darlington Rd on 17 March.</p>
