            <p>A man who has been missing since mid-March was found dead during flooding in Hawke's Bay earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Earle Taka, who is known as Pat, was from Central Hawke's Bay and was last seen at a service station at the intersection of Russell Road and State Highway 2 Waipukurau.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Saturday, police said Taka was found by a contractor who was carrying out flood protection work in the waterways of the Ōtāne area on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay and Tai Rāwhiti were slammed with torrential rain earlier this week, causing flooding and prompting evacuations as well as local states of emergency.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they did not believe 66-year-old's death was suspicious and a post-mortem had been carried out.</p>
        
            <p>When police reported on his disappearance, they said he was known to often hitchhike from his home at State Highway 2 Ōtāne, near Te Aute College to Waipukurau or Hastings.</p>
