        <p>
The Health Minister is speaking as Wellington Regional Hospital reveals the first of eight new radiology machines.
</p>
        
            <p>New digital radiography machines at Wellington Regional Hospital will boost services in the region, Health Minister Shane Reti says.</p>
        
            <p>Watch the media conference above from about 9am.</p>
        
            <p>Reti is opening the first of eight new x-ray machines now operational at the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Imaging that might have taken half an hour to capture and review can now be done in about a third of the time, he said, with quicker access enabling more patients to be seen every day.</p>
        
            <p>"This investment represents a significant upgrade to radiology services at Wellington Regional and Kenepuru Community hospitals."</p>
        
            <p>The rollout of the eight new machines will continue through to December this year and also includes the refurbishment of radiology rooms.</p>
        
            <p>It followed an earlier upgrade of x-ray machines and radiology rooms at Hutt Hospital.</p>
