        <h2>Nurses to strike over pay dispute with Health NZ</h2>
        <p>
Nurses are "tired and frustrated" and there is no evidence their work is valued, union says.

            <p>The Nurses Organisation has called a nationwide strike in December over its pay dispute with Health NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora members have voted to strike on 3 December between 11am and 7pm, and embark on rolling strikes in districts across the country in the following two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Nurses were feeling undervalued and were worried patient safety was being put at risk, Nurses Organisation chief executive Paul Goulter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nurses all around New Zealand working in the public hospitals are tired, they're frustrated, they keep being promised things, they keep being told 'we value your work', but in fact when it comes down to it there's no evidence their work's being valued."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ was suggesting pay rises far below what nurses deserved, he said.</p>

            <p>It had capped any increase at 1 percent of total employee costs - which would mean 0.5 percent in the first year because it would not come into effect until April 2025 - and up to 1 percent in the second year.</p>
        
            <p>The Nurses Organisation had told members that meant they would be offered a wage increase well below the rate of inflation - effectively a pay cut.</p>
        
            <p>Nurses needed pay rises that reflected at least the cost of living, and recognised their skills and knowledge, the union - which represents about 56,000 nurses and health workers - said.</p>
        
            <p>Nurses were also alarmed at plans to pause a digital staffing system used in hospitals to indicate how many full-time staff were needed on duty at any given time, the union said. That would leave few safeguards on staffing levels and result in fewer nurses, midwives, health care assistants and kaimahi hauora on duty.</p>
        
            <p>The union said that would put patient and whƒÅnau safety and wellbeing at risk, and patients would pay the price for hospitals that were continuously under-staffed and under-resourced.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora will be formally notified of the strike on Monday. It has been approached for comment.</p>
