            <p>A Waikato bakery is one of the latest to fall victim to counterfeit money amid a series of cases in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of dollars of counterfeit notes have been found in Waikato, with retailers being warned to keep a sharp eye out during the Christmas rush.</p>
        
            <p>Since October, police say there have been seven incidents with alleged fake notes, including $50, $20 and $10 notes.</p>
        
            <p>They have been reported across Waikato, including Hamilton East, Te Rapa, Frankton, Te Awamutu, Beerescourt, and Paeroa.</p>
        
            <p>Kath Ung, owner of the Golden Pie Bakery and Cafe in Hamilton, said a man came into her shop early Monday morning and bought a sweet muffin with a $100, asking for change.</p>
        
            <p>Looking closer, she could tell the note was a fake, Ung said.</p>
        
            <p>"The paper is different, because the real note is like a bit plastic, it's not like paper paper, but this one is like a newspaper," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The colour is like light pink not dark pink, and it's a bit longer."</p>
        
            <p>The man was given more than $90 in change, Ung said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't do anything with that [$100] note, I lost the money."</p>
        
            <p>The man had been acting suspicious as she went to the bank to get change, Ung said.</p>
        
            <p>"He look a bit [rushed] ... he couldn't stay in one place, his reaction showed that he 100 percent knew it was a fake note."</p>

            <p>When Ung reported it to police, they told her to come in and drop the bill at the station.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got no time to do that stuff," Ung said.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was not happy after being scammed, given her and her staff work hard to earn a living.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working so hard, I have to get up at like four in the morning to make the pies," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not so happy though, we're working so hard and then they use that fake note on us and get our money.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything is going up, and we try to work hard for the cost of living," said Ung.</p>

            <p>Waikato Prevention Manager Inspector Hywel Jones told Checkpoint people should check every note they were handed.</p>
        
            <p>There are some security features - which help distinguish fake notes - on the two types of banknotes in circulation at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"The first one has a bird at the lower left front. And if you move that back and forth, you should see a rolling bow of color, as it's tilted and you can hold it up to the light and you'll see a fern in the centre of the bird," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"The second older style of banknote has got a small oval window at the front right and holding it up to a light will show a watermark of the queen to the left of that window.</p>
        
            <p>"And finally, for those retailers, I suppose who've got a UV torch or black light, both styles have a patch that shows the denomination that glows which is located on the front left of the note."</p>
