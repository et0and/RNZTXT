            <p>Holiday traffic is causing congestion in the main centres as people head away for the long Labour weekend.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, traffic heading north out of the city was expected to remain heavy until about 7:30pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, northbound congestion was predicted to ease after 7pm. While further south, heavy traffic between Christchurch and Ashburton on Friday was expected to start to ease as the evening began.</p>
        
            <p>Six people died on New Zealand roads during last year's Labour Weekend period. While seven died during the Easter period this year - the highest since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The official Labour Weekend road toll period started at 4 pm on Friday 25 October, and runs until 6 am on Tuesday 29 October.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers were being asked to play it cool to keep everyone safe on the roads this Labour Weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Sticking to the basics was key, police and the Transport Agency Waka Kotahi said in a statement, and police patrols would be out on the roads watching drivers carefully.</p>
        
            <p>"Those who blatantly choose to drive dangerously whether it's driving without a seatbelt or impaired by drugs and alcohol, using a mobile phone and speeding, they can expect to be ticketed," road policing director Superintendent Steve Greally said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no room for complacency, and we want motorists to take note whenever and wherever they are travelling. We all have a responsibility to drive and ride safely on our roads."</p>
        
            <p>The Holiday Hotspots Journey Planning Tool had been updated ready for Labour Weekend, the Transport Agency said.</p>
        
            <p>The interactive map shows drivers where and when traffic is predicted to be heavy, based on travel patterns from past years.</p>
        
            <p>And, "we encourage drivers to use the Journey Planner tool, as it allows you to plan your trip with travel time estimates, and provides updates on potential delays, road works and road closures," Transport Agency land transport director Brent Alderton said.</p>
        
            <p>"With more traffic, comes the need to take more care on the road. Holiday traffic means there will be congestion on highways in and out of the main urban centres on Friday and Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"We're asking everyone to make safe choices to protect themselves and others. Please be patient and drive at a safe speed, especially around and through road works."</p>
