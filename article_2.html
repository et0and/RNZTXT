        <h2>Cricket: Kohli's conduct under the microscope in Boxing Day test</h2>
        <p>
The on-field conduct of India cricket legen Virat Kohli's has come under the microscope in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne after a clash of shoulders with teen debutant Sam Konstas but the incidentâ€¦

            <p>With Konstas well on top of India's bowlers on day one, Kohli was booed by the Melbourne Cricket Ground after bumping into the 19-year-old as he walked down the pitch for a chat with opening partner Usman Khawaja at the end of the 10th over.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli and Konstas turned to face each other and exchanged words, prompting umpire Michael Gough and Khawaja to step in to defuse the moment.</p>
        
            <p>Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who was covering the game for host broadcaster Seven Network, said veteran batsman Kohli was clearly the offender.</p>
        
            <p>"That man (Kohli) might have a few questions to answer," Ponting said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're out there batting, the batsman owns the wicket. The crease is his. Especially between overs like that."</p>
        
            <p>Former England captain Michael Vaughan also put the blame on 36-year-old Kohli.</p>
        
            <p>"Virat Kohli is such an experienced pro, being wound up by a 19 (year old)," the Fox Cricket pundit said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's Virat that walks into Sam."</p>

            <p>Konstas, who replaced the dropped Nathan McSweeney in the side, appeared unruffled by the clash, smashing Jasprit Bumrah for four on the next delivery and hitting a six over the Indian pace spearhead's head on the way to 18 runs from the over.</p>
        
            <p>Konstas downplayed the incident in a brief interview with Fox Cricket during a drinks break.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever (happens) on the field stays on the field. I love competing. It doesn't get any better for a debut at a packed stadium," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear whether any action will be taken against either player.</p>
        
            <p>The International Cricket Council bans "inappropriate physical contact" and those found guilty can be suspended for matches if the offence is deemed serious enough.</p>
        
            <p>Batting maestro Kohli had shrugged off a dire run of form with a century in the series-opener in Perth but has managed just 21 runs in three innings since in the series.</p>
        
            <p>With the temperature racing past 30 degrees Celsius in the morning, his mood may not have been helped by Konstas surviving a nick off Bumrah that fell just short of him in the slips.</p>
        
            <p>Kohli had earlier laughed openly at Konstas when the teenager botched two attempts to scoop Bumrah behind the wicket.</p>
        
            <p>But there was little mirth among the Indians as Konstas succeeded on his next three efforts, scoring boundaries on each.</p>
        
            <p>Having also smashed fiery seamer Mohammed Siraj around the ground, Konstas was eventually dismissed for 60 off 65 balls when trapped lbw by Ravindra Jadeja before lunch.</p>
        
            <p>At afternoon tea Australia had got through to 176 for two, with Konstas and Usman Khawaja (57) the batters out.</p>
        
            <p>Marnus Labuschagne was on 44 and Steve Smith on 10.</p>
        
            <p>The five match series is level at one-all.</p>
