            <p>Parliament's speaker Gerry Brownlee has ruled last night's interruption of a karakia was correct, but such celebrations should in future be discussed so Parliament and those celebrating know what to expect.</p>
        
            <p>He has also criticised the opposition parties for demanding an apology, saying it was "highly disorderly".</p>
        
            <p>At the final reading of the Whakatōhea Claims Settlement Bill on Tuesday, assistant speaker Maureen Pugh interrupted Te Kahautu Maxwell's celebratory karakia ahead of a waiata the iwi had permission to perform.</p>
        
            <p>Relying on standing orders, she said the public gallery was not the place for speeches.</p>
        
            <p>After the subsequent waiata, Te Pāti Māori raised a point of order and demanded Pugh apologise for the insult. Brownlee was called in and backed Pugh.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of Question Time on Wednesday, Brownlee delivered a ruling on the matter.</p>
        
            <p>"The assistant speaker interrupted a kaumatua in the gallery who was speaking prior to the performance of a waiata celebrating the third reading. According to standing orders the Assistant Speaker was correct in doing so. The practice of the House since the 1990s has accommodated celebratory contributions such as karanga and waiata but not contributions the nature of a speech such as whaikōrero."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was unfortunate Pugh was placed in that situation in the first place, saying the ruling mentioned provided flexibility for the speaker to agree beforehand on celebratory contributions and asked for details of the celebrations to be discussed in future.</p>
        
            <p>"I ask that ministers and members when facilitating arrangements for people to attend an event in the House such as a settlement bill discuss with attendees what celebrations are intended so that the tikanga of the House and the parties to the settlement can be fully aligned. This was not fully observed on this occasion.</p>
        
            <p>"In the future, greater clarity about what is agreed would allow the presiding officer to know what to expect and to ensure things run smoothly. It also will enable those attending to understand what to do and when."</p>
        
            <p>He then criticised the opposition parties for their calls for the speaker to apologise.</p>
        
            <p>"It is highly disorderly for members to demand apologies from presiding officers when they are applying the rules and practice of the House. I strongly advise when members consider the House's rules and practice need to evolve, those members should address a proposal to that effect to the Standing Orders Committee."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
