        <h2>Watch: Port Hills state of emergency lifted</h2>
        <p>
Authorities say they will move to the "recovery phase" shortly.
</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency, in place since a wildfire tore through hundreds of hectares of forest and scrub on Christchurch's Port Hills last week, was lifted at 1pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury Civil Defence group controller Richard Ball said authorities would transition to a recovery phase at that point.</p>
        
            <p>"In a practical sense, it's going to be a continuation of working together across all services and agencies, as we have been doing throughout the response," he told media shortly before 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The nature of recovery is fundamentally different from response. The immediate risks to people, animals, property and the natural environment has diminished, and recovery is a slower and more deliberate process."</p>
        
            <p>Ball said recovery would involve the "wider community, not just those living in the immediate area".</p>
        
            <p>"There are many ways to help, but please understand recovery is complex and takes time, especially if you want to do it well."</p>
        
            <p>He said after "two serious fires in seven years", community engagement would be vital.</p>
        
            <p>Crews at the Port Hills fire were tackling 20 hotspots on Wednesday morning as the fire risk remained high. Incident Controller Dave Key said 70 firefighters were at the scene. A drone on Tuesday night identified 20 hotspots and firefighters were working on turning over and extinguishing those.</p>
        
            <p>Key said there would be no helicopters or aircraft assisting on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) area commander Colin Russell said on Wednesday FENZ was scaling back its work, with all helicopters and aircraft grounded on Tuesday, but the switch to a recovery "does not affect the status of our operations".</p>
        
            <p>"We do have the capacity to stand them up again if we need to. The aim is to clear all the hotspots before we hand the land back to the landowners."</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very large fireground, around 500ha with a 24km perimeter, so we have a large area to deal with."</p>
        
            <p>Russell said FENZ was assessing restrictions on access to the areas surrounding the fire, with cordons at Early Valley lifted on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Canterbury remains in a prohibited fire season, so the fire danger is still very high and we will be entering some more high-risk periods over the weekend and in future weeks, so we ask the public to be very vigilant and careful."</p>
        
            <p>The fire started on 14 February and quickly grew to burn through 650ha. Key said the fire risk remained extremely high and people need to stay very aware of that.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of north Canterbury's Waipara township returned home on Monday after a 300ha blaze at at Waikari Valley was brought under control.</p>
        
            <p>Russell said an investigation into the cause of the fire, with police, was ongoing. He could not give any details on how it was progressing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's far too easily at this stage to make any further comment on the cause."</p>
        
            <p>He urged anyone with information to get in touch.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger on Wednesday thanked residents who were evacuated last week, acknowledging the disruption and anxiety the fire brought to their lives, some for a second time after the fires seven years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Mauger thanked FENZ and Civil Defence for moving quickly to fight the blaze once the state of emergency was called, saying he was "extremely impressed" with the "well coordinated response".</p>
        
            <p>Selwyn District Council recovery manager Al Lawn said he was "very, very grateful for their incredible mahi they have done over the last week or so".</p>
        
            <p>Mauger also thanked evacuated residents for their cooperation, and the families of those who worked to bring the blaze under control.</p>
        
            <p>"I also want to thank the families who've picked up the slack while their loved ones have been out doing what they needed to do to get this fire under control."</p>
        
            <p>Kaumātua Te Hapū o Ngāti Wheke Yvette Couch-Lewis said it took "amazing work" to get the fire under control.</p>
        
            <p>"The Port Hills is a unique place… a treasure we should all look after."</p>
