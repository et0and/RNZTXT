            <p>A meeting where a scathing review of Wellington Water was discussed saw Upper Hutt's mayor lash out over its failings, while other council leaders aired their problems with its deep-seated cultural issues.</p>
        
            <p>An independent report revealed Wellington Water staff took four months to tell the region's councils about a $51 million budgeting error.</p>
        
            <p>It also found the company was immature, with inadequate systems and processes and a dysfunctional culture.</p>
        
            <p>It compared the $5m accounting mistake to the fluoride scandal just two years earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water were also the subject of a report conducted by consultant company FieldForce4 released earlier this year, initiated by Wellington City Council.</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington Water committee meeting amongst mayors in the Wellington region was held on Friday morning to discuss the latest review.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the meeting was excluded to the public due to privacy concerns which Upper Hutt mayor Wayne Guppy was not happy about.</p>

            <p>"There's a cover up again, we've had the fluoride report, we had the FieldForce report that this committee did not want to address, and to not [want] to discuss this in public is disgraceful."</p>
        
            <p>When the public were allowed back in the meeting, Guppy made it clear the problems with Wellington Water were not new.</p>
        
            <p>"We've allowed this beast to grow and it's over five or six years and the fact of the matter is they have continuously thumbed their noses at us."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped other council-controlled organisations around the country were not run like their councils ran Wellington Water.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water board chairperson Nick Leggett said they were taking responsibility for the botch up.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately the board's accountable for the performance of the company and we're going to take account and we're going to improve things."</p>

            <p>Leggett would not comment on whether anyone in senior leadership would be sacked over the saga.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is about understanding at a high level what the direction from our shareholders is."</p>
        
            <p>He said Wellington Water was an organisation that was scared to tell the truth and confront problems.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what we've got to change, we have to be up front earlier."</p>

            <p>Lower Hutt mayor Campbell Barry said there was clearly cultural issues that need to be addressed immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we are very clear on that; the board is clear on that, and we are expecting action.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau and Porirua mayor Anita Baker shared similar sentiments.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said the review showed there were massive failures at Wellington Water and that its culture had to change.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said the review was honest and reinforced serious issues that Wellington City Council had highlighted in the FieldForce4 report and the fluoride inquiry.</p>
