            <p>Friends and family of Yanfei Bao, who was killed in Christchurch in July last year, have gathered to remember her.</p>
        
            <p>The 44-year-old mother and real estate agent was last seen on her way to show a house to a prospective client, and her body was found a year later in farmland on the outskirts of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Tingjun Cao is on trial in the High Court at Christchurch, accused of her murder.</p>
        
            <p>A funeral service was held for her on Monday, with the organisers saying they wanted to remember her beautiful life and incredible accomplishments.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 people gathered at Our Lady of Victories church in Sockburn on a sunny but blustery day.</p>
        
            <p>One of those at the ceremony was Jin Tian, who became friends with Yanfei Bao in 2018 when they went to the University of Canterbury together.</p>
        
            <p>The pair had stayed in touch, with Jin talking to Yanfei on the day she went missing.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was lovely to hear Yanfei's family, friends, workmates and neighbours speak about her.</p>
        
            <p>The eulogy delivered by Yanfei's partner, Paul Gooch - in which he spoke of his love for Yanfei - was very moving, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"His love for Yanfei will live forever, and that Yanfei was the light of the family. He spoke very highly of Yanfei, and that she loved life."</p>
        
            <p>The service also heard from Yanfei's father, who along with Yanfei's sister is currently visiting from China.</p>
        
            <p>She said he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the community, and to the police for their hard work on the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"He is shattered and heart-broken."</p>
        
            <p>Jin said she remembers Yanfei Bao as a wonderful friend, who smiled often and was hard working.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the smartest I'd say. And she's a lovely mother, and she's a friend."</p>
        
            <p>The service ended with the hymn "Amazing Grace", which could be heard ringing out from the church.</p>
        
            <p>The trial of the man accused of murdering Yanfei Bao is currently underway in the High Court in Christchurch, but was halted on Monday due to a juror being unwell.</p>
        
            <p>It had already been subject to a number of delays, and two weeks ago the accused, Tingjun Cao, fired his lawyers and had been representing himself.</p>
