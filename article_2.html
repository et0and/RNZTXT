            <p>This summer looks set to be wetter and windier than usual.</p>
        
            <p>A change in air flow patterns means there will be mixed weather through to March.</p>
        
            <p>In NIWA's seasonal climate outlook from January through to March, a La Niña watch will also remain in place.</p>
        
            <p>La Niña refers to a cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean and the subsequent shift in global weather patterns, including a strengthening of moist easterly winds blowing towards New Zealand, and a subsequent increase in cloud development and rain over the longitudes.</p>
        
            <p>It is only the second time in 75 years that a La Niña onset has arrived in summer.</p>
        
            <p>It usually forms in winter, peaks in late spring, and then gradually weakens through summer.</p>
        
            <p>La Niña will bring moist, rainy conditions to northeastern areas of the North Island and reduced rainfall to the lower and western South Island.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA said there was also an enhanced potential for rain events linked to the tropics and sub-tropics to impact the country from mid-January through to March.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from the west and east of the South Island, which may experience extended dry spells, the rest of the country has a chance of above normal rainfall for the next three months.</p>
        
            <p>Warmer than average air and sea temperatures were also likely for the North Island, with about equal chances for near average or above average seasonal temperatures for the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>The change in air flow patterns will also increase the odds for spells of cooler than usual summertime temperatures.</p>
