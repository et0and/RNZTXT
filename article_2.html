            <p>New Zealand Football plan to have the All Whites play a full schedule of matches in their buildup to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand secured their place in next year's tournament in Mexico, the US and Canada with a 3-0 victory over New Caledonia in the Oceania play-off final in Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>They already have games against Côte d'Ivoire and Ukraine scheduled for June in Toronto and a game against Norway in October in Oslo.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites qualification means New Zealand Football is expected to receive just over $18 million dollars, with around 40 percent going to the players.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Football chief executive Andrew Pragnell said that will also allow them to organise a comprehensive buildup for the All Whites.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll look to play every single international window in the build up to this World Cup," Pragnell said.</p>

            <p>"There are many important things on the horizon for football, but getting this campaign plan absolutely right so the team can perform, go on and win games at this World Cup is a huge priority for us.</p>
        
            <p>"Six international windows, so there's at least 12 international matches there. There'll be a pre World Cup release period where we have the players in which we hope to play at least a couple more matches, getting their ranking up along the way, and against a high quality opposition. That will be critical for us."</p>
        
            <p>Pragnell believes there are several reasons why the All Whites will be an attractive opponent for other teams.</p>
        
            <p>"Having players like Chris Wood and a high quality team is really exciting. The fact we've qualified early, we're the fifth team to qualify, Japan just snuck in there before us and the three hosts, but the fifth team to qualify also means that we'll be sought after. I think kiwis can look forward to an incredible run of fixtures into the World Cup."</p>

            <p>Pragnell hopes some of those games will be in Aotearoa, possibly later this year.</p>
        
            <p>"I would definitely like to have them at home," Pragnell said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've gone out and said we're we are chasing some fixtures at home in September this year. So that's an option.</p>
        
            <p>"It would fantastic as well to have a send off in 2026 for the team before they go to the World Cup. That being said, performance is paramount. We and Kiwis want this team to perform. So that'll (playing at home and having a send off) need to be weighed up carefully against acclimatisation in the in the North American environment and making sure we get the best preparation for the team."</p>
