            <p>The remains of a tramper who was missing in the Pureora Forest near Lake Taupō since March last year have been found.</p>
        
            <p>Judy Donovan, 79, had not been seen since 23 March, when she was separated from her group while bait-lining on the Rangitoto Station.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed on Tuesday that her remains had been found in the Pureora Forest.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Western Area Commander Inspector Will Loughrin said police were alerted to the discovery by a local hunter on Monday evening, 27 January.</p>
        
            <p>"Police can now confirm the remains are those of 79-year-old Judy Donovan," Loughrin said.</p>
        
            <p>On 23 March, Search and Rescue teams, including Land Search and Rescue, Police Search and Rescue, and dog units, were deployed to the area to search for Donovan, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The search for Judy was suspended in April last year after a large-scale, weeks-long search.</p>
        
            <p>"The choice to suspend a search is always a tough one. It involves the assessment of a number of factors, including consultation with survivability experts," Loughrin said.</p>
        
            <p>In May, police and a cadaver dog deployed to the area again, however, they were unable to find her, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said Donavan's family had been advised of the discovery, and were being offered support.</p>
        
            <p>"A post-mortem examination has been completed along with the formal identification process.</p>
        
            <p>"As the matter is with the coroner, we are unable to provide further comment."</p>
        
            <p>Donovan had been described as highly respected in the outdoor community, by the Outdoor Access Commission's board chairperson Don Cameron.</p>
        
            <p>She was a member of the Pukekohe Tramping Club and helped create the five summits trail in Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>Cameron said in 2022, the commission presented Donovan with an outdoor access champion award for her work in the region and she had been an active member of its national network of trailmakers.</p>
