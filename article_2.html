            <p>The Warriors have had the Cowboys' number in recent history, having edged them out twice at the start of last year's season in tight contests.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland to Townsville is the longest trip the Warriors have to make, but they are welcoming back plenty of key players returning from injury.</p>
        
            <p>The Cowboys are in an almost identical position on the ladder, also desperate to walk away from Saturday night's match with a much-needed victory.</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off is at 7.30pm.</p>
