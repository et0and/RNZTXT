            <p>New All Blacks coach Scott Robertson is urging New Zealand Rugby to keep an open mind over the eligibility rules surrounding overseas based players, playing for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson has got together with the All Blacks for a two- day camp in Auckland, the first time he and his new management team along with the players have met as a group.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-two players are there but missing are a number who headed off overseas to play following the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>In November All Blacks captain Sam Cane said New Zealand Rugby should reconsider not picking overseas-based players for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>However New Zealand Rugby responded by saying it won't be changing its policy, which requires players to be playing in New Zealand to be considered for the All Blacks, any time soon.</p>
        
            <p>Cane is among several of the sport's stars, including World Player of the Year Ardie Savea and South African flyer Cheslin Kolbe, who will play in Japan's League One this year, enticed by high salaries and a relatively compact rugby calendar.</p>
        
            <p>While Cane will not miss any internationals during his brief sabbatical, other All Blacks like Richie Mo'unga have signed multi-year deals in Japan that effectively rule them out of selection unless New Zealand's governing body changes its rules.</p>

            <p>Asked about the situation today, Robertson remains open to the idea of selected players based overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"I presented to the board, the CEOs of Super Rugby, the PUs (provincial unions).. I explained about keeping an open mind in that space, that's what I've asked for.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep an open mind where the game is at the moment, it's moving quite quickly, as we know.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of on and off field, players and decisions and contracting, and I want to be a step ahead of that. Decipher that."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson also said he wouldn't name an All Blacks captain until they get together for their first camp following Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks open their season against England in July.</p>
        
            <p>A Fresh Start</p>
        
            <p>Banishing the demons of 2023 was a key theme of the All Blacks first camp of the year, with players opting not to discuss the heartbreaking loss in the Rugby World Cup final.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said players arrived fit and firing for what will be a huge year ahead for the men in black, including blockbuster tests against Ireland and France.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the elephant in the room was ignored.</p>
        
            <p>"Not a mention of it, new year, fresh start," Robertson said of the 12-11 loss to the Springboks.</p>
        
            <p>Still seven months out from his first test against England at home, Robertson said he is carefully shaping his squad.</p>
        
            <p>"You'd hope for a bit of consistency, I do have a good feel of who will be in that squad but you're always open, the great thing about Super Rugby, someone always comes through you know, look at Cam Roigard as a prime example, someone can come into the picture pretty quickly."</p>
        
            <p>However, he doesn't shy away from the fact he has lost a heap of experience post World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's pretty clear around the locks. You lose a couple hundred tests and a couple of icons, but who's next? So you get excited about some great young athletes that are coming through. And, you know, obviously Nuggy (Aaron Smith) you cannot replace him for what he's done with his experience, but you can replace him with someone who is skilled and gifted with passion and we've got a few coming through."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether he would look to reward form over experience, Robertson said it would require a balance of both.</p>
        
            <p>"Class is permanent, but also you have got to pay well, you've got to you got to be playing good footy and be consistent."</p>
        
            <p>Though Robertson said he has a fairly good idea what his squad may look like when they open their 2024 campaign against England in July, on the subject of who will skipper the side, he remained coy.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll name the captain as we come into the series, when we name the squad. I've got to get in front of a few people, have conversations, catch a few eyes, get on the odd knee and have some chats."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said he will look to manage players workloads throughout the Super Rugby season.</p>
        
            <p>Players will still miss multiple matches, but there will not be a blanket rule regarding player rest.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson has collaborated with Super Rugby coaches as some may need more time on the sidelines due to factors such as prior injures.</p>
        
            <p>"We looked around the individual manager minutes and load management. We've changed the model and are going to do it individual load management for the athlete. We found five six games sometimes wasn't enough for players."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said he has asked Super Rugby coaches to look at their draws to help decide what's right for their leading players.</p>
