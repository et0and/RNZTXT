            <p>A beloved costume rental outfit in Wellington is shutting down this week, and many outfits with plenty of stories behind them are heading out the door.</p>
        
            <p>The Costume Cave started in 1991 on Wellington's Wakefield Street, and has long been a friend to filmmakers, theatre practitioners and partygoers in the capital and across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Director Kate Railton-Jacks told RNZ Nights the racks upon racks of bright wigs, sparkly boots, pirate blouses and period-accurate frocks had plenty of stories behind them.</p>
        
            <p>She said the business created a platform for people to "enjoy being in their own skin and to be living out their own dreams".</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of stories and memories in some of the items that people have hired, especially for film and theatre, or even just for parties, and seeing them go off and lead new lives, it's really quite exciting."</p>

            <p>Railton-Jacks said there were a number of factors behind the closure of the store, but the most overarching reason was the financial longevity and sustainability of the business.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, especially over the last few years, it's just become more and more difficult to remain open, and it's not the best of times for a costume hire. But we've done our best, it's time, and we're going to be leaving knowing we've done our best, with our heads held high."</p>
        
            <p>Many of the costumes were made by the store, while others were items donated by people that they turned into other costumes.</p>
        
            <p>But they all had to go, with the closing sale seeing costume shoppers able to buy outfits by the bag.</p>
        
            <p>"So come on it, fill them up and live your dreams," said Railton-Jacks.</p>
