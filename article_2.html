            <p>North Korea has fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells off its west coast, towards the South's Yeonpyeong island, Seoul's military has said.</p>
        
            <p>Immediately afterwards, South Korea issued an evacuation warning to civilians on the island - which is home to around 2,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>The South has condemned the move, calling it a "provocative act".</p>
        
            <p>In 2010, North Korean artillery fired scores of times on Yeonpyeong island, killing four people.</p>
        
            <p>The artillery shells fired on Friday did not enter South Korean territory as they all landed in the buffer zone between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>The latest incident comes as North Korea fully suspended a military deal with the South aimed at lowering tensions.</p>
        
            <p>The last time North Korea fired artillery shells into the sea was in December 2022, with nine such incidents happening in that year alone.</p>
