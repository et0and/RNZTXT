        <h2>Using Kupe to promote beer 'highly offensive' - tikanga expert</h2>
        <p>

            <p>A Māori cultural advisor is "gobsmacked" an Upper Hutt brewery has released a beer named Kupe as part of a series showcasing historical explorers.</p>
        
            <p>Te Aro Brewing Company, based in Upper Hutt's Brewtown, is rolling out six limited-release beers in its Age of Discovery series.</p>
        
            <p>The third beer - a New Zealand IPA called Kupe - had been released, and its design featured the bare-chested Polynesian navigator holding what appeared to be a taiaha.</p>

            <p>Other craft beers in the series had been named after explorers Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan.</p>
        
            <p>Tikanga expert Dr Karaitiana Taiuru (Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Toa) said he was shocked to see Te Aro Brewing had named a beer after Kupe.</p>
        
            <p>"I was gobsmacked this is actually happening in New Zealand in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Depicting and using a famous Māori and Pacifica ancestor such as Kupe for alcohol is highly offensive," Taiuru said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the social harms caused by alcohol to Māori."</p>

            <p>Not only that, Taiuru said a series of beers that celebrated colonial explorers who had taken so much from indigenous cultures was in poor taste - and not only to Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"Both [Columbus and Magellan] are colonial discovering captains who are responsible for huge numbers of deaths and the colonisation of indigenous peoples.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got those colonial, evil people being branded and promoted [alongside] a famous Māori and Pacifica ancestor and explorer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Taiuru also took issue with the beer label design, and the fact Te Aro Brewing Company first announced the beer with a Matariki-inspired social media post.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that Kupe has been portrayed on the image promotes colonial misinformation and [an idea of] racial superiority that Māori were either underfed or skinny. We do know that our Māori ancestors were quite large, muscular people - we had really good diets.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't just get lost coming to New Zealand, it was well-navigated using the stars.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case we didn't use Matariki to get to New Zealand, we use a number of other stars," Taiuru said.</p>
        
            <p>"It just appears to be a cheap way to commercialise on New Zealand's public holiday, and a very significant cultural day for Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Te Aro was not the first brewery to be called out for the inappropriate use of Māori kupu and imagery on beer products.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, Auckland's Birkenhead Brewing Company apologised for using images of Te Arawa ancestors Tūtānekai and Hinemoa on two of its beer labels.</p>
        
            <p>Several UK and European breweries had also been accused of cultural appropriation for using Māori images and kupu on their beer labels in 2017 and 2018, including a Belgian brewery for naming one of its offerings "Māori Tears", and a brewer in Bath for having a caricature of a Māori man riding a Kiwi while performing pukana on a beer label.</p>
        
            <p>Those indiscretions caused the Brewers Guild of New Zealand to produce a guide on the appropriate use of Māori culture in the brewing industry.</p>
        
            <p>Taiuru said there was no excuse for Te Aro Brewing falling short of the mark.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a significant amount of work in raising these sorts of issues, raising awareness, working with the brewing industry to prevent this from happening," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a quick Google search will show people what's offensive and what's not offensive with any sort of branding or marketing."</p>
        
            <p>The brewers needed to take action, and make serious changes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they need to consider whether promoting two colonial explorers actually is culturally appropriate. Is it insensitive to Native Americans and insensitive to the Filipino communities?</p>
        
            <p>"They should consult with local iwi about the appropriateness of using Kupe, fact check who Kupe is, fact check Matariki, and read the room, I guess."</p>
        
            <p>Te Aro Brewing has declined to speak on the record in response to RNZ's questions.</p>
