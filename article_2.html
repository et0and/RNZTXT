        <h2>$3m overspend frustrates Tasman councillors</h2>
        <p>
Maintaining Tasman's infrastructure this financial year is expected to cost $3 million more than was budgeted for, and the district's councillors aren't happy.

            <p>Maintaining Tasman's infrastructure this financial year is expected to cost $3 million more than was budgeted for, and the district's councillors aren't happy.</p>
        
            <p>Actual figures up until 31 December 2024 show an overspend of almost $3.3m dollars, largely driven by unexpected water supply and transportation repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasts to 30 June 2025 - the end of the Tasman District Council's financial year - show a slightly reduced maintenance overspend but will still be more than $3.1m over budget.</p>
        
            <p>Elected members were frustrated by the forecast deficit when presented with the figures on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Christeen Mackenzie wanted greater input into mitigating measures to offset the overspend.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just being presented with the fact that actually we set a budget, we have no choice, and we're going to be $3 million over," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"At no point actually â€¦ have we been given options and choices to be made."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Brent Maru agreed and said that he would have expected a report with mitigating options to be presented to them "well before" the council reached its current situation.</p>
        
            <p>Chief financial officer Mike Drummond said the council was "caught between a rock and a hard place" with its maintenance budgets.</p>
        
            <p>"There are works that are outside of our budget permitted, but we can't not deal with them - large water leaks, wastewater overflows, those sorts of things."</p>
        
            <p>Richard Kirby, the council's group manager of community infrastructure agreed.</p>
        
            <p>He highlighted that reactive maintenance works had trended upwards last year and, when setting its budgets last year, the council "took a punt" and set a tight budget, hoping the number of repairs dropped.</p>
        
            <p>"As it turns out, it hasn't dropped, it's probably increased."</p>
        
            <p>Both officers, however, assured councillors that future reports would provide mitigating options for councillors to consider.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tim King welcomed the suggested approach, and said the cost of the repairs was a "significant challenge".</p>
        
            <p>
Mayor Tim King said the maintenance budget had been deliberately kept "tight" to avoid rating residents unnecessarily.

            <p>"We need a better way of addressing it than just getting a report that said 'it is what it is'."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said a balance would need to be struck so the council didn't find itself having to approve spending to fix every water leak.</p>
        
            <p>King added that the council had deliberately set a "far tighter slash riskier" budget due to mounting cost pressures.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a conscious decision that we made, to not collect money off the ratepayer unless it was absolutely necessary."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Kit Maling warned his colleagues about the future challenges in keeping costs low as the cost of maintaining infrastructure continues to bite.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a very difficult year going forward. We either put the rates up or we do less."</p>
