        <h2>Heavy rain set for parts of North Island, weather watches in place</h2>
        <p>
A "very moist air mass" will see the upper North Island doused with rain, with flooding possible in places.

            <p>Heavy rain is on the way for parts of the North Island, with residents told to expect up to 40mm per hour in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said water could run off and pool on the hard, dry ground, meaning a chance of flooding in some places.</p>
        
            <p>The forecaster has issued a heavy rain watch for Northland (south of Dargaville) and Auckland (excluding Great Barrier Island).</p>
        
            <p>It would be in force from 12pm Sunday until 10am Monday, and possible downpours and intensities of 20-35 mm per hour could be expected, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>The amount of rain could approach warning criteria in some places, especially in the west.</p>
        
            <p>The culprit was a "very moist air mass" affecting the north of the North Island, the forecaster said.</p>
        
            <p>☔ This rain band has been moving northwards across the North Island overnight and is expected to slow down and fracture today. Rain has now arrived in Auckland, and there is a risk of heavy rain in localised spots across the region this afternoon and evening. Not looking so… pic.twitter.com/R61YteZF9H</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Plenty was next in the firing line, with a "shallow low" expected to form to the west and downpours expected. A heavy rain watch would be in place there from 9am Monday to 12am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Rain would be heaviest inland and, like in Auckland and Northland, the amount could approach warning criteria, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40mm of rain per hour could be expected.</p>
        
            <p>"Further heavy rain is possible on Tuesday and the period of this watch may be extended," MetService said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>How many dry days has your region had this summer? ☀️Most of the country experienced at least a month's worth of dry days this summer.Areas shaded in red () experienced over 50.Tasman/Nelson/Marlborough had the highest number of dry days (65 days, over 2 month's worth) ️ pic.twitter.com/4yNZaRllEO</p>
        
            <p>Locals were urged to keep up to date with the latest forecasts in case the situation changed.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, orange weather warnings were in place on the West Coast as rain pummelled the South Island, but those had since been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>The rain comes after at least a month's worth of dry days for much of the country over summer.</p>
        
            <p>It was particularly dry in the North Island - Whanganui had the most dry days of anywhere in New Zealand, with 64.1.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland had 53.8 dry days and Bay of Plenty had 59.6.</p>
        
            <p>"While this is welcome rain after such a dry February, these peak intensities coupled with hard, dry ground can cause water to run off and pool, meaning there is a chance of surface flooding in localised areas," MetService said.</p>
