        <h2>Treating birds 'blimmin' expensive', rescue centre at risk of closing says</h2>
        <p>
Volunteers Robert and Robyn Webb rescue and treat about 1300 birds every years for 35 years - but a lack of funding is putting their work at risk.

            <p>Volunteers Robert and Robyn Webb founded the Whangārei Native Bird Recovery Centre more than 30 years ago, rescuing and treating about 1300 birds every year.</p>
        
            <p>Their feathered patients included kiwi hit by cars, seabirds caught in fishing lines, starving penguins, orphaned ruru (moreporks) and rarities such as the elusive matuku-hūrepo (bittern).</p>
        
            <p>However, the Webbs said they might have to close the centre if they could not get more funding.</p>
        
            <p>"We're slowly dwindling into our funds that we've tried to save over the years. And things are getting so expensive now it's not even funny," Robert Webb said.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, for example, they brought a kiwi back to health after it had been hit by a car near Kerikeri - but the medication alone cost $400.</p>
        
            <p>Food was another major expense with seabirds gulping down large quantities of fresh fish and birds of prey needing fresh meat.</p>
        
            <p>Even peas and corn for birds such as native pigeons added up to $300 a month, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to give them the right stuff. You can't just give them rubbish, so it gets blimmin' expensive."</p>

            <p>At the same time, much of the centre's equipment was getting old and starting to break down.</p>
        
            <p>They had spent $1200 servicing a large, old upright freezer, used to store food and deceased birds, just to keep it running. A replacement would cost about $5000.</p>
        
            <p>The tyres on their vehicle, used for collecting and releasing birds, would have to be replaced before winter, which was likely to set them back another $1000.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's all those things that have been sneaking up on us. You forget about them, then all of a sudden they pop up and you think, 'Jeez, where are we going to get the funding for that from?'</p>
        
            <p>"Covid did a lot of harm too of course. We were getting lots of overseas visitors but that all petered out."</p>

            <p>Donations from visitors who did still call into the centre, next to Kiwi North in the Whangārei suburb of Maunu, were a "godsend", Webb said.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation's Whangārei office gave money when it could and the centre received some funding from Northland Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>Webb said the centre was careful with its money - a $100,000 donation about 20 years ago was only now close to being used up.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's not as though we're wasting money. We shouldn't have to run cap in hand to the public. It's neat getting the support - it does show us that what we're doing is appreciated by the public - but there should be funding available."</p>
        
            <p>He said $200,000 would keep the centre going for years to come, allow them to plan ahead, and take away the worry which niggled at the back of their minds.</p>
        
            <p>It would also allow them to resume the educational programme which used to tour Northland schools.</p>

            <p>Webb said neither he nor his wife had been paid in the 35 years they had worked at the centre.</p>
        
            <p>"To do that, you've either got to be totally dedicated or bloody stupid, one or the other. I'm not sure which one it is yet," he quipped.</p>

            <p>Closing down the centre would be "terrible", Webb said.</p>
        
            <p>"If a bird gets into trouble, who's going to repair it? We've had little baby moreporks at the centre, they would have died long ago if we hadn't intervened and got them. We got another bittern in the other night. They're highly endangered birds. Where's the support for us looking after them and supplying medication? We've even had to miss out getting X-rays done on some birds because we couldn't afford to have it done anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Despite being unpaid for almost 35 years, Webb said he and his wife remained dedicated to the cause.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always felt birds deserve our support. I reckon we've taken enough from them over the years. We've taken their habitat, we've ruined this, we've ruined that, all for the sake of progress, for the mighty dollar, I suppose. The birds get pushed further and further away as big subdivisions open up. Now it's time for us to put our hand up, and do what we can to look after them."</p>
