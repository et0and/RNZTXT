        <h2>Live: Hīkoi halts traffic ahead of Treaty Principles Bill reading</h2>
        <p>
Thousands are moving down the country as Parliament prepares to debate the bill for the first time. Audio

            <p>Thousands of people have stopped traffic in Hamilton this morning as the national hīkoi made its way through the city.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi is continuing even as the legislation they are protesting gets its first reading in Parliament on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the bill was "simplistic" but they would abide their agreement to see it to select committee.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour disagreed saying today was "fantastic".</p>
        
            <p>In Hamilton, the hīkoi grew in size swelling to more than 6000 as people made their way from FMG Stadium to the city's gardens.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi enters day four Thursday and will head off from Huntly, destined for Rotorua today, after it advanced through Auckland on Wednesday.</p>
