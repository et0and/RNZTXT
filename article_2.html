            <p>New Zealand high jumper Hamish Kerr has matched his personal best outdoor height to claim victory at a Diamond League track and field meet in Monaco.</p>
        
            <p>In an encouraging performance two weeks out from the Paris Olympics, Kerr was the only athlete to clear 2.33m, achieving the height on his third attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr was three centimetres short of his national record - set four months ago when he won gold at the world indoor championships in Glasgow.</p>
        
            <p>That 2.36m height remains the second-highest clearance of any athlete this year behind the 2.37m achieved by Italian Gianmarco Tamberi.</p>

            <p>Kerr, 27, started his sequence smartly, clearing 2.16m, 2.21m and 2.25m all on the first attempt.</p>
        
            <p>He failed twice at 2.28m but was successful on his third before a clean first-up attempt at 2.31m.</p>
        
            <p>In the final act of the evening, Kerr had one attempt at a world-leading height of 2.38m but fell short.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Zoe Hobbs was sixth in the women's 100 metres, with her time of 11.15 seconds just 0.02s outside her season's best.</p>
        
            <p>Running in lane one, Hobbs started well and finished 0.3s behind comfortable winner Julien Alfred of St Lucia.</p>

            <p>A third Paris-bound New Zealand athlete, Tori Peeters, was sixth out of seven women in the javelin field but well below her best.</p>
        
            <p>Peeters threw the same 55.80m distance in her first and fourth throws but fouled in her other three, going nowhere near her season-best 61.26m.</p>
        
            <p>Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi won with a best throw of 65.21m.</p>
