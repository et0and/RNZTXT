            <p>GNS Science says it has recorded more than 80 earthquakes in the Hawke's Bay and Te Tairāwhiti regions since they started this week.</p>
        
            <p>The swarm of shallow but frequent tremors began on Tuesday just before 6am.</p>
        
            <p>Seismic duty officer Elisabetta D'Anastasio said the tremors were recorded about 20 kilometres north-east of Wairoa in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The largest - a 4.5 magnitude quake - was felt by 240 people early on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>D'Anastasio said such swarms were "not uncommon" in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite common to have this cluster of increased seismicity in Wairoa and also the whole east coast."</p>
        
            <p>The quakes were on a known set of fault lines running from the steep hill country north-east of Wairoa to the east coast between Mahia and Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>The light shaking was likely to taper off in the next few days, and swarms were a good reminder to be prepared for a big quake, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The swarm we're observing right now so far doesn't indicate anything concerning but it's always a possibility that we can't predict."</p>
        
            <p>She said the swarm could be "very upsetting" for people who felt the tremors, but the best thing was to be prepared.</p>
        
            <p>"We live in a very active country in terms of tectonics and it's very good to use these swarms as reminders and know what to do in case of large events."</p>
