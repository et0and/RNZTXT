            <p>A teenager appears to be lucky to be alive although he remains stuck after climbing a power pylon in Christchurch on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to the scene on Ashtead Lane in the Sockburn area of the city about 7:40pm.</p>
        
            <p>Just Perfect Detailing owner Josh Phillips was nearby as emergency services arrived and believes the teenage boy climbed the pole before grabbing the live wires.</p>
        
            <p>"He's still holding on to it. I think they may have turned the power off because if he grounds again, he'll get another shock. It's pretty bad," Phillips told the New Zealand Herald.</p>
        
            <p>The boy is stuck very high, at least 25 metres above the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips said he was amazed the teenager was still alive, but was confused as to why he climbed the power pylon in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't understand it. It's a bit silly in my opinion, but he's lucky to be alive," Phillips said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's sweating, and he's got quite bad burns, there's red all over him. His shorts have disintegrated literally, and there were burned bits of fabric underneath the power line he climbed. His arms and legs are charred, and he's complaining he can't feel his legs and that he's cold."</p>
        
            <p>He said emergency services were gathered around the power pole, but he wasn't sure if the power had been turned off.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how they'll get him down, though, because he can't use his legs, and they're pretty charred," Phillips said.</p>
        
            <p>"He seems a little dazed, as you would, but he is communicating. Somehow, he's alive. I'm not sure how."</p>
        
            <p>A Hato Hone St John spokesperson said one ambulance, one rapid response unit and one manager were on the scene, though no patient information was available.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency shift manager said two appliances from Wigram and Ilam were at the scene, as well as a ladder vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were assisting ambulance staff. People were advised to avoid the area because roadblocks were in place.</p>
