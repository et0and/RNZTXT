        <p>
Significant vegetation and planting areas have been lost at two regional parks from fires started by fishers cooking their catch, a manager says.

            <p>Fishers are being urged to stop lighting fires to cook their catch at Auckland regional parks.</p>
        
            <p>It is illegal to light open fires or discharge fireworks in public areas in the region.</p>
        
            <p>But Auckland Council regional parks manager Scott De Silva said that was not stopping fishers camping overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"Most fires we've had at regional parks relate to unauthorised fires by fishers.</p>
        
            <p>"Our parks are great environments to catch fish and recreate, and a small action like that can have devastating consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"Please be cautious about how you're cooking your food and our preference is that you take it home."</p>
        
            <p>People were able to use gas barbeques at parks, De Silva said.</p>
        
            <p>They had lost significant vegetation and planting areas in recent years at Duder and Waitawa regional parks from fires started by fishers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Those places are hotspots that get really dry in the summer.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire risk there is always reasonably high."</p>
        
            <p>Bethells Beach, Long Bay, and Anawhata Beach recently had uncontrolled fires break out.</p>
        
            <p>De Silva urged people to be sensible and mindful of the conditions to avoid more vegetation fires this summer.</p>
        
            <p>"At regional parks we've had three [fires] since Christmas, that's reasonably high for us.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone needs to understand in January, February, and March, we typically get these dry periods which are a real risk for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>He said people were generally being compliant and not lighting fires, but they had dealt with multiple incidents of people setting of fireworks.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of them are good intentioned and trying to celebrate something, but it can result in uncontrolled fires taking off and destroying significant areas of habitat my rangers work hard to protect."</p>
        
            <p>He believed the recent Long Bay fire was started by young people playing around.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Fire and Emergency moved extended Auckland's restricted fire season until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>De Silva reminded people they would need to apply for a permit to light an outdoor fire anywhere in the region, even on private property.</p>
        
            <p>They welcomed wet weather foecast for next week, but the risk of fire spreading, particularly in forestry areas was still high, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While there is some rain forecast next week, this isn't going to be enough to counter the effects of the recent warm, dry weather."</p>
        
            <p>"We continually monitor the weather conditions throughout the region, and keep an eye on how quickly vegetation is drying out."</p>
