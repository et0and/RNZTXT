Only one of the six candidates from the council sacked by the government in 2021 has returned to council.

            <p>Initial results for the Tauranga City Council election show that Mahé Drysdale is likely to be the city's new mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale has nearly 5000 more votes than former mayor Greg Brownless who is in second place, followed by former deputy mayor Tina Salisbury, with singer-songwriter Ria Hall in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said preliminary results show voters have elected a team who can deliver a positive future for Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very pleased with the general gist of the council, I think there's some really good skills and really passionate people."</p>
        
            <p>Today's election was the first since the last council was sacked by the government in February 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Since that time the city has been run by government-appointed commissioners chaired by former National MP Anne Tolley and Tauranga locals were not able to participate in the last nationwide local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>Only one of the six candidates from the council sacked by the government in 2021 has returned to council.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Morris is currently the likely councillor for the Pāpāmoa ward. He was on Tauranga City Council from 2013 until the time it was dismissed.</p>
        
            <p>Voter turnout was the lowest it has been in over a decade with only 31.09 percent, or 33,998 Tauranga residents, taking their opportunity to vote, though this number is expected to go up slightly once once last minute and special votes have been counted.</p>
        
            <p>Voter turnout had been going up in the city before 2020, with 40.28 percent voting in 2019, 38.07 percent in 2016, and 37.78 percent in 2013.</p>

            <p>Drysdale said it was disappointing that a minority of people decided the future of Tauranga due to low voter turnout.</p>
        
            <p>He said there is much to do to engage voters.</p>
        
            <p>"This is something we've got to start doing better as politicians, is connecting with people, and making them aware how important these decisions are."</p>
        
            <p>He expected the voter turnout could reach 40 percent after last minute and special votes were counted.</p>
        
            <p>Unsuccessful candidate Ria Hall congratulated Drysdale and said running for council was an absolute privilege.</p>
        
            <p>"I will continue to advocate for the voices within our place that want to see change," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale does not currently live in Tauranga city but had said that if elected mayor he planned to move to Tauranga with his young family once the current school year is over.</p>
        
            <p>The final election result will be declared next week once last minute and special votes have been counted.</p>
        
            <p>The new council will be sworn-in on 2 August.</p>
