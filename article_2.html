            <p>A couple's wedding planned for Saturday had to be cancelled after a P&O cruise around New Zealand was completely changed during the actual voyage.</p>
        
            <p>P&O's cruise ship Pacific Adventure left Sydney last Monday for a 13-night "Kiwi Adventure" cruise.</p>
        
            <p>The ship was denied entry to New Zealand waters under the country's biohazard rules as its hull had not been cleaned and is now on its way to Tasmania instead.</p>
        
            <p>Sydneysiders Janine Sherriff and Kyle Risk had planned their dream wedding at Hobbiton - The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movie set - in the Waikato after receiving some cruise tickets for a trip to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Initially, the cruise started out as an early Christmas present from my parents. Along the way, we found out one of our stops was Hobbiton," Sherriff said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the idea to get married came about as they looked at the itinerary.</p>
        
            <p>"Kyle is a massive Lord of the Rings fan and when we found we were going there, we jokingly mentioned they do a wedding package." She said.</p>
        
            <p>"His face just absolutely lit up like it was the greatest thing ever discovered.</p>
        
            <p>"So we seriously started planning the wedding, we took the time off from work, we had our nearest and dearest friends and family all co-ordinate to be in New Zealand at this exact time.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan was to get off the boat, go straight to Hobbiton, have our wedding, then head straight back to the boat for the rest of the honeymoon."</p>
        
            <p>Risk said it has been a rollercoaster of emotions.</p>
        
            <p>"First off, I was furious. I saw Janine's face when we got the news. I was ready to explode," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I got a selfie from our family and friends at the site in Hobbiton we should have been on about 20 minutes before we had to turn around."</p>
        
            <p>Risk said the whole thing has been woeful.</p>
        
            <p>"It would have meant a lot as it was a beautiful setting. As long as we have each other," Risk said.</p>
        
            <p>"I adore this man, I was so excited, so ready to be able to officially call him my husband, I am heartbroken this day has been taken away from me." Sherriff said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we have to figure out what to do about our wedding, we have all this money down the drain."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, P&O Cruises Australia said guests were notified before embarking on their 13-day Kiwi Adventure voyage that there could be significant changes to the itinerary.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to New Zealand's strict biosecurity requirements, the ship left Sydney on Monday for hull cleaning off the Bay of Plenty, however the weather did not allow this to happen, so we apologise that the itinerary had to be amended."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to ABC News from sea, Sydneysider David Curtis, 60, said the ship was on its way to Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was very disappointing to miss all of the planned New Zealand ports advertised on the cruise - Bay of Islands, Auckland, Tauranga, Napier, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Fjordland National Park.</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said passengers onboard were frustrated - with no options given and some wanting to get back to Sydney.</p>

            <p>"The whole ship is in an uproar at the moment. We are forced to go to Tasmania," Curtis said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been basically kidnapped by P&O."</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said he had planned to meet with several friends in New Zealand following his 60th birthday celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>"This is horrendous, I have missed out on seeing friends based in New Zealand. They were not able to come to Australia for my birthday celebrations and I said that is OK - I am coming to see you." Mr Curtis said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it could have been worse, however, referencing the young couple who missed out on their wedding.</p>
        
            <p>"All of the guests had already got there and were waiting for them and they missed their wedding. So I got off fairly lucky. But again, still, everyone on the ship is devastated." Mr Curtis said.</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said passengers were only alerted to two ports being missed.</p>
        
            <p>"We got an email last Thursday [from P&O] that said the itinerary was being changed and that only two of the destinations would be missed - Auckland and Bay of Islands." Mr Curtis said.</p>
        
            <p>In their statement, P&O Cruises Australia said it hoped guests would enjoy their time in Hobart, Port Arthur and Eden on the NSW South Coast.</p>
        
            <p>"Guests have been offered additional compensation in light of this change to their itinerary."</p>
        
            <p>Curtis said very little had been offered.</p>
        
            <p>"They have offered us a percentage off a future ticket. I never plan to travel with these people again. They [P&O] knew about the hull needing attention before the cruise." Curtis said.</p>
        
            <p>He said an additional $300 was then offered when P&O cancelled the rest of the trip.</p>
        
            <p>"The money is to spend on the ship during the cruise. It is the most expensive hotel on the planet. The $300 would not even buy a carton of beer. It is $11 for a beer on this boat. We are trapped. This has been an absolute debacle."</p>
