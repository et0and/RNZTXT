            <p>Several batches of ham have been recalled, just before Christmas lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Source and Supply Food Co is recalling batches of Smith Meats branded cooked on bone hams (whole and half) as the product may be undercooked.</p>
        
            <p>The affected product was sold at Matamata Butchers and Starfood (Taup≈ç only).</p>
        
            <p>Some were sold to non-food companies.</p>
        
            <p>The affected batches have the best before dates of 26/01/24, 27/01/24, 28/01/24, 09/02/24, 14/02/24.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, New Zealand Food Safety deputy director general Vincent Arbuckle said as the product was undercooked it meant bacteria, including listeria, which could cause serious illness may be present.</p>
        
            <p>It was a health concern for everyone, but particularly for vulnerable groups, such as pregnant people and their unborn babies, newborns, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Affected product should not be eaten. It can be returned to the place of purchase for a refund. Should you be unable to do this, throw it out.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have consumed any of these products and are concerned for your health, contact your health professional, or call Healthline on 0800 611 116."</p>
        
            <p>Affected product is being removed from stores and has not been exported. There have been no reports of associated illness.</p>
        
            <p>"As is our usual practice, NZFS will be working with the company to understand how the problem occurred and prevent its recurrence," Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>Information about affected batches is on the New Zealand Food Safety food recalls page.</p>
