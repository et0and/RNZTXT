        <h2>Neighbours at war over barking Shih Tzu cross dogs</h2>

"If you're going to make a complaint, you have to have ground of your complaint. If somebody disturbs you for one reason, you can't use another reason to justify something."

            <p>A Napier woman claims neighbours have complained about her barking dogs because they have something against her.</p>
        
            <p>A pair of Shih Tzu crosses, Ruby and Simba, have been the subject of 17 complaints from three neighbours who said they were being driven mad by their barking and howling - sometimes for hours at a time.</p>
        
            <p>After three years of warnings from Napier City Council, the dogs' owner Nuzia Scaranci was issued with a compliance notice in September.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, there had been an additional six complaints from two different neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>The notice ordered Scaranci to try some remedies, like using anti-barking collars, keeping the dogs inside and away from distractions, and getting help from an animal trainer - but those had not been followed, council staff said.</p>
        
            <p>In front of a Napier City Council hearings committee on Friday, Scaranci fought that notice.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm asking is to give my dogs a chance," she said.</p>

            <p>The crux of Scaranci's argument was that the complaints were unfair because they came from neighbours she did not get on with.</p>
        
            <p>The barking was not an issue, she said - and she was backed up by her witness, a neighbour who lived directly below her, who said it had never been a problem.</p>
        
            <p>In November, Scaranci installed cameras which alerted her when they detected noise. She had not noticed anything excessive, and was happy to give council access to those cameras, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Scaranci also suggested neighbours may have actually been hearing sound from her portable speaker while she gardened.</p>

            <p>"I presume that the motivation of 17 complaints is not actually my dogs barking, but maybe me outside listening to podcasts."</p>
        
            <p>"I would appreciate it if you would stop laughing," she said to people in the public gallery, who she later identified as her neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>But the barking had been independently verified by animal control officer David Whyte, who visited a neighbouring property for about ten minutes and said a dog barked the whole time.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as we stepped out to a living area, which borders the neighbouring property, the dog - and we believe it's Simba - came running out and was alert barking, so it was reacting to our presence," he told the hearings committee.</p>
        
            <p>"Although we weren't in the vicinity of the property, just the noise of walking on the deck alerted the dog."</p>
        
            <p>The committee could either confirm, modify or cancel the compliance notice - but that decision was reserved and would be delivered in writing at a later date.</p>
