        <h2>Thousands of die-hard fans watch Shaun Johnson's last game</h2>
        <p>
The wet weather and tough result wasn't enough to deter fans leaving the stadium early as thousands stuck around for one last glimpse of Johnson.

            <p>They say there's no place like home and that rang true last night as 24,000 plus die hard Warriors fans crammed into the renamed "Shaun Johnson" stadium just to see the legend himself work his magic one last time.</p>
        
            <p>But it wasn't just Johnson fans were celebrating - it also marked the final time club stalwart Jazz Tevaga and front row sensation Addin Fonua-Blake would pull on the sacred Warriors jersey.</p>
        
            <p>The club did an amazing job of pre-game presentations paying tribute to the departing players with The Warriors forming a guard of honour as Johnson ran onto the field for the very last time with his wife and daughters by his side.</p>

            <p>Johnson himself admitted that the occasion had overwhelmed him - especially after dropping the ball on his first touch of the game. But that could also be put down to the pouring Auckland rain that belted the stadium throughout the night.</p>
        
            <p>In a game somewhat tarnished by more harsh calls from the NRL referees as head coach Webster touched on at the press conference, the Warriors fought hard in the first half with the crowd right behind them the whole way before letting the game slip away from them early in the second half.</p>

            <p>Wet weather and a tough result wasn't enough to deter fans though as they stuck around.</p>
        
            <p>Even when the game looked done and dusted with 10 minutes to go we didn't see the classic Mt Smart shuffle of people leaving early to beat the traffic, thousands stuck around for the post match presentations with an even more loyal contingent waiting next to the team's locker rooms for an hour just to get one last glimpse of Johnson in a Warriors jersey.</p>

            <p>Johnson told RNZ after the match that he didn't have any cold feet about his decision to retire at all saying that he "can't remember being this busted" seemingly looking forward to hanging up the boots and getting a well deserved rest.</p>
        
            <p>Surrounded by friends, family and an army of ex Warriors players Johnson seemed content with his final match praising fans for toughing it out in the rough conditions just to see him play one last time.</p>
