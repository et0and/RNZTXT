        <h2>Watch: Govt targets will need public sector to 'dig deeply' - PM</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister says progress on the targets will be reported publicly every quarter so Kiwis can "see what results they are getting from their taxes".
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has detailed his government's nine targets for the next six years.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon spoke to media at the weekly post-Cabinet press conference in the Beehive at 4pm on Monday, ahead of a busy week in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition is pushing on with its quarter-two action plan announced a week ago.</p>
        
            <p>Not contained in the plan was a range of changes to the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV), announced by Immigration Minister Erica Stanford on Sunday. They aimed to address "unsustainable" levels of migration and better protect incoming workers against exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>Cuts to the public sector are also continuing at pace.</p>
