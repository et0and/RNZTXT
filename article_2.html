            <p>Police are investigating the death of a 53-year-old Victorian woman who fell ill after consuming a drink at a retreat near Ballarat over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the woman was at Soul Barn, which describes itself as a creative wellbeing centre, in the regional town of Clunes when she fell ill late on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the Ringwood North woman died at the Fraser Street premises.</p>
        
            <p>Paramedics responded to reports of an incident in Clunes about 11.50pm Saturday and took two other people by ambulance to Ballarat Base Hospital, Ambulance Victoria said. They have since been discharged.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second death this month for the small town of Clunes. On 5 April, the body of 23-year-old local Hannah McGuire was discovered in a burnt-out car south of Ballarat.</p>
        
            <p>One resident, who declined to be named, said the latest death was "such a shock".</p>
        
            <p>"There's been so much tragedy," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Soul Barn bills itself as an alternative and holistic health service that hosts "inspiring workshops and retreats that will link you to your own passions, allow you to explore new skills and encourage you to express yourself authentically".</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, the business posted on Facebook that a planned "sound healing" workshop, due to be held that day, would be cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Detectives are investigating the circumstances and have urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers in Victoria.</p>
