            <p>Police have shot dead a 16-year-old boy who stabbed another man with a kitchen knife in Perth, saying the teenager was "radicalised" online.</p>
        
            <p>WA Police said they received an emergency call just after 10pm on Saturday from a teen saying he was going to commit acts of violence.</p>
        
            <p>A second triple-zero call was made a short time later after reports a man had been stabbed in the car park of a Bunnings store in Willetton, in Perth's southern suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Col Blanch said when they arrived, they found a 16-year-old armed with a large kitchen knife.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Blanch said the boy lunged at officers with the knife and was shot.</p>
        
            <p>He died a short time later in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The police commissioner and WA Premier Roger Cook held a press conference on Sunday morning and described the incident as "extremely confronting".</p>
        
            <p>They said the boy was "running around a car park, armed with a knife" before stabbing another man not known to him in the back, in what appeared to be a random attack.</p>
        
            <p>"They [WA police] exited their vehicle and were confronted with a male alone with a large kitchen knife," Commissioner Blanch said.</p>
        
            <p>"Two officers drew their tasers and one of the officers drew his firearm.</p>
        
            <p>"They challenged the male to put down the knife, which he did not."</p>
        
            <p>Blanch said the body-cam footage he watched showed the 16-year-old rushing one of the officers with the knife before both officers deployed their tasers.</p>
        
            <p>"Both of them didn't have the full desired effect, and the male continued to advance on the third officer with the firearm, who fired a single shot and fatally wounded the male."</p>
        
            <p>Cook said there were indications the boy had been radicalised online.</p>
        
            <p>"But I want to reassure the community at this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"Members of the WA Muslim community, who were concerned by his behaviour, contacted police prior to the incident and I thank them for their help."</p>
        
            <p>It was also said the boy's family was cooperating with police.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Blanch said the incident was not being labelled as a terrorist attack at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"It certainly has the hallmarks of one and the reason why I would declare it as a terrorist act going forward - it's about timing," Blanch said.</p>
        
            <p>"If I need extra capability, particularly from the Commonwealth, sometimes you'll see terrorist acts being claimed very early or declared very early.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe this is a person acting alone â€¦ I don't need additional capability at this time whilst it meets the criteria, or at least the definition.</p>
        
            <p>"That's something that we can work towards as we find out more information from the motivations behind this."</p>
        
            <p>Blanch said the teen was known to police and was part of a program designed to help individuals at risk of being radicalised.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a support program focused on individuals who expressed ideologies that were of concern to the community but "they may not be committing any crimes".</p>
        
            <p>"We are dealing with complex issues with this 16-year-old male - both mental health issues but also online radicalisation issues," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[The program is] for those that are exhibiting behaviours that might be religious or issues motivated.</p>
        
            <p>"This 16-year-old Caucasian male was part of that program."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese thanked the police for acting quickly to contain the incident.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had been briefed by the heads of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Federal Police.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia."</p>
