            <p>A Palmerston North man has been sentenced to 14 months home detention for beating two puppies so severely they were lame.</p>
        
            <p>The man was sentenced at Palmerston North District Court after he pleaded guilty to charges brought against him by the SPCA under the Animal Welfare Act.</p>
        
            <p>It followed an investigation by SPCA inspectors relating to an incident at a house where two approximately four-month-old puppies were beaten.</p>
        
            <p>"These puppies should have had better care from the person responsible for them, not made to cower in fear of being beaten," SPCA CEO Todd Westwood said.</p>
        
            <p>SPCA were alerted to the beating by a witness in July last year, who saw the man beating the two tan crossbreed puppies, known as King and Hunnie, in the front section of his property.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said she saw the puppies run out of the house and under a tree, where the man approached them holding what looked like half of a broken fence baton, approximately 70cm long.</p>

            <p>She told the SPCA, the man "thrashed around" with the baton and then hit King several times at "full force" - the puppy could be heard screaming.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said the man then went inside with King and she heard multiple thumps and a screaming puppy sound.</p>
        
            <p>Westwood said when SPCA went to the house King was lame on his right leg, had blood on his gums, a small cut on is tongue and dark patches on his feet.</p>
        
            <p>The other puppy, Hunnie, was also lame on her right hind leg and looked to have a bloodshot eye, Westwood said.</p>
        
            <p>Both puppies behaved fearfully around the man, shaking, and crouching low with tails between their legs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The puppies were taken into SPCA's possession for veterinarian examinations which revealed King had a broken thigh bone, a broken rib, a bruised lung, and a painful air pocket in his chest.</p>
        
            <p>"Hunnie had a fractured pelvis and suspected blunt trauma to her top right hindlimb."</p>
        
            <p>"The veterinarian concluded the injuries would have caused severe pain for the puppies both at the time of injury and after and were consistent with blunt force trauma. Fracture margins were found to be sharp, suggesting they were fresh."</p>
        
            <p>The man declined to be interviewed, the SPCA said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am grateful to the member of public for her brave intervention to get help for the puppies," Westwood said.</p>
        
            <p>"You heard their helpless screams and knew to take action, thank you."</p>
        
            <p>Along with 14 months home detention, the man was disqualified from owning dogs for seven years.</p>
