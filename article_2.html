            <p>The two New Zealand-based A-League sides are currently occupying the top two spots in the table.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams took down their Australian rivals in Sunday evening play.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix defeated Melbourne Victory and Auckland FC took out Macarthur on Sunday evening. Both victories saw the New Zealand sides go 1-0 for the win.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC was back in action after a long break thanks to a bye and international breaks.</p>
        
            <p>Guillermo May scored the goal but the outstanding defence made the difference, including Alex Paulsen's two saves and a commanding aerial performance.</p>

            <p>Kosta Barbarouses scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute for the Phoenix during his 96th A-League match.</p>
        
            <p>He told Sky Sport it was tough work in the afternoon heat, but the team had shown their adaptability.</p>
        
            <p>"We just get on with it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was hard work in the hot conditions but the team was very adaptable, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Victory had by far the better of the first half, with 10 shots at goal - though only two were on target - to the Phoenix's two, with Daniel Arzani looking particularly threatening for them.</p>
        
            <p>It was the Phoenix's sturdy defence that frustrated Melbourne in the second half in the Sydney heat and Barbarouses, one of the game's best players, made them ultimately pay.</p>
        
            <p>Next up, Auckland FC play Newcastle Jets on 30 Nov before playing the Phoenix the following weekend on 7 December.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ will be covering the match live.</p>
