            <p>The man who escaped Corrections custody at Waikato Hospital on Monday has been named by police.</p>
        
            <p>He is 48-year-old Damon Anderson.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they are still trying to locate Anderson, after being told of his escape at about 1.30pm on Monday of his escape from the hospital on Pembroke St while he was there for medical oversight.</p>
        
            <p>They said he was not considered an immediate risk to the public but they urged people not to approach him and report any sightings of him to police.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections earlier said Anderson was on remand at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.</p>
        
            <p>Springhill general manager Scott Walker said he was handcuffed and wearing a GPS monitor when he escaped.</p>
        
            <p>An immediate review into how the incident occurred would be carried out, Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>A Corrections spokesperson would not say how many staff were escorting the prisoner when he escaped, but said none were injured.</p>
        
            <p>A Health NZ spokesperson would not say whether any hospital staff or patients were injured or threatened.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time in a month that a prisoner has escaped from Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In the first incident in November, a prisoner escaped after allegedly assaulting two Corrections officers and carjacking a vehicle. He was later arrested.</p>
