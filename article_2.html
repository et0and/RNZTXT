            <p>A 21-year-old has been arrested after reports of a firearm being shot near a South Auckland early learning centre.</p>
        
            <p>A group of men were reported to be shooting "what appeared to be a rifle" at a property on Sturdee Road in Manurewa just before 11am on Monday, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The nearby early learning centre was put into lockdown as a precaution, and the Eagle helicopter was sent out, while police cordoned off the area.</p>
        
            <p>Police found an air rifle at the home where the man was arrested "without incident".</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Danny Meade said people should think twice before using an air gun in a populated area.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a timely reminder that when police receive reports of a firearm being used or seen, and staff respond, there is an expectation they are entering an armed confrontation and so staff will react accordingly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said laying charges was being considered.</p>
