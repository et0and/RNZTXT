        <h2>The pressure to work holidays when you don't have kids</h2>
        <p>
There is anecdotal evidence that "non-parents feel pressure to pick up the slack" - like working over Christmas - when those with caring responsibilities are unavailable, experts say.

            <p>Jessica hopes to have a baby one day but hasn't met the right person yet.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, the 32-year-old from Sydney/Gadigal Country says she's enjoying her childfree life, embracing the independence and other freedoms it brings.</p>
        
            <p>However, in the workplace, Jessica says that freedom works against her.</p>
        
            <p>"[Working] in health, it's an unwritten rule that you work one or the other, Christmas or New Year's, and get one off," the midwife, who asked we don't use her real name, says.</p>
        
            <p>"[I've] felt pressured to work Christmas so my colleagues [with kids] could be home with their young families to open gifts on Christmas morning."</p>
        
            <p>Melissa Wheeler is a senior lecturer in business administration at RMIT University with an interest in workplace flexibility, and gender roles in work and care.</p>
        
            <p>She says there is anecdotal evidence that "non-parents feel pressure to pick up the slack" when those with caring responsibilities are unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>"When I run or speak at career events for women's advancement, many non-mothers share their frustration with being asked to do more because they are presumed to have fewer responsibilities or commitments."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Wheeler says employees may find it difficult to push back on those expectations and experience feelings of resentment, and burnout, as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Jessica says her childfree status has also meant she's expected to do overtime.</p>
        
            <p>"I live alone and have a pet that I need to feed, and while it's not deemed as important as having children, I found the assumption to be frustrating because I'd be guilted into overtime and made to feel like my life and circumstances weren't as important.</p>
        
            <p>"It does make you feel less than, like you don't have real responsibilities unless you have children.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a colleague once comment that I had 'nobody to go home to'."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Wheeler says a report by PwC and Business in the Community showed that two-thirds of women without kids felt that they were expected by employers to work extra hours, compared to women with children.</p>
        
            <p>Lisa Heap is a senior researcher at the Centre for Future Work - Australia Institute, and says while she recognises there can be "perceived frustrations" from childfree and childless people in the workplace, "it's more likely to be the other way around".</p>
        
            <p>"The evidence I've come across both in research and anecdotal is that â€¦ parents or people who have caring responsibilities will find it difficult at work or be discriminated against."</p>
        
            <p>For example, a 2023 study from the University of South Australia's Centre for Workplace Excellence found new parents were being monitored, excluded and given fewer opportunities to advance their careers when they returned to work after parental leave.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Heap says frustrations from those without children may occur when "there isn't good on-the-ground open communications" and reasonable process within an organisation around leave and other entitlements.</p>
        
            <p>"The potential for there to be pressure or to be perceived conflict must be where there isn't a good culture and practice of sharing people's needs and trying to sort things out," Dr Heap says.</p>
        
            <p>Emma from Melbourne/Naarm works in banking and says her childfree status comes with the assumption she's happy to work anytime.</p>
        
            <p>"If you put in for leave that overlaps with school holidays [for example], you'll be questioned about that," the 34-year-old, who asked we don't use her surname, says.</p>
        
            <p>"Or they will say things like, 'You should wait, it will be better for you when it's quiet', not really considering your personal need to travel or take a break at that time."</p>
        
            <p>For people who are childless not by choice, there can be an "extra sting in the tail", explains Sarah Roberts.</p>
        
            <p>She's a childlessness grief counsellor and lived experience advocate based in Brisbane/Meanjin.</p>
        
            <p>"I've certainly heard from women they've been told [things like] 'I'm not allocating Christmas leave until I've heard from parents in the company'," Roberts says.</p>
        
            <p>She says the grief of childlessness can be exacerbated when someone feels their parental circumstance is used against them.</p>
        
            <p>"Often women are told Christmas is for kids, so the parents are prioritised."</p>
        
            <p>It is against the law for employers in Australia to discriminate against a person because of their family or caring responsibilities. In some states, those anti-discrimination laws also make it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of "parental status", explains Dr Heap.</p>
        
            <p>"Where parental status is stipulated, that gives an option to consider not being a parent as a ground for anti-discrimination law."</p>
        
            <p>For example, Dr Heap says if you did not get a job as a director of a childcare centre because you weren't a parent, even though you were qualified for the role, "it's worthwhile having a look at whether that is covered in the law where you are".</p>
        
            <p>"But it's more common across federal anti-discrimination and workplace relations law for the focus to be on addressing discrimination against those with family and caring responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>"And the reason these laws are framed that way is because the evidence shows people are being discriminated against when they do have those family and caring responsibilities."</p>
        
            <p>According to the Fair Work Ombudsman, people who meet certain criteria, including having parenting responsibilities, being aged 55 or older, or experiencing family and domestic violence, are entitled to request flexible work arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Wheeler says while legally speaking, not being eligible doesn't equate to discrimination, if an employer puts extra pressure on a non-parent to work outside their hours, or in some cases on public holidays, "unfair treatment is present".</p>
        
            <p>Jessica says she has become more confident in pushing back against such expectations, like working Christmas Day, throughout her career.</p>
        
            <p>"I would often say I already had commitments or plans and try to find a compromise like offering to pick up a shift that suited my schedule."</p>
