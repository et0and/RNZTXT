            <p>More than 70 flood alerts remained active across New South Wales on Friday night after intense rainfall saturated the state, with the worst to come overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The expected deluge until Saturday morning in parts of Sydney and the Illawarra, Blue Mountains and Hunter, could see severe flash flooding and rapid river rises - including up to 220 millimetres in six hours on the Illawarra Escarpment.</p>
        
            <p>In Sydney more than 160mm of rain had fallen since 9am on Thursday, its heaviest in four years.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Mid North Coast had been the hardest hit, with more than 132mm pummelling Port Macquarie and 125mm at Taree since 9am on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment we have seen widespread rain right across the eastern parts of New South Wales," Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) senior meteorologist Gabrielle Woodhouse said.</p>
        
            <p>"But currently, though, we're seeing a lot more focus of the rainfall across parts of the Mid North Coast and Hunter, where there is a severe thunderstorm warning in place.</p>
        
            <p>"We're expecting the rainfall to intensify overnight and start to shift further south."</p>
        
            <p>Late Friday evening, residents in the eastern parts of Chipping Norton in Sydney's south-west were given until midnight to evacuate ahead of route closures.</p>
        
            <p>For those unable to stay with family and friends, an evacuation centre had been set up at Club Liverpool on George Street, Liverpool.</p>
        
            <p>Other centres have also opened up at Bankstown Sports Club and Richmond Club at Richmond in preparation for evolving conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Just after 9pm, prepare to evacuate orders were placed on parts of Sackville North, near Richmond, with residents told to stay alert for messaging from the NSW State Emergency Service (SES).</p>
        
            <p>The earlier weather damage to equipment at Redfern train station was still impacting the rail network by Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Transport for NSW said while trains were running on all lines, there were major delays and gaps in service.</p>
        
            <p>Buses were replacing trains between Campbelltown and Macarthur, and between Riverstone and Richmond.</p>

            <p>A number of roads remained closed due to flooding, including the Wakehurst Parkway between North Narrabeen and Oxford Falls. Conditions had also been impacted at the Pacific Highway at Pymble, Centenary Drive at Strathfield, Pittwater Road at North Manly and Euston Road at St Peters.</p>
        
            <p>SES chief superintendent Dallas Burnes said the expected heavier rainfalls, and strong winds, were a concern.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still looking at falls of another 100mm in the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, some central west areas and particularly in the Illawarra," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are still forecast falls of up to 200mm for the 12 to 24 hours from now. So we're watching those very carefully."</p>
        
            <p>The flow on to rivers would be a priority, according to chief superintendent Burnes, with SES teams placed at key locations.</p>
        
            <p>By 2.30pm on Friday, the SES said it had more than 830 volunteers responding to calls for help, with the number reaching to more than 1,200.</p>
        
            <p>Chief superintendent Burnes said the majority of call-outs were to fix leaking roofs and assist with fallen trees.</p>
        
            <p>"We've also had a number of flood rescues but not many, only half a dozen.</p>
        
            <p>"So if people can and are able to check their gutters, and particularly storm water drains to make sure they're clear to get that water away from their properties, that'd be very helpful."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Parramatta River overflowed, with the council advising that access would be restricted through the riverside area of the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>Since 9am, the area had received 46mm of rain.</p>
        
            <p>Affected areas include the pedestrian footbridges across the river, as well as the Parramatta Ferry Wharf. Buses are replacing ferries between the wharf and Rydalmere.</p>
        
            <p>Here's what to expect across Australia over the weekend, including the rain, flooding and storms in the east & the hot and dry weather in #WA.Video current as of 2:30 pm AEDT, Friday 5 April 2024. Latest: https://t.co/4W35o8iFmh pic.twitter.com/NCMLt0hIbX</p>
        
            <p>On Friday afternoon, residents in the Hawkesbury-Nepean were warned Windsor and Putty Road were at risk of moderate flooding overnight, with major flooding possible at Menangle and North Richmond from Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The BOM also advised that minor flooding was likely along the Hawkesbury, Nepean and Colo Rivers.</p>
        
            <p>Since 9am on Thursday, the catchment area had received 150mm of rain.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the community having experienced a number of similar events in previous years, Hawkesbury City Mayor Sarah McMahon said people were still really anxious.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we don't know how the next couple of days are going to play out," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We certainly have the prediction from the BOM and the SES warning, but you never know how high it [the catchment] is going to go. So we're sort of just waiting to see what happens."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was pleasing to see the SES issuing alerts to the community before people were going to bed, so they could be on alert.</p>
        
            <p>"Be prepared, that's something that we have all learned after the last floods â€¦ be informed through official forms of information, and keep your eye on what's happening."</p>
        
            <p>Another area of concern for authorities is Warragamba Dam, which is currently at 96 per cent capacity and could spill if the forecast eventuates.</p>
        
            <p>In the state's central west six people, including two children were hospitalised following a crash due to the wet weather in Mudgee.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the two-vehicle crash on the Castlereagh Highway, about 2pm on Friday, where a ute and four-wheel drive had collided.</p>
        
            <p>The male passenger in the ute, believed to be in his 60s, was flown to hospital with serious injuries, while the male driver, 55 was taken to Mudgee Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the four-wheel drive, a 34-year-old man, was also flown to hospital with serious injuries, while his 32-year-old female passenger was flown to hospital with critical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Two children in the back-seat, aged two and six, sustained minor injuries and taken to The Children's Hospital at Westmead for observation.</p>
        
            <p>A crime scene had been established and an investigation was underway.</p>
        
            <p>The band of torrential rain was moving south and would clear from Sydney early on Saturday morning, clear the Illawarra by late morning and clear from the South Coast by the evening.</p>
