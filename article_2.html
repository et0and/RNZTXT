            <p>After a break for international fixtures, the A-League is back with the Unite Round from Sydney, bringing together all A-League fans in their general disdain for the entire idea.</p>
        
            <p>However, the annual visit to New South Wales has dealt up a treat for New Zealand football fans, with the Wellington Phoenix and Auckland FC going back-to-back on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Here's everything you need to know ahead of the weekend fixtures:</p>
        
            <p>For the Phoenix, this round brings an opportunity to exorcise some demons. They face the side that last season burned to ashes their hopes of a first piece of silverware.</p>
        
            <p>This is a very different Phoenix side, however, and the same goes for the Victory - who also have a new manager in Patrick Kisnorbo. He has led his side to the top of the A-League pile early on, so this will be a tough proposition for Giancarlo Italiano's men.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix face a potential full-back dilemma, with Tim Payne still recovering from an injury that saw him skip international duty and Sam Sutton struggling with a knock. Lukas Kelly-Heald is also injured, so the 'Nix may need to get creative in the wide defensive positions. Wing-backs seem likely, with Matthew Sheridan and Nathan Walker the most likely candidates.</p>
        
            <p>Fin Roa Conchie is absent again but Kosta Barbarouses has shaken off a niggle and should start against his former team.</p>

            <p>Tough one to call, this. The Phoenix demonstrated their danger in their last outing, thrashing reigning champs Central Coast 3-0. However, that weakness at full-back could easily be exposed by the in-form Rene Piscopo and Nishan Velupillay.</p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix might have to wait a little bit longer for redemption: Melbourne Victory 2-1 Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>"That game for me is long gone. That was last year's team, that was [Tony] Popovic's team and it's a completely different feel this season. This is Patty's [Patrick Kisnorbo's] team now - he has different ideas and they're playing in a different way.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be good to play them, I think they're deservedly at the top of the table and have been good in all of their games so far." - Phoenix head coach Giancarlo Italiano.</p>
        
            <p>This will be Auckland's first trip across the Tasman and their first game since the derby day triumph on 2 November. That was followed by a bye week and the international break, meaning plenty of the players have had a chance for some rest and relaxation.</p>
        
            <p>Others had exceptional international breaks, with Liam Gillion making his All Whites debut and Francis de Vries scoring his first goal for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>That time off is reflected in the team news, with no new major injury concerns. All Whites striker Max Mata is back among the fold, with hopes of forcing his way into the starting XI. Jesse Randall drops out with a minor thigh injury, but Steve Corica can still name his best side.</p>

            <p>Auckland's brilliant start has taken many by surprise and it is very tempting to suggest the bubble must burst at some point.</p>
        
            <p>The Bulls are clearly struggling for consistency but can be devastating when in flying form. In saying that, Auckland's defence is solid, and still yet to concede. While that surely has to come to an end sooner rather than later, that unbeaten run can likely remain: Macarthur 1-1 Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"Three games in, we've done exceptionally well. We've won all three, we've kept three clean sheets, so now it's about building on that. It doesn't matter whether we have a couple of weeks off - we want to keep moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a perfect start really so I can't complain I just want it to continue." - Auckland head coach Steve Corica.</p>
