            <p>"It's been a long-held ambition for New Zealand Rugby and part of our wider strategy to increase the visibility and understanding of rugby in North America and to build our brand presence ahead of the men's and women's Rugby World Cups in 2031 and 2033 respectively," said NZ Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson.</p>
        
            <p>In August the All Blacks will begin the defence of their Rugby Championship title with two tests against Argentina - one in Wellington on 10 August and a week later in Auckland.</p>
