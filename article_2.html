        <h2>Live: Residents urged to evacuate as Bridge Hill blaze still out of control</h2>
        <p>
Incident Commander Brian Keown says it is possible the 535ha blaze will reach Castle Hill village overnight.

            <p>Residents of Canterbury's Castle Hill village have been encouraged to evacuate as a 535-hectare scrub fire at Bridge Hill continues to burn out of control.</p>
        
            <p>Incident Commander Brian Keown says it is possible, but not probable the blaze will reach the village overnight.</p>
        
            <p>While not an evacuation order, Keown says it is easier to leave now than in the middle of the night.</p>
        
            <p>Nine helicopters, three planes, and 12 trucks, tankers and support vehicles are among the resources being thrown at the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Three school camps staying about a kilometre from the fireground have been evacuated as a precaution, as has Flock Hill Lodge.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 73 is closed between Castle Hill and Arthur's Pass village.</p>
