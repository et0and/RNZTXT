            <p>Two people have been arrested after a kidnapping in Auckland's North Shore on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, police had been on the hunt for three people they believed to be involved in forcing a woman into a car from a house in the suburb of Beach Haven just before 7.30pm on Tuesday. She was later found injured in Greenhithe.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Callum McNeill said two people were taken into custody after being found in central Auckland on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation has been progressing throughout the day, and we have been speaking with the pair late this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man from Dairy Flat is facing multiple charges, including kidnapping, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, commission of a crime using a firearm and burglary with a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>A 28-year-old woman from Bayview has been arrested in relation with outstanding warrants, and also faces a charge of failing to carry out obligations relating to a computer search.</p>
        
            <p>McNeill said further arrests could not be ruled out.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation will continue, and while matters are before the court, what I can say is that we do not believe this was a random incident."</p>
        
            <p>The pair will be appearing in the North Shore District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the victim was recovering from her injuries in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"She will have a long road to recovery, and we will be looking to speak further with her around what has occurred."</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked those who have helped in their investigation, and they said staff would continue to be present in the Beach Haven area and provide reassurances to community.</p>
