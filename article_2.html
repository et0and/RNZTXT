            <p>Wellington's mayor says ministers are "right to be concerned from what they've seen" after threats of possible government intervention, but denies it is a shambles.</p>
        
            <p>This week, Local Government Minister Simeon Brown told media he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him, and thresholds to intervene, in the city council.</p>
        
            <p>It came after the council voted on Thursday to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The sale was part of the council's long-term plan, with money raised from it set to be used to establish an investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>An urgent private meeting will be held between the mayor, councillors and mana whenua at 2:30pm on Wednesday to discuss the long-term plan amendment process.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau told Midday Report she disagreed with comments made by Finance Minister Nicola Willis that the council was a shambles.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't call it a shambles, and of course there is pressure and they are right to be concerned from what they've seen."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said she would meet with Brown on Thursday, and was confident the council could come up with a plan that gave the government confidence.</p>
        
            <p>She said that she had no plans to resign, and the council had not met the bar for government intervention.</p>
        
            <p>"We would need to be failing our statutory obligations as a local authority - we have not met that threshold."</p>
        
            <p>She said Wednesday's meeting was not a crisis meeting. Whanau told Midday Report these kinds of meetings were fairly standard procedure, and Wellingtonians should not worry about the council's issues.</p>
        
            <p>"These things happen - again, we are focused on delivering a successful long-term plan that also addresses our insurance issue, and we are going to do that together as a team this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>She was confident the councillors would be able to get an amended long-term plan over the line.</p>
