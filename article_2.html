        <h2>'Where are the police?' Serial heckler interupts apology to survivors</h2>
        <p>
Security guards pulled the man to the door of the House before he gave up his resistance and walked out.
</p>
        
            <p>A fringe political candidate and serial heckler has been removed from Parliament after interrupting the prime minister's official apology to those abused while in state care.</p>
        
            <p>Karl Mokaraka, who ran for Destiny Church's Vision NZ party last year, stood up in the public gallery and loudly declared his attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"We need Jesus back in this Parliament," he shouted. "How can we heal without Jesus Christ back in this Parliament?"</p>
        
            <p>Mokaraka was also abused in state care, telling Pacific Media Network in August of his support for fellow survivor William Wilson - who he had attended high school with.</p>
        
            <p>"Hurt people hurt people, and that's what happened to William," he said, acknolwedging his part in bullying at Wesley College.</p>

            <p>His heckling in Parliament was met by disapproval from other survivors and MPs in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's Speaker Gerry Brownlee repeatedly called for security to intervene - "please remove the gentleman from the gallery" - and appeared frustrated at how long it took for them to respond.</p>
        
            <p>"Where are the police, and why aren't they here?" Brownlee said. "On your way."</p>
        
            <p>At least four security guards pulled Mokaraka toward the door before he gave up his resistance and walked out.</p>
        
            <p>Follow RNZ's live updates on the national apology:</p>
        
            <p>In his final words, he called on Te Pāti Māori to "stop the division"; co-leader Debbie Ngarewa Packer responded, "haere atu", or leave.</p>
        
            <p>After Mokaraka's ejection, Brownlee expressed his disappointment that the survivors' day had begun with "such an unacceptable interruption".</p>
        
            <p>"We know that you come here with good will, having put up with so much in your lives, and how important today is."</p>
        
            <p>Mokaraka stood for Vision NZ in the Panmure-Ōtāhuhu electorate. It was won by Labour's Jenny Salesa, Mokaraka's 387 votes falling far short of her more than 15,000 and putting him at second-to-last of the six candidates.</p>
        
            <p>He gained national attention, and National's attention, after heckling leader Christopher Luxon from behind a fence during the election campaign.</p>
        
            <p>He had earlier followed Chris Hipkins around at the Ōtara markets, and later interrupted ACT's campaign launch in Auckland - sneaking into the event wearing a false moustache.</p>
