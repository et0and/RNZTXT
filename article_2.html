            <p>Auckland Transport is delaying part of its plan to expand bus lanes on Karangahape Road.</p>
        
            <p>Its plan was to scrap all car parks on the iconic entertainment and hospitality strip, starting next week, to make way for more public transport.</p>
        
            <p>However, following push back from businesses and mayor Wayne Brown, the full plan will not go ahead for a few months.</p>

            <p>Brown told Checkpoint Auckland Transport "got a bit ahead of themselves".</p>
        
            <p>"They've backed away from most of what they had in mind, and put (the bus lanes) off to have a better discussion."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said parking on Karangahape Rd would still be scrapped this weekend, but would not become full bus lanes until February.</p>
        
            <p>It said until then, they would operate as a loading zone for shuttles, taxis, and buses between 10am and 3pm and as a bus lane outside of this.</p>
        
            <p>From February, bus lanes will be implemented from 7am-7pm on the north side, but were not planned for the south side.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the new Western Express connecting West and North West Auckland to the city, buses will run the route every 10 minutes from Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>AT said the removal of car parks would mean more consistent bus trip times and encourage more people on to public transport.</p>
        
            <p>But some Karangahape Rd business owners told Checkpoint the change was a shock and they relied heavily on "park and pop in" customers</p>
        
            <p>Karangahape Rd Business Association chairperson Muy Chhour said the proposed removal of parking was "simply not acceptable".</p>
        
            <p>"In order for businesses to survive, you need customers to be able to access your business. Loading zones are a crucial part of doing business - however that's probably only 5 percent of your business activity.</p>
        
            <p>"What AT is doing is giving a tiny piece of a crumb and expecting the business to survive. It makes no sense whatsoever."</p>
        
            <p>Karangahape Rd had "so many wonderful businesses" who had been operating for a very long time.</p>
        
            <p>"This is going to destroy our precinct. It's crazy," she said.</p>
