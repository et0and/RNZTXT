            <p>Wellington Water is recommending the city's council spend $2.5 billion over a decade to fix its leaky water network.</p>
        
            <p>That's the maximum that would be needed, with spending starting lower and increasing in later years.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water chief Tonia Haskell told Morning Report it was up to Wellington City Council to decide how much it could actually afford to spend.</p>
        
            <p>One councillor has suggested the council could cut staff to free up funds, while the mayor said she was open to putting other plans on hold to find the money.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water had said it would cost $1b a year for 10 years to fix the regions water woes.</p>
        
            <p>But Haskell said there was a limit on what could be delivered.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was restrained by contractor availability, staff capacity, and an acceptable level of disruption in the city.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to dig up roads, we have to interrupt private properties, there's a maximum amount that the city would be able to sustain."</p>
        
            <p>The $2.5b was how much Wellington Water believed it could deliver in the city over the next 10 years, Haskell said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to build capability ... it does take awhile to do that, as I say we have been doing that steadily for the past few years."</p>
        
            <p>A review into the efficiency of the agency is due out later this week.</p>
        
            <p>Despite some reports it will be critical of Wellington Water, Haskell said she welcomed its release.</p>
        
            <p>"We can always learn and do things better.</p>
        
            <p>"There does need to be investment in our systems and our processes and people, which is also lacking, to kick us up a notch."</p>
        
            <p>Upper Hutt Mayor, Wayne Guppy, told Morning Report he had "major concerns" about Wellington Water's ability to get things done.</p>
        
            <p>He said his council had been asked for more money, but wanted an assurance the work would happen.</p>

            <p>"Over the last 5 years, we've had more than about $18m of carry-overs, unspent by Wellington Water, so the history is not great."</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged capacity was an issue, but didn't think disruption should be a factor.</p>
        
            <p>"People want things fixed."</p>
        
            <p>Residents would rather traffic disruption than putting up with water restrictions while watching it flow down the gutter, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Guppy met Local Government Minister Simeon Brown on Monday in what he described as a "straight forward" meeting.</p>
        
            <p>He said they discussed the issues facing Wellington and the county, and possible models for change.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone in the country that thinks Government is going to turn up with a cheque book and pay the bills, that is not going to happen."</p>
        
            <p>Former Wellington mayor Dame Kerry Prendegast told Morning Report councillors faced some difficult decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"Local government is absolutely about potable water and sewerage, that is the absolute thing you have to do when you're elected."</p>
        
            <p>But Prendegast, who has been a champion of the Town Hall earthquake strengthening, said it should be able to continue.</p>
        
            <p>It would be more expensive to halt the restoration than to complete it, she said of the much delayed and over-budget project.</p>
        
            <p>Despite Mayor Tory Whanau saying all options were on the table, Prendegast said the Town Hall was a significant asset and its strengthening should be finished despite the water crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Other "vanity projects", such as the cycleways, could be put on hold, she said.</p>
