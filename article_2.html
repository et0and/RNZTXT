            <p>A witness says she remembers a man accused of multiple rapes telling her to stop crying after she woke to find him on top of her.</p>
        
            <p>John Hope Muchirahondo is facing 22 charges of sexual violation by rape, and nine of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection and one of not providing access to a cell phone.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court at Christchurch today heard from the first witness.</p>
        
            <p>She described a night out she had in late February 2021 with a friend.</p>
        
            <p>They went to two bars in central Christchurch at about 1am, after drinking at her sister's flat.</p>
        
            <p>At the first bar, they went to get a drink, and Muchirahondo offered to get them one.</p>
        
            <p>They moved onto a second bar and when the witness went to leave with her friend, Muchirahondo said they lived close together and should share a ride back to save money.</p>
        
            <p>On the way, the witness is said to have begun losing consciousness and vomited when the car stopped.</p>
        
            <p>She told the court her next memory was waking to find Muchirahondo on top of her on a couch.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was confused and disorientated, told him to get off her and that she wanted to leave.</p>
        
            <p>She began crying while he walked her home and said Muchirahondo asked why she was crying and told her to stop, the witness said.</p>
        
            <p>She was defiant in the dock when questioned by Defence Counsel, Anselm Williams.</p>
        
            <p>She said while her memory was not complete because the experience happened three years ago when she was a teenager, and she had been very drunk, she remembered that she had been raped.</p>
        
            <p>She became tearful at several points discussing the details of the night, but said she was sure Muchirahondo was responsible.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday the court heard a 111 phone call the witness made once she got home the next morning.</p>
        
            <p>She was sobbing and in places struggled to speak to the operator.</p>
        
            <p>Today the court watched CCTV footage of the night and heard from two other witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>One was the friend the first witness was out with.</p>
        
            <p>She told the court she had been checking on the first witness once they managed to carry her inside of Muchirahondo's house after getting out of the car.</p>
        
            <p>She checked on her repeatedly until she herself passed out, the friend said.</p>
        
            <p>Muchirahondo woke her the next morning asking her to leave immediately.</p>
        
            <p>The first witness was gone, which the friend said she thought was odd.</p>
        
            <p>She asked to be dropped back to her car at the first witness' house.</p>
        
            <p>When Muchirahondo saw a police car parked outside, she said he became shaky and nervous, and said the police were trouble.</p>
        
            <p>He then refused to drop her off, instead taking her back to his house and telling her to walk, the friend said.</p>
        
            <p>The trial is set down for eight weeks before Justice Lisa Preston and a 12-person jury.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown's witnesses were scheduled to continue giving evidence tomorrow.</p>
