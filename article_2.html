            <p>Labour has hit back at the government's accusations its health reforms have been an expensive botch-up with a blow out in middle management and an overspend of $130 million a month.</p>
        
            <p>Health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall said it's "absolutely untrue."</p>
        
            <p>"I don't accept what the government said [yesterday] - that there have been a growth in middle management over five years - as a cause for one year's budget trouble under their watch.</p>
        
            <p>"A blowout in the financial year that they are responsible for is their responsibility."</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government announced yesterday it would be replacing the board of Health New Zealand with a commissioner, who will be tasked with finding savings and strengthening the agency's governance.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said without urgent action, Health New Zealand would run an estimated deficit of $1.4 billion by the end of 2024-25.</p>
        
            <p>Reti blamed the previous government, saying the "botched health reforms have created significant financial challenges at Health NZ".</p>
        
            <p>"The issues at Health NZ stem from the previous government's mismanaged health reforms, which resulted in an overly centralised operating model, limited oversight of financial and non-financial performance, and fragmented administrative data systems which were unable to identify risks until it was too late."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the government's framing of the situation at Health NZ was a misleading, brazen and desperate attempt to pin responsibility for its own decisions on the previous Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>Former Health Minister Verrall added that Labour made those reforms partly to make the system more efficient.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew that duplicating management across 20 DHBs was wasteful," said Verrall, "So for this government to claim that that is the basis for their current actions is untrue."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister said Health New Zealand was not meeting the outcomes against the targets the government has set, was not managing its budget, and had no clear organisational model.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon said no level of funding can fix the failures of governance and financial management at the health agency, but the failures "do require an urgent and significant intervention".</p>
        
            <p>He pointed to the government having invested an additional $16.3b into the health system from the next three Budgets.</p>
