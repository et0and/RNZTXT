            <p>Auckland police have arrested a 34-year-old woman over the fire at City Garden Lodge in Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze on 7 April extensively damaged the boarding house on St Georges Bay Road in central Auckland, with 10 of its guests evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>The building had failed its Building Warrant of Fitness twice last year over several areas of non-compliance, including a problematic external fire escape.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Chris Allan said Auckland City Criminal Investigation Branch arrested a 34-year-old woman on Friday afternoon in relation to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>She had been charged with arson and was expected to appear in the Auckland District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank the members of the public who assisted with our enquiries and contributed to this result."</p>
        
            <p>Seema Chatly, who owns City Garden Lodge with her husband Suresh, said they were glad to hear an arrest had been made.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very relieved that this happened. We are very happy that ... they've got her."</p>
        
            <p>The future of the building was unclear, and they were still deciding what to do with it, she said.</p>
