        <h2>Wellington station still quake prone despite years of strengthening</h2>
        <p>
KiwiRail received a revised detailed seismic assessment that meant further work on the station was required to meet earthquake prone rating standards.

            <p>More strengthening work is needed for the Wellington Railway Station to lose its earthquake prone rating after a newly released seismic report.</p>
        
            <p>In 2014 the central city station was rated as 20 percent of the national building standard (NBS) following an assessment of the building.</p>
        
            <p>A 2015 report identified seismic work was needed to bring the building to 34 percent of the NBS, meaning that it would no longer be classified as earthquake prone.</p>
        
            <p>That work had taken place over several years, with the final piece of it completed earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>In November, KiwiRail received a revised detailed seismic assessment that still put the building at 20 percent of the NBS and meant further work on the station was required to bring it up to 34 percent.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail executive property general manager Anna Allen told RNZ the work would start in the first half of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Allen said it was not yet known how much the work would cost.</p>
        
            <p>She said the work was still in its planning phase, but they would aim to minimise any disruption caused by it.</p>
        
            <p>"KiwiRail is committed to bringing the building up to the required new standards."</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council chairperson Daran Ponter said Metlink was aware the seismic survey had been commissioned and was grateful to KiwiRail for sharing the results.</p>
        
            <p>"The building was considered earthquake prone prior to the survey, and a separate independent risk assessment of it's safety recently commissioned by KiwiRail shows there is now no increased risk of loss of life."</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said Metlink accepted the assessment's findings, and they were happy to continue their use of Wellington Railway Station.</p>
        
            <p>"We look forward to discussing with KiwiRail it's remediation plans for the building."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for rail minister Winston Peters said the minister had not yet been formally briefed on the seismic status of Wellington Railway Station but it was understood KiwiRail was developing a plan.</p>
        
            <p>They said it was an operational issue for KiwiRail to manage.</p>
