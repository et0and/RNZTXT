            <p>The loving banter between British comedian Jack Whitehall and his elderly dad Michael has been winning over Netflix audiences since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>At their live shows in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland in January, Michael will surely dip into his "vast back-catalogue of anecdotes and stories and tall tales", Jack says, and there will also be plenty of spontaneity.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be a slightly chaotic, hopefully amusing evening of watching a father and son on stage," he tells RNZ's Jim Mora.</p>
        
            <p>Jack Whitehall says he has got a lot better at travelling in the seven years since he and his dad first shot Travels With My Father, but much of it has been "solitary".</p>
        
            <p>In Aotearoa, he and Michael - a former theatrical agent to the stars - will enjoy some time off together.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm normally pretty in and out of the locations that I go to and tend to see an airport and then a dressing room and maybe the back of a car. It'll be nice to be able to sort of actually spend some time in New Zealand and enjoy it."</p>
        
            <p>While Jack concedes that he and Michael's lives are "quite privileged and whatnot", audiences seem to relate to their father-and-son dynamic and enjoy their shared sense of humour.</p>
        
            <p>"We kind of banter with each other and undermine one another and push each other's buttons in a comedic way but it's all underpinned by a great love and affection.</p>
        
            <p>"I think people recognise elements of that in their own relationships with their parents and they like seeing that reflected on screen. It's that double-act element that people seem to really connect to."</p>
        
            <p>At 84, Michael says he is no longer very strong physically but is "mentally fine" and can get himself around.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very lucky to have a team of people who are all very concerned about my health because of my great age."</p>
        
            <p>He refuses to believe that urinating just twice a day, as he does, is any cause for concern.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason is I don't drink anything. I don't drink water all day whereas the modern youth drink water all the time.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, water is for washing. I'll put water on my face when I shave in the morning and I may have a bath before I go to bed but drinking it - no, not really."</p>
        
            <p>In the Whitehalls' new Netflix show Fatherhood with My Father, Michael shares a drink and pub meal with a robot, with which he became "completely bewitched".</p>
        
            <p>"When I asked her a question she'd look slightly over to one side and then give me an answer and talk very intelligently ... At the end, I had to be sort of dragged away from there and back to the hotel in the driverless car we drove in Los Angeles."</p>
        
            <p>Often Michael's unusual references fly over people's heads, Jack says, but not the robot's.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the first time I have ever seen him have a conversation where someone knew everyone that he was referencing and was able to hold a conversation with him about all of his very niche interests."</p>
        
            <p>Michael represented lots of successful actors, such as Colin Firth and Judy Dench, but says he is not posh himself.</p>
        
            <p>"That's part of the problem with me because people see ex-clients of mine driving around in big motors and going on fancy holidays and all that and say 'Michael probably does that, too'. No. I'm just a humble man."</p>
        
            <p>He says Jack, who had a daughter Elsie with his partner Roxy Horner in 2023, is a much better father than he was.</p>
        
            <p>"I was an agent and I was running a business in London, working and trying to make money so that my family would be successful and happy and everything. I was at the coalface but I was never actually at home very much.</p>
        
            <p>"Whereas Jack, actors basically tend to be at home a lot. When they're working they work and then when they're not working they come home."</p>
        
            <p>Jack says it has been an "amazing ride" becoming a father himself and having a baby brought him and Roxy even closer.</p>
        
            <p>"You're going through a very intense life experience together and you certainly feel like you're in the trenches with each other. It made us feel like even more of a team. It's been amazing to feel like more of a family and Elsie is the centre of my world."</p>
