            <p>The father of a man killed in Dunedin says he wants justice for his son.</p>
        
            <p>Gurjit Singh's body was found at his home on 29 January, with forensic evidence indicating he died from multiple stab wounds by a sharp weapon.</p>
        
            <p>A 33-year-old man has been charged with his murder and was due to appear in Dunedin District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Kallum Croudis said a large team of investigators have worked extensively on the case.</p>
        
            <p>He said several vehicles, another residential property and workplaces were still part of the ongoing investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking through a translator, Singh's father, Nishan Singh, said he was pleased with the work done by the police, but he wanted answers.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said he wanted justice.</p>
        
            <p>His son was an intelligent, soft-hearted gentleman who helped lots of new migrants to adjust to life in New Zealand, and had no enemies, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Nishan Singh had arrived in Dunedin and was being supported by the Punjabi community and police.</p>
        
            <p>Narindervir Singh from the Otago Punjabi Foundation Trust said a Givealittle fundraising page has been set up to support the family.</p>
        
            <p>Gurjit Singh's wife was meant to arrive in the country this month, but it was now unclear what would happen now that her husband had died, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was an awful situation as Singh had set up his home here so he could spend time with his beloved family, Narindervir Singh said.</p>
