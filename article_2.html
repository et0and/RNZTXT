        <h2>$63.6m boost for Life Saving and Coastguard in Budget</h2>
        <p>
"New Zealand has a tragically high drowning toll," Transport Minister Simeon Brown said at the announcement.
</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving New Zealand and the Coastguard will receive a funding boost of $63.6 million over four years, the government has announced.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Transport Minister Simeon Brown,and Associate Minister Matt Doocey outlined the new funding as part of a pre-Budget announcement this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Both organisations are facing across the board cost increases. At the same time New Zealand has a tragically high drowning toll and services of frontline services keeping people safe in and around water are needed more than ever before," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>About 90 people drowned every year and the government was intent on seeing that number reduced.</p>

            <p>Lifeguards and Coastguard were at the frontline of efforts to reduce the country's high drowning toll, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Costs are rising across the board for these largely volunteer-driven organisations. The funding will cover operational expenses for both organisations as well as rescue equipment, facilities and maintenance."</p>
        
            <p>The money would be divided as $19m for Coastguard and $44m for Surf Life Saving NZ.</p>
        
            <p>There were around 4500 lifeguards, Brown said, and the extra funding would help with training and gear as well as the upkeep of their buildings.</p>
        
            <p>They carried out around 31,000 "preventative actions" annually, he said.</p>

            <p>Coastguard rescued more than 6000 people who got into trouble on the water annually and needed more funds "to deliver their essential prevention and rescue services".</p>
        
            <p>"Demand for Coastguard is growing."</p>
        
            <p>He thanked both organisations for their "great work saving lives on the water".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said heading to the water was a Kiwi way of life, however, it came with risk and frontline organisations such as Surf Life Saving New Zealand and Coastguard New Zealand needed more funds.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was a huge admirer of both services and put in a plug for boaties to join Coastguard and take one of their education courses which he has done.</p>
