            <p>Lulu Sun's memorable Wimbledon debut continues after she beat a Chinese opponent to advance to the fourth round at the All-England club in London.</p>
        
            <p>The 23-year-old only made her Grand Slam debut at the Australian Open this year, losing in the first round, and this is only her second main draw appearance.</p>
        
            <p>The world number 123 is now into the second week and the last 16 after overcoming China's Zhu Lin, ranked 61 in the world, 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (8-6).</p>
        
            <p>Sun is the second player competing for New Zealand to make the fourth round in a women's singles Grand Slam event after Belinda Cordwell (Australian Open 1988 and 1989).</p>
        
            <p>She pulled off a major upset on the tournament's opening day, ousting Chinese world number eight Qinwen Zheng.</p>
