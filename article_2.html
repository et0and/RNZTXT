            <p>The South Taranaki District Council has voted unanimously to retain its two Māori wards at the 2025 local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>At an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday, mayor Phil Nixon expressed frustration at having to revisit the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"Our council made the decision to introduce Māori wards in 2020, prior to the Labour-led government removing the right to demand a poll. At the time, a petition demanding a poll was received, but it did not meet the required 5 percent of electors threshold and therefore a poll was not required."</p>
        
            <p>A recent law change by the current government required councils to either disestablish their Māori wards or agree to a binding poll.</p>
        
            <p>Nixon could not see the point.</p>
        
            <p>"While we acknowledge the coalition government's desire to restore the right to binding referenda, we feel strongly that any council that made a decision on Māori wards and fully completed the legislative process prior to the Labour government's changes, should not have been made to go through this costly, time consuming and politically divisive process again."</p>
        
            <p>Nixon said the introduction of Māori wards in South Taranaki had been a positive enhancement to decision-making and enabled the council to be more effective as a board of governors.</p>
        
            <p>"As residents and ratepayers, Māori (who make up almost 20 percent of South Taranaki's population) had been underrepresented and disengaged from the electoral and local democratic process for too long.</p>
        
            <p>"Our move to Māori wards has encouraged more Māori to participate in the governance of our district and means the council is more representative of our whole community."</p>
        
            <p>Nixon said having diverse opinions at the council table helped it make the best decision for all of the community.</p>
        
            <p>"We are stronger as we work together in partnership for the good of South Taranaki - which is ultimately what we are all here for."</p>
