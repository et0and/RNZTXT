        <h2>Bid to save iconic Chateau Tongariro Hotel launched</h2>
        <p>
The iconic hotel was permanently closed in February last year and has simply been deteriorating while it sits empty, petitioners say. Audio

            <p>The Ruapehu District Mayor Weston Kirton is calling on the public to sign a parliamentary petition urging the government to preserve the Chateau Tongariro Hotel and restore it to its former glory.</p>
        
            <p>The petition said that while negotiations were underway and decisions are pending from government officials, the hotel's future hung in the balance.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Kirton told Midday Report the council wanted the government to act quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"We want them to give some respect to the fact that our community is reliant on tourism, reliant on the Chateau being revived, and we want them to act pretty quickly."</p>
        
            <p>"The government needs to come with a timeline as to when they can start addressing some of these outstanding issues."</p>
        
            <p>The Chateau was forced to close in February last year after a seismic assessment deemed it "very high risk" with an E-grade earthquake rating.</p>
        
            <p>It was also found to need critical work to make it weathertight and halt further deterioration.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the hotel has sat empty and has been been left to languish.</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said the Chateau was more than just a historic landmark.</p>
        
            <p>"Before its closure, it was a major economic driver employing over 70 staff, attracting high-spending tourists, and contributing around $10 million annually to the local economy."</p>
        
            <p>He said its closure severely impacted the region's tourism economy.</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said the hotel was leaking, moisture was a big issue, and chattels and historical items such as photos and art works were deteriorating.</p>
        
            <p>The land was owned by the Department of Conservation with taxpayers spending about $2 million a year on maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an important part of not only the region's heritage, but of course New Zealand's heritage as well," Kirton said.</p>
