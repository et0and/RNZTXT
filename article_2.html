            <p>Australian musician Jimmy Barnes is up and about after having open heart surgery last week.</p>
        
            <p>Wife Jane Barnes posted an update on her husband's social media that he was walking around and in good spirits after he had to have surgery because a bacterial infection had spread to his heart.</p>
        
            <p>On Instagram, his wife wrote: "Jane Barnes here with 'Our Jimmy' update for all your well wishers sending in #positivity. Day 3 post op we had a few walks up and down the hallway, 250m I'd say. A tough & fragile day but here's a big brave smile for us. Keep up the good work Jimmy."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the musician's wife tweeted that her husband was "moving out of ICU" and had been on a short walk within the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Barnes had to pull out of the Rock the Boat 2023 cruise festival because he was hospitalised for bacterial pneumonia.</p>
        
            <p>He was initially expected to make a full recovery after a few days.</p>
        
            <p>Day 2 post open heart op. Out of bed, sitting up for 2 hours, short walk and moving out of ICU. It’s been a big day and the next level of his healing now begins. We’ve put up the tree in the hope that Jimmy will be home for Christmas♥️. Love & Thanks, @jane13barnes pic.twitter.com/de8C2MdeXw</p>
        
            <p>The 67-year-old had shows scheduled for December, January and February but in a statement said the health setback would "take him out of action for a while".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really sorry for all the inconvenience this will cause but please be patient while my team works hard to figure things out. A new plan will be announced as soon as possible," he said in a statement on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>In late 2022, Barnes also had to cancel performances to undergo emergency back and hip surgery due to "constant and severe pain".</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear when the musician will be discharged from hospital but Jane Barnes revealed on the social media website X that she had put their Christmas tree up "in the hope that Jimmy will be home for Christmas".</p>
