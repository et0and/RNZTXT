        <h2>TVNZ staff called into meeting amid search for $30m</h2>
        <p>
TVNZ in August said it needed to save $30m amid a "constrained economy, market disruption and a difficult advertising market".

            <p>A whole staff meeting has been called at TVNZ as the broadcaster tries to find $30 million, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcaster earlier this year cut a number of news and current affairs shows as it tries to reduce costs and increase revenues.</p>
        
            <p>Sources at TVNZ have confirmed an invite was sent to all staff to a meeting on the proposed structure changes, for between 1pm and 3pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"This consultation is focused on how we might achieve our $30m target and deliver our Digital+ strategy. Proposals relating to individual roles are not part of this consultation."</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority is to share proposals with our people first. We will not be commenting further at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, TVNZ says it is entering into consultation on the proposed "strategic changes" to deliver savings.</p>
        
            <p>It says this consultation is not related to individual roles.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Jodi O'Donnell in August said TVNZ had sufficient cash to fund its digital strategy over the next three years, but would not pay a dividend.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcaster reported a loss of $85 million against a $1.7m profit the year before, driven by a $62m write down in asset values, which were not specified, and a $39m drop in revenue.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ earlier this year took Fair Go and its midday and late night news bulletins off-air.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
