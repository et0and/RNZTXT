            <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs Winston Peters has returned to New Zealand after a whirlwind trip visiting several countries in the South and South East Asia region.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' last stop was in Singapore, which he said was New Zealand's "most important defence partner in South East Asia".</p>
        
            <p>Singapore was also New Zealand's fourth-largest trading partner and a critical transhipment hub for New Zealand goods, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Peters met Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Mohamad Maliki Osman.</p>
        
            <p>They discussed how to develop a stronger New Zealand-Singapore relationship and the most pressing regional and global challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"Singapore and New Zealand have shared interests and perspectives on a broad range of issues," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"Through the COVID era, we made considerable progress through cooperation on supply chains and food security."</p>
        
            <p>The deputy prime minister said Singapore was a tech and innovation leader and an "ideal" partner for collaboration on "new and emerging areas", such as "the digital economy" and "the green transition".</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand looks forward to working with Singapore to further deepen ties, as well as to progress regional issues, including in the Pacific."</p>
        
            <p>Peters also visited India and Indonesia on this trip in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"The Coalition Government has identified South and South East Asia as a pivotal region in our efforts to deliver for New Zealand a more active, energetic foreign policy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As we pursue an international agenda aimed at enhancing New Zealanders' security and prosperity, further high-level visits to South and South East Asia will follow in the coming six months."</p>
