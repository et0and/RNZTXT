            <p>A $4.5 million funding boost has been promised for conservation body QEII National Trust, to support its partnerships with landowners to create protected pockets of land under covenants, as well as a $750,000 injection for a Waikato conservation project.</p>
        
            <p>Conservation Minister Tama Potaka announced the new funding for the Trust's biodiversity protection work, on Saturday, saying it will be delivered through the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>The funds are an acknowledgement of the Trust's effective record at protecting "special areas of bush, wetland, and biodiversity for future generations," Potaka said, as well as increased demand for their partnerships.</p>

            <p>"Many of our most at-risk plants and animals are found on private land," Potaka said. "Landowners provide a significant contribution to conservation efforts through additional planting, pest control, and fencing work.</p>
        
            <p>"The QEII Trust has proven extremely effective in collaborating to protect these crucial habitats, particularly in lowland and coastal zones where much of our threatened biodiversity exists."</p>
        
            <p>In the past 50 years the Trust had worked to protect 187,000 hectares of land in 5200 covenanted areas.</p>
        
            <p>"You could think of it as about 187,000 rugby fields," Potaka said.</p>
        
            <p>The additional funds announced Saturday as well as earlier government funding allocations, mean the Trust will receive $5.8 million each year for the next three years, Potaka said.</p>

            <p>The Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust Sanctuary would also get additional funding, Potaka said, with $750,000 to be delivered over the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>"The Sanctuary - a popular tourist destination in the Waikato region - is home to native kākāpō, Mahoenui giant wētā, takahē, banded kōkopu, giant kōkopu (native NZ fish) and tuna (longfin eel)," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident this funding will help the Sanctuary continue their work with our precious native species.</p>
        
            <p>"Kia kaha te mahi tahi. We all have a role to play in looking after Aotearoa New Zealand's incredible and vulnerable nature."</p>
