            <p>Bus driver protection screens will be installed across Auckland's bus fleet by 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown welcomed the move, which will see full length driver screens for 80 percent of Auckland Transport's fleet - approximately 1,100 buses.</p>
        
            <p>"The Government is committed to improving the safety of working environments for bus drivers, and Budget 2024 allocated $15 million of Crown funding over two years to do just that," Brown said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA), who administers the funding on behalf of the government, has now concluded assessments on the first round of nine bids from Public Transport Authorities (PTAs) for funding across Auckland,</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington, Nelson-Tasman, and Hawke's Bay."</p>
        
            <p>Brown acknowledged the "important job" bus drivers have in the community, and reaffirmed the government's commitment to help them make their role as safe as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"These hardworking New Zealanders often work with little to separate them from their passengers. Safety screens will provide protection and ensure our service continue to run smoothly and safely," he said.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA is also considering funding to deliver driver toilet facilities and an on-board live CCTV trial for 30 buses, with results of this trial guiding how Auckland Transport will roll out more cameras in future.</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to these initiatives being delivered as soon as possible, and other funding bids to be confirmed in due course once final agreements are made," Brown said.</p>
