            <p>One person has been injured after reports of an explosion was felt in the Waikato town of Cambridge.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand says a 44-gallon drum exploded at 8.07am this morning.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene says a worker was cutting the top from a large oil drum when it ignited, blowing the lid off.</p>
        
            <p>A colleague of the worker told RNZ he "was very lucky".</p>
        
            <p>An ambulance is at the scene and the worker is being treated.</p>
        
            <p>The lid of the drum appears to have been blown metres away in the blast. One eyewitness says it may have been blown a block away.</p>
        
            <p>The explosion caused a loud bang which could be heard around the centre of the town.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
