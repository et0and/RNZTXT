        <h2>Little optimism in Gaza</h2>
        <p>
Palestinian citizens have little hope ICC arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant will deter Israel.

            <p>Gazans see little hope that International Criminal Court arrest warrants for Israeli leaders will slow down the onslaught on the Palestinian territory, where medics say at least 24 people were killed in fresh Israeli military strikes.</p>
        
            <p>In Gaza City in the north, an Israeli strike on a house in Shejaia killed eight people, medics said.</p>
        
            <p>Three others were killed in a strike near a bakery and a fisherman was killed as he set out to sea. In the central and southern areas, 12 people were killed in three separate Israeli air strikes.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Israeli forces deepened their incursion and bombardment of the northern edge of the enclave, their main offensive since early last month.</p>
        
            <p>The military says it aims to prevent Hamas fighters from waging attacks and regrouping there; residents say they fear the aim is to permanently depopulate a strip of territory as a buffer zone, which Israel denies.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the three besieged towns on the northern edge - Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun - said Israeli forces had blown up dozens of houses.</p>
        
            <p>An Israeli strike hit the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, one of three medical facilities barely operational in the area, injuring six medical staff, some critically, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The strike also destroyed the hospital's main generator, and punctured the water tanks, leaving the hospital without oxygen or water, which threatens the lives of patients and staff inside the hospital," it added. It said 85 wounded people including children and women were inside, eight in the ICU.</p>
        
            <p>Later on Friday, the Gaza health ministry said all hospital services across the enclave would stop within 48 hours unless fuel shipments are permitted, blaming restrictions which Israel says are designed to stop fuel being used by Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>Gazans saw the ICC's decision to seek the arrest of Israeli leaders for suspected war crimes as international recognition of the enclave's plight. But those queuing for bread at a bakery in the southern city of Khan Younis were doubtful it would have any impact.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision will not be implemented because America protects Israel, and it can veto anything. Israel will not be held accountable," said Saber Abu Ghali, as he waited for his turn in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Saeed Abu Youssef, 75, said even if justice were to arrive, it would be decades late: "We have been hearing decisions for more than 76 years that have not been implemented and haven't done anything for us."</p>
        
            <p>Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas-led militants stormed across the border fence, killed 1200 people and seized more than 250 hostages on 7 October, 2023. Since then nearly 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, much of which has been laid to waste.</p>
        
            <p>The court's prosecutors said there were reasonable grounds to believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution, and starvation as a weapon of war, as part of a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza".</p>
        
            <p>The Hague-based court also ordered the arrest of the top Hamas commander Ibrahim Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif. Israel says it has already killed him, which Hamas has not confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Israel says Hamas is to blame for all harm to Gaza's civilians, for operating among them, which Hamas denies.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli politicians from across the political spectrum have denounced the ICC arrest warrants as biased and based on false evidence, and Israel says the court has no jurisdiction over the war. Hamas hailed the arrest warrants as a first step towards justice.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts by Arab mediators Qatar and Egypt backed by the United States to conclude a ceasefire deal have stalled. Hamas wants a deal that ends the war, while Netanyahu has vowed the war can end only once Hamas is eradicated.</p>
