            <p>With the price of vinyl getting higher and higher, more young people are seeking out CDs to have a way to get their hands on a physical copy of their favourite tunes.</p>
        
            <p>Sellers say that physical media like CDs, cassette tapes and VHS are increasingly achieving cult status in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Apa Hutt of Creeps Record Parlour in Wellington told RNZ Nights that compact discs and other antiquated forms of media were "slowly" coming back.</p>
        
            <p>He said the sheer cost of vinyl was a big factor, and something like a Wu-Tang Clan album might have risen by price by 50 percent in the past few years, while a Taylor Swift record could reach $80-$120.</p>
        
            <p>"Kids can't afford that, but they still want music, they still want to collect things.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that Spotify is really huge with young people, but humans love owning things, and the next option is the cheap option that is CDs."</p>
        
            <p>He noted that many young people had some sort of gaming console that still played CDs.</p>
        
            <p>Creeps Record Parlour deals in second hand CDs, with many selling for about $5, going up to $30 for things like 1980s post punk, or obscure jazz CDs that are hard to find.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt said CDs by huge artists like Radiohead or Foo Fighters go for about $10-$15, because "there's loads of it", but they would go for three times that price on vinyl.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was also some value in VHS tapes, and it wasn't just collectors paying for them. </p>
        
            <p>"Kids are buying them - its really weird. I'll have a copy of Harry Potter or Spider-Man or Toy Story, kids come in and buy it. They buy the cassettes they watched as a kid, they just want to own them."</p>
        
            <p>He said there has always been demand for cult movies on VHS, and some went for big money, especially old horror films.</p>
        
            <p>"That's where the weirdos are willing to spend. That's where it's at."</p>
        
            <p>Tape cassettes might also be a relic of a bygone era of entertainment, but specific tapes by artists like AC/DC or Kraftwerk could still fetch hundreds.</p>
