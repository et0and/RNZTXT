        <h2>Push for more women in council ahead of local elections</h2>
        <p>
While women account for 51 percent of Auckland's population, they hold only 37 percent of elected positions in Tāmaki Makaurau.

            <p>Auckland is pushing for increased female representation in governance, coinciding with International Women's Day this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The celebration highlights the movement that began with New Zealand's suffrage 156 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Despite progress, women are still underrepresented in leadership roles.</p>
        
            <p>While they account for 51 percent of Auckland's population, women hold only 37 percent of elected positions in Tāmaki Makaurau.</p>
        
            <p>In the 2022 local elections, although fewer wāhine ran for office, a higher proportion of those elected were women (44 percent compared to 35 percent for men). Currently, 63 of Auckland's 170 elected members are women.</p>
        
            <p>This year, two prominent women in governance, Manurewa-Papakura Ward Councillor Angela Dalton and Ōtara-Papatoetoe Local Board member Dr. Ofa Dewes, are completing their terms and have chosen not to seek re-election.</p>
        
            <p>"We should have a voice," Dalton said, pointing to Ada Wells, the first woman councillor on Christchurch City Council in 1917, who advocated for facilities like changing rooms and toilets in Cathedral Square.</p>
        
            <p>Wells, supported by male colleagues, demonstrated that these needs had not been considered by men in leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about men opposing what women want; it's about men not considering what women need."</p>
        
            <p>Dalton emphasised the value of diversity in governance, and highlighted the importance of including Pacific people, Māori, Asians, young people, and retirees, who often found themselves in a society not designed to meet their needs.</p>

            <p>When discussing the importance of female representation in local government, Dalton said, "Women need to believe that their lived experience matters, that they don't have to understand governance or technicalities.</p>
        
            <p>"The advice and training provided once you're elected is amazing because Auckland Council wants its elected members to make good decisions and feel they've got all the information they need ... Believe that what you're bringing to the table is the most important thing. Everything else can be taught and learned."</p>
        
            <p>Dalton acknowledged that self-doubt may hold women back, causing them to question their abilities.</p>
        
            <p>"What women bring to the table is their lived experience as a woman, as a sister, as an auntie, as a cousin, as a mother, as a grandmother - all of those experiences. Also, their lived experience as a person who lives in society."</p>
        
            <p>She also stressed the significance of hearing diverse voices, particularly from youth.</p>
        
            <p>"What do you think our daughter, or my niece, or my granddaughter would think? We have access to those voices as well."</p>
        
            <p>Dewes, a Pacific woman and the only female on the Ōtara Papatoetoe Local Board expressed her gratitude for the residents of Papatoetoe who voted for her.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an honour because it gave me the opportunity to serve the local board for a second term."</p>
        
            <p>On how to inspire more women to run for council, Dewes said, "The issue I see is it's all left to chance. We will never make any impact or have any influence on attracting women - especially young Pacific women - into these roles if there is no commitment and leadership to provide the means to support women into these positions."</p>
        
            <p>She acknowledged the different responsibilities women often faced.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't have been able to do this 20 years ago or when my children, my sons, were younger. But I am now at this later stage of my life because I can fit it into my work schedule."</p>

            <p>Dewes wanted targeted programmes.</p>
        
            <p>"There needs to be a stronger commitment and adequate funding put towards a program that will support women into these roles and not just make it an open application. It's got to be targeted and also identify the leaders who will support these people through."</p>
        
            <p>While she acknowledged existing initiatives like the Ōtara-Papatoetoe Squad (TOPS), Dewes believed they should be more focussed "than just talking to high school students and putting them through a leadership program. While it's excellent, they need to see what the next steps are after that."</p>
        
            <p>Apulu Reece Autagavaia, chair of the Ōtara Papatoetoe Local Board, supported increasing women's representation in local governance, and said, "I guess it's ensuring that we show the value of our women."</p>
        
            <p>He pointed out that in some parts of New Zealand and Pacific societies, women's roles were often undervalued, which limited them to traditional responsibilities like child-rearing and housework, which created barriers to leadership opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen some stats where some of the best countries out there are run by women. I think there's value in ensuring that women's contributions are just as valued, and therefore we should support them. But we also need to bring down any social norms or barriers that make them feel like they're not valued, allowing them to put their name in the hat."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council Governance and Engagement General Manager Lou-Ann Ballantyne stressed the importance of achieving gender balance in local politics.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to empower more women to take the lead in shaping the future of this region by standing in this year's local elections, and we'd like to see more wāhine at the decision-making table," Ballantyne said.</p>
        
            <p>"Women bring complementary perspectives and leadership styles to government, and vocalise issues that are sometimes left off the table, so it's important that women are fairly represented.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, diverse representation across all demographics is vital for Auckland's citizens - we are more likely to engage in decisions that affect our daily lives if our values and ideas are respected and considered by those who might think similarly to us."</p>
