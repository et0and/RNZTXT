            <p>A large vegetation fire in Whangārei Heads in Northland has triggered Fire and Emergency response.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuations are underway for a number of homes nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were called shortly after 2pm Thursday to the blaze on Whangārei Heads Road between Onerahi and Tamaterau.</p>
        
            <p>Ten trucks and four helicopters are in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's Northland District manager Wipari Henwood says a number of houses are being evacuated, and crews are undertaking a reconnaissance flight to confirm how many structures are at risk.</p>
        
            <p>He says the fire is burning in a "problematic area", with numerous access points.</p>

            <p>A large amount of smoke can be seen at Whangārei Heads. A resident in the area says it is smoky.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident said the fire was scary and bigger than she had seen in previous years.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who did not want to be named, lives about a kilometre from the fire.</p>
        
            <p>She said she could see flames and several helicopters pouring buckets of water onto the fire.</p>
        
            <p>They have had bush fires previously, she said, but not at the scale she has seen today.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei District Council says Whangārei Heads Road is closed at the Beach Road intersection and motorists should use Mt Tiger Road to access Whangārei Heads.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
