            <p>Britain will hold a parliamentary election on 4 July which opinion polls indicate will hand power to Keir Starmer's Labour Party and end 14 years of Conservative Party-led government.</p>
        
            <p>To win outright, one party needs to win at least 326 out of the 650 parliamentary seats. The leader of that party becomes prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>In each of the 650 constituencies, voters elect a local candidate who is usually affiliated with a larger political party. Voters choose one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.</p>
        
            <p>A hung parliament occurs if no single party wins a majority. In this case, the incumbent prime minister remains in power and is given the first chance to form a government either by building a coalition or governing with a minority.</p>
        
            <p>During the Conservative Party's campaign, it warned that Labour could win a 'supermajority' that would embolden it to make more radical reforms than those set out in its manifesto.</p>
        
            <p>In some democracies, a supermajority is a legally defined threshold, higher than a simple majority, required to make major changes such as to a constitution.</p>
        
            <p>In Britain, however, there is no definition of a supermajority that gives governments any special powers and the term has no clear meaning in its political lexicon.</p>
        
            <p>An exit poll is released by broadcasters immediately after voting ends at 10pm (9am NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>Vote counting begins immediately and first results come within hours. Most are declared overnight and the outcome is usually clear between 5am and 7am (local time).</p>
        
            <p>Once the overall result is clear, and if the governing party has lost, the prime minister would be expected to tender his resignation to the king on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The leader of the winning party will then meet the king, who will request he or she form a government. They will then head to Downing Street to make a speech to the British public as the new prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>The new prime minister will begin appointing ministers, starting with senior positions.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament is scheduled to return on 9 July. The Speaker of the House of Commons - parliament's lower chamber - will be elected from among members of parliament (MPs).</p>
        
            <p>Each MP will then in turn swear the oath of allegiance to the king or make a solemn affirmation. This usually takes a few days.</p>
        
            <p>The State Opening of Parliament and King's Speech, setting out a government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session, is due to take place on July 17, although this date could be changed by a new government.</p>
        
            <p>Voters must be aged 18 or over on polling day, and be either a British citizen, Irish citizen or qualifying Commonwealth citizen.</p>
        
            <p>Close to 50 million people are registered to vote. Polling stations open from 7am to 10pm (local time). Votes can be cast in person, by post, or through a proxy.</p>
        
            <p>Voters must take photo ID with them to vote, the first national election at which that has been required.</p>
        
            <p>Overseas British citizens will also get to vote, opens new tab regardless of how long they have been living outside the country.</p>
