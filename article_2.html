        <p>
The Reserve Bank has signalled further rate cuts to come, but what will that mean for borrowers?

            <p>The official cash rate (OCR) has been cut and banks have trimmed many of their home loan rates.</p>
        
            <p>But, with the OCR forecast to fall through the next couple of years, how far are mortgage interest rates really likely to drop?</p>
        
            <p>And how long is it worth hanging out for a better deal?</p>
        
            <p>As part of its updated forecasts, the Reserve Bank said in the latest monetary policy statement that it expects the OCR to drop to less than 4 percent by the end of next year, and to 3 percent by mid-2027.</p>
        
            <p>Gareth Kiernan, chief forecaster at Infometrics, said he expected a 25 basis point cut at each meeting between now and the middle of next year, and a couple of cuts in the second half of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>He said, plugging the bank's OCR track into Infometrics' interest rate model showed that by early 2025, a one-year home loan rate might be about 5.4 percent, a two-year fix might be 5.5 percent, a three-year 6 percent and a four-year 6.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Five-year fixes would be 6.3 percent and the floating rate would be 6.67 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"However, two caveats to these numbers. Firstly, the Reserve Bank doesn't publish any other interest rate forecasts, so I've kept our longer-term wholesale rate forecasts, which see a 10-year government bond rate of about 4.2 percent in early 2027 - a rate that is no lower than the current rate. This component limits the fall in longer-term fixed rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Secondly, bank margins look to be unusually low on retail mortgage rates at the moment, which might be a function of weak demand for borrowing, which is encouraging banks to price their rates more sharply to get lending out the door.</p>
        
            <p>"I've assumed that these margins are restored back towards normal over the next 18 months, meaning that banks pass on less of the interest rate cuts to borrowers during that period."</p>
        
            <p>But he said if margins remained at their current levels, a 3 percent OCR could mean a one-year fixed rate of 4.9 percent, two- and three-year rates of 5 percent and four- and five-year fixes at 5.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Sabrina Delgado, an economist at Kiwibank, said she expected the OCR to fall further than the Reserve Bank forecasts - she forecasts 2.5 percent in mid-2027.</p>
        
            <p>But she said retail interest rates would be affected by what happened to term deposit rates and other funding costs.</p>
        
            <p>"We would expect to see mortgage rates closer to 5 percent, possibly higher depending on how far term deposit rates fall.</p>
        
            <p>"The last time we got to 2.5 percent OCR, before and after the earthquake, term deposit rates widened out to 4 percent and mortgage rates fell to 5.5 percent. Then the OCR fell to 1.75 percent in 2018, and we got 5 percent mortgage rates. Of course, all rates fell to the lowest levels in human history during Covid. Hopefully we won't see that again."</p>
        
            <p>Chris Tennent-Brown, a senior economist at ASB, said the bank expected the OCR to be 3.25 percent by the end of next year, when most fixed-term mortgages would be "comfortably under 6 percent".</p>
        
            <p>Wholesale markets have priced in another 75bps of cuts through the rest of this year.</p>
        
            <p>To make it a better deal to fix for six months now rather than a year, the six-month rate would need to drop to 6.59 percent from 7.01 percent now to make fixing for two back-to-back six-month terms a better option than fixing for a year at 6.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"If there's a 1:1 pass through from OCR cuts to the six-month rate, which is a bit of a heroic assumption," Kiernan said, "you would need two rate cuts during that time. Seems possible."</p>
