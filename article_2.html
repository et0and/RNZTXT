            <p>Northlanders and holidaymakers visiting the top of the country are being urged to conserve water as a dry summer continues to bite.</p>
        
            <p>Northland Regional Council chairman Geoff Crawford said parts of the Far North and Kaipara districts have been under water restrictions since late last year, and the region has only become drier since then.</p>
        
            <p>Northland's water supplies would be under even more strain when tens of thousands of people descended on the region for Anniversary Weekend and Waitangi Day, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some rain was forecast next week, but it was unlikely to be enough to replenish the region's shrinking rivers, Crawford said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rainfall is the key to it all ... we've been hoping for it and while some areas have had some rainfall in recent weeks, unfortunately it has not fallen across the whole region," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council's latest climate report showed Northland received only half its expected rainfall in December, and levels in most of the region's rivers ranged from low to extremely low.</p>
        
            <p>
December rainfall was much lower than average across most of Northland, as shown in this Northland Regional Council graphic.

            <p>Central and southern areas of Northland were worst affected.</p>
        
            <p>Groundwater levels varied across the region but most were below normal.</p>
        
            <p>The report stated dry conditions were likely to continue throughout January.</p>
        
            <p>The lack of rainfall also sent the fire risk soaring, and contributed to serious wildfires in the past week at Waikaraka, near Whangārei, and Taheke, west of Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>Homes were threatened in both cases.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency declared a restricted fire season across Northland on 10 January, and a few days later cancelled all existing fire permits.</p>
        
            <p>Level 3 water restrictions, which prohibit sprinklers, irrigation, hand-held hoses and filling swimming pools, are in place in Ōmanaia, Rāwene, Ōpononi and Ōmāpere in the Far North, and in Dargvaille and Baylys Beach in Kaipara.</p>
        
            <p>Level 2 restrictions, which ban sprinklers and irrigation systems, are in force in Paihia, Ōpua, Waitangi, Kerikeri, Waipapa, Kawakawa and Moerewa, all in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>There are no formal water restrictions in Whangārei but the district council is urging residents of Te Kamo, Hikurangi, Tikipunga, Whau Valley, Three Mile Bush, and Otangarei to use less water than usual while a reservoir leak is repaired.</p>
        
            <p>Those repairs are expected to take until the end of January.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is predicting heavy rain in parts of Northland on Tuesday and showers from Thursday through to Sunday.</p>
