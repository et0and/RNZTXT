            <p>The Women's British and Irish Lions Tour rugby tour of Aotearoa will see its first women's team play three Test matches against the Black Ferns across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Sport and Recreation Minister Chris Bishop said $3.9 million from the Major Events Fund had been set aside to support the series.</p>
        
            <p>The first women's Lions team will take on the Black Ferns and play matches across New Zealand in September 2027.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen from the recent women's world cups that Kiwis love a chance to see world-class teams competing up close in our own backyard," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is going to be a historic moment for rugby, and I can't wait to see the very first women's Lions team take on our world champion Black Ferns. This tour is going to be epic."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson said hosting the games was a milestone for women's rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"Hosting this tour gives our players a pinnacle event that will be a highlight in their career and it provides an aspirational pathway for our emerging players. There is nothing quite like a Lions tour to engage and excite fans. We think this will have a unique flavour, a freshness and excitement to it like we saw during the Rugby World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be taking this tour around the country; it will genuinely be something that all Kiwis can get behind and get excited about."</p>
        
            <p>British & Irish Lions chief executive Ben Calveley said the team would play three test matches against the Black Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>It would be "the ultimate challenge", he said, which made for a "fantastic sporting spectacle".</p>
        
            <p>Economic Development Minister Melissa Lee said the tour would further increase the "value and visibility of women's sport" in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The action on the field is set to be matched by positive economic benefits as we look forward to seeing Kiwis pack stadiums and welcoming the legion of fans that will come to New Zealand for this landmark tour," Lee said.</p>
