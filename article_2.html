            <p>All Whites midfielder Clayton Lewis is reportedly among three A-League players arrested over an alleged betting scandal.</p>
        
            <p>Australian media is reporting Lewis, who now plays for Sydney club Macarthur, was arrested along with former Phoenix captain Ulises Dávila who is now also at Macarthur along with midfielder Kearyn Baccus.</p>
        
            <p>The NSW Police Organised Crime Squad Gaming Unit launched an investigation into the alleged manipulation of yellow cards during football games for gambling purposes.</p>
        
            <p>Police allege they discovered Dávila, 33, had been taking instructions from a man - believed to be in South America - to organise yellow cards to occur during certain points in A-League games.</p>
        
            <p>They said the offending occurred during games between 24 November and 9 December last year.</p>
        
            <p>Dávila received a yellow card during Macarthur FC's game against Melbourne Victory on 24 November and another yellow card during his side's match against Sydney FC on 9 December.</p>
        
            <p>Failed attempts to allegedly control the number of cards issued during games happened between 20 April and 4 May this year.</p>
        
            <p>Detectives executed five search warrants across Sydney on Friday 17 May, arresting Dávila in South Coogee.</p>
        
            <p>Police will allege a senior player paid junior players $10,000 for giving away yellow cards, acting under instruction of an organised crime figure in South America.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Fitzgerald said the money was insignificant compared to the impact the actions of these players have had on the integrity of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"We will allege that the giving out of four yellow cards and the subsequent penalties that arose out of those yellow cards could in fact change the way that result of that game went," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While $10,000 may seem a lot of money to a young sportsperson, we will advise that is incredibly insignificant when you consider the damage that being charged with this offence and conviction results in.</p>
        
            <p>"We will allege that these instance in November and December 2023, that these players betrayed the trust of their supporters."</p>
        
            <p>Police said in addition to the three players arrested on 17 May, they are looking for another player who is currently out of the state.</p>

            <p>NSW Police State Crime Command's organised crime squad Detective Superintendent Peter Faux said investigators had not identified any betting in Australia, but "predominantly in South America".</p>
        
            <p>"There's multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars being paid out in respect to the game we are alleging this occurred in," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent Faux said he wanted to make it clear that there was currently no other evidence or indication that any other club within the A-League was involved.</p>
        
            <p>Dávila has been charged with a number of offences, including two counts of engaging in conduct that corrupts a betting outcome of an event.</p>
        
            <p>A 27-year-old player from Parramatta and a 32-year-old player from West Hoxton have also been charged with offences, including participating in a criminal group.</p>
        
            <p>All three have been granted bail to appear in court at a later date.</p>
        
            <p>Dávila plays as an attacking midfielder, was the first Mexican to sign with English Premier League club Chelsea in 2011, and has previously played for Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>He recently signed on for another two years at Macarthur FC.</p>
        
            <p>Macarthur FC said in a statement the club was "shocked" by the arrests.</p>
        
            <p>"Integrity of our game is a foundation pillar and we will work closely with all relevant agencies on this matter," the club said.</p>
        
            <p>Detectives from the organised crime squad are working with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, Sports Integrity Australia, Football Australia, Australian Professional Leagues and the NSW Crime Commission.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the A-League said it was aware of the arrests and "are liaising closely with all relevant agencies on this matter."</p>
