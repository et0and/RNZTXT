            <p>Pete Hegseth narrowly secured enough votes on Friday local time to become the next US defence secretary, a major victory for President Donald Trump after fierce opposition from Democrats and even some Republicans to his controversial nominee.</p>
        
            <p>Hegseth was confirmed after a 50-50 vote in the Senate, when Vice President JD Vance came to the chamber to break the tie, after three Republicans joined every Democrat and independent in voting no.</p>
