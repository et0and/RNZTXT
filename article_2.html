            <p>The Breakers have granted centre Freddie Gillespie a release from the remainder of his contract, allowing the US import to likely join Italian club Olimpia Milano.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old had only joined the Breakers this season.</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie helped the Breakers to a strong start to the NBL season, with the side having chalked seven wins in 10 games to sit second in the championship. He had previously played in Europe for Bayern Munich and Crvena Zvezda.</p>
        
            <p>His release is immediate.</p>
        
            <p>Describing his short stint with the club, Gillespie said, "I've built great and lasting relationships with my team-mates, the Breakers staff, and our incredible fans.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to begin the next chapter of my journey."</p>
        
            <p>Gillespie's roster place is expected to be filled by 2.29-metre former NBA player Tacko Fall.</p>
        
            <p>Fall, who played 40 NBA games over three seasons with the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers, has been with the Breakers since the start of the season but has been awaiting a roster place to become available.</p>
