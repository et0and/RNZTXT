        <h2>Nerves aplenty for All Blacks young and old</h2>
        <p>
Whether you've played one test or 100, one thing never changes as an All Black.

            <p>Whether you have played one test or 100, one thing never changes as an All Black: you still get nervous before a match.</p>
        
            <p>That assertion rings true for backs Sevu Reece and Cortez Ratima, who will start against the Springboks in what is essentially a must-win match against the Springboks this weekend in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>Halfback Ratima has played just five tests but has been thrust in the deep end for Sunday morning's game, which the All Blacks need to win to realistically keep their Rugby Championship title chances alive.</p>
        
            <p>He replaces veteran TJ Perenara, who drops to bench alongside another long-time and World Cup-winning All Black in Beauden Barrett, who moves to the reserves to allow Will Jordan to start at fullback.</p>
        
            <p>Ratima will have a familiar face in his Chiefs team-mate Damian McKenzie outside at first-five and while he said that should him keep him calm, he conceded he would still have a stomach full of butterflies as the game nears.</p>

            <p>"Playing with [McKenzie] through Super Rugby definitely helps but I think the nerves will well and truly be there. It's probably the biggest match (of my career) so far. Any time you pull on the jersey the nerves and pressure definitely come with it."</p>
        
            <p>Ratima's sentiments were echoed by wing Sevu Reece, who debuted in 2019 and is closing in on 30 tests.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh yeah, 100 perfect, I'll get nerves. Especially here against South Africa, the crowd here is something else. I still get really nervous and it's not until after the game kicks off that it settles down."</p>
        
            <p>Being able to use that nervous energy in a positive way was a challenge for many athletes and Ratima said the All Blacks coaches had done their best to ease any pressure he was feeling.</p>
        
            <p>"They just instil a bit of confidence. Obviously they trust me to go out there and do a job, so that's pretty big coming from them."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Perenara had been a calming influence.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been really good. Asking me if I need anything and is always open when I have questions, so he's been real good too."</p>
        
            <p>The halfback said he had his own techniques to settle the nerves ahead of a test match.</p>
        
            <p>"Just getting good prep throughout the week and ticking things off as I go, gives me things to focus on and definitely helps out. Just go about my work and try and do my job and nail my role," Ratima said.</p>
        
            <p>Reece has been recalled alongside fellow wing Mark Tele'a, with Jordan moving to fullback and Caleb Clarke out injured.</p>

            <p>Reece will mark up against Springboks star Cheslin Kolbe for the first time. The Crusaders flyer said he would have to be on top of his game to get the better of the World Cup-winning South African.</p>
        
            <p>"Cheslin and I have always been on opposite wings and I'm looking forward to coming up against him. This will be the first time we've marked each other. He's skilful, he can run, he can kick, he can sidestep like we all know.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll just go about my own prep and practice my tackling and my own footwork as well and come game time, we'll see."</p>
