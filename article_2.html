            <p>Auckland golfer Ryan Fox has fired four birdies on the back nine to shoot up the leader board in the final round of the PGA's Myrtle Beach Classic in South Carolina.</p>
        
            <p>He has finished in a six-way tie for fourth, matching his best result on the PGA tour, carding a final round four-under par 67 to finish 15 under for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Fox also finished fourth equal at the recent PGA event in New Orleans.</p>
        
            <p>His latest success earns him $244,000.</p>
        
            <p>American Chris Gotterup won the South Carolina event, finishing 22-under par and six shots clear of his nearest rival.</p>
        
            <p>The tournament was played at the same time as the Wells Fargo Championship - one of the PGA Tour's signature events, featuring most of the top players - and meant Fox was the top-ranked player heading into it.</p>
        
            <p>The result boosts Fox's chances of keeping his tour card for next year, moving him to 120th in the FedEx Cup standings, with the top 125 in that ranking securing their PGA Tour card for 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand's Steven Alker has finished second at the Senior PGA tour's Regions Tradition event in Alabama - the first of the season's five majors - to climb to first place on the money winners' list.</p>

            <p>Alker carded a course record-equalling nine-under par 63 in his final round at the Greystone Golf & Country Club in Birmingham to finish on 15 under for the tournament, two shots behind the winner, American Doug Barron.</p>
        
            <p>Alker eagled the par-five second hole and had eight birdies and one bogey in his round.</p>
        
            <p>"I woke up at 7.03 this morning and I hopped out of bed and I thought, 'I've just got to shoot 10 under,' and I came up one short," Alker said.</p>
        
            <p>The total prize pool for the tournament was $4.3 million dollars with Alker taking home around $380,000.</p>
        
            <p>He has won more than $1.6m so far this season and climbed from second to the top of the money winners' standings ahead of Canada's Stephen Ames.</p>
        
            <p>Alker has one victory on the Senior PGA tour, know as the Champions Tour, this season.</p>
