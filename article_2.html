            <p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump met in a tightly controlled television debate in their fight to be the next US president.</p>
        
            <p>Neither acknowledged the other as they arrived on stage.</p>
        
            <p>The debate had been without the interuptions and interjections of the last campaign, when ugly shouting matches broke out.</p>
        
            <p>Rules were in place this time to prevent that, and both men know their microphones were off when it was not their turn to speak.</p>
        
            <p>The topics included the economy, the Covid pandemic, abortion rights and immigration.</p>
        
            <p>The debate has ended.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a recap of the debate:</p>
