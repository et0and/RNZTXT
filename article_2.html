            <p>The owner of a Wellington vet centre and cattery that was gutted by fire on Saturday night says emergency crews did an amazing job helping to rescue as many cats as possible, and staff are working to find out how many were in the building.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the fire at the two storey building on Mahora Street in Kilbirnie at 11.50pm. It took more than two hours for firefighters to put the blaze out.</p>
        
            <p>The two storey building also contains two flats, one on the ground floor and one on the second storey, but they appeared unscathed.</p>
        
            <p>Around eight staff were standing in the vet centre's car park on Sunday morning, looking tired and shellshocked. A couple of residents - one still in her dressing gown - turned up briefly.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile a man and his young daughter came past to inquire about a cat, owned by his sister, who is overseas.</p>

            <p>CareVets Kilbirnie owner Nick Cooper said firefighters had entered the cattery to get the animals out.</p>
        
            <p>There had been about ten cats at the clinic the night of the fire, he estimated, and "a heap of cats" had been carried out of the building. But staff don't know the exact number, as they had not been able to get into the building where the computers and paperwork were.</p>
        
            <p>Some cats had escaped during the fire, he said, at least one had been retrieved, and at least two more were still on the loose. The SPCA was helping CareVets track them.</p>
        
            <p>"We are actively searching for them but if you see them, please call the SPCA or CareVets," Cooper said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the cats that were pulled out of the burning building were given treatment at the scene, before being taken to they city's after-hours veterinary clinic.</p>
        
            <p>"Our nurses put a couple of cats on oxygen straight away - the ambulance helped us, and they've recovered, and they've gone to our other clinic now," Cooper said.</p>
        
            <p>As many of the cats' owners were away, he did not want to cause any "undue stress" until more was known: "As soon as we know, the owners will be the first people we contact."</p>
        
            <p>At least six people were in the building the night of the fire, he said, but everyone got out safely, and that meant fire crews could go straight into the cattery to get the animals out.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper said he and his staff had been on site since 3am on Sunday, and he praised everyone who had helped respond: "Wellington After Hours Vet, Wellington Free [Ambulance], the fire service, all fantastic, absolutely - and my team of course."</p>
        
            <p>Cooper owned two of the cats who had been at the cattery last night, but as regulars they were with one of his staff, and they had been rescued, he said.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ central shift manager Murray Dunbar said eight appliances and four specialist support vehicles attended the fire, which was put out around 2.30am.</p>
        
            <p>The fire at CareVets Kilbirnie would be investigated, he said.</p>
        
            <p>One couple, who did not want to give their full names, said they had heard about the fire at their local vet clinic, and came over to see if they could help.</p>
        
            <p>Giulia said, as a pet owner, the idea that cats may have died in the fire was "just terrifying".</p>
        
            <p>"We've been coming to this vet for at least 15 years and I'm thinking of the people who may have woken up to the news thinking 'oh my god, my baby is in there'. We came by to show support and see if any of the staff needed a hot drink or a hug, we are sending our love."</p>
        
            <p>Her partner Fillipo, said he sees the owner's cats hanging out in reception whenever they go to the vets. "They greet you at reception, they are awesome."</p>
