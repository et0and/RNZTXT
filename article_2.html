            <p>A dentist who practised while under suspension is now facing 19 charges under a health act.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Jacob Goldenberg of Total Health Dentistry in Ponsonby had been suspended by the Dental Council since March last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, patients claimed that he had been practising until earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>His practice was put into liquidation in April.</p>
        
            <p>The chief legal advisor at the Ministry of Health, Phil Knipe, said Goldenberg has appeared in court.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry of Health can confirm that Mr Goldenberg is facing 19 charges under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said Goldenberg first appeared before a registrar in the Auckland District Court last week and did not enter a plea, and was due to appear again next week.</p>
