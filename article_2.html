        <h2>Northland's most flood-prone marae to receive resilience boost</h2>
        <p>
The $630,000 year-long Northland flood-affected marae project starts in July.

            <p>Thirty-five of Te Tai Tokerau's most flood-prone marae are to get a flood resilience boost in New Zealand's first project of its type.</p>
        
            <p>Northland Regional Council (NRC) specialists will work with the marae to boost flood resilience - which for a small number of marae may mean in the longer-term shifting location.</p>
        
            <p>Marae from near Cape Reinga in the north to Kaipara's Naumai near Ruawai in the south are involved.</p>
        
            <p>These marae or their connecting roads are consistently impacted by flooding.</p>
        
            <p>They are in a range of often remote settings including coastal and inland beside rivers</p>
        
            <p>The effects of climate change will amplify the impacts of today's river and sea flooding the resilience mahi will deal with.</p>
        
            <p>All three marae in the heavily impacted tiny west coast settlement of Pawarenga on the shores of the Whangape Harbour in the Far North are part of the project.</p>
        
            <p>NRC rivers manager Joe Camuso said the $630,000 year-long Northland flood-affected marae project starts in July.</p>
        
            <p>He said NRC was now in the process of contacting project marae.</p>
        
            <p>Camuso said the work would bring many benefits.</p>
        
            <p>"As well as the obvious benefits to marae infrastructure, making marae more resilient to flooding events reduces the strain on Northland's emergency services and responders," he said.</p>

            <p>Cyclone Gabrielle had clearly illustrated the importance of marae during flooding and bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>Families had at some marae, while others were used as hubs supporting local emergency responses for communities cut off from the outside world.</p>
        
            <p>The project work combines NRC's rivers, civil defence and climate change teams.</p>
        
            <p>Camuso said civil defence was helping with marae preparedness planning.</p>
        
            <p>The climate change team was helping with the small number of marae for whom relocation might be the best option.</p>
        
            <p>He said the regional council plans focused on how best to best to protect marae from flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Some would require more work to achieve this than others.</p>
        
            <p>Council would work with each to develop an individualised approach to boosting flood resilience.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no 'one size fits all silver bullet' solution."</p>
        
            <p>Camuso said the work had become possible through NRC's new flood hazard mapping which enabled the worst-affected marae to be clearly identified.</p>
        
            <p>The marae were affected by one-in-10-year flooding, which meant they would also in turn be affected by larger one-in-50 and one-in-100-year flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Council mapping shows worsening impacts into the future with the effects of climate change.</p>
        
            <p>Camuso said physical construction work would be best for some marae. Flood protection work could include stop banking or engineering work to widen a river's banks.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>For marae that decided longer-term retreat was the best flood resilience option, planning and design work would instead more likely prevail.</p>
        
            <p>Camuso said a community that decided to shift its marae might decide not to spend money doing it up, instead using that towards a longer-term shift.</p>
        
            <p>The year-long project is almost fully government-funded with $600,000 through its Crown Infrastructure Partners and NRC rates contributing $30,000.</p>
        
            <p>The project is part of NRC's wider $700,000 three-year marae flood resilience plans with ratepayers contributing $100,000 in total to the mahi.</p>
        
            <p>About 70 percent of the project's marae are in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>Camuso said this was where the project had identified the bulk of the worst-affected to be via combined flood mapping and marae distribution analysis.</p>
        
            <p>There are 350 marae in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>The project's 25 Far North district marae are - Te Hūruhi and Ururangi at Awarua; Ngāi Tawake at Mataraua; Mohinui and Kawiti at Waiomio; Waikare (Te Tūruki) at Waikare; Ōtiria at Ōtiria; Tuhirangi and Ōtātara at Waima; Mōrehu, Ōhāki and Taiao at Pawarenga; Ngāti Manawa (Te Waiariki) and Waipuna at Panguru; Waihou (Waimirirangi) at Waihou; Te Pīti (Ōmanaia) at Ōmanaia; Mataitaua at Hōreke; Te Arohanui (Mangataipa) at Mangamuka Bridge; Mangamuka at Mangamuka; Matihetihe at Mitimiti; Waimanoni at Awanui; Te Reo Mihi at Te Hāpua; Tauteihiihi (Ngātokimatawhaorua) at Kohukohu; Tauratumaru at Utakura and Aputerewa at Mangōnui.</p>
        
            <p>Its six Whangārei district marae are - Mōkau at Mōkau; Ngātiwai at Ngāiotonga; Akerama at Towai; Maungārongo at Poroti, Whakapara at Whakapara and Ōtetao Reti (Ōtetao) at Punaruku.</p>
        
            <p>The project's five Kaipara district marae are - Naumai at Naumai; Ahikiwi at Kaihū; Ōtamatea at Whakapirau and Te Houhanga at Dargaville.</p>
