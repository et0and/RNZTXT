            <p>A Māori astronomer is enjoying guiding crowds through the Māori New Year, teaching people how to navigate the stars ahead of Matariki celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Josh Aoraki (Kai Tahu) said Matariki was a special time, not only for astronomers but also for all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"The pillars of Matariki are around people - acknowledging those who have passed [and] being present with those we have in our lives."</p>
        
            <p>While Matariki festivities begin next week, Aoraki said the cluster was already rising in the morning skies.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're waiting for to actually start the celebration of Matariki is the correct lunar phase."</p>
        
            <p>To find Matariki, he suggested looking for Tautoru or Orion's Belt first.</p>

            <p>"If you look east in the morning just as the sun comes up, you'll see three stars in a row.</p>
        
            <p>"If you follow them to the left, that'll point you towards the little star cluster of Matariki."</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki, who is also an astrophotographer, has worked at Tāmaki Makaurau's Stardome Observatory & Planetarium for the past eight years.</p>
        
            <p>He is passionate about sharing his knowledge of kōkōrangi (astronomy), which he said was an important way of life for Māori ancestors.</p>
        
            <p>"We all descend from Ngā Whetū (the stars), we all descend from our tūpuna who were navigators.</p>
        
            <p>"We built our culture around our understanding of te taiao (the environment) and that was built upon kōkōrangi."</p>
        
            <p>In his work, he guides tours around the observatory and educates people of all ages about the stars, planets and solar system.</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki said there was a growing demand for the tours and shows, with more people eager to learn more about astronomy - particularly Matariki.</p>
        
            <p>"I find that every new group of students, knows so much more about Matariki than the last year."</p>
        
            <p>"It's really cool to be part of the generation that's cultivating the new generation who will have this context of Matariki."</p>
        
            <p>He also referenced a quote from his mentor, Professor Rangi Mataamua, as a guide for sharing mātauranga (knowledge) with others.</p>
        
            <p>"In the words of Rangi Mataamua - knowledge that isn't shared is not knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>"So, for us, it's all about sharing and cultivating and making those connections between people and environment."</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki also said Māori astronomy and western astronomy were more similar than people think.</p>
        
            <p>"For me e rua e rua - they're the same thing. You're sort of applying two different lenses to the same kaupapa.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not in conflict to me, they're actually just working together in tandem. It is possible to have two bodies of knowledge next to each other."</p>
        
            <p>In the new year, Aoraki has set his sights on 'expanding his kete of knowledge' and learning more about the different tribal stories around kōkōrangi.</p>
        
            <p>Tickets for the Stardome Observatory and Planetarium's Open Day next week are sold out. This special Matariki event will take place on 28 June.</p>
