            <p>Financial troubles are underpinning a dangerous apartment building in Auckland which residents have been warned to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council has issued a Dangerous Building Notice for the City Gardens Apartments on Albert Street.</p>
        
            <p>The building's management said they were short more than $30 million needed for long-term fixes to some fire hazards and recladding.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the City Gardens Apartments were told last week they may need to evacuate due to significant fire safety defects.</p>
        
            <p>The council was working on remedial work with the building owners - but if necessary measures could not be met by Friday, all occupants needed to get out.</p>
        
            <p>The building has not had a warrant of fitness since 2017, with the council issuing a number of notices to fix (NFTs) and infringement fines as a result.</p>
        
            <p>In August 2023, the council said it carried out an audit on the building after being notified by Fire and Emergency New Zealand of fire safety issues.</p>
        
            <p>The primary concern was the car park stairs being open to potential car fires which could block the way of the apartment building.</p>
        
            <p>The audit was followed up with a meeting with the body corporate, where the issues were discussed and actions were undertaken immediately to avoid a Dangerous Building Notice.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, FENZ reported to the council that a sprinkler had been set off in the building without triggering the building alarm or notifying fire crews.</p>
        
            <p>This incident, as well as a follow up inspection by the council and FENZ, led the council to conclude the building met the threshold of a dangerous building.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council said there were no other dangerous building notices for apartment buildings active in the city.</p>

            <p>One resident, Mac, hoped he would be able to stay for a little longer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's terrible," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to just stay here for a period of time, I hope they can fix the problems."</p>
        
            <p>Mac said there should be help for them.</p>
        
            <p>"I think council should give me, give us, some place to stay..."</p>
        
            <p>Residents found out they may need to leave after a notice was posted on the building's entrance, alongside a letter from Fire and Emergency which outlined the building's issues.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, FENZ said it had concerns around whether the building's fire alarms could reliably alert occupants to a fire.</p>
        
            <p>It was also worried whether residents would be able to escape safely, promptly and efficiently if they needed to.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said it was unclear if the building's hydrant system was able to deliver water for firefighting to the upper levels of the building.</p>
        
            <p>A resident, who RNZ has agreed not to name, said it was very upsetting.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel sad, I cried [for] almost a day."</p>
        
            <p>She moved from Iran six months ago with her husband and nearly 2-year-old son, and said it had been difficult to find anywhere else to stay.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm trying to find a new place and move from this building, but it's really hard for me to find a new place because, you know, I don't have any friends or relatives in here," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really hard to find a new place, I don't know what should I do."</p>
        
            <p>She said there had been other issues in the building as well, including a large number of cockroaches in her apartment.</p>
        
            <p>The body corporate's lawyer, Tim Rainey, said they had a shortfall of more than $30m to get the building up to standard.</p>
        
            <p>The entire cost of remedial work was estimated to be about $75m, but that work to remove the Dangerous Building Notice was funded.</p>
        
            <p>"We're talking in excess of $30m short-fall, between the estimated cost of the work and the money that was available after settlement of the litigation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very significant increase in the cost of the work..."</p>
        
            <p>He said they had previously been in litigation with the council over the state of the building.</p>
        
            <p>"This building has long standing building defect issues, which are the subject of a building consent to remediate, it followed on from litigation against the council and others which was settled many years ago."</p>
        
            <p>However, Rainey was confident residents would be able to stay.</p>
        
            <p>"The body corporate is doing everything it can to make sure that those issues are addressed properly," Rainey said.</p>
        
            <p>"We fully expect that by Friday we will have most of those issues fully addressed to the council's satisfaction and the notice will be withdrawn."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council general manager of building consents Ian McCormick said they were also expecting a fix to be in place by tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>"Our expectation is that all of the items that are on the list will have been addressed, or should have been addressed, by Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"If they haven't, the requirement for the occupants to leave the building will still be there."</p>
        
            <p>In that case, residents would need to be out of the City Gardens Apartments by Monday.</p>
        
            <p>If remedial work meets the council's standards - the dangerous building notice can be removed, and residents can stay put.</p>
