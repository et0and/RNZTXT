            <p>Canterbury's State Highway 8 has been closed after several vehicles were in a crash on the shores of Lake Pukaki.</p>
        
            <p>Police say it was reported just before 10.30am on Sunday near the State Highway 80 intersection.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said it sent two ambulances, two first response units, one rapid response unit, two managers, one PRIME vehicle and three helicopters to the scene, assessing nine patients.</p>
        
            <p>One patient was airlifted to Christchurch Hospital in a serious condition, two others to Dunedin Hospital. Six with minor conditions were treated at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency says drivers should expect delays on both roads, which are also known as Mount Cook Road and the Tekap≈ç-Twizel Highway.</p>
        
            <p>Black ice warnings are currently in place for the area, which was the scene of twin bus crashes earlier this week that left 15 people in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in the North Island there is a road closure in the Napier suburb of Taradale following a crash involving a vehicle and a cyclist just before 11am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Neeve Road is closed near the intersection of Church Road and detours are in place.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the cyclist had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Police said motorists should avoid the area and expect delays, with the road expected to be closed for some time.</p>
