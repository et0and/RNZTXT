            <p>A Qantas flight has made an emergency landing at Sydney Airport after a loud bang was heard following take-off.</p>
        
            <p>An airport spokesperson said the Qantas flight QF520 from Sydney to Brisbane landed safely just after 1pm (local time).</p>
        
            <p>"This departure of aircraft coincided with a grass fire along the eastern side of the airport's parallel runway, which was brought under control by teams from the Aviation Rescue Fire Fighting Service," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not clear at this stage if the two incidents are linked and investigations are continuing."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Qantas confirmed the flight experienced a suspected engine failure mid take-off.</p>
        
            <p>"One of our flights to Brisbane experienced a suspected engine failure after take-off from Sydney Airport this afternoon. After circling for a short period of time, the aircraft landed safely at Sydney Airport," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our pilots are highly trained to handle situations like this and the aircraft landed safely after the appropriate procedures were conducted.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this would have been a distressing experience for customers and we will be contacting all customers this afternoon to provide support.</p>
        
            <p>"We will also be conducting an investigation into what caused the engine issue."</p>
        
            <p>ABC journalist Mark Willacy was on board the flight and said a "sharp shudder" went through the aircraft after the explosion.</p>
        
            <p>"It was apparent something had happened with one of the engines, then the plane seemed to labour to get off the ground or get any altitude," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's when the pilot came on about 10-15 minutes into the journey and he said that there'd been a major problem with the right engine, that everything was under control at that point, but we'd have to go back to Sydney."</p>
        
            <p>All other aircraft at Sydney were put into a ground stop at the time while the Qantas flight circled and prepared to land.</p>
        
            <p>The Qantas flight was followed down the runway by several Aviation Fire & Rescue appliances.</p>
        
            <p>A number of aircraft waiting to take off had to return to the terminal to refuel, with resulting delays of over an hour on departing flights.</p>
        
            <p>Airport service crews checked the length of the runway for any debris before flights could resume.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney Airport said the main runway was operational but that passengers should expect some delays.</p>
        
            <p>"With the safe arrival of the aircraft, Sydney Airport's priority is to conduct a full inspection of its parallel runway and to return it to service as quickly as possible," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers who are travelling today are also encouraged to check with their airline regarding the status of their flight, or via the online flight information boards on Sydney Airport's website.</p>
