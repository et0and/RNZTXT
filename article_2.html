            <p>Young Wanaka freestyle skier Luca Harrington has achieved his dream, being crowned Big Air World Champion in Switzerland.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first world championship title for the 21-year-old, who is also the first New Zealander to claim a world title in the discipline.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Harrington became Big Air World Cup Champion after finishing third in the last World Cup tour event for the season in France.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the Crystal Globe he won for that, he is now world champ.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so honoured. This season has been just incredible for me and to top it all off with the world champs win is such an honour, it is a dream of mine coming true and I am so grateful to be here right now," an elated Harrington said after his victory.</p>
        
            <p>He was the top qualifier into the finals on Sunday, which gave him the advantage of dropping last into each of the three finals runs.</p>
        
            <p>He scored 92 on his first run, one of six to score over 90, but his decisive blow came in the second run, as he performed a switch right triple corked 1800 Escro grab, which earned him 96.75, the highest score of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, after my first run I was a little surprised but super stoked on what the judges scored it and that gave me a lot of confidence to send it on my second run. That trick [triple corked 1800 Esco Grab] is my speciality and I knew I could put it down. That was the cleanest I had landed it here, it was crazy and I was in shock, I just couldn't believe it!"</p>
        
            <p>He scored 95.25 with his final run, taking the world championship with a total combined score of 192, seven points ahead of Elias Syrja of Finland, while reigning Olympic champ Birk Ruud of Norway claimed the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>After five World Cup podiums, including two gold, X Games gold and silver medals, the Crystal Globe and world champ title, Harrington is taking a break from competition.</p>
        
            <p>His win came a day after fellow Kiwi Zoi Sadowski-Synnott had to withdraw from the Snowboard Big Air finals after being injured in a tumble during practice.</p>
        
            <p>Snow Sports NZ told RNZ Sadowski-Synnott was attempting her backside triple-cork 1440 when she crashed.</p>
        
            <p>"After the crash the tight team made the call to withdraw from today's competition. We expect to see Zoi back on snow in the coming weeks."</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend Sadowski-Synnott was crowned the FIS Snowboard Slopestyle world champion in Switzerland for a third time, after taking gold in the final.</p>
        
            <p>Italy's Flora Tabanelli won the women's Big Air world champ title, after earlier taking the Crystal Globe.</p>
