            <p>A German aerospace engineer has celebrated setting a world record for the longest time living underwater without depressurization - 120 days in a submerged capsule off the coast of Panama.</p>
        
            <p>Rudiger Koch, 59, emerged from his 30sqm home under the sea on Friday (local time) in the presence of Guinness World Records adjudicator Susana Reyes.</p>
        
            <p>She confirmed that Koch had beaten the record previously held by American Joseph Dituri, who spent 100 days living in an underwater lodge in a Florida lagoon.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a great adventure and now it's over there's almost a sense of regret actually. I enjoyed my time here very much," Koch told AFP after leaving the capsule 11m under the sea.</p>
        
            <p>"It is beautiful when things calm down and it gets dark and the sea is glowing," he said of the view through the portholes.</p>
        
            <p>"It is impossible to describe, you have to experience that yourself," he added.</p>
        
            <p>To celebrate, Koch toasted with champagne and smoked a cigar before leaping into the Caribbean Sea, where a boat picked him up and took him to dry land for a celebratory party.</p>
        
            <p>Koch's capsule had most of the trappings of modern life: a bed, toilet, TV, computer and internet - even an exercise bike.</p>
        
            <p>Located some 15 minutes by boat from the coast of northern Panama, it was attached to another chamber perched above the waves by a tube containing a narrow spiral staircase, providing a way down for food and visitors, including a doctor.</p>

            <p>Solar panels on the surface provided electricity. There was a backup generator, but no shower.</p>
        
            <p>Koch had told an AFP journalist who visited him halfway through his endeavour that he hoped it would change the way we think about human life - and where we can settle, even permanently.</p>
        
            <p>"What we are trying to do here is prove that the seas are actually a viable environment for human expansion," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Four cameras filmed his moves in the capsule - capturing his daily life, monitoring his mental health and providing proof that he never came up to the surface.</p>
        
            <p>"We needed witnesses who were monitoring and verifying 24/7 for more than 120 days," Reyes told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>The record "is undoubtedly one of the most extravagant" and required "a lot of work," she added.</p>
        
            <p>An admirer of Captain Nemo in Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Koch kept a copy of the 19th-century sci-fi classic on his bedside table beneath the waves.</p>
