            <p>The death toll from Japan's devastating New Year's Day earthquake has risen to 161, authorities say.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts are continuing in attempts to find more than 100 people who remain missing a week later.</p>
        
            <p>But bad weather is hampering rescuers - with heavy rain and snow triggering warnings of landslides and building collapses.</p>
        
            <p>The 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the remote Noto peninsula - toppling buildings and sparking a major fire.</p>
        
            <p>The majority of the deaths have happened in the hard-hit cities of Wajima and Suzu.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the number of people missing has dropped from 195 to just over 100. The death toll has jumped from the 120 reported on Sunday.</p>

            <p>More than 2000 people are reportedly still cut off due to massive damage to roads. Several others are living in emergency shelters.</p>
        
            <p>The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes.</p>
        
            <p>The defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had sent nearly 6000 troops out to help with the relief mission.</p>
        
            <p>They added that they believe there are still people alive who need rescue and vowed to continue their lifesaving operations despite the ending of a critical 72 hour window to find survivors.</p>

            <p>Stories of miraculous recoveries have been emerging. A woman in her 90s was found alive under rubble five days after the earthquake hit, in Suzu.</p>
        
            <p>Those in the worst-affected areas are being urged to keep their guard up as they continue to experience further quakes.</p>
        
            <p>As of early Monday local time, more than 1200 tremors had been recorded since New Year's Day, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.</p>
        
            <p>Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing in the Noto area since the end of 2020.</p>
        
            <p>More than 500 small and medium earthquakes have hit there over the past three years.</p>
