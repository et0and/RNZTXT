            <p>The new Ministry for Regulation has laid out some time frames for getting things done.</p>
        
            <p>Its new strategic intentions report released this week was short on dates, so RNZ asked the ministry when it aimed to get its immediate five jobs done by.</p>
        
            <p>For the first job - two regulatory reviews - it said it would send a draft report on the agricultural and horticultural products regulatory review to ministers by year-end.</p>
        
            <p>The other review, of early childhood education regulations, had prompted 2300 submissions - some 130 pages long - in a submission period that was extended given the high interest. It was now looking at the submissions, but gave no firm dates.</p>
        
            <p>It was upping regulatory capabilities by putting out online lessons - six by November and another four next April. The ministry said it was also setting up three or four groupings of regulators by the end of the year that could share ideas.</p>
        
            <p>A fourth job was to get a Regulatory Standards Bill passed, which it had begun advising over, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Timings are subject to Cabinet and engagement processes."</p>
        
            <p>As for its fifth and final immediate job, it was in the middle of giving advice about improving how regulatory assessments were done, the ministry said.</p>
