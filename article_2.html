            <p>Warning: The story contains details of animal abuse</p>
        
            <p>Two 4-month-old puppies were beaten so badly with a fence paling one never recovered and had to be euthanised.</p>
        
            <p>In July last year, Crimson Toto's neighbour called the SPCA after watching the man beat his two dogs, Hunnie and King, after they escaped his house and hid under a tree.</p>
        
            <p>As Toto lashed out with the fence paling at the dogs, which were of unknown breed, Hunnie ran down the road.</p>
        
            <p>But King ran onto the porch, where he was struck at least three more times before being taken inside.</p>
        
            <p>The neighbour heard thumps from inside Toto's house, accompanied by a "screaming puppy," Judge Jonathan Krebs described at Toto's sentencing in the Palmerston North District Court on two charges of willful ill-treatment of animalstoday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clear from the material that the dogs were under a significant degree of pain," Judge Krebs said.</p>
        
            <p>"You injured their bones and their internal organs.</p>
        
            <p>"You used extreme violence."</p>
        
            <p>The judge said after Toto's neighbour called the SPCA, the animal welfare charity immediately attended and confiscated the dogs.</p>
        
            <p>Veterinarian staff later found Hunnie had suffered a fractured pelvis and blunt trauma to one of her back legs.</p>
        
            <p>King, who took a longer beating, suffered a fractured thigh bone and injuries to his lungs.</p>
        
            <p>The SPCA noted he was cowering and afraid of men.</p>
        
            <p>That fear did not subside and despite attempts to have him adopted, he had to be returned to the SPCA and was later euthanised.</p>
        
            <p>Hunnie recovered from the injuries and was successfully adopted.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Krebs told Toto he was charged with the most serious offence of animal cruelty available.</p>
        
            <p>"The beating of a dog with a piece of wood, not once but many times, means what you did was serious."</p>
        
            <p>The judge noted while the beating Toto handed down was not sadistic, it was still "extreme".</p>
        
            <p>Judge Krebs said Toto had endured a rough home life and was subject to violence growing up and there was a clear link between his background and his offending.</p>
        
            <p>He sentenced Toto to 14 months home detention and disqualified him from owning a dog in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Following the sentencing, SPCA chief executive officer Todd Westwood said a veterinarian concluded the injuries would have caused severe pain for the puppies.</p>
        
            <p>"These puppies should have had better care from the person responsible for them, not made to cower in fear of being beaten," Westwood said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I am grateful to the member of the public for her brave intervention to get help for the puppies.</p>
        
            <p>"You heard their helpless screams and knew to take action, thank you."</p>
