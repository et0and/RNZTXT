            <p>Multiple investigations have been launched into allegations of animal cruelty on a farm leased by former NBC Today show host Matt Lauer.</p>
        
            <p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia-Pacific said an investigation into 11 farms and shearing sheds which supplied ZQ-certified wool - which claimed to be the "world's leading ethical wool brand" - revealed workers beating, kicking and stomping on sheep.</p>
        
            <p>Among them is Hunter Valley Station, which Lauer - who was sacked from his high-profile broadcasting gig in 2017 following accusations of sexual misconduct - bought the lease for, in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>"Farm workers at a property owned by former NBC host Matt Lauer stepped on a thrashing sheep's neck, dragged sheep across the floor, sewed up a sheep's bloody wound without any painkillers, and other atrocities," PETA alleged.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries confirmed it was investigating PETA's allegations.</p>
        
            <p>Graeme Todd, a New Zealand-based lawyer for Lauer, said his client had nothing to do with the day-to-day farming on Hunter Valley Station.</p>
        
            <p>Lauer's company leased the right to farm the property to Hunter Valley Farming Co Limited, which had hired shearing contractors, Todd said.</p>

            <p>Despite that, Lauer's company - Orange Lakes (NZ) Limited - was carrying out an investigation into PETA's claims.</p>
        
            <p>"These are extremely serious allegations that have been made and he's taking them seriously," Todd told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We alerted the Overseas Investment Office. We don't own the stock or plant - it's owned by a totally separate entity and that entity has contracted independent shearing contractors."</p>
        
            <p>Todd, who was also a director of Orange Lakes (NZ) Limited, said they would have more to say once their investigation was complete.</p>
        
            <p>"We are taking the matter extremely seriously because at the end of the day the company owns the farm and while we haven't got anything to do with it, this group [PETA] is trying to link the actions to Matt, which is a nonsense," Todd said.</p>
        
            <p>Digby Cochrane, who owned Hunter Valley Farming Co Limited, hung up the phone when contacted by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>However, a statement later provided to RNZ and attributed to a Hunter Valley Farming Company spokesperson said the company was also investigating.</p>
        
            <p>"The Hunter Valley Farming Company takes animal welfare very seriously and the company and its independent contractors must adhere to standards and procedures under New Zealand law and as administered under the Ministry of Primary Industries," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently investigating the allegations we have received from PETA with the independent contractors undertaking the shearing activity and are seeking advice from the Ministry of Primary Industries.</p>
        
            <p>"This will include our full cooperation with any further enquiries that the ministry wish to undertake. We have also made Mr Lauer aware of this situation and continue to keep him updated."</p>

            <p>PETA claimed it had uncovered cruelty at numerous farms and shearing sheds which were ZQ-certified.</p>
        
            <p>ZQ was a wool certification, developed and owned by The New Zealand Merino Company.</p>
        
            <p>The wool was sold to Allbirds, Barkers, Cavalier Bremworth, Hugo Boss, Icebreaker and others, according to ZQ's website.</p>
        
            <p>"Every garment made with 'ZQ-certified' wool is tied to the suffering of sheep who likely endured violent beatings, painful injuries from rough shearing and were ultimately slaughtered or discarded like trash," PETA Senior Vice President Jason Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>"PETA is calling on Allbirds, Smartwool, and other brands to reject this sham label and the cruelty it conceals and reminds consumers that the only humane option is to choose vegan materials."</p>
        
            <p>PETA Asia-Pacific gave its evidence to New Zealand officials and was urging them to investigate, the group said.</p>
        
            <p>MPI manager of animal welfare and NAIT compliance (South) Peter Hyde said an investigation was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"MPI has received a complaint and video clips alleging mistreatment of sheep by some shearers. We note some of the allegations date back to 2023. MPI is investigating the complaints."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ had also sought comment from The New Zealand Merino Company and the Overseas Investment Office.</p>
