            <p>Official figures show most Year 11 students attempted some NCEA level 1 standards in 2024, even though the qualification's popularity has fallen.</p>
        
            <p>Figures provided by Education Minister Erica Stanford showed there were 70,250 Year 11 students enrolled at secondary schools in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Of those, 45,038 (64 percent) participated in a full level 1 programme, down from 75 percent in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>However, a further 19,477 students were entered for some level 1 credits. Just 5735 were not entered for any level 1 credits.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, 64 out of 130 schools (49 percent) did not offer a full level 1 programme, and in Wellington the figure was 31 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In Southland, seven of 16 schools (44 percent) did not provide level 1, in Manawatū-Whanganui 25 percent, and in Hawke's Bay 23 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Considered by equity index band, level 1 was least popular among schools with fewer socioeconomic barriers (48 percent did not offer the qualification last year).</p>
        
            <p>Only 15 percent of the 221 schools facing moderate barriers did not offer level 1, and the figure for the 192 schools facing the most barriers was 17 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Changes to level 1 in 2024 reduced the number of standards on offer, and increased their credit value in a bid to ensure students studied each subject in depth.</p>
        
            <p>But in November, the Education Review Office said the qualification needed another overhaul.</p>
