            <p>Police have confirmed a fourth shoplifting charge has been laid against former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions from RNZ about reports of additional shoplifting charges against the 43 year old, a police spokesperson confirmed a fourth charge of shoplifting had been filed.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the new charge relates to an incident in Newmarket on 22 December and was reported to police in late January.</p>
        
            <p>The charge sheet shows Ghahraman is accused of stealing a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman was due to appear in the Auckland District Court on 28 February for her first appearance but will now appear on 20 March.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's earlier charges relate to the alleged theft of nearly $10,000 worth of goods from two other boutiques.</p>
        
            <p>She is accused of stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx store on 22 October.</p>
        
            <p>She is also charged with stealing $7223 of items from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods from the same store on 23 December.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years if convicted.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, she said stress relating to her work had led her to "act in ways that are completely out of character. I am not trying to excuse my actions, but I do want to explain them".</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma," she said.</p>
