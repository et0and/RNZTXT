            <p>US superstar Simone Biles said it was "just the right thing to do" after she and team-mate Jordan Chiles bowed down to Olympic gold medallist Rebeca Andrade after the floor final in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Biles had been hoping to win a fourth gold at these Games but a couple of mistakes meant she had to settle for silver behind the Brazilian.</p>
        
            <p>However, the 27-year-old, who is the world's most decorated gymnast, was far from disappointed and instead joined Chiles in showing admiration to Andrade in one of the iconic images of these Games.</p>
        
            <p>The trio also made history as the first all-Black podium in men or women's gymnastics at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"Rebeca's so amazing, she's a queen," said Biles. "She's such an excitement to watch and then all the fans in the crowd were always cheering for her, so it was just the right thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an all-black podium so that was super-exciting for us, but then Jordan was like 'should we bow to her?' and I was like 'absolutely'."</p>

            <p>Andrade, who lost out on the all-around title to Biles last week, appreciated the show of respect, saying: "It was very cute of them.</p>
        
            <p>"They are the world's best athletes and what they did means a lot to me. We're always rooting for each other, the final is very difficult for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Biles now has 11 Olympic medals after winning team, all-around and vault golds in Paris to go with her floor silver, while she was fifth in the beam final.</p>
