            <p>New Zealand company Rocket Lab is doing a dress rehearsal later today for its latest satellite mission.</p>
        
            <p>It aims to launch a small Earth-imaging satellite for a Japanese company next week from Māhia.</p>
        
            <p>It is the company's first since a rocket failed in September shortly after take-off.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab is also working on hypersonic tests flights for the US Department of Defense. These test the likes of sensors rather than launching operational payloads.</p>
        
            <p>However, the aim in early 2025 is to deploy an Australian-made 3m-long "dart" made by 3D printing, that can hit speeds up to Mach 7 or 8300km/h.</p>
        
            <p>With its own test capacity under strain, the Pentagon is turning to private companies in a bid to boost its hypersonic test flights to one a week.</p>
        
            <p>The Defense Innovation Unit signed its latest contract with Rocket Lab last month under the programme.</p>
        
            <p>The "project represents a paradigm shift in viewing the hypersonic realm as a place for aircraft, not just missiles and weapons", the unit said.</p>
        
            <p>The US is at the same time scrambling to deploy a hypersonic weapon amid fears of gains by China and Russia in developing super-fast missiles.</p>
        
            <p>A major military contractor, Leidos, turned to Rocket Lab in June for the inaugural launch from its Virginia site of a hypersonic "test bed" for the US Naval Surface Warfare Center.</p>
        
            <p>Suborbital missions like these are all run out of the US, by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Rocket Lab National Security, that it set up a year ago "to serve the defence and intelligence community" with services for "the US government and its allies".</p>
        
            <p>Leidos has four launches like this with Rocket Lab.</p>
        
            <p>"This will enable more robust and successful developments of hypersonic weapon systems," Leidos said.</p>
        
            <p>Leidos also has a half-billion-dollar contract with the US Air Force under a secretive hypersonic programme called Project Mayhem.</p>
        
            <p>The Pentagon has about 70 hypersonic programmes.</p>
        
            <p>"Hypersonic and suborbital test capabilities are key priorities for the nation [US], yet the DoD's ability to test these systems has been limited," Rocket Lab's senior director of global launch service, Brian Rogers, said on its website.</p>
        
            <p>Its missions based on its Electron rocket provided "frequent, and cost-effective" test opportunities from Virginia, he said.</p>
