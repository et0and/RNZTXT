        <p>
The watchdog says a merger would substantially hit competition and make it harder for other retailers to grow.

            <p>The Commerce Commission has declined Foodstuffs' proposal to merge its North Island and South Island divisions.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year the country's biggest supermarket operator agreed to bring the divisions together to create a national co-operative.</p>
        
            <p>The boards of Foodstuffs North and South Island divisions currently operate separately and run a number of well-known brands including New World, Pak'nSave and Four Square.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the Commerce Commission declined the proposal saying it would substantially lessen competition.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, chair Dr John Small said it would reduce the number of buyers of grocery products in New Zealand from three to two giving it greater buying power.</p>
        
            <p>"As a consequence of the substantial lessening of competition and the associated increase in buyer power, the merged entity would likely be able to extract lower prices from suppliers and/or otherwise adversely impact suppliers in the relevant markets.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also concerned that the consolidation with the proposed merger would lead to reduced investment and innovation by suppliers, meaning reduced consumer choice and/or quality of grocery products in New Zealand for consumers."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would also make it harder for other retailers to grow, potentially depriving consumers of a more competitive grocery sector in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs' proposal required Commerce Commission and High Court approval.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission can only grant clearance to a deal when it is satisfied it will not result in a substantial lessening of competition.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Foodstuffs North Island and South Island divisions said they were disappointed by the decision.</p>
        
            <p>North Island chief executive Chris Quin said the merger was a once in a generation opportunity for the supermarket operator to adapt to the market.</p>
        
            <p>"This merger is about bringing together the back-end support functions of our two regional co-ops to become more efficient and competitive, so we can better serve our customers. That's good for everybody.</p>
        
            <p>"For around a century our co-ops have taken the lead in adapting to changing consumer preferences, facing economic challenges, dealing with crises and finding new ways to deliver value and innovation at the checkout.  </p>
        
            <p>"The merger proposal continued that legacy and is an important step for us to keep delivering the best value and experience to customers nationwide."</p>
        
            <p>He said the co-ops remain convinced merging was the right thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>South Island chief executive Mary Devine said operating as one business would make more sense.</p>
