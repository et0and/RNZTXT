            <p>Photography fans and stargazers are in for a show this week.</p>
        
            <p>A "blue" supermoon will light up the sky across the world, with New Zealanders able to see it if our skies stay clear of clouds.</p>
        
            <p>Let's break down what that means and what you can expect.</p>
        
            <p>Technically, NASA says it will occur on Tuesday, 20 August at 4.26am EST. For New Zealand that is around dusk on Tuesday evening, with moonrise over our horizon about 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>That's because an optical illusion occurs when the Moon is sitting low on the horizon that makes it appear larger.</p>
        
            <p>And while Tuesday night is the peak time to catch the sturgeon supermoon, it will still look impressive on the nights and early mornings surrounding that day too.</p>
        
            <p>The moon doesn't actually grow bigger - it just looks that way.</p>
        
            <p>According to NASA, the term refers to when the Moon, either its full or new lunar phase, syncs up with a close swing around Earth.</p>
        
            <p>That is, when it is within 90 percent of its closest approach to Earth, to be exact.</p>
        
            <p>But since we can't see new moons very easily, the term most often refers to when the Moon is full.</p>
        
            <p>Because the Moon's orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle, there are times when it is closer to Earth.</p>
        
            <p>That's when it looks biggest to us on Earth.</p>
        
            <p>All the full moons throughout the year have names, which can be traced back to a US reference book called the Old Farmer's Almanac, first published in 1792.</p>
        
            <p>The book, which is published every September, contains things like weather pattern forecasts, moon phases and gardening tips.</p>

            <p>Each full moons' name was given to it based on seasonal milestones.</p>
        
            <p>Here's the name for each month's moon:</p>
        
            <p>You might have noticed some of these names - like the snow moon and cold moon - don't quite fit in with our calendar year.</p>
        
            <p>That's because the lunar names are based on Northern Hemisphere seasons.</p>
        
            <p>No.</p>
        
            <p>While that's what the name would suggest, the term 'blue moon' actually describes when we get multiple full moons in a given period.</p>
        
            <p>There are two kinds of blue moons.</p>
        
            <p>A seasonal blue moon refers to the third full moon in a season that has four.</p>
        
            <p>A monthly blue moon is when we get a second full moon within the same calendar month.</p>
        
            <p>This one earns its 'blue' status for being the third full moon in a season of four.</p>

            <p>You'd be forgiven for thinking blue moons are somewhat rare, thanks to the saying 'once in a blue moon'.</p>
        
            <p>But according to NASA, a monthly blue moon occurs once every two-and-a-half years.</p>
        
            <p>There can be rare occurrences around blue moons, though - it's not often we see two blue moons in the same year.</p>
        
            <p>That only happens about four times a century, with the most recent being in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>We usually get three or four supermoons a year.</p>
        
            <p>And because they always happen one after another, we'll see about that many in a row in the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>This will be the first supermoon of the year.</p>
        
            <p>According to the BBC's Sky at Night, the next ones will occur on:</p>
