        <p>

            <p>The Public Service Association is astonished the Minister of Education expects her agency to hire contractors to review the curriculum.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has proposed to cut more than 500 roles, including 200 in the curriculum centre.</p>
        
            <p>But Erica Stanford told Morning Report it would also bring in writing experts as short term contractors, to help write changes to the education programme.</p>
        
            <p>PSA assistant secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said hiring contractors was an appalling solution when people who could do the work were losing their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>"The government promised a crackdown on consultant and contractor spending, today's revelation is hypocritical and may end up costing more in the long run. It does not this make sense.</p>
        
            <p>"They are decimating the ministry at a time losing important capability in critical areas like the review of the curriculum."</p>
        
            <p>The public sector cuts were reckless and had not been thought through, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the breadth and depth of these brutal cuts it's clear that very soon ministries will be forced to bring back contractors just as happened under the last National-led government. The government should be upfront about how many contractors it will need to do the work of dismissed public servants in all agencies.</p>
        
            <p>"The minister's comments today expose the short-term decision-making behind this war on the public service."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the majority of roles cut in the curriculum centre were involved with the NCEA change programme, which the government had delayed.</p>
        
            <p>As well as contractors, the ministry would add roles to the curriculum team, including more staff in the regions to get more resources on the front line, she said.</p>
