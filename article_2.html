        <h2>Maya Angelou's poetry translated into te reo</h2>
        <p>
The African-American poet's experiences have a lot in common with those of many wāhine Māori, editor says.

            <p>A collection of ruri (poems) by Maya Angelou is the latest book to be translated into te reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>He kupu nā te māia is the 13th te reo book from Kotahi Rau Pukapuka, which aims to eventually translate 100 books into te reo.</p>
        
            <p>Editor Pania Papa said after researching Maya Angelou's poetry, it was easy to see similarities between her life as an African-American woman and the lives of many wāhine Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"Her poetry comes out of a place I think of trauma as well as oppression and the marginalisation of an African-American woman, so a lot of her poems talk about women and families and relationships within families and the complexities within that. To us that seemed to be a good fit for things Māori."</p>

            <p>Thirty-four wāhine from Te Panekiretanga o te Reo, the Institute of Excellence in the Māori Language, were chosen to translate and each had the option to choose one or two poems.</p>
        
            <p>That led to a huge variety in style of the translations, with each wahine bringing a whole host of different experiences in their own lives, Papa said.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the wāhine had contributed to the revitalisation of te reo in their communities, she said.</p>

            <p>"Often the wahine in this space are perhaps undervalued I would say, and go under the radar because a lot of our wāhine do so much but don't necessarily do it for the accolades and the praise.</p>
        
            <p>"So we have 30 voices transferring their experiences into Maya Angelou's words and I think that's going to be quite beautiful for people to read."</p>
        
            <p>Papa said translating poetry was a much more creative process when compared to translating narrative stories.</p>
        
            <p>Translators needed to draw on their knowledge of kupu whakarite (metaphor) and research every turn of phrase in order to understand the author's intention, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I find the poetry fun and a little bit more tricky."</p>
        
            <p>As part of the launch of the book, a group of wāhine Māori have turned some of Angelou's work into song, and will perform live at the Wellington Jazz festival.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a beautiful way to kick our book off and launch it with the tones of some beautiful wāhine Māori singers," Papa said.</p>
        
            <p>The show - called Oro Maia - will take place on 19 October at the Opera House.</p>
