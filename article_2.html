            <p>About 50 members of Ngāti Kahu are preventing people launching boats at Taipā, where the competition will be based on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The group says it was protesting over-fishing and a government proposal to introduce a bill redefining the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 500 people were expected to take part in the annual contest.</p>
        
            <p>Five police officers were understood to be present at the boat ramp.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were monitoring the event.</p>
