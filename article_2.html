        <h2>The Diplomat is back, here's what you need to know</h2>
        <p>
The first season of The Diplomat was a smash hit - and with the US presidential election around the corner, it's never been a better time to watch. Video

            <p>With the US presidential elections around the corner, it's never been a better time to tune into a political drama.</p>
        
            <p>The Diplomat - which has just dropped its second season - is the sharply funny and fast-paced thriller you need in your life; and parallels with real-life events makes this an even more compelling watch. And the world agrees, with season one debuting at No.1 on the streaming charts, and appearing in the Netflix Top 10 in 86 different countries.</p>
        
            <p>As the title suggests, the protagonist here is ambassador Kate Wyler (Keri Russell; The Americans), a career diplomat who's spent most of her working life in boots-on-the-ground roles in conflict-ridden regions.</p>
        
            <p>But as she prepares to go to Kabul, she is immediately reassigned to a much more public role as ambassador in the UK by US President William Rayburn (Michael McKean), and White House Chief of Staff Billie Appiah (Nana Mensah).</p>
        
            <p>And to make things even more complicated, on her first day in the job, she has to deal with a big international crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Created by Debra Cahn (The West Wing, Homeland), the series is inspired by ambassadors Cahn met while filming Homeland.</p>
        
            <p>With the second season now streaming, we thought we'd give you a briefing (see what we did there?) on why The Diplomat is one of the most exhilarating shows around.</p>

            <p>Wyler lands in London to start her brand-new job right as the British government is responding to an attack on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf.</p>
        
            <p>Given her experience in the Middle East, Kate hits the ground running, acting as an intermediary between the White House and British government, while obtaining intel from Iranian, Russian and French government officials.</p>
        
            <p>On a personal front, Kate's husband Hal Wyler (Rufus Sewell), a former diplomat himself, is relegated to a supporting role when he joins her, which creates tension in their already-failing marriage.</p>
        
            <p>Kate isn't your average diplomat - she hates public speaking and is averse to much personal grooming - and she's discomfited by her new high-profile role, with her team of advisers equally frustrated with her.</p>
        
            <p>As the professional and personal become intertwined, Kate discovers she's a potential replacement for the vice-presidency.</p>
        
            <p>Without giving too much away, series one ends on an explosive cliffhanger, which paves the way for an interesting turn of events for Kate in season two.</p>
        
            <p>Wyler is an astute observer, direct talker and quick thinker who's unafraid to take a risk for the greater good. She can shift from subtle subtext to casual affability to persuasive influence within minutes.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Simultaneously, she's highly anxious and constantly unsure of herself, making sartorial faux pas and profane remarks at every turn.</p>
        
            <p>After playing KGB officer Elizabeth Jennings for six seasons of The Americans, Russell brings a similar calculated, no-nonsense decisiveness to this role.</p>
        
            <p>With every covert meeting, phone call, corridor conversation and trilateral negotiation, political odds and strategies continually shift; you never know who or what to trust.</p>
        
            <p>The relationships here are crucial to the story: Kate's colleagues and confidantes - US deputy chief of mission at the embassy Stuart Hayford (Ato Essandoh) and CIA official Eidra Graham (Ali Ahn) - often disagree with her brash tactics and resistance to soft-diplomacy ploys; her husband, who is both a skilled diplomatic manipulator, her competition and a trusted adviser all in one, also keeps the ambassador and the viewer on their toes.</p>
        
            <p>Despite all this opposition, Wyler's unconventional style and political prowess make her both relatable and formidable, just like a charismatic political candidate.</p>
        
            <p>Like many workplace dramas, The Diplomat has attracted the interest of foreign-services professionals globally.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of detail in there that's really, really smart," Aaron Snipe, a spokesman with the US Embassy in London, told Politico.</p>
        
            <p>"[But] as a career diplomat, I must say you're watching it thinking, 'Wow, my job is not nearly as sexy as Ambassador Wyler's romps through foreign policy'."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to ABC Breakfast News, Debra Cahn reveals the extensive research that goes into creating the narrative detail on the show.</p>
        
            <p>"We talk to a lot of people … former ambassadors, people in the CIA, journalists, politicians," she says. "All of the nitty gritty of that is what makes the characters relatable and the world feel real."</p>

            <p>For her own research, Russell spent time with the actual US ambassador to the UK, Jane Hartley, attending lavish dinners with guests like Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton.</p>
        
            <p>"She's so stylish, she's so smart, she's so warm … I have the utmost respect [for her]," Russell told DC Film Girl.</p>
        
            <p>"Talk about people who have to be … sharp as a tack about so many world issues all at once."</p>
        
            <p>The lead-up to the US election makes it even more relevant, despite the cast claiming any plot parallels are coincidental, given how far ahead they shoot.</p>
        
            <p>Within the first episode of series one, US chief of staff Billie Appiah has a pointed conversation about Wyler's candidacy: "I just spent three years building a VP who could take a torch from an old man and get us another term. This was not my plan."</p>
        
            <p>The "special relationship" between the US and UK makes for compelling viewing, with the personal dynamic between the countries' leaders proving just as crucial as their political, cultural and historical ties.</p>
        
            <p>On top of this, both regions' relationships with Russia, and the UK's own internal tensions with rogue conservatives continue to provide fictional fodder with factual parallels.</p>
        
            <p>Season two picks up in the final moments of the cliffhanger finale, and kicks off into another action-packed season.</p>
        
            <p>"I love this kind of TV work," Russell tells ABC News film reviewer Zak Hepburn.</p>
        
            <p>"I prefer it to film, actually because you can unravel this character or a story in a much more concentrated way. You get to come back to it in a new year with all the same people and throw this grenade to it and see how it shifts everything."</p>

            <p>In another huge win for the season, Alison Janney joins the cast as vice president Grace Penn, reuniting with Cahn, who she worked with for seven seasons of The West Wing.</p>
        
            <p>Production is already underway for season three, so you're safe in the knowledge that there'll be more political hijinks and high-stakes drama to be had in the future.</p>
        
            <p>The Diplomat is streaming now on Netflix.</p>
