        <h2>Gore council CEO saga takes new twist</h2>
        <p>
A former council chief financial officer says he was pushed out - and has announced his intention to seek the top job, even though he's now based in the UK.

            <p>The search for Gore District Council's next chief executive is gathering steam after a former chief financial officer, who says he was pushed out, announced his intention to seek the top job.</p>
        
            <p>Gore mayor Ben Bell said he hoped the unexpected publicity boost would help recruitment and from early next year the council could just get on with its work.</p>
        
            <p>It had been almost two decades since Doug Walker last called Gore home.</p>
        
            <p>But the UK-based accountant said he would happily come back to Southland to take over as Gore District Council's most senior unelected official.</p>
        
            <p>"Gore is a special place for me, so I feel like Gore ratepayers have had a bit of a raw deal and obviously through the petitions and the protest, they're not happy about what's going on at the council," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>He worked at the Gore District Council from 2004 until 2006 and ended his time there as chief financial officer.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was unsupported and bullied by chief executive Stephen Parry and ultimately felt pushed out of the job despite, in his view, doing excellent work.</p>
        
            <p>His time at the council had motivated him to apply for the chief executive vacancy, but it had nothing to do with revenge, Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think part of it is redemption, just showing that what happened to me many, many years ago should never have happened."</p>
        
            <p>But he also felt he had the skills to do the job successfully and turn around the council's finances.</p>
        
            <p>If successful, he wanted to instil a positive and supportive work culture at the council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The nexus of the vacancy was the very public falling out between the Gore District Council's chief executive and mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Parry had held the role since 2001.</p>
        
            <p>Bell was elected over long-time incumbent Tracy Hicks in October last year.</p>
        
            <p>The pair butted heads almost instantly, and by December were in mediation and not speaking.</p>
        
            <p>That led to some councillors trying to get Bell to resign, while in response a public petition calling for Parry to go made its way to the council table.</p>
        
            <p>Following what RNZ understood was a mediation process in June, Bell and the council apologised to Parry and in September he announced his resignation as chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>But last month, a majority of councillors appointed him to take on an interim chief executive's role until a replacement was found.</p>
        
            <p>Bell was not among those in favour.</p>
        
            <p>But he told RNZ anyone could apply for the open role, including Parry.</p>
        
            <p>"He's welcome to apply for it, just as much as anyone else," Bell said.</p>
        
            <p>"But my impression - not speaking for Mr Parry, but my understanding from what other councillors have told me is that he's not interested in doing anything past this interim contract."</p>

            <p>Parry told RNZ he had not even thought about applying for his former role, but if he was he would not be discussing it in the media.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm focusing on the interim role to provide stability and continuity at this time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He did not want to comment further on the recruitment of a new chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>Bell said, while somewhat surprised, he was pleased with the boost the recruitment drive had got through Doug Walker's public announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually really looking forward to seeing who will come forward and I'm hoping there's a gem in the rough out there that we can snatch up," Bell said.</p>
        
            <p>It was hoped a new chief executive would be in place by early next year.</p>
        
            <p>But would that be the end to the tension and in-fighting of the past 12 months?</p>
        
            <p>"Never say never," Bell said, with a laugh.</p>
        
            <p>"The people around the table are still the exact same. But, yes, hopefully we can all move on and see what the new chief executive brings to the table."</p>
        
            <p>A petition calling for Parry to be removed from the interim chief executive role was expected to go to the council next week, as was a report on the recruitment process.</p>
