            <p>The biggest news in New Zealand football so far this year is Wellington Phoenix goalkeeper Alex Paulsen signing with English Premier League club Bournemouth.</p>
        
            <p>But he's just the crest of a wave of news about our players exceeding on the world stage. </p>
        
            <p>Nearly a year after our nation co-hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup, it's not just the women who've reached higher - our men are making themselves known around the globe.</p>
        
            <p>They include Chris Wood, Liberato Cacace, Matt Garbett, Marko Stamenić, and Ben Waine.</p>
        
            <p>On today's episode of The Detail, Jason Pine - host of Newstalk ZB's Weekend Sport and a Sky Sport football commentator - takes us through the big names and whether they have any chance of elevating our relatively poor football record.</p>
        
            <p>"A year ago, if you asked 'who is Alex Paulsen?', even dyed-in-the-wool football fans probably would've scratched their heads," Pine says.</p>
        
            <p>"In the [Phoenix] season just past, their best ever season in their 17 year history, he was a big part of their run all the way to within one game of the grand final. He had the highest save percentage in the entire A-League across all 12 teams... basically [he] had a season to dream of in goal for the Wellington Phoenix.</p>
        
            <p>"What that's done is turned a lot of heads, including some in the premier league in the UK. Bournemouth FC - not a big club...but a proper premier league club, have come in and have basically bought Alex Paulsen from Wellington Phoenix, for a fee of around $2 million."</p>
        
            <p>The structure of the deal is complex and largely confidential but if Paulsen gets useful game time, the benefit to the Nix could double. </p>
        
            <p>Pine also talks about the prospects for the All Whites with all these good young players available, and the ups-and-downs of the women's teams.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a bit of a challenging time for the Football Ferns," he says. </p>
        
            <p>"Leading into the World Cup and off the back of the World Cup, they had that wonderful night at Eden Park where they beat Norway in the opening game - Hannah Wilkinson's goal - a seminal moment in New Zealand sport... but apart from that it's been pretty slim pickings.</p>
        
            <p>"They're off to the Olympics as well but they're in a very tough group... something needs to change there for there to be an upswing in fortunes in that team."</p>
        
            <p>But the game is strengthening in New Zealand as well with a second A League team, Auckland, kicking off this season, and Pine says the outlook for football here looks positive. </p>
        
            <p>"It's become a very popular choice for young boys and girls and the development of our young players has improved as a result," Pine says.</p>
        
            <p>"There are more and more clubs and academies around the country taking it seriously now.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not saying it's football's time and I don't think football should ever pretend that it's going to usurp rugby or rugby league to win the hearts and minds of Kiwi sports fans - but it's certainly a genuine option for youngsters and the results are starting to catch people's eyes."</p>
