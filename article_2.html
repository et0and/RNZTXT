            <p>An Invercargill city councillor has publicly revealed his disdain for the use of te reo Māori in names after making an incorrect assumption at a meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred on Tuesday as councillors worked through a report on fees and charges, one page at a time, during an ordinary meeting.</p>
        
            <p>When elected members reached a section on the soon-to-be-built Te Unua Museum of Southland, mana whenua representative Evelyn Cook pointed out the complex had been incorrectly titled 'Southland Museum and Art Gallery Te Unua' in the report.</p>
        
            <p>Cook also noted the charges detailed in that section related to services delivered by Te Kupeka Tiaki Taoka Trust - the board which oversaw the museum collection - which had not been mentioned anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Michael Day confirmed the page had been incorrectly titled and said it needed to be changed.</p>
        
            <p>First term councillor Barry Stewart then interjected.</p>
        
            <p>"Are we going to reverse all these European names and put the Māori names first on everything? Because I'm going to object every time."</p>
        
            <p>"Evelyn's busy saying, I'm presuming she's saying, that the Māori name should be above."</p>
        
            <p>When a councillor sitting next to Stewart confirmed it was the name of the museum, Stewart responded: "I didn't agree to it."</p>
        
            <p>Chairman Tom Campbell clarified the museum's collection had a te reo name which needed to be reflected in the report, while Cook reiterated it was a matter of consistency.</p>
        
            <p>"If we are going to be consistent with decisions we have already made at this table, then the documents we produce should also reflect that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stewart was elected in 2022 as the twelfth and final councillor by a narrow margin of 26 votes.</p>
        
            <p>Standing as a member of mayor Nobby Clark's Let's Go Invercargill team, he semi-retired from his gas fitting business to take up the position.</p>
        
            <p>In his candidate statement, Stewart said he was strongly against "the framework around co-governance".</p>
        
            <p>By law, te reo Māori is an official language of Aotearoa, alongside New Zealand Sign Language.</p>
        
            <p>English is considered a de facto official language due to its widespread use.</p>
