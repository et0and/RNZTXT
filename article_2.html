        <h2>Desert Road to re-open after two-month closure</h2>
        <p>
State Highway 1 between Tūrangi and Waiouru has been shut since mid-January, forcing a 40-minute detour.

            <p>The Desert Road in the central North Island will re-open on Friday after a two-month closure for major roadworks.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 between Tūrangi and Waiouru has been shut since mid-January, forcing a 40-minute detour.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agency's contractors had now rebuilt and repaired 28 lane kilometres of road - 12 more than planned - and completely rebuilt the deck of the Mangatoetoenui Bridge, said maintenance and operations regional manager Roger Brady.</p>
        
            <p>"By doing the work under full road closures, more invasive construction methods can be used which would not be possible under stop/go traffic management," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It means SH1 is being brought up to a higher standard quickly, and New Zealanders can get back on a quality road surface sooner," Brady said.</p>
        
            <p>It was part of the country's "largest and most ambitious" maintenance project: the Tīrau to Waiouru maintenance programme.</p>
        
            <p>Before the works, Waka Kotahi said the stretch of the road was one of worst in Waikato, and among the most challenging to fix.</p>
        
            <p>The road would reopen at 1pm on Friday 14 March with traffic management and speed restrictions in some parts for three to four days.</p>
        
            <p>Further work to finish the road surfacing would happen later in the year, and mostly carried out at night.</p>
        
            <p>When the closure was announced the chief executive of a Māori trust that administers land in the area said he was blindsided.</p>
        
            <p>A transport industry group said it would increase freight costs by $100,000 a day - but it supported the move, saying the road had to be fixed.</p>
        
            <p>The closure was a welcome boost to Ruapehu businesses, diverting traffic to small towns like Ohakune, National Park, Taumarunui and Raetihi.</p>
