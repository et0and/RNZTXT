            <p>It was a wet and windy night for many, particularly those in Wellington and the upper and west of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>There were around 350 households without power in the Wellington region this morning, though they have since been restored.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency attended six call-outs for loose building materials in the wind last evening.</p>
        
            <p>Orange strong wind warnings are in place for Wairarapa, Wellington and the Marlborough Sounds until midmorning.</p>
        
            <p>Flight disruption at Wellington Airport continues following flight and ferry cancellations on Thursday amid severe gales which damaged roofs and power lines.</p>
