            <p>South Korea's opposition-led parliament impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday, voting to suspend him from his official duties over his short-lived attempt last week to impose martial law.</p>
        
            <p>Under the constitution Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was appointed by Yoon, becomes acting president.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon is the second conservative president in a row to be impeached in South Korea. Park Geun-hye was removed from office in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>The motion was carried after some members of Yoon's People Power Party joined the opposition parties, which control 192 seats in the 300-member national assembly, clearing the two-thirds threshold needed for impeachment. The number of lawmakers supporting impeachment was 204, with 85 against, three abstentions and eight invalid ballots.</p>
        
            <p>Although suspended, Yoon remains in office. The Constitutional Court will decide whether to remove him sometime in the next six months.</p>
        
            <p>If Yoon is removed from office, a snap election will be called.</p>
        
            <p>Yoon shocked the nation late on 3 December when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers in order to root out what he called "anti-state forces" and overcome obstructionist political opponents.</p>
        
            <p>He later apologised to the nation but also defended his decision and resisted calls to resign ahead of the vote.</p>
