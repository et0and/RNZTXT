            <p>"Reports have led us to believe this was not the only incident, and there may be further victims to his alleged offending," a police spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>The driver was said to be waving a firearm out the window while following a red vehicle, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"This behaviour is very concerning and presents a risk to members of the public.</p>
        
            <p>"If you witnessed a similar offence recently and have not yet reported it to Police or witnessed the green van driving down Featherston Street yesterday, we would like to hear from you."</p>
        
            <p>Police were asking anyone with information to contact investigators by calling 105 or anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
