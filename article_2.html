            <p>The outpouring of community support following a spate of arson attacks on churches at the weekend has been staggering, Masterton's mayor says.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating after four churches across the Wairarapa town were set alight between 4am and 5am on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>There were also arson attempts at two other churches, and a funeral home chapel.</p>
        
            <p>A police presence would remain in the town on Monday, with officers continuing to conduct reassurance patrols in Masterton and nearby towns.</p>
        
            <p>Masterton mayor Gary Caffell said the attacks were shocking and locals had really rallied together.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been an outpouring of community support from tradespeople who are willing to help out, from organisations who have got halls and buildings that churches could have services in if they need to, it's just been remarkable," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Caffell said the churches were working with their insurers to assess the damage.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been amazed at the community support that's come through on this. They're also, like the rest of the community, very happy that there were no buildings absolutely destroyed or lives lost," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said on Saturday they were following up CCTV as well as a Facebook post in which a local man claimed he carried out those attacks.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday police cordoned off a road in the Masterton area while they worked the find the occupant of a vehicle of interest that was found abandoned.</p>
        
            <p>There was no information as to whether the cordons were related to the arson investigation.</p>
