            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Police Minister Mark Mitchell have announced a 22 percent drop in assaults in the Auckland CBD in the past year.</p>
        
            <p>The two spoke to media on Sunday afternoon at the Auckland Central Police Station.</p>
        
            <p>The government has just released a statement that police data shows that from 1 January to 31 July this year, there was a 22 percent reduction in serious assaults within the Auckland CBD compared with the same period last year, and an 18 percent reduction in serious assaults resulting in injury.</p>
        
            <p>"This shows that Auckland is turning a corner," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell agreed, saying in a statement that "a whole of system co-ordinated approach is working to make Auckland a safe city and one we can be proud to showcase as a gateway to New Zealand for overseas visitors".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon partly credits the drop in crime to a new scheme where police work closer with stakeholders and services including the Ministry of Social Development, Kāinga Ora and Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>The first meeting took place in May.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said New Zealanders are interested in results - not talking, meetings and bureaucracy.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had lots of people having lots of meetings. Lots of talking, lots of bureaucracy and the whole thing, no results.</p>
        
            <p>"And here you have an example where the agencies have come together, chosen to do things differently, as a group of people using their respective skills, and actually as a result have gotten a different set of outcomes. That's what we're interested in seeing."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister went on a ride-along with police Saturday night during the course of their duties, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said most New Zealanders are "blissfully unaware" of what police officers have to deal with.</p>
        
            <p>He said there "was a consistent theme" of mental health callouts during his ride-along on Saturday night.</p>

            <p>Cross-government action to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour in Auckland is getting traction, Mitchell said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Our central cities should be great places to live and work, but in recent years they have become hot spots for crime and anti-social behaviour. In Auckland, businesses and residents suffered as violent and retail crime soared.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis ought to feel safe going about their daily lives, and that is why this government is focused on restoring law and order, and putting victims first, ahead of offenders."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon criticised the previous Labour government as "soft on crime" during his remarks.</p>
        
            <p>There have been a flurry of homicide investigations in Auckland in the past several weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said 97 people have also been referred for addiction and family wellbeing, and accommodation support between July and 10 September, using a new joined-up approach.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative has been running since May, and links police up with the Ministry of Social Development, Kāinga Ora and other social services.</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City said it was delighted with the commitment from government to the cross-agency approach to addressing crime and social issues to complement local initiatives in Auckland's city centre - bringing results to issues that the organisation has been lobbying for since the Covid period.</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck said in a statement that "There is a noticeable difference to how the city centre feels - the additional police and the significant local resources including our own safety team has made a positive impact. This is showing in crime trending down and the feedback that we get from local businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst there is a still a way to go to become the vibrant, safe, 24/7 city we aspire to, we're also really pleased about the progress being made on addressing other areas of concern such as mental health, addiction and housing."</p>
        
            <p>In response, Labour said police have been working hard to combat crime in Auckland CBD, but the government is just shifting the problem elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>Labour pointed to an increase in thefts, assaults and related offences, when looking nationwide over the first five months.</p>
        
            <p>The party's police spokesperson, Ginny Andersen, said the government has spent nearly a year in government cutting funding for support services.</p>
        
            <p>"I am concerned the Government is shifting the problem, not fixing it," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Pushing people out to the suburbs does not address the causes of crime.</p>
        
            <p>"There are underlying issues here, like drug and alcohol addiction, and mental health. These people need help, and the government has so far spent a year in government cutting funding from frontline support services and are yet to announce what will fill the gap now that police are pulling back on mental health callouts."</p>
