        <h2>MPs 'probably' deserve pay rises, former minister says</h2>
        <p>
Backbench MPs are paid twice as much as the average full-time worker, but their salaries are "way behind" what is appropriate, Chris Finlayson says. Audio

            <p>MPs need to stop turning down pay rises and take what they are offered, a former cabinet minister says.</p>
        
            <p>It has been six-and-a-half years since MPs got a pay bump.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Jacinda Ardern instituted a pay freeze for MPs in 2018 and her cabinet voted to take a pay cut in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>The independent Remuneration Authority is due to deliver its latest verdict on MPs' pay in the next couple of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as public sector jobs are being slashed, with more than 900 roles cut so far in a bid to reduce government spending.</p>
        
            <p>Former attorney-general Chris Finlayson told Checkpoint MPs "probably" deserved a pay rise as salaries had not risen in more than five years.</p>
        
            <p>Turning down pay rises was "virtue signalling", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They should be completely indifferent to what they receive and just accept it and get on with it."</p>
        
            <p>Currently, backbench MPs receive an annual salary of $163,961, while anyone who chairs a select committee gets $179,713.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet ministers are paid $296,007, as is the leader of the opposition.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's salary is $471,049.</p>

            <p>According to Stats NZ, the average annual salary or wage for full-time employees in the quarter to December 2023 was $82,576.</p>
        
            <p>Finlayson said MPs' salaries should remain high so that people from diverse backgrounds would choose that career path.</p>
        
            <p>"I always worry that if salaries aren't enough you're going to have every rich people entering parliament and only them, or the virtue signallers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There has to be a proper balance of what is an appropriate salary for the type of work that's done."</p>
        
            <p>Going into parliament should not mean "they don sackcloth and ashes and refuse renumeration", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I look at it in comparison to other very senior positions ... it's way behind what I consider to be an appropriate figure for a cabinet minister."</p>
