            <p>The Warehouse has confirmed it has plans to close their central city Wellington site as its lease will likely be not renewed.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand retail chain have been operating their store on Tory Street in the capital since 1994.</p>
        
            <p>It was shut for nearly a year after a fire in April 2023 meant it needed to refurbished and repaired.</p>
        
            <p>Warehouse General Manager of National Store Operations Shane Nalder said the company could confirm it was talking to its Wellington team about a proposal to close its store on Tory Street pending the end of its current lease on 30 June 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"We're absolutely gutted to be considering this closure.</p>
        
            <p>"The landlord has informed us they will not be entering into a new lease as they have different plans for the site.</p>
        
            <p>"We enjoy having a presence in central Wellington, but it's really tough to find the sort of sites we need in this part of inner Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said Tory Street was an important part of their network.</p>
        
            <p>"We've loved being part of the Wellington city community over the past 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, we've exhausted all options to stay at this site.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not the outcome we wanted."</p>
        
            <p>He said the plans to close the store were particularly disappointing given the store only reopened last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team has worked incredibly hard to serve our customers in Wellington, and we're committed to supporting them through this consultation process."</p>
        
            <p>While this proposal is under consideration, Tory Street remains open for business.</p>
        
            <p>The store's last day of trading would be 31 May 2025.</p>
