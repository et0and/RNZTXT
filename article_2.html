            <p>A Wellington based clothing brand with a focus on sustainability will shut its doors for a second time in early April.</p>
        
            <p>Nisa, which means 'women' in Arabic, was founded in 2017 and aimed to create employment opportunities for women with refugee and migrant backgrounds.</p>
        
            <p>The clothing brand made sustainable underwear, swimwear and activewear.</p>
        
            <p>The business previously closed down in July 2023, but was revived after staff fund-raised through a Pledge Me campaign that doubled its original target of $80,000 and raised over $165,000.</p>
        
            <p>Nisa said in a statement on its website, 31 refugee women had been employed with the brand.</p>
        
            <p>It attributed its closure to a drop in sales and rising costs.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel that if we raise our prices any more to cover [costs] our products will be unattainable for our customers, which really starts to go against how we want to operate as a retailer. So, we have decided to close Nisa."</p>
        
            <p>The online store will shut down on 8 April at midnight, with the Wellington store closing on 12 April.</p>
