        <h2>Police impound cars after illegal 'skid meets'</h2>
        <p>
About 100 cars were involved in the gatherings, and police are warning they'll be out in full force to stop anti-social behaviour.

            <p>Police have impounded cars, issued infringement notices and ordered vehicles off the road after eight illegal 'skid meets' in Canterbury overnight.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 cars were involved in the illegal activity, with police interrupting six skid meets in Christchurch and two in Rolleston.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Craig Scott said three vehicles were impounded for sustained loss of traction, and 18 infringement notices were issued to other drivers.</p>
        
            <p>Two vehicles were given green stickers for compliance issues, while another was deemed unsafe and given a pink sticker, preventing it from being driven.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen too many instances where this illegal behaviour has put lives at risk, caused injury, and created unrest in our communities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The results of last night's operation in Canterbury show that we're pushing back on this unwanted activity."</p>
        
            <p>Police were not standing for this kind of behaviour, he said.</p>

            <p>"Canterbury Police will have a much larger presence on the roads from tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"We're sending a message to everyone who takes part in these events: Expect us to be waiting for you."</p>
        
            <p>It was not just Canterbury that would have increased police presence, however - police across both the North and South Island were on high alert.</p>
        
            <p>Additional staff and resources - including the Police Eagle helicopter - had been redeployed to support several operations taking place over the long weekend throughout Aotearoa, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists would notice an increased police presence on the roads, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask the public to be patient with us as we work across the weekend - Eagle is highly effective and one of our best tools available to target this type of behaviour," Assistant Commissioner Sandra Venables said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you hear the helicopter overhead, please don't be alarmed - we hope you will be reassured that we are taking action against illegal activity in your community."</p>
        
            <p>Scott asked the public to get in touch if they had information about the meets, including details of cars, license plate numbers of what streets they were meeting on.</p>
        
            <p>"We're asking the community for as much information as possible about these anti-social gatherings," he said.</p>
