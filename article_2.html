            <p>Hundreds of people have marked the start of Matariki Festival in Auckland on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Tamaoho led the karakia at the pre-dawn ceremony at Pukekohe Hill with an acknowledgement of the stars of Matariki, in preparation for the national Matariki holiday.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's Māori identity lead Melz Huata-Lucas was stoked with the turnout.</p>
        
            <p>"This morning was such a special way to start Matariki Festival, alongside our partner Ngāti Tamaoho. The skies were clear, the birds were singing, the rain stayed away so we could see the whetu.</p>
        
            <p>"These events mark the launch of Matariki Festival with over 90 events happening around Tāmaki Makaurau. We invite everyone to take part in events around the region to learn more about Matariki and te ao Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Following the morning karakia, Matariki i te Marae saw all welcomed onto Nga Hau e Wha O Pukekohe Marae with a powhiri, before sharing breakfast together and being entertained by kapa haka, waiata and a special performance from the New Zealand Dance Company.</p>
