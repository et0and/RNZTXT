        <h2>What to expect out of this weekend's new-look All Black team</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - Who out of the six new faces has the most to gain, who leads the haka and what does it all mean in the long run, asks Jamie Wall.

            <p>Analysis - Just who out of the six new All Black faces has the most to gain this weekend? That's one of the storylines that is worth talking about in the lead up to Saturday's test against Fiji, with the others being more of the off field and long-term variety anyway.</p>
        
            <p>It will be a special day for Hurricanes centre Billy Proctor, Chiefs number eight Wallace Sititi, Hurricanes prop Pasilio Tosi, Crusaders hooker George Bell, Blues lock Sam Darry and Crusaders halfback Noah Hotham when they run onto Snapdragon Stadium - especially Darry and Hotham, neither of whom were in the initial All Black squad. It will also mean Billy and brother Matt Proctor will become the 48th set of brothers to have played for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Right now, it probably feels like Proctor is in the best position to push for a top side spot, but that's probably saying more about the rest of the positions than anything else. The All Black midfield was in an intense battle with its English counterparts over the last couple of tests and struggled to get much going, however it'll take a combination of what Proctor does and what Rieko Ioane doesn't in order for a shift to take place there.</p>
        
            <p>Of the others: Sititi has Ardie Savea in his way. Hotham will have to get past Cortez Ratima, Finlay Christie and a fully fit TJ Perenara. Tosi may well be an alternate for Tamaiti Williams but the propping rotation is very solid now. Darry is a place holder for Patrick Tuipulotu and Bell will need one of Codie Taylor or Asafo Aumua to get injured, as well as Samisoni Taukei'aho to stay injured, if he's going to stay in the squad. So, it very much looks like an All Black test team that might take the park in a Rugby Championship game in about 2026.</p>

            <p>Others with a bit of a point to prove include Aumua, because the All Black lineout was an abomination over the last fortnight, so his combinations with his jumpers will be under the microscope. Tupou Vaa'i gets only his third start at lock in 26 tests, with the other two (against Italy and Japan) being not well remembered for his impact. Williams will be wanting to empty his tank before he's replaced, he and Ethan Blackadder have only played a combined nine games of rugby this season so simply getting through this without injury will be their main concern.</p>
        
            <p>Another interesting question is just exactly who leads the haka, with Perenara out and Codie Taylor rested it means there will be a debutant in that space too. Ardie Savea is probably the most likely candidate, however it would be a nice surprise to see Scott Barrett follow in the footsteps of fellow captains Kieran Read and Richie McCaw.</p>

            <p>The main concern for the All Blacks though is that if things turn pear-shaped, there's no real attacking experience other than Jordie Barrett on the bench to bail them out. It is worth remembering that in the first test of the last series these sides played, the Vern Cotter-coached Fijians absolutely took it to the All Blacks in the first half and only trailed 21-11 at the break. The final score was 57-23 to the All Blacks, but only after Dane Coles came off the bench and scored an astonishing four tries in the last 20 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Really though, the score line will be of little importance to Scott Robertson. This test is about field testing a few ideas and seeing what his new boys can bring, as well as making sure no one gets hurt - because it is telling that we're only two tests into the season and are already seeing players from outside the squad not only brought in but named to play.</p>
        
            <p>This San Diego trip is more a test for NZ Rugby's latest foray into the American market anyway. It's not the first and it's unlikely to be the last, but it is a good barometer of where they stand as a global sporting brand. The new, shiny Snapdragon Stadium holds 35,000 so it will be interesting to see just how many of those seats are filled on Saturday afternoon NZT.</p>
