            <p>A Wellington McDonald's has been forced to revert to cash and paper dockets after a system breakdown.</p>
        
            <p>The fast food chain has been hit with a global outage with reports of system malfunctions in New Zealand, Australia and Japan.</p>
        
            <p>The restaurant on Manners Street in the capital said their computers went down Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>A staff member said half the system is back working just before 9pm but the kitchen order screens are still showing "loading" signs.</p>
        
            <p>He said staff are writing down or verbally giving orders to people working in the kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>Similar problems have also been reported in the UK and Canada.</p>
        
            <p>McDonaldâ€™s customers in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong reported having trouble ordering at the fast-food restaurants on Friday, as some operators cited technical problems with ordering systems. https://t.co/2Hg6glJZKz</p>
        
            <p>A McDonald's NZ spokesperson told The New Zealand Herald, "McDonald's restaurants are experiencing an IT issue that's impacting their ability to process orders.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team is working to rectify the issues as soon as possible and we thank customers for their patience."</p>
