            <p>Overthrown Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow after being granted asylum in Russia, according to Russian state media TASS, citing a source in the Kremlin.</p>
        
            <p>"Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia, for humanitarian reasons, has granted them asylum," the Kremlin source said, according to TASS</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Syrian rebel forces reached additional cells in the notorious Saydnaya prison on Sunday, freeing more prisoners from inhumane conditions after seizing the capital Damascus and toppling the Assad regime.</p>
        
            <p>In one video streamed online by Al Jazeera news, rebel forces can be seen breaking down walls with sledgehammers, after the discovery of prison cells that appeared to be hidden. Footage shows hundreds of men shuffling out of the extremely overcrowded prison.</p>
        
            <p>"We are kept in the dormitory, with 25 people crammed together," one released prisoner can be heard telling a rebel fighter in the Al Jazeera video.</p>
        
            <p>"We only know some of each other's names because we are forced to sit and look down at all times."</p>
        
            <p>The freed detainee, from Aleppo, said he had been imprisoned since 2019 for trying to run from regime military service. He said he was once hit on the head with a hammer by Syrian regime guards and detailed the brutality of the Syrian forces, who held control of the prison just days before.</p>
        
            <p>"The day before yesterday, at 4am in the morning, they took us out. They took 60 people from our block. Two (guards from the regime forces) with pump-action shotguns escorted us and took three of our group, saying they were being taken for execution," the freed detainee said in the video.</p>
        
            <p>Other social media videos circulating Sunday showed women and at least one child being freed from the prison.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, video from outside the prison walls shows people searching for their imprisoned loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>A 2023 report by the United Nations Human Rights Council detailed "widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" in detention facilities of the Syrian regime.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017, an Amnesty International report claimed as many as 13,000 people had been hanged from 2011 to 2015 at Saydnaya Prison in a secret crackdown on dissent against the Assad regime.</p>
