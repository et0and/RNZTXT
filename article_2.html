            <p>A fallen tree has blocked a busy Auckland highway and caused a crash.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency said a tree fell onto the Southwestern Motorway in Onehunga about 1.30am.</p>
        
            <p>It closed the highway between the Neilson Street off-ramp and Hillsborough Road on-ramp.</p>
        
            <p>At 7.30am emergency services were called to a crash at the fallen tree.</p>
        
            <p>The crash was cleared by 8am, but NZTA said the highway remained closed as crews removed the tree.</p>
        
            <p>"Please keep following the detour and allow extra time for your journey," a spokesperson said on social media.</p>
