            <p>Public sector cuts appear to be having an impact, particularly in Wellington, the latest jobs statistics show.</p>
        
            <p>More than 3000 jobs have already been announced as going from government departments and agencies.</p>
        
            <p>And Trade Me data showed listings for jobs in central government were down 77 percent year on year, and 34 percent for the past three months.</p>
        
            <p>The average salary in Wellington was down 3.3 percent on the previous quarter to $72,062, the biggest percentage drop across all the regions.</p>
        
            <p>The number of job applications in Wellington increased by about 18 percent compared to the last three months of 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me's Matt Tolich said Wellington was beginning to show the impact of public sector job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Overall the number of job listings in the three months to March rose, up 11.7 percent compared to the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Tolich said that showed employers were still looking for staff despite the challenging economic conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Among the biggest increases in listings were in agriculture, office and administration and the hospitality and tourism sectors."</p>
        
            <p>The number of overall applications was also up for the quarter, by 15.4 percent, driven by migration and those who had lost their job, Tolich said.</p>
