            <p>Hamish Cleary, 20, likes making things in building class, enjoys gardening and loves mowing lawns.</p>
        
            <p>Like many students, Hamish is pondering what to do when he leaves school later this year.</p>
        
            <p>But while other students might consider going into further education, training or employment, Hamish faces more obstacles.</p>
        
            <p>Rangiora High School Lighthouse programme teacher Julia Malcolm said Hamish and other young people with special needs have a full programme at school.</p>
        
            <p>They have a range of conditions, including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, but have willingness to learn and live meaningful lives, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The challenge is transitioning from school into the workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"Trying to find places for these students to 'work' in some way - either volunteering, or work experience is really hard." Malcolm said.</p>
        
            <p>"They all really want to be doing something meaningful aside from their recreational activities in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"They are very capable, willing, resilient, and lovely people to work with."</p>

            <p>Malcolm is keen to hear from local employers willing to offer work experience for Hamish and other young people.</p>
        
            <p>She said the students would be supported with a learning assistant, if necessary.</p>
        
            <p>"They just need people who are empathetic and prepared to give a bit of extra time and creativity to think how they could be included in the workplace."</p>
        
            <p>The school's Board of Trustees backs the programme.</p>
        
            <p>Presiding member Simon Green said the board "is immensely proud" of the staff and students in the Lighthouse programme.</p>
        
            <p>"The success stories emerging from this programme are a testament to the passion and hard work of our staff and the connection to our local community is critical.</p>
        
            <p>''We value the long standing relationships we have with our local businesses and hope that more will see the value of supporting our young people."</p>

            <p>There are 35 students in the Lighthouse programme, including 16 in the senior transition class and 19 in the junior classes.</p>
        
            <p>The students can stay at school until they turn 21, with many of the senior students supplementing their programme with mainstream classes in a range of subjects.</p>
        
            <p>Last year senior students began working on the Duke of Edinburgh programme, on top of their regular activities out in the community.</p>
        
            <p>The Lighthouse programme students have interests similar to other students.</p>
        
            <p>Jonty Campbell (19) likes art and gardening, Jessica Higgs (20) likes spending time in the garden, art and drawing, and Midge Walesby (16) likes learning French and te reo MƒÅori.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone wanting to help by offering opportunities for the Lighthouse students can contact Julia Malcolm on mmj@rangiorahigh.school.nz.</p>
