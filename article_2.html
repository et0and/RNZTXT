        <h2>New 63,000-seat stadium to be built in Brisbane for 2032 Olympics</h2>
        <p>
Queensland Premier David Crisafulli, who promised multiple times not to build a new stadium before the state election, declared Victoria Park was a "clear" choice.

            <p>A new 63,000-seat stadium will be built at Brisbane's Victoria Park for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland Premier David Crisafulli unveiled the plans for the Games today following a 100-day independent review into venues, infrastructure and transport.</p>
        
            <p>Crisafulli, who promised multiple times not to build a new stadium before the 2024 state election, declared Victoria Park was a "clear" choice.</p>
        
            <p>"It became a choice between the embarrassment of hosting the games at QSAC or a new stadium at Victoria Park," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Games must be held at a new stadium at Victoria Park.</p>
        
            <p>"Any other choice would have meant placing the government's interests ahead of the interests of Queensland."</p>
        
            <p>The Gabba, once touted as a future Olympics stadium, is now set to be demolished after the Games to make way for urban renewal.</p>
        
            <p>"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final - the Gabba's swansong," Crisafulli said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "no longer time" to upgrade the Gabba, adding the plan would deliver "for 2032 and beyond".</p>
        
            <p>"We're not Paris, we're not LA. This will be better, and it'll be the Queensland way, and that's what will make the Games great," Crisafulli said.</p>

            <p>The cost of the stadium, which is set to host the athletics and opening and closing ceremonies, is yet to be announced, although the 100-day review said it would come in at an estimated $3.785 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond the Games, Victoria Park is set to be the new home of the Brisbane Lions, Brisbane Heat and Brisbane Bulls, with the ability to host AFL, Test cricket and other events.</p>
        
            <p>The state government has committed to keeping the Olympics budget within the $7.1 billion funding envelope.</p>
        
            <p>Crisafulli apologised for breaking his election commitment that no new stadiums would be built, saying "I have to own that".</p>
        
            <p>A new national aquatic centre with a Games capacity of 25,000 and multiple pools will be built at the Centenary Pool at Spring Hill.</p>
        
            <p>Crisafulli said the development had the backing of key sporting bodies and would see many move their headquarters to Brisbane.</p>

            <p>The RNA showgrounds will host the athletes village and an upgraded 20,000-seat arena will host key events.</p>
        
            <p>A new 3000-seat show court arena will be built at the Queensland Tennis Centre, alongside 12 new match courts, ensuring the tournament will not be shifted to Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"Melbourne will not be taking the tennis from Brisbane - not on our watch," Crisafulli said.</p>

            <p>Crisafulli confirmed the state government would not proceed with the proposed Brisbane Arena as part of the Games plan, suggesting this would allow $2.5 billion the federal government had committed to the project to go towards the new Victoria Park stadium and aquatic centre.</p>
        
            <p>But he insisted this would not mean the "death" of the venue - as he revealed plans for a privately funded venture.</p>
        
            <p>"Let me be clear: Brisbane needs a world-class Brisbane arena in the CBD, full stop," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Under the 100-day review's proposal, the arena would still be backed with $2.4 billion in federal funding.</p>
        
            <p>However, the state government has rejected this, indicating it wants the Commonwealth's money to go to the Victoria Park stadium and the new aquatic centre.</p>
        
            <p>Crisafulli said the state government had instead received offers from the private sector to build an arena at the vacant GoPrint site at Woolloongabba for "a fraction of the cost for taxpayers".</p>
        
            <p>The panel's report suggests if the state government had continued with a publicly-funded Brisbane Arena, along with a Victoria Park stadium, the cost of the Games would climb from $7.1 billion to $8.791b.</p>

            <p>Outside the south-east, Rockhampton will host rowing on the Fitzroy River, while Townsville and the Whitsundays will co-host sailing.</p>
        
            <p>The Gold Coast will be home to an athletes village at Royal Pines, and will receive a new arena and upgrades to the city's hockey centre.</p>
        
            <p>New indoor sport centres will be built at Logan and Moreton Bay, alongside a new whitewater rafting centre in the Redlands.</p>
        
            <p>An equestrian centre of excellence will be built at the Toowoomba showgrounds.</p>
        
            <p>An athletes village will also be built at Maroochydore, where there will also be a new arena and cultural precinct.</p>
        
            <p>Football and basketball will be played in Cairns, with the possibility of cricket if it is included in the Games. Barlow Park stadium will be upgraded with a new grandstand to increase its capacity to 5000.</p>

            <p>In addition to venues for the events, the government has promised to deliver an improved transport network.</p>
        
            <p>It will include new rail lines and stations, northern and eastern Brisbane bus corridors, upgrades to the Pacific Motorway, and faster rail from Brisbane to the Gold Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A rail line running from Beerwah to Birtinya, called The Wave, will link with metro services which will run from the Sunshine Coast Airport to Maroochydore.</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced upgrades to the Bruce Highway, including the Tiaro Bypass, Rockhampton Ring Road and Goorganga Plains, and the Cairns Western Arterial Road, between Redlynch Connector Road and the Captain Cook Highway.</p>
