        <h2>Rainbow crossing on Auckland's K Road painted over</h2>
        <p>
It comes after a rainbow crossing in Gisborne was painted over earlier this week by Destiny Church members protesting a drag story-time event at the public library.

The crossing has been painted white, but rain has washed a lot of it away.

            <p>A rainbow crossing in central Auckland has been painted over with white paint overnight.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from Auckland Council confirmed the crossing on Karangahape Road had been painted over.</p>
        
            <p>Rain overnight has washed much of the white paint away, but remnants can still be seen on the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>On social media, Auckland Cental MP and Green Party co-leader Chl√∂e Swarbrick said she had contacted authorities to have the crossing repainted immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad and bizarre some people are spending their energy suppressing simple symbols of the visibility and pride of our - my - rainbow community. You can't paint over our existence. Love always wins."</p>
        
            <p>I am in touch with relevant authorities to have our Karangahape Rd rainbow crossing fixed immediately.</p>
        
            <p>In a similar incident in Gisborne, five people were arrested on Wednesday after a group of protesters returned to Gisborne's rainbow crossing with paint cans. The crossing had been restored after protest group linked with Destiny Church covered it in white paint in opposition to a drag storytime event at the local library.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council on Tuesday cancelled its Rainbow Storytime event due to safety concerns, after councillors and staff received "a large number" of threatening and intimidating messages.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
