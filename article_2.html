            <p>West Coast residents may face more waterspouts after one made landfall this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A waterspout hit Awatuna shortly after 12pm with reports of trees downed and some property damage.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecaster Tuporo Marsters said the waterspout was part of active shower clouds that popped up over the sea ahead of a front moving up the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>"A little bit of convergence in upwards motion sort of made those clouds a bit more convective.</p>
        
            <p>"There was enough to get some downdraft and entail a little bit of spin similar to what you get with a tornado."</p>
        
            <p>He said another front was moving up the West Coast and it could bring more waterspouts and thunderstorms to the area.</p>
        
            <p>That front is expected to clear the South Island Sunday night and move onto the North Island.</p>
