            <p>New Zealand boxer Mea Motu has defended her IBO super bantamweight world title against India's Chandni Mehra in Whangārei .</p>
        
            <p>Motu, buoyed by home support, was too quick and powerful for her Indian opponent.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Northlander Lani Daniels beat Australia's Desley Robinson for the IBF light heavyweight title.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the week Daniels described the Whangārei event as en emotional homecoming.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really hard to put into words, that's how much it means it's very special and close to my heart and I'm just trying to embrace the moment as best I can," Daniels said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait to put on the show but I need to knuckle down now, last week was a hell of a week. So I'm looking forward to putting my head down and unleashing the beast."</p>
        
            <p>Motu also said it had been invigorating to experience the huge outpouring of support from the local community.</p>
        
            <p>"Pukepoto, Te Rarawa my hometown, my marae. I'm proud to finally go back home and, you know for to have my people bring me back home, it's going to be something special to me," Motu said.</p>
        
            <p>Also securing a win was Auckland's Jerome Pampellone (pam-pe-lone) who fought hard for an emphatic victory against Mexico's Rogelio Medina.</p>
