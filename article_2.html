            <p>Authorities are warning of potentially catastrophic fire danger across parts of Victoria mid-week as the west of the state reels from a bushfire that has been burning for five days.</p>
        
            <p>The Bayindeen fire has burnt more than 19,500 hectares, destroying three homes north of Beaufort and another six near Raglan.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze has also claimed sheds, livestock and farming equipment.</p>
        
            <p>About 600 firefighters are working to suppress the fire, which has been burning since Thursday last week.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday afternoon, about 200 people gathered in Beaufort for a community meeting about the fires.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was Sandy Little, a wool farmer from Raglan who has been in the Country Fire Authority (CFA) for most of his life.</p>
        
            <p>He said the fire was like nothing he had seen before.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of the worst, fastest-moving fires I've seen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Little lost his wool shed and 70 sheep in the fire, but was grateful to still have his house standing.</p>
        
            <p>Other farmers have lost their homes and livestock too.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been miraculous saves, but lots of heartbreak too," Little said.</p>
        
            <p>Ballarat CFA incident controller Jon Rofe told community members gathered to be prepared for the coming week.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of Wednesday, Rofe said the strategy was to actively suppress the blaze, using an earth trail around the fire to create a break in the fuel and slow it down.</p>
        
            <p>He said locals would see an increase in fire activity and smoke as crews actively burned areas untouched by fire to remove fuel.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be increased aircraft activity as crews try to suppress the fire between the earth trail and where it was burning.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-four aircraft were working on the fire on Sunday, including water-bombing helicopters and observation craft.</p>
        
            <p>Rofe said if the fire broke out on the eastern side, it could spread over the Western Highway past Beaufort and head north-east towards Lexton and beyond.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria Police District Commander Jason Templar said the Western Highway could be shut if the fire posed a safety risk and alternative routes would be available.</p>
        
            <p>Health representatives told people with compromised health to wear masks to minimise smoke exposure during the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>Central Highlands Water reported no impact on drinking water quality to date, but people with private drinking water supply were urged to seek alternative sources.</p>
        
            <p>There have been reports of asbestos in some of the burn sites and anyone in these areas must wear an N95 mask.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Agriculture will have eight teams on the ground for welfare checks and urgent cases.</p>
        
            <p>The Mallee, Wimmera, and South West Victoria regions all have an extreme fire danger rating for Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Angus Hines did not rule out the fire risk reaching catastrophic levels for parts of Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>"If we do see those hot, dry, and windy conditions sharpen up even further, we could see very high and extreme fire dangers, or possibly a repeat of catastrophic fire danger for parts of the state," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Haines said moderate fire danger was forecast across most of the state on Monday and Tuesday along with cool, settled conditions, but this would change mid-week.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, hot and dry winds are forecast to gust from inland through the west of the state including the Mallee, Wimmera, and South West Victoria regions.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures are also set to soar with a high of 44 degrees Celsius forecast for Mildura, 37C for Horsham, and 36C for Beaufort.</p>
        
            <p>Haines said temperatures were likely to remain high for the rest of the week, with no rain forecast for the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>"The wind may die away, but we're still anticipating a number of regions will stay in high fire danger towards the end of the week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The forecast will be reassessed in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>CFA chief executive Jason Heffernan said the CFA, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Fire Rescue Victoria were working together to prepare for Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Heffernan said the CFA had requested support from New South Wales crews to help bolster firefighter numbers and prevent fatigue.</p>
        
            <p>He said residents as far away as Bendigo might smell or see smoke drift from the fire area as crews did strategic burnt offs.</p>
        
            <p>People should check the VicEmergency app or website if they are concerned.</p>
        
            <p>"It's likely to be smoke drift from this fire, but if in doubt, or you see a fire without firefighters in attendance, call triple-0," Heffernan said.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers from Tyers Fire Brigade, in Victoria's east, had an early start on Friday morning as they travelled about 375km to help fellow CFA crews battle an out-of-control bushfire in the state's west.</p>
        
            <p>Tyers CFA captain Ross Wisewood said he had immense pride for his volunteers who dropped everything they were doing to lend a hand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just about helping your mate, helping your community," Wisewood said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't do it for the medals or the honour; we do it to help our family."</p>
        
            <p>It was not uncommon for CFA volunteers to travel long distances to assist other brigades when bushfires got out of control.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, Wisewood said the CFA had become much better at ensuring available resources were sent to the right place at the right time.</p>
        
            <p>"We might be volunteers, but we pride ourselves on delivering a professional service to the community," he said.</p>
        
            <p>With more hot weather on the way this week, there are concerns bushfires could pop up in other parts of the state.</p>
        
            <p>However, Wisewood said the CFA would be ready.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot goes on in the background when we have those spike days," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's when state and [incident control centres] â€¦ start to hone down into smaller areas, smaller districts."</p>
