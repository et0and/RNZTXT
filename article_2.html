            <p>The Privacy Commissioner has no record of knowing that the Ministry of Social Development was using fake social media profiles to spy on beneficiaries for fraud.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ recently revealed that ministry staff set up the fakes to gather information through Facebook and other platforms.</p>
        
            <p>It paused the practice in 2021 and is now instituting a first-ever policy that bans it.</p>
        
            <p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner investigated and castigated the ministry in 2019 for collecting information about people from third parties.</p>
        
            <p>But the office said that while the investigation touched on the use of Facebook in one case study, "this did not raise the issue of fake social media personas".</p>
        
            <p>It told RNZ, in response to an Official Information Act request, that it had no record of the ministry telling it about the use of the fakes.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry, in its online privacy policy, told clients what information it gathered, but said this did not include any reference to fake personas in use prior to mid-2021.</p>
