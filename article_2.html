        <h2>Cathedral Cove: DOC 'not confident' of track reopening</h2>
        <p>
The Department of Conservation has conceded there's no guarantee a walkway to Cathedral Cove will ever reopen, but it is working to find a stable piece of land. Audio

            <p>The Department of Conservation has conceded there is no guarantee a walkway to Cathedral Cove will ever reopen but expects to know what may be possible by the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The walking track to the popular Coromandel tourist destination was closed in February 2023 after it was badly damaged in extreme weather, including Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Over the next few months the Department of Conservation (DOC) will consult on options for a resilient safe track.</p>
        
            <p>DOC regional director Tinaka Mearns told Checkpoint it was also waiting on a land stability report.</p>
        
            <p>"The land is still moving, we're still getting rockfall, still seeing large cracks widening around the area.</p>
        
            <p>"So, first real thing in front of us is to be able to find that alignment for a track and that's going to be on a stable piece of land to keep our visitors safe into the future."</p>
        
            <p>Mearns said it was a challenge and DOC was trying to find a stable piece of land.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not confident that we will find some, we're incredibly hopeful."</p>

            <p>A report is expected in June, which will give DOC a better idea of the land and where a new track can be built.</p>
        
            <p>"We've now delivered on some short-term alternatives to make sure that visitors still have a great time over the summer and businesses can continue to leverage off that."</p>
        
            <p>DOC was also working with Treaty partners and the community to find a way forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Through the Cyclone Recovery Fund, DOC was allocated some funding and we've put aside some of it for this knowing that Cathedral Cove is a really important location. So there is a pool of money I have access to draw on to.</p>
        
            <p>"We have access to up to $1 million at this point in time. So it will really depend on what the solution looks like as to how much of that we may need."</p>
        
            <p>It was not unusual for the arch to crumble every now and then, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since the cyclones we have had about five different rock falls, all in different types of weather.</p>
        
            <p>"So those are becoming a little bit less frequent at the moment, which is why we're leaning towards the next phase of our geotech's advice that will also tell us a lot more about what's happening with the arch, the longevity of that."</p>
        
            <p>As of now, the best way to see and grab that photograph of the Cathedral Cove is via boat.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the alternatives that I'd like to point out that we opened this summer is a track called McHands Track. That's about an hour return walk, and at the end of that, there's a viewing platform you can actually see down to Cathedral Cove from the top, so not as a close-up view, but also a really spectacular way to be able to see the cove and the whole coastline along there."</p>
