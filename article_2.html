            <p>Solar power company SolarZero has been put into liquidation, leaving some customers worried about the contracts they have signed with the company.</p>
        
            <p>The company - which offers customers solar power systems with no upfront cost but an ongoing, multi-decade lease - said the directors had requested its shareholder appoint a liquidator.</p>
        
            <p>It said directors had requested its senior lenders take enforcement action, and appoint another provider Verofi, to ensure power service for customers was not interrupted.</p>
        
            <p>"The directors have advised company employees that due to unsustainable operating losses, and liquidity constraints, the business is unable to continue trading in its current form.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, the company has ceased operations from 4pm [Tuesday]. Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton have been appointed as the liquidators of SolarZero."</p>
        
            <p>SolarZero is owned by GRP III Regional Holdings Ltd, part of the BlackRock Group.</p>
        
            <p>It was founded in the 1970s and has 160 employees throughout the country and offices in Auckland, Christchurch and Wanaka.</p>
        
            <p>SolarZero directors said the company had explored a range of options for a restructure.</p>
        
            <p>"Regretfully, SolarZero and its key stakeholders were unable to find a viable solution to sustain the business.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tough day for SolarZero teams, who have worked hard to build a more sustainable New Zealand. Today's decision is not a reflection on their work or commitment."</p>
        
            <p>Customers posting on SolarZero's Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: "Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?"</p>
        
            <p>Another asked: "Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buy back scheme. Feels like a liability on the roof now."</p>
