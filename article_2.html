        <h2>What Muslim women consider when looking for a hair salon</h2>
        <p>
Muslim women who choose to cover their hair have to consider modesty, privacy and gender when going to the salon.

            <p>For Ilaaf Hammoud, finding a hairdresser can be challenging.</p>
        
            <p>She said many salons do not actively market themselves as hijab-friendly, so it can be "hard to tell if they will respect my needs".</p>
        
            <p>The 24-year-old influencer from Sydney said it was a common misconception that women who wear the hijab "don't care about their hair or don't need professional hair care".</p>
        
            <p>"In reality, many women who wear the hijab still value and prioritise healthy, well-kept hair but they do so in a way that aligns with their modesty."</p>
        
            <p>Associate head of school at Charles Sturt University's Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation Zuleyha Keskin said Muslim women can cover parts of their body, including hair, in public or when they're with people who aren't considered family.</p>

            <p>"The Qur'an mentions the importance of modesty for both men and women," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't specifically say why, therefore all Muslims have identified their own reasons why, trusting in the wisdom."</p>
        
            <p>The associate professor said that when out in public, including a hairdresser, the chances of other men who aren't related being around was "more likely".</p>
        
            <p>"It's not an issue with women, it doesn't have to be Muslim women, other women in the hair salon can be there," she said.</p>

            <p>Hammoud goes to an experienced hairdresser who works from a granny flat, giving complete privacy.</p>
        
            <p>But when she is looking for a salon, she relies on word-of-mouth, or enquires about their understanding of clients who wear the hijab.</p>
        
            <p>This includes a space where hair can be styled without visibility to the public or sometimes with a no phone or camera policy inside.</p>
        
            <p>Another bonus is finding a professional who can work with hair that has been worn under a hijab for long periods, which may require "unique care".</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just about hair, it's about feeling understood and respected in a space that caters to personal and cultural needs," Hammoud said.</p>
        
            <p>"It also promotes greater cultural understanding and respect in the beauty industry."</p>

The screen dividers, or boards, are put up and down as needed in the salon.

            <p>South-west Sydney hairdresser Rana Karnib says inclusivity is a no-brainer.</p>
        
            <p>The head stylist and owner of Rana's Hair Design in Narwee has been servicing the local community for 15 years and has hijab-wearing clients come in daily.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm Muslim and I know how important it is for someone to be able to come in and not have to go to ... a salon where they're feeling secluded," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Karnib's solution is simple - to put up a screen divider against the street-facing window so clients can feel reassured when removing their hijab.</p>
        
            <p>"When we get the boards up, it just feels like they're just in the salon, so it's very comfortable for them.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a normal salon experience."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Residents know that once the boards are up, client's partners or men in the area shouldn't come in.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time we change postmen, they generally barge in and we yell, 'Stop!' and then they freak out, like, 'What's happened? Who did I kill?'" she joked.</p>
        
            <p>She said alternative options she has heard for women who wear hijabs included home visits or being separated into a "small back room where you're shoved in a little corner".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think anyone would really enjoy that experience where they're feeling like they're ... not part of what's happening in the salon," she said of the latter.</p>
        
            <p>With upcoming renovations, Karnib hopes to elevate the experience with sheer curtains that obscure the view inside but let clients see out.</p>
        
            <p>She said she would like to see more hairdressers take the extra steps to welcome hijab-wearing clients.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not that hard, everyone has personal needs and preferences, why not accommodate for everybody?"</p>
