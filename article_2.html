            <p>A new flying school has opened in Auckland, geared towards training new pilots amidst a soaring aviation industry.</p>
        
            <p>The world will need about 600,000 more pilots by 2040, according to figures from Airbus and Boeing.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Pilot Training group will see two-well established operators coming together in order to get more pilots trained, and ultimately in the air.</p>
        
            <p>First Up's Leonard Powell takes to the skies to find out more:</p>
        
            <p>"So once we get in the air, I will hand over the control to you. I will teach you how to fly the multi engine aircraft, sound interesting?"</p>
        
            <p>It's at about this point in the day that I'm starting to question my decision to agree to take a flying lesson.</p>
        
            <p>My apprehension has nothing to do with my instructor Tiger Liu, who has been training pilots for 14 years.</p>
        
            <p>I'm here at the North Shore Airport today to witness the launch of the Auckland Pilot Training Group, and before I know it, Tiger is taking me through pre-flight safety checks and explanations.</p>
        
            <p>We do a thorough check of the DA-42 aircraft, then get strapped in and get the engine started.</p>
        
            <p>As we taxi to the top of the runway, I admit I'm feeling anxious about the prospect of flying. Tiger does his best to calm my nerves.</p>
        
            <p>"I will fully look after you! Once you finish the flight, you will want to become a pilot."</p>
        
            <p>And before you know it, we're staring down the long narrow runway.</p>

            <p>Back on the ground, I speak to APTG North Campus chief executive John Punshon.</p>
        
            <p>He says the coming together of two flight schools makes sense, because despite losing pilots during the pandemic, recruits are increasingly taking up commercial jobs, leaving a shortage of training pilots.</p>
        
            <p>"It became apparent to us, really, that there was a a good opportunity here to work together a little bit more closely to help try and solve some of the issues that we're facing as organizations individually, and to help try and solve some of the issues that the wider New Zealand aviation industry is experiencing, in terms of pilot shortages and and retention of pilots."</p>
        
            <p>He said the lack of new pilots will result in increasing levels of flight cancellations, a lack of availability and a lack of routes.</p>
        
            <p>"The airlines can't provide as many flights as as as demand would ideally have them provide."</p>

            <p>Punshon says a lack of commercial airline pilots can effect the wider industry, including businesses like his.</p>
        
            <p>"Most pilots, and this is not talking absolutely across the board, but most pilots aspire to be airline pilots and fly big jets, so it does create a bit of a vacuum with the smaller carriers, the second and third tier carriers, regional operators, charter operators.</p>
        
            <p>"And of course, organizations like ourselves, as flying schools who are trying to retain instructors in in the face of that huge booming demand that we're seeing."</p>
        
            <p>The cost to complete the full APTG programme is $135,000 to get a pilots licence, at which point you are fully employable.</p>
        
            <p>Sophie Nuttall is another flying instructor present today, with aspirations of one day becoming a commercial pilot.</p>
        
            <p>She says while there's good money to be made as a pilot, it's not cheap.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess the biggest negative for it is that it costs a lot of money to get into it. It is an expensive career path, so that can deter people from doing it."</p>
        
            <p>Back in the air, Tiger has put me through my paces going up and down and turning the plane. He assures me our trip is safer than my drive along the motorway to get to the airport.</p>
        
            <p>Feeling a little queasy, I ask him if anyone has vomited during a flying lesson. Surprisingly, the answer is no.</p>
        
            <p>We do another loop, and get ready for our descent.</p>
        
            <p>Tiger breezes onto the runway for landing, much to the relief of myself and camera operator Nick Monro.</p>
        
            <p>I don't think I'll be one of the 600,000 new pilots.</p>
