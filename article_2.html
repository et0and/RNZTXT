            <p>A stolen Toyota Aqua reversed into the store on Broadway at about 8.55pm while several staff were closing up shop for the day.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Joseph Niupopo said the employees locked themselves in a back room while the offenders, whose faces were covered, began breaking cabinets and taking jewellery.</p>
        
            <p>The thieves used hammers and tyre irons to get into the cabinets and fled with a large quantity of high-end pieces of jewellery.</p>
        
            <p>Niupopo said officers found the car abandoned a short distance away with some of the stolen goods still inside.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic examinations of the scene and vehicle were contuing today.</p>
        
            <p>Niupopo said none of the staff were injured but it was a distressing incident and police were providing them with support.</p>
        
            <p>The employees made the right decision to put their own safety first, he said.</p>
