            <p>You can follow our liveblog of the hīkoi at Parliament here.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford has expressed disapproval at the number of children participating in today's hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>"We need our kids in class in front of our amazing teachers," she said. "Children need to be in class every opportunity they have so we can raise achievement rates."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said if schools were holding an "education-outside-the-classroom" activity, they needed to ensure it had a literacy and numeracy component.</p>
        
            <p>But Tapeta Wehi, the son of haka expert Ngāpo Wehi, is in Wellington with students from Te Wharekura o Rakaumangamanga who have travelled down from Huntly.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was important rangatahi had the chance to be part of the events.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hearing out there that these kids should be at school, but this is all part of our learning, this is their school."</p>
        
            <p>Those rangatahi, as well as Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke and Māori queen Nga wai hono i te po were the "next generation" and the "face" of the movement, Wehi said.</p>
        
            <p>A hīkoi against the Treaty Principles Bill has reached Wellington today.</p>
        
            <p>Dot Bax and her nine-year-old son Felix made the impromptu decision to get in their truck in Whangārei on Monday morning, to get to the hīkoi .</p>
        
            <p>"We had to do what we had to do," she said. "Just jumped in my truck and that was us, we were down here.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about our tamariki, our language, our culture."</p>
        
            <p>She said despite the cost of fuel to make the trip, it was worth it, regardless of whether any MPs came out to talk to crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the wairua that I'm here for basically, I feel the love here with all our people here, and all those from overseas, too.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all united ... we'll let the people speak for themselves."</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi is scheduled to arrive at Parliament around midday.</p>
