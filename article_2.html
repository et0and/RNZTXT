            <p>Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says work has started on a broader accredited employer work visa (AEWV) review and promises she will be "listening to feedback" during that process.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of that review we will consider removing the median wage requirement, as stated in our coalition agreement with Act."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Mountain Scene contacted Stanford outlining significant concerns raised by Queenstown employers over changes to the visa - announced and introduced on 7 April - and implications for them ahead of what may be the busiest winter, visitor-wise, the resort's had.</p>
        
            <p>Worries include additional steps required to hire an international worker, such as checking with Work and Income New Zealand, and additional processing times - possibly as long as five months.</p>
        
            <p>That could leave local businesses short-staffed again, potentially meaning reverting to reduced hotel occupancy, and forcing hospitality venues to shut the doors a couple of days a week.</p>
        
            <p>In an exclusive statement to Scene justifying the changes, Stanford said the current levels of record migration were not sustainable.</p>
        
            <p>"They put pressure on our education and health systems, and having few checks and balances led to increased migrant exploitation which tarnished NZ's reputation.</p>
        
            <p>"The previous government made a series of decisions that were both irresponsible and unsustainable when they removed almost all checks and balances from the AEWV process and instead just relied on the median wage as a proxy for skill."</p>
        
            <p>That resulted in a surge of lower-skilled workers and a situation where some international workers were being paid more than Kiwis in the same job, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The changes I introduced were necessary to address the levels [of] migrant exploitation and unsustainable net migration."</p>
        
            <p>Regarding the Work and Income checks, Stanford said that was a requirement to list the job with Work and Income at the same time a business was advertising more generally.</p>
        
            <p>"Work and Income also has the discretion to waive advertising with them if they determine they do not have any job-seekers who would be suitable for the role.</p>
        
            <p>"Employers will still be able to employ migrant workers on AEWV pathways if they are not able to find employable NZers -  appreciate that for Queenstown-Lakes this is a particular challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"For seasonal peaks, there also continue to be more seasonal-specific visas available."</p>
        
            <p>Explaining a new requirement for a migrant worker to have three years' relevant experience in a role, Stanford said a potential hospo worker could have three years' experience in that industry, or another where the skills were deemed "relevant".</p>
        
            <p>"Immigration NZ have said they are going to be taking a very pragmatic approach to this and [I am] monitoring this closely."</p>
        
            <p>Southland MP Joseph Mooney said he was doing everything he could to ensure Queenstown businesses' concerns about immigration changes were being heard and understood in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Mooney, who was overseas early last week, said he had been having "a lot of conversations on the ground" and relaying those to Stanford and her office regularly.</p>
        
            <p>"That will be ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm constantly working to try to ensure there's a good communication flow between the [Queenstown Business Chamber of Commerce] and local businesses and Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>While there was no word yet of a visit by Stanford to Queenstown to speak to those affected directly, "I am certainly relaying the [desire] locally for her to come down".</p>
