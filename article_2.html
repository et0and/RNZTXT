            <p>A Mexican court has heard chilling details of the events which prosecutors allege followed the deaths of Perth brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend, as a man faces charges relating to their disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>The trio were surfing and camping in a remote part of northern Mexico when they were shot dead.</p>
        
            <p>Their bodies were later found in a 15-metre well a short distance from their campsite.</p>
        
            <p>Jes√∫s Gerardo, also known as "El Kekas", appeared before a court in the Mexican city of Ensenada on Thursday, where his last name had been suppressed according to local laws.</p>
        
            <p>He wore an orange jumpsuit and white sneakers with his hands and feet handcuffed and chained to the floor.</p>
        
            <p>He stands charged with being responsible for the disappearance of the three men, but is yet to enter a plea.</p>
        
            <p>Charges against Gerardo have not yet been upgraded to murder, but that is expected to happen in coming days.</p>
        
            <p>The judge read out the state's case, in which Gerardo's then-girlfriend, 23-year-old Ari Gisell has turned prosecution witness.</p>
        
            <p>The prosecution alleged Ari, whose last name had also been suppressed, told authorities her then-partner had admitted to killing the three men.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard she told investigators her former romantic partner had arrived at her house on Sunday and told her "I f****ed up three gringos".</p>
        
            <p>The court heard she said, "what do you mean?" to which he replied, "I killed them".</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors alleged he then gave her a mobile phone and said "look what I got you", before taking her outside to show her the new tyres on her car that had been allegedly stolen from the trio's vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>There is a possibility that when Ari turned on the stolen mobile phone, she attracted the attention of Mexican authorities.</p>
        
            <p>Upon her arrest, the court heard she told investigators she wanted to assist the investigation because she had a four-year-old daughter who she needed to care for.</p>
        
            <p>She alleges Gerardo has a history of domestic violence and had been physically and mentally abusing her.</p>
        
            <p>Ari was arrested in relation the trio's disappearance, along with Gerardo's brother, Cristian Alejandro. She has been charged with drug possession after being found with methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors alleged Gerardo robbed the men of the tyres on their car, along with cash and electronic valuables.</p>
        
            <p>They told a court room packed with local and foreign journalists that they believed other people were involved in the case.</p>
        
            <p>Questions remain about how one man of slight build could have moved the bodies of three large men about 6km away from the crime scene to a well where their bodies were later discovered.</p>
        
            <p>It is these circumstances, along with the way the men were killed, that has led some to question whether Mexican cartels or organised crime were involved.</p>
        
            <p>The judge presiding over the case told the court the three victims were vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Australian and American men were in a remote part of a foreign country where they did not speak the language and did not have phone reception or social support.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard tooth fragments and a bullet casing were all found at the crime scene where the trio had been camping.</p>
        
            <p>Their campsite was later discovered burnt to the ground, alongside their 4WD.</p>
        
            <p>Gerardo sat impassively in the tiny court room.</p>
        
            <p>Before him sat two public defenders and an unarmed police officer.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of court proceedings, the man leaned forward to speak with his legal team.</p>
        
            <p>Gerardo is yet to enter a plea and has been remanded in custody until his next court hearing, which is scheduled to take place in 8 November.</p>
