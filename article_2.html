            <p>The death of a Dunedin man known for his reclusive nature who once made international headlines for his misguided pursuits at love, remains unexplained one week on.</p>
        
            <p>The body of Peter Alexander Robb, 69, was found at his Garfield Avenue home in the Dunedin suburb of Roslyn last Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police were continuing to investigate his death and on Tuesday, a spokesperson confirmed there were no updates and that the death was still being treated as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>They said earlier that initial indications suggested the person may have been at the scene for some time.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours of Robb told the Herald about his reclusive and odd nature.</p>
        
            <p>One neighbour said they occasionally saw Robb riding his bike in the area, though not for about a year.</p>
        
            <p>Others had not seen him in the six months they had lived in the area and assumed the home was abandoned.</p>
        
            <p>Robb's Garfield Avenue property was overgrown, a path had been cut around the edge of his impassable yard that was littered with dozens of old bikes, with broken furniture strewn throughout.</p>

            <p>A broken-down 1985 Honda City sat in the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>In 2009, Robb made international headlines when he lured a German woman to his home, resulting in a raid by the Armed Offenders Squad.</p>
        
            <p>The woman, who did not want to be named, told the Herald that Robb portrayed himself as a representative of the University of Otago, offering her a position there.</p>
        
            <p>She said the situation had been misrepresented as a love story by the media at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"With its app [sic] reporting and misrepresentation, it played into the hands of this simply psychopathic person," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since Peter Robb was working precisely to portray me as his lover and did everything he could to do so, it played into the hands of the public."</p>
        
            <p>The woman contacted a man she had met on the flight to New Zealand for help, who in turn contacted police.</p>
        
            <p>As Robb had previously had firearms confiscated by police, an armed raid was conducted and the woman was removed from the property.</p>
        
            <p>The woman told the Herald she was "not surprised" at the news of Robb's death.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have very many emotions about this person. You could say he was a poor and very lost spirit with psychopathic tendencies," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In a 2009 interview with stock photo website Stockvault, Robb referenced this interaction with the woman and police.</p>
        
            <p>"I consented to put up a German woman ... for a holiday and my house was raided by the Armed Offenders Squad, she was abducted by the police and humiliated me in the local newspaper.</p>
        
            <p>"I never saw her again. So I don't think I will be doing any more entertaining. Now I am called Internet Romeo or Horror House Romeo."</p>
        
            <p>It was not the first time Robb's behaviour towards women had led to police involvement, as the Otago Daily Times revealed in 2009 he had also been charged with criminally harassing a Brazilian student the year before.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere in his interview with Stockvault, Robb said he was born in Dunedin and had lived there all his life.</p>
        
            <p>He came from a fourth-generation Dunedin family and was a student with two degrees, a BA and a BCApSc (Bachelor of Consumer Food Science), he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>He described himself as an opportunist amateur photographer, "but I plan some shoots".</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy working with models."</p>
        
            <p>Robb's LinkedIn profile lists many of his personal and artistic achievements, including his life membership of the Dunedin Poultry Club.</p>
        
            <p>It also details the multiple places he has been banned, trespassed, and denied entry from in Dunedin, including Otago Polytechnic "for being over-enthusiastic", the University of Otago, Aoraki Polytechnic, Otago University Students Association "for using a microwave for cooking [with permission]", and the Hocken Library "due to body odour [I am a cyclist]".</p>
