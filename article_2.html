            <p>Police say they now believe a homicide and an aggravated burglary in the Wellington suburb of Miramar last month are linked.</p>
        
            <p>About 2am on 17 March, police were called to a Darlington Road address after the occupants found an intruder in their home.</p>
        
            <p>A 28-year-old man was arrested and charged with aggravated burglary in relation to this incident.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty minutes later, 63-year-old Abdul Nabizadah was located with serious head injuries at the intersection of Camperdown Road and Totara Road.</p>
        
            <p>He later died in hospital, and a homicide investigation was launched.</p>

            <p>Detective inspector Nick Pritchard said a large police team were working on parallel investigations into both incidents, and are now treating the cases as being linked.</p>
        
            <p>"We also believe he was the victim of a robbery," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>They were still seeking information from the public which could help identify a pedestrian walking from Camperdown Road into Darlington Road at 12.28am.</p>
        
            <p>This person was wearing a light top and dark pants, and police said they could have crucial information.</p>
        
            <p>"We also continue to seek the driver of a 2006 silver or grey Mazda 6 that was seen driving through the Darlington Road/Camperdown Road intersection several times between 11.50pm Sunday 16 March and 2.17am Monday 17 March."</p>
