        <h2>Lone Motutapu Island rat declared dead after long hunt</h2>
        <p>
It's been running amok on the otherwise pest-free island for months of running amok. But it's come at a price.

            <p>A lone rat caught on camera on the otherwise pest-free paradise of Motutapu Island has been killed after months of running amok, in a sting costing ratepayers thousands of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>The island in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf is directly behind Rangitoto Island, where the furry fugitive is suspected to have swum from - a near six kilometre mini-doggy paddle that surprised biosecurity experts.</p>
        
            <p>The Norway rat sparked a five month search after it was spotted on a network of pest-control cameras in April.</p>

            <p>Together with Ngāi Tai Ki Tāmaki, the Department of Conservation (DOC) deployed a swot team of cameras, conservation dogs, bait and traps around the island.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said the cost of the eradication effort was still being reconciled but would be about $50,000, excluding staff hours.</p>
        
            <p>DOC Island Biosecurity Advisor Claire Warren said the rat was last filmed stocking up on toxic bait over four days in August and has not been spotted since.</p>
        
            <p>Last week a DOC rodent detection dog and handler undertook a sweep of the island with no detections - and the rat was declared dead.</p>

            <p>A network of 50 cameras was the key tool that led to the predator's demise, including two new thermal imaging cameras, named DOC AI CAM, developed by conservation group Cacophony Project.</p>
        
            <p>"We used a combination of standard trail cameras and AI cameras that gave us important and surprising information about the rat's behaviour, routes and favourite locations," Warren said.</p>
        
            <p>"The cameras revealed that the rat travelled from a suspected nest site to McKenzie Bay on Rangitoto Island, around 5.8 km away, which is much further than we ever expected."</p>

            <p>She said the camera network helped trackers conclude that there was only one rat on island, and decide where to lay bait and traps.</p>
        
            <p>"The AI cameras sent us alerts when the rat was seen on camera. This gave us real-time information about the rat's location and direction of travel, which really helped us target it," Warren said.</p>
        
            <p>The DOC team used a variety of trap types and lures such as peanut butter, rat bedding and rat recordings, but the rat evaded these.</p>
        
            <p>"With every incursion we have, we learn more about how to track and kill mammalian pests. When they evade all your attempts to entice them into a trap, it forces you to think laterally and innovate," Warren said.</p>
        
            <p>Motutapu is home to one of New Zealand's rarest birds, the tūturuatu /shore plover, with just 250 individuals remaining nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Warren said a single rat could have devastated the small island population.</p>

            <p>In 2022, DOC spent nearly half a million dollars on an operation to kill one stoat on Chalky Island/ Te Kākahu-O-Tamatea.</p>
        
            <p>The island in Fiordland had been predator-free since 1999.</p>
