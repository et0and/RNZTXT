            <p>South Island iwi Ngāi Tahu want amendments to the Fast-track Approvals Bill to avoid costly legal battles with the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, representatives from the iwi made a submission to the select committee on the bill, which aims to speed up the consent process for major infrastructure projects.</p>
        
            <p>Over the weekend, thousands gathered in central Auckland to oppose the bill, citing fears it would degrade the environment.</p>
        
            <p>Opening the iwi's submission, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Kaikōura representative Rāwiri Manawatu said Ngāi Tahu takiwā, or territory, took up almost all of the South Island, including about two-thirds of New Zealand's conservation estate.</p>
        
            <p>While Ngāi Tahu did not oppose the principles of the bill - speeding up the consenting process - the iwi shared the concerns of those who fear the consequences on the environment.</p>
        
            <p>Manawatu said it was important to note the Crown's apology to Ngāi Tahu - part of its Treaty Settlement more than 25 years ago - expressly stated the iwi had sole rangatiratanga over their takiwā.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ngāi Tahu settlement is the only settlement that have the recognition of rangatiratanga and cannot be ignored. It requires specific recognition in this bill.</p>
        
            <p>"Ngāi Tahu does not want to be tied up in costly litigation. But the solution in our response puts forward other reasonable ways to avoid such outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>The iwi wants a clause added requiring "decision-makers" to consult specifically with Ngāi Tahu on decisions relating to their territory.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāi Tahu would act without hesitation to protect the interests of Ngāi Tahu whānui, tamariki and mokopuna, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wairewa Rūnanga is one of 18 smaller entities which make up Ngāi Tahu, representing the interests of the people of the Southern Banks Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson Jaleesa Panirau told the select committee she opposed the bill, and her submission carried the weight of more than 19,000 whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"As a rūnanga with intergenerational views, we approach things with the focus of preserving resources for our mokopuna. Rushing decisions jeopardises this legacy," Panirau said.</p>
        
            <p>"Expediency should never come at the expense of the environment. If we haven't learned that yet, then I'm afraid, we're going to leave a bigger mess for the next generation and the generations to come.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe it's just selfish, self-centred- self-absorbed and ego-centric."</p>
