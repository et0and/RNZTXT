            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had this month criticised spending on bonuses for public servants who were proficient in the language, and also criticised spending on lessons in the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'd just say to you is people are completely free to learn te reo themselves, that's what happens out there in the real world - out there in corporate life, or in any other community life across New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, it later emerged he had received his own lessons in te reo Māori, which had been paid for by the opposition leader's budget, which is publicly funded.</p>
        
            <p>Other National Party MPs also admitted to having lessons paid for by the taxpayer.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's office on Wednesday confirmed the cost of his lessons was $4150.</p>
