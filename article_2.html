            <p>There has been a small sting in the tail of the Covid-19 Christmas wave, with an apparent rise in cases this month.</p>
        
            <p>The wave had been declining, but latest ESR data showed the level of the virus in wastewater has risen for three weeks in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 modeller Michael Plank said even though wastewater readings could bounce around a little, it appeared there had been a rise in actual cases, with those reported to Te Whatu Ora also trending upwards.</p>

            <p>That was probably because more people had been returning to work and school after the holidays, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But the current wave was still generally tracking down.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite possible we'll see some little peaks and troughs on the downward slope and we've seen this before - as schools go back you get a bit of a bump in numbers for two or three weeks or a maybe a little longer, but then it is relatively short lived and then it starts to come down again," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The number of people currently hospitalised with the virus was 200 - about half the number at the peak in December.</p>
        
            <p>"That peak was itself already much smaller than many of our previous waves," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Christmas wave was mainly driven by the JN1 variant, which now made up about 93 percent of all cases.</p>
