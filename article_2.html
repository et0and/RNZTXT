            <p>A Muriwai resident is among the first owners of storm-damaged homes in Auckland to receive a buyout offer.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's recovery office has notified 67 homeowners they are eligible for a buyout, starting with 47 in Muriwai, and most are working through the valuation process.</p>
        
            <p>The coastal West Auckland community was hit by land slips during Cyclone Gabrielle which damaged a number of homes.</p>
        
            <p>Muriwai resident Caroline Bell-Booth has today received a buyout offer from council.</p>
        
            <p>She said others in the community have received valuations and were waiting on legal documents to sign.</p>
        
            <p>"All people that I've come across feel satisfied and content with the offer that has been placed. Everybody considers it fair, no-one's rubbing their hands with glee as if they've won a Lotto ticket," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"All we've ever asked for is a realistic price so that we can move on and thus far I'm yet to meet somebody who is disgruntled by the category three buyout valuation from council."</p>
        
            <p>The buyout amount will be the agreed valuation for a property, less the five percent homeowner contribution, less any settled insurance claims.</p>
        
            <p>Bell-Booth expected to settle the buyout for her home in the new year - but has mixed feelings.</p>
        
            <p>"I just felt immense sadness which seems so contrary because the number [of the property valuation] was totally acceptable and so I guess there's relief and assurance but it wasn't as I had imagined my response to be," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just felt deep sadness that the house that I love and that chapter of my life is over and that I won't be living at Muriwai anymore."</p>
        
            <p>She said it had been a long journey to get to this point, including advocating for the community through the Muriwai Stickered Residents Group.</p>
        
            <p>Bell-Booth said many families were still waiting for certainty, while others had a complex process ahead determining what mitigation work was needed to future-proof their homes and allow them to continue living in them.</p>
        
            <p>"What you learn is the value of the people because you've lost all your possessions."</p>
        
            <p>Although renting in Muriwai, she and her husband plan to move out of the coastal suburb where housing is limited.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to heal elsewhere just because it's been a great loss for us. Some new surroundings will bring an invigoration of spirit and start a new chapter," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a timely closure and we're very grateful to have that level of clarity before going into Christmas."</p>
