            <p>Fifteen fire crews from across Auckland were at a large fire at the site of the former Centrepoint commune in Albany overnight.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said the fire was in a one-storey 12 metre by 15 metre building, and was fully involved when firefighters arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Crews remained at the scene on Saturday morning dampening down hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>Centrepoint leader Bert Potter was arrested in 1990 following police raids, and the commune was shut down in 2000.</p>
        
            <p>The seven and half hectare property most recently hosted the KƒÅwai Purapura Retreat Centre and a number of long term residents - thought to be around 70 when it was last on the market in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Many were distressed after being told to vacate with less than a month's notice in early 2024 when the property, which is valued at nearly $9 million, was purchased by former Shortland St actor turned property magnate Paul Reid's Icon Group.</p>
        
            <p>Takapuna senior station officer Quin Webster told the NZ Herald most of the buildings on the site were derelict, and it was believed squatters had been staying there.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly a dozen fire trucks also attended a blaze in a strip of surburban shops in Coutts Street, in the Wellington suburb of Kilbirnie, overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said the fire was well involved by the time appliances arrived shortly after 1.30am.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is not thought to be suspicious, but fire investigators are on site.</p>
