            <p>Friends turn foe this weekend, as All Blacks star Ardie Savea lines up against his old Super Rugby Pacific side for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>The Moana Pasifika captain is bracing for a bruising battle against the Hurricanes at Albany on Saturday, after playing 131 times for the Wellington-based side between 2013-23.</p>
        
            <p>"I know, once we cross that line, it's going to be war," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Savea is finding the fixture a bit surreal - he never thought he would line up against the Canes.</p>
        
            <p>"If you asked me five months ago, no, but it's come to that point this weekend, where I get to a run out against some of the brothers, and a team that has done so much for me and my family, and that I've served for many years. It's going to be special."</p>
        
            <p>However, the All Blacks flanker has no regrets.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone asked me if I miss the Hurricanes, I replied, 'Why would I miss being somewhere when I am home with my people?'"</p>
        
            <p>Savea has yet to receive any messages from his old teammates this week, but he expects his inbox to fill up with a barrage of banter before kickoff.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll try and smash each other, and then afterwards, we'll give each other a big hug and catch up."</p>
        
            <p>Expecting some extra spice at the breakdown, Savea won't shy away from the inevitable shots coming his way.</p>
        
            <p>"If I was the other team, I would put a target on my head."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said nothing changes in his preparation.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got to nail things each day for me to be able to perform on game day. As athletes, we try to use anything, everything to build a knot in your gut to build that energy to go out there and want to play well.</p>
        
            <p>"The 'Canes being a past team, that's something that I want to go out there on Saturday and try to perform to the best, especially against the team that I've played for for years and got some close mates in that team too."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Tana Umaga knows all too well what it's like to be up against his old side, as part of the legendary early 2000s Hurricanes side, alongside Christian Cullen and Jonah Lomu.</p>
        
            <p>"I know, obviously, he's got a lot of blood, sweat and tears invested in that team and in that jersey, as a lot of our players have had before," he said. "It'll mean a lot to him, but it won't be about him.</p>
        
            <p>"That's how he is - all about the team and how we can get better."</p>
        
            <p>After a year constantly changing home grounds, Umaga said the side was finally starting to feel settled on the North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>"It was probably one of the best atmospheres I've been a part of," he said of last week's fixture against the Highlanders. "The music, the crowd that came in and the way they just got into everything... we've always wanted a real home for us.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year was a bit hard travelling around all the time, but now it's really starting to feel like home."</p>
