            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says the new government is going to continue everything that the previous government put into place to help with the recovery from Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has been in Wairoa this morning to gauge progress of the town's recovery from the cyclone and is meeting with several Hawke's Bay mayors.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has met with Wairoa Mayor Craig Little and toured damaged sites in the town, including Takitimu Marae where the floodwaters swept through leaving a thick layer of silt.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa was badly hit by Cyclone Gabrielle with scores displaced and a section of State Highway 2 between Wairoa and Napier washed out. In October, Little told RNZ between $60 million and $100m of work needed to be carried out in the town to prevent similar disasters.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said today the government is committed to being in Hawke's Bay engaging with the local community.</p>
        
            <p>"A really good day to actually say we're going to continue everything that the previous government has put into place, we don't want to turn all that upside down."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said on the way down his team saw the state of the roads and the challenges the region faces during cyclone recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to get an assessment of what is actually needed, some of it will be money and some of it will be regulation."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he wanted to avoid "more talk and more consultation where nothing gets done".</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to get a sense of the priorities of where we can put the emphasis and the push."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said conversations with local mayors and leaders had proved invaluable.</p>

            <p>"I think the community here has been very well represented by leaders."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said part of his government's 100-day actions plan was getting on the ground repeatedly in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"That's job number one, to make sure we've got a good assessment."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Little said he told the prime minister flood protection was top priority because the town did not have any.</p>
        
            <p>There were still 130 homes that were unliveable and half of them were uninsured, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Little also told Luxon he wanted State Highway 2 fixed, because it was continually closed due to slips in poor weather.</p>
        
            <p>Asked what he can actually do about the dismal state of SH2 between Wairoa and Napier, Luxon said there was "a big conversation to happen on State Highway 2".</p>
        
            <p>A railway was a lower priority, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The bottom line for me is that the Napier to Wairoa rail link has been poorly utilised," and that money could go to other things, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa had not been forgotten, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not forgotten, that's what we wanted them to understand by us all coming here today."</p>
        
            <p>In the government's plan for its 100 days, two of the 49 items related directly to cyclone and flood recovery:</p>
