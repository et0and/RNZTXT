            <p>An attempt is being made to retrieve a multi-tonne truck that rolled off a winding road and down a bank in Wellington's Aro Valley.</p>
        
            <p>The multi-tonne truck crashed down a bank on Thursday morning and landed only a couple metres from occupied homes.</p>
        
            <p>The truck was being held in place by a cable as crane drivers attempted to lift the truck up the bank.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were watching the salvage attempt take place.</p>

            <p>Mortimer Terrace was closed overnight, with cordons in place, and ten residents had been vacated because of the risk the truck might fall on them.</p>
        
            <p>Linesman had to cut down power lines above the scene of the truck crash for the cranes to fit on the narrow, winding road.</p>
        
            <p>A truck towed parked cars from surrounding streets which had caused delays as the key crane, that would pull the sump truck out, made it's way to site.</p>

            <p>The driver was not inside when the truck rolled and no-one was injured.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it did not know the precise reason the truck rolled and said the investigation would be a matter for the police.</p>
        
            <p>The truck belonged to a subcontractor for Fulton Hogan and was used for vacuuming stormwater drains.</p>
        
            <p>Work to retrieve the truck begin at 7 o'clock on Friday.</p>
