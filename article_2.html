        <p>

            <p>Care and support workers have held rallies around the country calling on the government to fully fund a pay equity settlement.</p>
        
            <p>The unions E tū, the PSA and the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) said the rallies were the next step in a long campaign for the workers' pay equity claim, which was filed against 15 employers almost two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The claim could have implications for 65,000 people working in disability, home and mental health support, as well as aged care work, the unions said.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the unions took the claim to the Employment Relations Authority.</p>
        
            <p>E tū activist and residential aged care worker Marianne Bishop said the government needed to front up.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been waiting far too long for a decent pay equity settlement," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The care and support workforce is an essential part of our health system and our wider communities. We do these jobs because we love the work and we want to do the best we can.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really worried about the future of the sector if there isn't a proper settlement really soon. We can't attract and retain workers if they know they're only going to be paid a pittance. We have an ageing workforce and an ageing population - unless we fix this now, it's a recipe for disaster."</p>

            <p>In Christchurch, about 40 people waved signs and flags on the footpath near the Hornby Club.</p>
        
            <p>NZNO delegate Val Fifita said workers were there protesting for equal pay.</p>
        
            <p>"Our counterparts like the DHB have all got pay rises but we haven't. We do the same amount of work for the same patients and everything. All we're asking really is to be paid what we're worth.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really hoping the government will come through and support the equal pay case."</p>
        
            <p>In 2017, the government signed a $2 billion equity settlement giving tens of thousands of care and support workers a pay rise.</p>
        
            <p>PSA spokesperson Brad Sparrow said care and support workers were some of the lowest paid.</p>
        
            <p>"So just really need to get our wages up to meet the cost of living and so we don't lose some of our people supporting our most vulnerable over to the Aussies," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Health New Zealand/Te Whatu Ora said it was aware the Public Service Association applied to the Employment Relations Authority last month to determine remuneration rates in relation to the 1 July 2022 Care and Support Worker Pay Equity Claim.</p>
        
            <p>"Health NZ is not the employer of this workforce and is not a party to the claim," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, Health NZ as a major funder, has been in ongoing discussions with employers to support them with resolving the claim made against them."</p>
