            <p>New Zealand cheesemakers are celebrating after taking home 27 medals and two trophies from one of the world's oldest cheese and dairy competitions.</p>
        
            <p>More than 5500 producers from over 50 countries entered the 128-year-old International Cheese and Dairy Awards in the United Kingdom over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Cheese expert and awards ambassador Franco Cesa told Afternoons New Zealand was developing its own identity in cheese-making.</p>
        
            <p>"For a long period of time we were a cheddar making country but over time cheesemakers have realised ... consumers have become more adventurous in wanting to try different style of cheeses."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had come a long way in its tastes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I came to New Zealand at 20 to 40 years ago, I remember that the deep fry camembert in the pub was the highlight. You know, we came a long way from."</p>
        
            <p>Traditionally, New Zealand's cheeses were local versions of European styles, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But producers had to challenge themselves as tastes changed.</p>
        
            <p>"Now they're creating cheeses that have completely no linkage whatsoever to the European-style cheeses."</p>
        
            <p>Producers around the country were getting more adventurous - one in Geraldine was trialling deer-milk cheese - and that was starting to get noticed.</p>
        
            <p>It would also allow New Zealand to access different markets, Cesa said.</p>
