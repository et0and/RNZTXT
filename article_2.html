            <p>Firefighters are working with Coastguard to respond to a fire on the Boulder Bank, near Port Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said several members of the public reported the fire just before 3pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>There is no road access to the site and the spokesperson said it was not known if it was a bach or a vegetation fire at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>Four firefighters and a portable water pump have been taken to the site by the harbourmaster.</p>
        
            <p>Dark smoke from the fire was visible across the Nelson Haven.</p>
        
            <p>There were several baches on the Boulder Bank - which is a naturally formed 13km spit, which protects Nelson City from Tasman Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The baches were recognised by Heritage New Zealand/ Pouhere Taonga in 2013 as being part of a historic area that includes the Boulder Bank lighthouse, lighthouse station remains and several middens.</p>
        
            <p>A bach on the bank was set on fire in 2021 and burnt to the ground.</p>
