            <p>John Bishop, political veteran and father of National Party minister Chris Bishop, has died.</p>
        
            <p>A post on his Facebook page, written by family, announced the news, explaining that he suffered a brain aneurysm and was rushed to the ICU. He died 48 hours later, on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are bereft. It is hard to take in that this intelligent, funny, loving man is no longer a part of our everyday lives but we are also so immensely grateful for the wonderful kindness and care of ambulance and Wellington hospital staff, to John and to us," the post read.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop was a journalist for years, working at Radio New Zealand and as chief Parliamentary correspondent at TVNZ, as well as writing for the National Business Review as a Wellington correspondent.</p>
        
            <p>He then had a career in public relations and corporate relations, working for his own firm. His blog also highlights his love of travel writing.</p>
        
            <p>More recently he wrote regular columns for The Dominion Post.</p>
        
            <p>He was the inaugural chairperson of political lobby group the Taxpayers' Union.</p>
