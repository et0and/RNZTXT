        <h2>Former mayor beats council over parking ticket</h2>
        <p>
It was ruled that the Victoria Street area where Dame Kerry Prendergast received a parking ticket had not been correctly designated as a footpath.

            <p>Former Wellington mayor Dame Kerry Prendergast has won a fight with her former council over a $40 parking ticket.</p>
        
            <p>In a just-released decision, two Justices of the Peace ruled the Wellington City Council (WCC) could not show it had correctly designated the Victoria Street area, where Prendergast was ticketed, as a footpath.</p>
        
            <p>Prendergast told NZME the decision showed the council needed to be careful in its processes.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't just decide something is no parking unless you've been through the proper legal process and promulgated it as no parking," she said.</p>

            <p>Council spokesperson Richard MacLean said the council had only just received the decision and it would take a few days to consider the practical implications.</p>
        
            <p>That includes the implications for those who have already been ticketed for parking in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The council earlier told NZME that between January and July this year, it issued 113 parking tickets for parking on a footpath.</p>
        
            <p>Prendergast said she expected anyone who had been ticketed in that area to be refunded.</p>
        
            <p>Prendergast, who was the capital's mayor between 2001 and 2010, did not deny parking in the area in January this year, but maintained she "did not park on a footpath" which is what she was ticketed for.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement prepared for the court, Prendergast said she parked her car on a paved section of slip-road between Dixon and Ghuznee Streets.</p>
        
            <p>There are no markings, signs or notices to notify drivers that parking is not allowed on the roadway.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was disputing the ticket because the area was ambiguous, and she contended she did not park on the footpath.</p>
        
            <p>At October's hearing in the Wellington District Court the principal transport engineer Dennis Davis told the hearing the area in question had been designed for pedestrians and "the area is considered a footpath by council".</p>
        
            <p>Davis also referred to the Proposed Traffic Resolution that made changes to the area in 2015 with specific reference to improving pedestrian facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"By improving these facilities to a tree-lined pedestrian-friendly boulevard, Wellington City Council and its Central City Framework (2013) hope to increase patronage in the area."</p>
        
            <p>Prendergast, who represented herself at the hearing, called one witness, her husband and former Wellington City councillor Rex Nicholls.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls told the court the traffic resolution for the area was about a road, not slipways.</p>
        
            <p>"If it was to be a footpath it would have to be designated footpath. There should have been a traffic resolution promulgated that this little piece of land is a footpath.</p>
        
            <p>"This is definitely a piece of land that nobody has designated," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The JPs agreed. The decision found the WCC needed to prove it made a Traffic Resolution confirming what constituted road and footpath in Victoria St.</p>
        
            <p>It said no information was placed before the court on the outcome of any consultation identified in the Proposed Traffic Resolution, or what steps had been taken to make it into a resolution.</p>
        
            <p>"No evidence was offered to conclusively prove that the Proposed Traffic Resolution became a duly approved Traffic Resolution and was appropriately promulgated.</p>
        
            <p>"The case is therefore not proven beyond reasonable doubt. Charges dismissed. Defendant discharged", the decision said.</p>
