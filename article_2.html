            <p>Donald Trump has ordered the immediate release of every prisoner involved in the 6 January, 2021, Capitol riot.</p>
        
            <p>One of the president's first acts upon his return to the Oval Office was to sign an order pardoning almost 1500 people involved in the insurrection.</p>
        
            <p>Just 14 offenders were not pardoned. But they had their sentences commuted, meaning they will also be freed imminently.</p>
        
            <p>Those pardoned include the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Tarrio was not in Washington at the time of the riot but was convicted of seditious conspiracy.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The founder of the Oath Keepers group, Stewart Rhodes, is on the list for commutations. He was given an 18-year sentence, also for seditious conspiracy.</p>
        
            <p>"This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation," the order says.</p>
        
            <p>As he signed the order, Trump said: "We hope they come out tonight, frankly."</p>
        
            <p>Supporters have gathered outside the DC Jail in Washington, where some of the 6 January inmates are being held.</p>
        
            <p>Damian Rodriguez, who was at the Capitol on 6 January but was not charged, is among them.</p>
        
            <p>He said anyone who assaulted police officers should get "just punishment," but argued those jailed over 6 January had been treated unfairly.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel very happy for the families that are getting their political prisoners back," he told the ABC.</p>

            <p>"[Trump] kept his promise and he signed the pardons and so I'm very happy about that."</p>
        
            <p>Former Metropolitan police officer Michael Fanone, who testified about being beaten and repeatedly Tasered during the riot, told CNN he felt betrayed.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight, six individuals who assaulted me, as I did my job on January 6, as did hundreds of other law enforcement officers, will now walk free," Fanone said.</p>
        
            <p>He said "countless" 6 January offenders had threatened him and his family because they saw him as a "spokesman for law enforcement".</p>
        
            <p>"My family, my children and myself are less safe today because of Donald Trump and his supporters."</p>

            <p>Trump defended showing clemency to people who assaulted police officers.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been in jail for a long time already," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I see murderers in this country get two years, one year, and maybe no time. So, they've already been in jail for a long time."</p>
        
            <p>All pending charges relating to the riot will also be dropped, according to the order.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021 after Trump made baseless claims that an election victory had been "stolen" from him.</p>
        
            <p>Some threatened to kill members of Congress, attacked police with weapons and fire extinguishers and caused millions of dollars in property damage.</p>
        
            <p>Before inauguration day, Trump had said he would pardon some of the people involved in the riots, who he frequently described as hostages.</p>
        
            <p>But he suggested particularly violent offenders might not be released.</p>
