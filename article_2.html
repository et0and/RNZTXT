            <p>The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to the victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks on the fifth anniversary of the tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>On 15 March 2019, a gunman opened fire at Al Noor and the Linwood Islamic Centre, murdering 51 people and injuring dozens more.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Prince William said his thoughts were with the families and friends of the victims and with those injured in the attacks.</p>
        
            <p>He also paid tribute to the "entire Muslim community in New Zealand who responded to this horrific event with such courage and fortitude".</p>
        
            <p>The prince visited Christchurch shortly after the attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Five years on from the terrorist attack in Christchurch, my thoughts are with the families and friends of those lost, those injured and the entire Muslim community in New Zealand who responded to this horrific event with such courage and fortitude. When I visited Christchurchâ€¦</p>
        
            <p>"I was struck by the unity forged by an attack which aimed to sow division," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a constant reminder to me of why we must come together and unite against extremism."</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of worshippers gathered at Al Noor on Friday evening to mark the fifth anniversary of the terror attack.</p>
        
            <p>They were joined by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, opposition leader Chris Hipkins, representatives from government agencies and local schools, and first responders.</p>

            <p>Farid Ahmed, who survived the shooting at Al Noor Mosque but lost his wife in the attack, said reflecting on the tragedy and the reaction of the world, "one word comes to my mind, and that is compassion".</p>
        
            <p>Survivor Sherif Ibrahim spoke at the commemoration event, saying the day shook him to his core.</p>
        
            <p>"I was going about my routine when suddenly chaos erupted. Screams pierced the ear and the sound of gunfire echoed throughout the mosque. Innocent lives were being threatened, families torn apart, and the sense of security shattered in an instant."</p>
        
            <p>The attack was a stark reminder of the fragility of life, but also the bravery and resilience of humans, Ibrahim said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ordinary people became heroes, risking their own lives to help those in need. Their selflessness and courage served as a beacon of hope in the midst of despair," he said.</p>

            <p>Ibrahim said after the attack he earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree, then went on to pursue a teaching qualification.</p>
        
            <p>"I refuse to let the acts of an individual bring me down."</p>
        
            <p>Ibrahim said every anniversary he thought back to the attack, and felt grateful to be alive.</p>
        
            <p>Sara Qasem, whose father Abdelfattah Qasem was killed at Al Noor Mosque, said she was at the commemoration in peace, love, grief, and in memory of all the victims.</p>
        
            <p>"The journey of healing has been by no means linear, but here we were and here we are, striving for hope," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Qasem said five years on she carried three aspirations for the next chapter ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"Firstly, may we always be brave enough to speak in the language of courage in the face of hate. May we continue to co-weave the tapestry of aroha with the intention of meaningful change, no matter the years that pass us by. And may we continue to extend our olive branches to one another, ourselves too, through the lens of salam as we dare to hope for better for Aotearoa, for this community and further to."</p>
