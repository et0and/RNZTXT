            <p>Wellington's regional parks are getting a new wildfire risk management system in preparation for a hot summer.</p>
        
            <p>Aligned with the New Zealand fire danger class criteria, each of the six risk levels triggers specific precautionary controls, including the closure of whole parks or sections of track.</p>
        
            <p>The code levels are represented by colour, with green the lowest risk and purple meaning extreme fire danger.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Eastern Parks team leader Ricky Clarkson said the system was a first for them, as a proactive approach to increased fire risk.</p>
        
            <p>"The El Niño weather pattern is contributing to a riskier-than-normal fire season. And as we mitigate the impacts of climate change the threat of wildfires has increased."</p>
        
            <p>Clarkson said dry and exposed areas like Baring Head/ Ōrua-pouanui and Queen Elizabeth Park will have a higher risk compared to denser growth parks like Kaitoke.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team will be monitoring wildfire risk levels regularly over summer, adjusting the new fire danger signs as needed."</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington council chair Daran Ponter said the new approach to the wildfire threat was part of a wider plan to protect and restore the region's parks.</p>
        
            <p>"This year we've made huge strides in the work we do to protect the biodiversity in our regional parks. In the warmer months, wildfire is a very real threat to our wildlife and forests."</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said young seedlings they have planted across retired grazing land were also at risk, as they haven't had the chance to fully establish.</p>
        
            <p>"The best-long term approach to wildfire risk is the restoration of native bush, which is naturally dense and slow to ignite."</p>
        
            <p>He said if the fire risk level rose above red, the council might need to close whole parks or restrict access to certain tracks to keep staff and communities safe.</p>
        
            <p>The plan also included new fire break trails, 'no fire' signage in high-risk areas, and comprehensive fire risk assessment training for relevant members of the park ranger team.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council has asked visitors to avoid lighting fires and carrying items that could cause ignition, including vapes and cigarettes.</p>
