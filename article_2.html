            <p>The bishop who was stabbed at a Sydney church on Monday night says he forgives his attacker and is "doing fine" after undergoing surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The Assyrian Orthodox Christ The Good Shepherd Church posted an update on social media on Thursday morning that included an audio recording from the bishop.</p>
        
            <p>A 16-year-old boy has been arrested over the attack and authorities are investigating it as a "terrorist incident". No charges have been laid.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel said he forgived "whoever has done this act".</p>
        
            <p>"I will always pray for you. And whoever sent you to do this, I forgive them as well is Jesus's mighty name," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In his almost four-minute speech, Bishop Emmanuel reassured his followers he was improving.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm doing fine, recovering very quickly. We thank the Lord Jesus, so there is no need to be worried or concerned," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Father Daniel Kochou, who also spoke in the video, said Father Isaac Royel, who was also attacked on Monday night was "recovering well".</p>
        
            <p>He added "nearby church members" who were attacked had also "received special care".</p>
        
            <p>Father Kochou also said the church "does not condone the activities" that took place outside the church following Bishop Emmanuel's attack.</p>
        
            <p>"The unfortunate events which took place outside the church caused unnecessary delays and threats to both victims, paramedics and police," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a large contingent of people who were not members of the church who attended and caused a major disturbance."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop Emmanuel also told his community to remember the teachings of Jesus Christ and not retaliate and cooperate with police investigating the assault and subsequent unrest outside.</p>
        
            <p>"I need you to act Christ-like. The Lord Jesus never taught us to fight. The Lord Jesus never taught us to retaliate. The Lord Jesus never said to us, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'."</p>
        
            <p>"I need you to be always law-abiding citizen(s) as well. We need to cooperate with the police directives, whether it be at a state level or a federal level.</p>
        
            <p>"We pray for our country, our beloved country, Australia, and our beautiful city of Sydney."</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb said, after the attack, Bishop Emmanual was "lucky to be alive".</p>
        
            <p>The 53-year-old, a prominent conservative leader of the Assyrian Orthodox Christ the Good Shepherd Church, underwent surgery after sustaining lacerations to his head from the attack.</p>
