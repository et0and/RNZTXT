            <p>About 5000 square metres of reef has been damaged by HMNZS Manawanui as it went down in a marine reserve off the southern coast of Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel ran aground and later sank at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Clean up and salvage operations are underway as debris continues to come loose from the vessel.</p>
        
            <p>Three cargo containers are among the contents to come away - two are floating in the sea with one now stuck on the reef.</p>
        
            <p>The 950 tonnes of fuel inside the vessel is still contained.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reporter Louise Ternouth is on Samoa's southern coast and has been out on the water with the defence force today.</p>
        
            <p>"We set out this morning in very windy and treacherous conditions out on the reef," she told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>The team waited until it was safe to get out on the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Before we were even told we had reached where the vessel was - which took up to an hour to get out there - you could smell it, you could smell the pungent petrol fumes and we knew we were in the right spot.</p>

            <p>"We also saw an oil slick on the water which the New Zealand Defence Force maintains is residual fuel from the initial sinking.</p>
        
            <p>"We could also see a bit of debris in the water but the main thing that stood out was the three shipping containers that were floating."</p>
        
            <p>The containers appeared to be mostly empty, Ternouth said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of those, though, was stuck on the reef, which will likely become a problem in the future I imagine to retrieve."</p>

            <p>A diver tasked with inspecting the HMNZS Manawanui said his team could not see any signs of further oil leaking from the sunken ship.</p>
        
            <p>The ship is 30 metres down, and Sam King said it was surreal to see it in a clean condition but lying on its side on the sea floor.</p>
        
            <p>"The ship looks like it's sitting on a kind of flat rock bed, so luckily from what I could see at least it is not sitting on top of coral, which is lucky."</p>
        
            <p>There is about 10 metres of visibility underwater, King said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see quite a bit from where you are just diving around the ship.</p>
        
            <p>"We couldn't see any oil spilling out while we were down there."</p>
        
            <p>A team of divers filmed and photographed the ship and located the voyage data recorder - the equivalent of an aeroplane's flight recorder.</p>
        
            <p>"(It's) an important piece of equipment on a ship which records a lot of things that go on. ... And again that will be used as an important tool for the investigation which is ongoing."</p>
        
            <p>After assessing the wreck's initial condition the team will be looking ahead at what is next in the salvage operation.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the other divers managed to bring up the name plaque of the ship, which is quite a significant thing.</p>
        
            <p>"So going forward I think that will be a big part of history. It's something special that we were able to bring back from the ship that I think will mean a lot to people, hopefully."</p>

            <p>Lieutenant Christian Lloyd with the navy's search dive team said hazards need to be identified before fuel is extracted from the Manawanui.</p>
        
            <p>"The primary task is to identify potential hazards or further hazards that can occur environmentally and also getting our initial assessments of the damage.</p>
        
            <p>"This will be able to provide an accurate picture back to the Samoan government and also New Zealand as a whole.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment the ship is stable on bottom, it's safe to dive, so that gets us a really good opportunity to get a clear picture."</p>
