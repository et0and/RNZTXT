            <p>Salmon, ham, barbecued Brazilian beef, oysters and ambrosia dessert are among the offerings being served up for Christmas meals on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ popped out to talk to those in central Christchurch late on Tuesday to get a sense of what was on the Christmas menu.</p>
        
            <p>Winter Hadfield will be having 'ota 'ika on Christmas day, a raw fish dish.</p>
        
            <p>"It's made with coconut cream, cream, vegetables, and just raw fresh fish. And that is pretty much something we always make."</p>
        
            <p>Followed by a household speciality - ambrosia.</p>
        
            <p>Ambrosia is also on the menu for Larissa Tinnelly and her family.</p>
        
            <p>But to start that will make their way through salmon, ham, lamb, and a selection of salads.</p>
        
            <p>Stephanie Lilloux is visiting from Tahiti and said that they follow the French tradition and have their Christmas meal on Christmas Eve.</p>
        
            <p>She said they normally go for caviar and foie gras as a special starter, but this year it was easier to get hold of salmon, oysters and lump eggs.</p>
        
            <p>Kath Schrader was in town with her daughters, Jill Olesen and Maria Witteman.</p>
        
            <p>Kath will be spending Christmas with her son and his family surrounded by grandchildren and grandchildren, with lamb and ham on the menu.</p>
        
            <p>She said she does not have a favourite Christmas food - she just likes them all.</p>
        
            <p>Helen and Phil Bolton are planning on a bbq, including Brazilian Picanha beef - a speciality being provided by some Brazilian family members.</p>
        
            <p>Helen said there will be also be seafood, chocolate brittle and chocolate brownies, but what she is looking forward to the most is getting spending time with the family.</p>
