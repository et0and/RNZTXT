            <p>Top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in Iran, the group has said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released on Wednesday, Hamas said Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli raid on his residence in Tehran.</p>
        
            <p>A number of other senior Hamas figures, including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, have described Haniyeh's death as an "assassination" and vowed to retaliate.</p>
        
            <p>Nobody has yet to claim responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps said the cause of the "incident" was not immediately clear but was "being investigated", AFP news agency reported.</p>
        
            <p>According to the group, Haniyeh died after participating in the inauguration ceremony of the new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian who was sworn in on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Hamas, the Palestinian group controlling Gaza, said Haniyeh was "killed in a treacherous Zionist raid".</p>
        
            <p>The group's political bureau member Musa Abu Marzuk said it was a "cowardly act" and one which "will not go unanswered"; while another senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, said the group will "continue on its path".</p>
        
            <p>"This assassination by the Israeli occupation of Brother Haniyeh is a grave escalation that aims to break the will of Hamas and the will of our people and achieve fake goals," Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters news agency.</p>
        
            <p>Israel is yet to respond or issue a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader.</p>
        
            <p>He was a prominent member of the group's movement in the late 1980s and was imprisoned by Israel for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising.</p>
        
            <p>He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections, but he was dismissed a year later after the group ousted Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence.</p>
        
            <p>Haniyeh rejected his sacking as "unconstitutional", stressing that his government "would not abandon its national responsibilities towards the Palestinian people", and continued to rule in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the past several years.</p>
