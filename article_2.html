            <p>Dozens of Auckland beaches have been put on high alert and some have been closed due to high levels of faecal bacteria.</p>
        
            <p>At least 25 beaches have been deemed high risk across the city, with Safeswim water quality models predicting levels of faecal bacteria that breach national safety guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>Four inner-city beaches have also been closed due to waste water overflow: Herne Bay, Home Bay, Judges Bay, and Te Tinana.</p>
        
            <p>Beachgoers were advised not to go swimming while Safeswim high risk alerts were in effect.</p>
        
            <p>Along Auckland's North Shore, the majority of beaches are deemed high risk.</p>
        
            <p>Popular Takapuna beach, Milford beach, Browns Bay and Long Bay are among those marked as unsafe to swim.</p>
        
            <p>However, those south of Takapuna, including Narrow Neck and Cheltenham, are all marked safe.</p>
        
            <p>In the east of the city, Saint Heliers, Ōkahu Bay, Ōrākei, Point England, Eastern Beach, Farm Cove and Cockle Bay have also been labelled as safe to swim.</p>
