            <p>The High Court in Auckland has been evacuated following a bomb threat this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The evacuation comes amid an admission ceremony for new lawyers, with dozens of family and friends in attendance for the day.</p>
        
            <p>All court procedures have been cancelled for the day.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson says the source of the threat is the same as those sent to other organisations including schools and hospitals yesterday and other organisations today.</p>
        
            <p>Police have said they do not believe there is an actual threat to those receiving the emails.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
