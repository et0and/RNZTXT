            <p>The Auditor-General has criticised the way the University of Waikato contracted former finance minister Steven Joyce without looking at other firms.</p>
        
            <p>In an open letter to the university, Auditor-General John Ryan said that Joyce's consultancy firm Joyce Advisory had been paid $1.1 million in public funds between 2019 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the contractor's work is ongoing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Public organisations were typically required to invite multiple contractors into the procurement process to ensure that public funds were spent responsibly.</p>
        
            <p>But Ryan said the University of Waikato did not engage in a competitive procurement process and had reached out to Joyce directly.</p>
        
            <p>"Where there has been a direct procurement like this, and one that to date has cost well over $1 million of public money, we would expect to see a clear and documented reason for the services that were needed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That explanation, and the assurance it would provide to the public that public money has been appropriately spent, is missing."</p>
        
            <p>He said the matter was a "useful reminder" for public organisations to be transparent while hiring contractors.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Waikato said it accepted the Auditor-General's comments.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] will ensure any future variations to university policies will be reported to the University Council," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The university accepts it is accountable for the expenditure of public money and for the outcomes resulting from that expenditure."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson noted the process used to originally hire Joyce Advisory in 2019 was "permissable under the University's Procurement Policy and Independent Contractor Policy."</p>
        
            <p>But it promised to "provide additional documentation when making future variations to contractor agreements, to ensure there is a robust reporting process".</p>
