        <h2>Experience the key factor in Perenara/Cane inclusion - Robertson</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - A balance between the present and future was needed for this tour, said the All Black coach.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - It's clear that in terms of where the All Black story is at right now, Scott Robertson isn't quite ready yet to finish one chapter. He named his 36-man squad for the end of year tour today, retaining former captain Sam Cane and veteran halfback TJ Perenara despite both leaving to play in Japan next season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always a balance between having experience, guys who are test-fit, balance of leadership and what it takes to win up north," said Robertson in Christchurch on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got a lot of those qualities. They're in a test team playing good footy still. That was part of it. They can build, they can be a big part of helping the next players come through and building for the future. On the balance of it, that's why they're coming."</p>
        
            <p>That does, admittedly, hold true with Robertson's selection logic for both players so far this season. Cane was brought back to be a senior man in the forwards despite not having played any rugby since January, while Perenara's role was to lead the inexperienced halfback corps. Both are clearly still needed to fulfil those roles, although it will be interesting to see just how scaled back that gets as the tour progresses.</p>

            <p>That's because Robertson has already basically admitted the All Blacks XV, which is named on Tuesday, will figure into the test selection and vice versa.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got an All Blacks XV tour that is going up there that we can use to give players game time. The (All Black) squad is 36, [but] not all 36 are playing every weekend. Both teams are on tour and a great opportunity for them to learn and play some quality rugby in the north," he said.</p>
        
            <p>So does that mean Peter Lakai - who everyone had assumed would be ushered into the All Blacks sooner rather than later - will make a test debut next month? If there are any injuries, certainly, but the All Blacks XV matches against Munster and Georgia could see him play his way in as a torch-passing moment from Cane.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, Robertson revealed - to no great surprise - Noah Hotham would be in the All Blacks XV side, which means he could get one too as Perenara rides off into the sunset.</p>
        
            <p>"How does it look, how do we get the best out of them?" Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"How do they get the best out of the next young All Blacks so they can see them come through, spend a bit of time with them and show them what test football and what touring is all about?"</p>

            <p>The halfback position has become a little bit more crowded with the return of Cam Roigard, who couldn't have started better with a two-try performance on Saturday for Counties-Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>It's almost impossible the All Blacks will come out of this trip unscathed, however. At least some of the 64 initial players from the combined squads will get injured - a fact that won't be lost on Perenara, as it was Twickenham where he suffered a catastrophic knee injury in 2022 that saw him sidelined for a year and a half.</p>
        
            <p>In brighter injury news, however, Robertson confirmed Jordie Barrett was tracking well for the Japan test. Even if fit, he may well be rested for that one anyway, as the All Blacks will need all their heavy artillery for a rematch with an England side looking for revenge.</p>
