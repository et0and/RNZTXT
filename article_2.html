            <p>The Warriors have scored a "huge" 22-20 NRL win over the three-time defending champion Penrith Panthers, ending a four-game losing streak in the upset.</p>
        
            <p>Penrith had a chance to level the Magic Round clash with a penalty which was pushed wide in the last minute by Dylan Edwards at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Brilliant rookie Warriors fullback Taine Tuaupiki nailed a late conversion from the sidelines to hand the the Warriors a narrow two-point advantage with the clock running down.</p>
        
            <p>With 10 Warriors players missing from the clash due to injuries, the team had a makeshift look about it.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Tohu Harris was missing from the side with a foot injury with Shaun Johnson also sidelined.</p>
        
            <p>Te Maire Martin and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad were inspirational leaders for the side, after the team was blown off the park by the Roosters 38-18 last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Martin told SkySport it was a significant performance for the club, which will give the side the belief they have been searching for.</p>
        
            <p>"It means a lot, it really does," Te Maire Martin said after their fifth - and most unlikely - win of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"We're stoked. We've been in a bit of a rut for the last couple of weeks and to come out with a win like that was huge.</p>
        
            <p>"Having some of our big boys out, Tohu our captain and Shaun, and our real big dog Rocco Berry, it was a credit to the boys.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously Webby (coach Andrew Webster) coming from Penrith he had a few things up his sleeve."</p>
        
            <p>Tuaupiki scored his maiden NRL try with Marcelo Montoya, Ali Leiataua and Adam Pompey also touching down.</p>
        
            <p>Next round the Warriors will host the Dolphins at Mt Smart Stadium.</p>
