            <p>Te Whatu Ora's beefed up Voluntary Bonding Scheme for new graduates will not stop people dropping out before they even qualify, nurses and midwives warn.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 scheme has been expanded to include all new midwives nationwide - including those who graduated last year - additional regions for nurses and trainee GPs, as well as opening up to pharmacists and anaesthetic technicians for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Graduate nurses who commit to working in aged care, mental health, district nursing, Well Child or in one of several hard-to-staff regions will get paid an extra $8499 after three years.</p>
        
            <p>Stick with it for two more years after that and they get a further $2833 at the end of each of those years.</p>
        
            <p>However, second year nursing student Shannyn Bristowe of Whakatāne could really do with the money now.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been living in my friend's shed since last April because I can't afford to pay rent anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>"And when I say shed, I mean an actual uninsulated shed. We've hung a sheet from the ceiling that separates my bed from all the stuff they keep in their shed.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm grateful to my friend because otherwise I don't know what I would do, how I would pay the bills. What you get from StudyLink is just not liveable."</p>
        
            <p>Nursing is a second career for Bristowe, and her student loan will top $77,000 by the time she finishes the degree next year.</p>
        
            <p>"There's so many people I speak to who want to do it, but the barrier for them every time is 'I have kids, I can't afford to'. Even if you don't have kids, it's just unaffordable."</p>
        
            <p>Nurses Organisation kaiwhakahaere Kerri Nuku said while the bonding scheme might create some opportunities for new graduates, it would not help students like Bristowe.</p>
        
            <p>"We've still got many nursing students living in the garages of friends or bed-hopping. Here's in Hawke's Bay, Cyclone Gabrielle wiped out many of the homes that our students from EIT were living in. So they're still in survival mode, and a few of them have had to pull out.</p>
        
            <p>"As we see the economic crisis take a bite, we're seeing nursing students really struggling. Some are not going back next year. What I'm hearing from students is the struggle is just too real."</p>
        
            <p>A district health board report in 2021 found nearly one in three nursing students drop out.</p>
        
            <p>Midwifery has the largest health workforce gap, with a 40 percent shortfall across the country.</p>
        
            <p>In a bid to plug those holes, Te Whatu Ora is opening up the Voluntary Bonding Scheme to all new graduates working anywhere in the country, including those who graduated in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>College of Midwives spokesperson Violet Clapham said better support for students was needed, like "earn as you learn" programmes.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment the costs involved in training to become a midwife are onerous and we do see students leaving the programmes every year.</p>
        
            <p>"If we were able to retain all the students coming through the schools, that would certainly add to the numbers in the profession."</p>
        
            <p>A key focus of the bonding scheme is general practice, with a $30,000 payout after three years.</p>
        
            <p>Māori and Pacific trainees working anywhere in the country can apply, along with others working in high-need areas - which is almost everywhere outside the main cities.</p>
        
            <p>General Practice New Zealand chairperson Bryan Betty said it was "a positive move" - especially for Māori, Pasifika and rural communities - but fixing the chronic shortages in primary care was going to take "a whole suite of strategies".</p>
        
            <p>"Thirty percent of practices across the country and a high number in rural and provincial areas are not accepting patients because they don't have the workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to address these issues."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora chief people officer Andrew Slater said the agency was continuing to look at ways to support students during their clinical placements, including more earn-and-learn pilots programmes, some of which are focused on healthcare assistants and nurses.</p>
        
            <p>"We're continuing to assess the outcomes of those programmes to ensure they are supporting students as they go through their course of study."</p>
        
            <p>The Voluntary Bonding Scheme was just one of several initiatives underway to boost the health workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really key step that we're taking to ensure that we retain the New Zealand trained health workforce here in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's something that we can scale up and do this year that will start having an immediate impact on the health workforce."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, 488 people were accepted last year onto the scheme, which cost Te Whatu Ora about $7 million.</p>
        
            <p>Registrations for the next intake are expected to open in February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"We're encouraging anyone who meets the criteria to put their application in," Slater said.</p>
        
            <p>"Depending on the interest, we will be accepting everyone who meets the eligibility criteria."</p>
