            <p>Top seed Coco Gauff maintained her imperious form in the leadup to the Australia Open by dismantling Emma Navarro 6-3, 6-1 in their Auckland Classic semi-final on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>World number three Gauff will seek to defend her title against second seed Elina Svitolina, who defied a back injury to win a contrasting contest against Wang Xiyu.</p>
        
            <p>Ukrainian Svitolina needed two medical timeouts before fighting back to beat her unseeded Chinese opponent 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.</p>
        
            <p>Gauff will be the fresher of the two finalists on Sunday, having won all her matches in straight sets this week - including a swift defeat of fourth seed Navarro that highlighted her attacking weapons.</p>
        
            <p>The US Open champion sent down 10 aces and struck 26 winners to six and said she knew what would be needed to quell her American compatriot.</p>
        
            <p>"Just being aggressive, with my serve and my return," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We played a practice set before the tournament started and she was playing really well so I knew it had to be my best game if I wanted to win.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely a good start to my 2024, Emma's an incredible player."</p>

            <p>Svitolina, whose quarter-final win over Marie Bouzkova didn't finish until 11pm on Friday, played with discomfort from the outset and needed treatment to her lower back 20 minutes into the match.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old took another timeout straight after clinching the second set before emerging to play her best tennis in the closing stages.</p>
        
            <p>Svitolina said she would need to lift to a higher level to stop the rampant Gauff, having endured a more taxing schedule - including wins over former grand slam champions Caroline Wozniacki and Emma Raducanu.</p>
        
            <p>"I had really tough matches in the first three rounds and after late last night I went to bed at 2am so it was not easy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really tough in the second set but I just pushed myself through. I played like there is no tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Svitolina, who also needed her right ankle strapped during the second set, is a three-time grand slam semi-finalist.</p>
