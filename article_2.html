        <h2>First Home Grants scrapped from today</h2>
        <p>
But Housing Minister Chris Bishop has also announced $140 million in new funding for 1500 new social housing places from July next year.
</p>
        
            <p>The government has confirmed it plans to scrap the First Home Grants scheme, with applications ending from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>This would recoup about $245 million over four years.</p>
        
            <p>It has also announced $140 million in new funding for 1500 new social housing places from July next year, to be provided through Community Housing Providers rather than Kāinga Ora.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop announced the moves this afternoon at a media briefing called with just half an hour's notice.</p>
        
            <p>He listed the Salvation Army, Emerge Aotearoa and CORT as some providers that could be contracted to provide the social housing places, and said that would be managed through a process run by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
        
            <p>"Kāinga Ora is no longer accepting new applications for First Home Grants. They will still process applications that have already been received," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've gone through the system and you've been approved for a first home grant or you've been pre-approved or you've currently got approval, and you're going out there and looking for your first home - that can last up to six months, all of that will be honoured."</p>

            <p>He said the government was filling a hole for social housing places left as a "fiscal cliff" by the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now filling that hole that Labour left us and that gives them some pipeline certainty.</p>
        
            <p>He said the First Home Grant was an "expensive and inefficient way to support first home buyers" and had gone from covering about 10 percent of a standard deposit when it was introduced in 2010, to just over 4 percent of a standard deposit in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Evidence shows the grant brings forward the purchase of a first home - but in most cases it does not make a difference to whether someone can buy a home or not," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government would be happy to provide that evidence.</p>
        
            <p>"The First Home Grant is a programme that ultimately we think - in comparison to social housing places - is lower value expenditure at a time when the social housing waitlist has 25,000 families on it and we have a big demand for New Zealanders in need.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had to make the tough, but I think the right, decision to discontinue the first home grant and reprioritise that money to social housing places."</p>

            <p>He said it was expected to have "minimal effect on home ownership rates".</p>
        
            <p>Labour's housing spokesperson Kieran McAnulty earlier said scrapping the grants would be a cynical move.</p>
        
            <p>"It will mean that there are people that would have been able to buy a home, and now they can't. There's sort of a social contract with people when you announce a plan to assist them to do something so crucial and so significant in their life like buy a home, that you don't fiddle with it."</p>
        
            <p>He said removing the grants, while also restoring interest deductibility for landlords, would make things even harder for renters to get on the ladder.</p>
