            <p>Dozens of Chinese tourists involved in two separate bus crashes will be taken to Christchurch on Friday after a frightening ordeal on an icy stretch of rural highway.</p>
        
            <p>Two buses in a three-coach convoy rolled within a hundred metres of each other along State Highway 8's Tekapo-Twizel Highway shortly after 8.30am on Thursday. Fifteen people were rushed to hospital, two seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>Other drivers on the road say conditions were treacherous and the highway should have been closed.</p>
        
            <p>Tony McClelland was driving south to Omarama on State Highway 8 and called police after his van hit black ice.</p>
        
            <p>"I just said, 'You guys have got to close this road - I almost just lost the van, almost ended up down the ditch, and next thing out of the fog coming towards me are these two white buses. No signage on the coaches.</p>
        
            <p>"And they were flying. They were not doing 60[km/h]. They were not doing 80. They were doing at least 100 - probably a little bit more."</p>
        
            <p>He drove this stretch of road several times a month, and said the conditions were the worst he had ever seen, and there were not enough warnings.</p>
        
            <p>"There's only a sign up by the airfield, the Mount Cook airfield on the left hand side as you're heading south, just saying 'winter conditions, caution - black ice' or something along those lines. Some people - it's not big, mate - people can't read that in fog. It's just got me mindblown, really. Should have been closed."</p>
        
            <p>Grace, a traveller from Australia, was driving north and pulled up to help injured passengers.</p>

            <p>"We immediately jump out and start providing first aid to the people, and they don't speak much English - however, the ones that do can let us know that the bus just slipped.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no fatalities, thank god, but the children were quite lacerated from the glass, I believe. We were super-scared on the road because of the black ice and just really poor conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Local civil defence controller Chris Clark was also relieved the crashes were not a lot worse. About 30 passengers were on each of the buses. Clark said both volunteers and officials got cracking sorting out help for the shocked tourists.</p>
        
            <p>"They opened up our event centre as an emergency civil defence centre, very grateful to have assistance from iwi, local rÅ«nanga, who rustled up lunch for the people that were there.</p>
        
            <p>"We also were very fortunate to have some staff from the Dark Sky Project in Twizel, who offered some of their Chinese staff to come down and help with interpreting."</p>
        
            <p>Part of the touring party included one of the choirs that had competed at this week's World Choir games in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Clark said passengers will be bussed to Christchurch on Friday, but on Thursday night were staying in a Twizel hotel.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they collectively made a wise decision that they didn't want to be on the road in dark and possibly icy conditions again, so they were all holed up in a hotel."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Transport Agency / Waka Kotahi had been warning about those icy conditions since Wednesday morning, saying drivers should also be aware of fog and possibly snow driving.</p>
        
            <p>Instructor Mark Rivel Johnson said if drivers did hit ice, they should not brake.</p>
        
            <p>"Any inputs in terms of speed reduction or steering [should be] gradual and gentle. You're generally better if you have the space available to decelerate and potentially come down the gears gradually rather than trying to brake."</p>
        
            <p>Up until Thursday, there had been 11 fatal or serious crashes on the Tekapo-Twizel road. In the past five years, six people have been killed and 18 seriously injured.</p>
