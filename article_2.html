        <h2>Treatment plant stinks of 'hydrogen sulfide and faeces', residents say</h2>
        <p>
Deodorisers installed to manage the stench are "the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff," a councillor says. Audio

            <p>Seaview residents and business owners say the stench is still unbearable from the local wastewater treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>They have been battling with the smell for years, however, what one resident described as the smell of "hydrogen sulphide and faeces" has only become worse in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>Ranjini Singh from Electrotech said her commercial building had installed its own air fresheners, at the cost of a couple of hundred dollars.</p>
        
            <p>She felt embarrassed when customers visited her business because of the smell outside.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said she complained to the council twice in recent months, and nothing had changed.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt City councillor Brady Dyer told Midday Report the Seaview Wastewater Treatment Plant's odour issues were part of a wider lack of investment in treatment plants.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident we're doing everything we can. It's just been an unfortunate string of failures at the plant."</p>
        
            <p>Last year the plant's biofilters failed, and the recent issues were caused by a sludge dryer catching fire, Dyer said.</p>
        
            <p>Recently, a second deodoriser was installed to try to control the stench.</p>
        
            <p>"The deodoriser makes it slightly more pleasant, but it's still not not a pleasant smell," Dyer said.</p>
        
            <p>Although they were not an ideal solution, they would have to do while the council upgraded the plant, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The deodoriser is kind of the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water has apologised for the odour, and said it was doing all it could to stabilise the plant after the dryer outages.</p>
        
            <p>The sludge dryer is now working in the backlog of sludge is producing, it said.</p>
