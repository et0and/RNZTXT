            <p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is preparing to head to a convention centre in Palm Beach, Florida to address his supporters, his campaign aide has told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>The Trump family have begun to arrive at the watch party in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Media are reporting that Donald Trump Jr is shaking hands with supporters and pumping fists.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear what time he will begin speaking, but RNZ plans to livestream his speech.</p>
        
            <p>Kamala Harris is not expected to speak tonight.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after a successful night for the Trump campaign.</p>
        
            <p>He has picked up swing states including Georgia and North Carolina and is most likely to beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to the White House.</p>
        
            <p>If he does, he will have pulled off a remarkable feat becoming the first president since Grover Cleveland in 1893 to win a second non-consecutive term in office.</p>
