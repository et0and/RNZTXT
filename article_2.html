            <p>Dunedin has recorded its "wettest day in a century" as rain continues to hit the Otago region - but how does the rainfall compare to other recent flooding events?</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency has been declared in Dunedin and a red heavy rain warning for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha is not due to end until 11pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It is the region's first red heavy rain warning since MetService introduced its colour-coded severe weather warning system in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Across the country there have only been 15 red rain warnings issued since then - including during the Canterbury flooding in May 2021, the 2022 flooding in Gisborne and Wairoa, the 2023 Auckland floods and Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>

            <p>According to NIWA, by 9am on Friday, Dunedin had experienced its wettest day in over a century with 130.8mm falling in 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>Provisionally, Dunedin (Musselburgh) has just observed its second-wettest day on record with 130.8 mm from 9:00 am Thursday-9:00 am Friday. It has been their wettest day in over a century; the last time it was at least this wet in Musselburgh was in April 1923. pic.twitter.com/k7cnzu8Aji</p>
        
            <p>Here's how that compares to the largest amounts of 24-hour rainfall in other red rain warning events.</p>
        
            <p>The Canterbury floods saw intense rainfall over three days with severe flooding in many areas east of the Eastern foothills.</p>
        
            <p>Flood damage repairs took three years with damage to roads and bridges, flooding homes and farms.</p>
        
            <p>According to NIWA's climate summary at the time, six Canterbury areas had record or near-record high one-day rainfall totals for May.</p>
        
            <p>Winchmore experienced 78mm of rain on 30 May, while Akaroa had 98mm on the same day. Waipara West had 75mm the day before while Lake Tekapo experienced 107mm that day.</p>
        
            <p>Hanmore Forest had 90mm of rain in 24 hours and Ashburton came in at 62mm.</p>
        
            <p>In the last week of March 2022, Gisborne and Wairoa were hit by floods which caused extensive damage to the region, including washing out the Tokomaru Bay bridge, isolating communities.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, MetService reported Gisborne was hit with "around three months worth of rain" for the region in just 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>Between 250 to 300mm of rain was recorded.</p>
        
            <p>Even before the 27 January storm hit Auckland, it had been an unusually wet month - but on that day NIWA recorded there had been 280mm of rain in under 24 hours in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>The weather caused widespread flooding and damage to Auckland and resulted in the deaths of four men - Dave Young in Onewhero, Daniel Mark Miller and Daniel Newth in Wairau Valley, and Dave Lennard in Remuera.</p>
        
            <p>Many people lost their homes and flood-damaged cars had to be towed out of the city.</p>
        
            <p>An internal review later found MetService's weather modelling systems did not forecast the amount of rainfall or degree of severe flooding caused by the deluge.</p>
        
            <p>The region was then hit by Cyclone Gabrielle only a couple of weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>Cyclone Gabrielle battered much of the North Island, claiming the lives of 11 people and causing nearly $13.5b worth of damage.</p>
        
            <p>The heaviest 24-hour rainfall for Northland's Whangarei, was 183.8mm between 8am 12 February to 8am 13 February, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>While Napier Airport recorded its wettest February day from 8am, 13 February, to 8am 14 February, measuring 175.8mm.</p>
