            <p>The number of electorates in New Zealand will decrease from 65 to 64 at the next general election, with one fewer in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ made the announcement on Wednesday morning after considering last year's census results.</p>
        
            <p>The decision does not alter the size of Parliament - 120 seats, before any overhang - but means there will be one more list MP and one fewer electorate MP.</p>
        
            <p>"This means there will be one more list seat in a 120-member Parliament," acting deputy government statistician Kathy Connolly said.</p>
        
            <p>New boundaries for the 2026 election will now be drawn up based on the data.</p>
        
            <p>The number of Māori seats remains the same, at seven.</p>
