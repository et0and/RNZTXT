            <p>The cost of living is still rising, but new data shows it is rising at a slower rate.</p>
        
            <p>Here is what the latest household living-costs price indexes from Stats NZ tell us:</p>
        
            <p>Apart from a bit of a mouthful, you mean? They're a quarterly tool Stats NZ uses to measure how inflation affects different household groups, as well as the "average" household.</p>
        
            <p>That's different to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures how inflation affects the country as a whole.</p>
        
            <p>They also include interest rates, which aren't picked up by CPI data but, as you're probably painfully aware, are a huge chunk of household expenses.</p>
        
            <p>There's good news and bad news.</p>
        
            <p>The bad news is the cost of living for the average household increased 6.2 percent in the year to March.</p>
        
            <p>The good news is that, while the price of simply existing keeps rising, it's rising at a slower rate. In the year to December 2023, the increase was 7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Interest, interest and more interest.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ consumer prices manager James Mitchell said interest payments had made a significant contribution to higher living costs, with the average household having a 28 percent increase in interest costs in the last 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>Insurance costs were another major mover, up 17.9 percent, while private vehicle costs were up 9.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Good question and an interesting answer.</p>
        
            <p>The largest increase (6.6 percent) was actually seen among the highest-spending households, although obviously that doesn't necessarily mean they felt it more.</p>
        
            <p>On the other hand, the lowest-spending households faced a 5.7 percent increase.</p>
        
            <p>Beneficiaries' costs were up 5.3 percent, MƒÅori households' costs were up 6.3 percent, and superannuitants' costs increased by 5.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Superannuitants were less affected by higher interest costs as they were more likely to own their own homes, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the group had been hit by a 20 percent increase in insurance costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Higher prices for insurance and rates have more impact than for other household groups who are more likely to rent or have mortgages," he said.</p>
