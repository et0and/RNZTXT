            <p>MetService is warning there could be small tornadoes in coastal areas today, as heavy downpours and thunderstorms are being forecast for parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has a heavy rain watch in place for Northland (until 9am), Coromandel (until 2pm) and Bay of Plenty (until 10pm).</p>
        
            <p>A watch is also in place for the Tasman, west of Motueka through until about 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>☔️It's a return to umbrellas for the northern and central parts of the country on Wednesday as an area of low pressure brings wet weather, which could be heavy at times⚡️The upper North Island may even be in for a thunderstorm in the morning with more intense bursts of rain pic.twitter.com/dueEWlCiwT</p>
        
            <p>It says there will be periods of heavy downpours and the possibility of thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>The thunderstorms may also bring wind gusts of 80-90km/h, which might result in small tornadoes about coastal areas, MetService forecaster Clare O'Conner told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain hit Northland overnight, as well as the Tasman area, including Collingwood. The Coromandel Peninsula and the Bay of Plenty are expected to be affected from early this morning.</p>

            <p>O'Conner said overnight the heaviest rain had fallen in Northland (Twin Bridges got almost 17mm between 4am and 5am) and at Whenuapai which received 8mm in half an hour before 6am.</p>
        
            <p>A front sitting over Waikato at 6am would move to the south-east and might result in downpours and thunderstorms and possibly some lightning, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In Tasman the Takaka hill had 22mm of rain overnight and it was still raining.</p>
        
            <p>"The lower North Island if you're not wet yet you will be later on today."</p>
        
            <p>The bad weather is being delivered by a low that is lying to the west of the centre of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Rain was expected to ease in the North Island by tomorrow while it might last a bit longer in the South Island.</p>
