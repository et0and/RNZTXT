        <p>
Move over, Brangelina, Donald Glover and Maya Erskine are brilliant in this surprisingly relatable action-packed series, says Pratik Navani.

            <p>Not sure what to watch tonight? Join us as we dig deep into the streamers' catalogues for shows worth your time. This week's watch: Mr. & Mrs. Smith.</p>
        
            <p>Before you dismiss this series, quoting online controversies, mixed reviews or your nostalgia for Brangelina, I strongly suggest that you ignore all the noise. Believe the hype, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a must-watch.</p>
        
            <p>The show runners have taken on the daunting task of adapting the 2005 action/rom-com starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie into an eight episode streaming series - and they've surpassed the original in more ways than one. The mix of thrilling espionage set pieces and an engaging romance between two strangers forced into what is essentially an employer-backed arranged marriage creates hilariously awkward moments of genuine intimacy. You might not have ever had to perform the same 'missions', but there's something very relatable about the show all the same.</p>

            <p>John (Donald Glover) and Jane (Maya Erskine) are both desperate to be hired for a well-paying, "high-risk" job at a mysterious international spy agency. The job requires them to leave their past behind in return for a life of luxury and high-stakes espionage with a forever roommate who they don't get to pick.</p>
        
            <p>It's got simple but nuanced character development, exciting action in scenic locations, that classic Donald Glover humour and some cool celebrity cameos (such as Parker Posey, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, John Turturro) in almost every episode. But where Mr. & Mrs. Smith really shines is when it explores slower moments of vulnerability and trust in a relationship through some seriously authentic dialogue.</p>
        
            <p>The season is self-contained but has the potential for a second season without leaving you hanging if they don't make more.</p>
        
            <p>Absolutely.</p>

            <p>Atlanta (Hilarious, thought-provoking, surreal comedy drama)</p>
        
            <p>Community (Cult classic comedy set in a community college, not your average sitcom).</p>
