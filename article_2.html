            <p>Can the Australian teams continue their good form this weekend? There definitely feels like there's a shift in the power dynamic of Super Rugby Pacific right now, with last weekend being the first time the Blues, Crusaders and Chiefs all lost on the same weekend in over a decade.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend starts off with a blockbuster in Christchurch, but the last game of the round sees some firepower return for a wounded Blues side.</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 7.05pm Friday</p>
        
            <p>Apollo Projects Stadium, Christchurch</p>

            <p>As if the Crusaders' start to the season couldn't get any tougher, they've just had the unluckiest break with Scott Barrett being ruled out for six weeks with a broken finger. David Havili takes over the captaincy of the winless champions, who face a Hurricanes side still missing a Barrett of their own.</p>
        
            <p>This still should be a really good game, though. The Crusaders have to start winning some time and being back at home is going to greatly increase the odds of that happening. Meanwhile, the Canes welcome back Du'Plessis Kirifi, who bolsters their loose forward unit who dealt to the Blues last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders: 15 Chay Fihaki, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Levi Aumua, 12 David Havili (c), 11 Macca Springer, 10 Riley Hohepa, 9 Willi Heinz, 8 Cullen Grace, 7 Tom Christie, 6 Dominic Gardiner, 5 Zach Gallagher, 4 Quinten Strange, 3 Fletcher Newell, 2 George Bell, 1 George Bower</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ioane Moananu, 17 Finlay Brewis, 18 Owen Franks, 19 Jamie Hannah, 20 Tahlor Cahill, 21 Mitchell Drummond, 22 Ryan Crotty, 23 Dallas McLeod</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes: 15 Ruben Love, 14 Josh Moorby, 13 Billy Proctor (cc), 12 Riley Higgins, 11 Kini Naholo, 10 Brett Cameron, 9 Cam Roigard, 8 Brayden Iose, 7 Peter Lakai, 6 Devan Flanders, 5 Isaia Walker-Leawere, 4 James Tucker, 3 Tyrel Lomax, 2 Asafo Aumua (c), 1 Tevita Mafileo</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 James O'Reilly, 17 Pouri Rakete-Stones, 18 Pasilio Tosi, 19 Justin Sangster, 20 Du'Plessis Kirifi, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Peter Umaga-Jensen, 23 Salesi Rayasi</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9.35pm Friday</p>
        
            <p>AAMI Park, Melbourne</p>
        
            <p>Probably worth keeping an eye on, the Rebels have bounced back impressively from their opening round hiding to record two wins. They face a Reds team that's coming off upsetting the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Rebels: 15 Andrew Kellaway, 14 Lachie Anderson, 13 Filipo Daugunu, 12 David Feliuai, 11 Glen Vaihu, 10 Carter Gordon, 9 Ryan Louwrens, 8 Rob Leota (c), 7 Vaiolini Ekuasi, 6 Josh Kemeny, 5 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 4 Josh Canham, 3 Taniela Tupou, 2 Jordan Uelese, 1 Matt Gibbon</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Ethan Dobbins, 17 Isaac Kailea, 18 Sam Talakai, 19 Tuaina Taii Tualima, 20 Maciu Nabolakasi, 21 Angelo Smith, Jake Strachan, James Tuttle</p>
        
            <p>Reds: 15 Jock Campbell, 14 Suliasi Vunivalu, 13 Josh Flook, 12 Isaac Henry, 11 Mac Grealy, 10 Harry McLaughlin-Phillips, 9 Tate McDermott (cc), 8 Harry Wilson, 7 Fraser McReight, 6 Liam Wright (cc), 5 Ryan Smith, 4 Seru Uru, 3 Zane Nonggorr, 2 Matt Faessler, 1 Peni Ravai</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Josh Nasser, 17 George Blake, 18 Jeffery Toomaga-Allen, 19 Cormac Daly, 20 John Bryant, 21 Kalani Thomas, 22 Tom Lynagh, 23 Jordan Petaia</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 12am Saturday</p>
        
            <p>HBF Park, Perth</p>

            <p>This is a big one for Moana, they let a good opportunity to get on a roll slip against the Rebels last weekend. Veterans Christian Lealiifano and Sekope Kepu come back into the starting XV for them, but another familiar face will line up for the Force. Former Canes loose forward Reed Princep has made the move west, linking up with fellow Kiwis Tom Franklin and Chase Tiatia.</p>
        
            <p>Western Force: 15 Max Burey, 14 Harry Potter, 13 Bayley Kuenzle, 12 Hamish Stewart, 11 Chase Tiatia, 10 Ben Donaldson, 9 Issak Fines-Leleiwasa, 8 Will Harris, 7 Carlo Tizzano, 6 Tim Anstee, 5 Jeremy Williams (c), 4 Thomas Franklin, 3 Santiago Medrano, 2 Tom Horton, 1 Ryan Coxon</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Feleti Kaitu'u, 17 Josh Bartlett, 18 Tiaan Tauakipulu, 19 Lopeti Faifua, 20 Reed Prinsep, 21 Ollie Callan, 22 Nic White, 23 George Poolman</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika: 15 Danny Toala, 14 Nigel Ah Wong, 13 Henry Taefu, 12 Julian Savea, 11 Kyren Taumoefolau, 10 Christian Lealiifano, 9 Ereatara Enari, 8 Lotu Inisi, 7 Sione Havili Talitui (c), 6 Jacob Norris, 5 Allan Craig, 4 Tom Savage, 3 Sekope Kepu, 2 Sama Malolo, 1 Abraham Pole</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Samiuela Moli, Sateki Latu, Sione Mafileo, Ola Tauelangi, Irie Papuni, Melani Matavao, William Havili, Pepesana Patafilo</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 4.35pm Saturday</p>

            <p>Billy Harmon has clearly been punctual this week as he's back in the starting lineup as Highlanders captain. Which is just as well, because Hugh Renton is out for six weeks with an ankle injury. Cam Millar gets his first start at first five, with Rhys Patchell somewhat surprisingly rested after his impressive transition to Super Rugby. The Brumbies haven't gone anywhere near what they are capable of so far this season, all the talent is there in a strong looking team, though.</p>
        
            <p>Highlanders: 15 Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens, 14 Timoci Tavatavanawai, 13 Tanielu Tele'a, 12 Sam Gilbert, 11 Martin Bogado, 10 Cameron Millar, 9 Folau Fakatava, 8 Nikora Broughton, 7 Billy Harmon (c), 6 Tom Sanders, 5 Max Hicks, 4 Fabian Holland, 3 Saula Ma'u, 2 Jack Taylor, 1 Ethan de Groot</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Henry Bell, 17 Ayden Johnstone, 18 Jermaine Ainsley, 19 Oliver Haig, 20 Sean Withy, 21 James Arscott, 22 Ajay Faleafaga, 23 Connor Garden-Bachop</p>
        
            <p>Brumbies: 15 Tom Wright, 14 Andy Muirhead, 13 Len Ikitau, 12 Tamati Tua, 11 Corey Toole, 10 Noah Lolesio, 9 Ryan Lonergan (c), 8 Rob Valetini, 7 Jahrome Brown, 6 Tom Hooper, 5 Cadeyrn Neville, 4 Nick Frost, 3 Sosefo Kautai, 2 Billy Pollard, 1 Blake Schoupp</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Lachlan Lonergan, 17 James Slipper, 18 Rhys Van Nek, 19 Darcy Swain, 20 Rory Scott, 21 Harrison Goddard, 22 Declan Meredith, 23 Ollie Sapsford</p>

            <p>The Reds probably didn't do anyone any favours by tipping up the Chiefs last weekend, because now they'll be on a mission to make up for it. The Drua are coming in having defeated the Crusaders, but there's a difference between playing in Lautoka and having to come to Hamilton. While there should be some decent on field action, the Chiefs are also putting on a 200 drone light show at halftime, the first of its kind in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs: 15 Shaun Stevenson, 14 Daniel Rona, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 12 Rameka Poihipi, 11 Etene Nanai-Seturo, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Cortez Ratima, 8 Luke Jacobson (c), 7 Kaylum Boshier, 6 Samipeni Finau, 5 Jimmy Tupou, 4 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 3 Reuben O'Neill, 2 Samisoni Taukei'aho, 1 Aidan Ross</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Bradley Slater, 17 Ollie Norris, 18 George Dyer, 19 Josh Lord, 20 Tom Florence, 21 Xavier Roe, 22 Josh Ioane, 23 Quinn Tupaea</p>
        
            <p>Fijian Drua: 15 Ilaisa Droasese, 14 Selestino Ravutaumada, 13 Iosefo Masi, 12 Michael Naitokani, 11 Junior Ratuva, 10 Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 9 Simione Kuruvoli, 8 Meli Derenalagi (c), 7 Vilive Miramira, 6 Etonia Waqa, 5 Ratu Leone Rotuisolia, 4 Mesake Vocevoce, 3 Jone Koroiduadua, 2 Mesulame Dolokoto, 1 Haereiti Hetet</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Zuriel Togiatama, 17 Emosi Tuqiri, 18 Samuela Tawake, 19 Te Ahiwaru Cirikidaveta, 20 Elia Canakaivata, 21 Peni Matawalu, 22 Kemu Valetini, 23 Taniela Rakuro</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 9.35pm Saturday</p>

            <p>Here's an interesting match up, because the Tahs have come off a win against the Crusaders and a game they all but won against the Highlanders. They look like they might actually be turning into the team they should be, but this is a tough ask against a Blues side that was wiped out by the Canes last weekend. Caleb Clarke, Hoskins Sotutu and Ofa Tu'ungafasi come back in for the Blues, who will want to put this one away early and start thinking about their big game at Eden Park against the Crusaders next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Waratahs: 15 Mark Nawaqanitawase, 14 Triston Reilly, 13 Izaia Perese, 12 Joey Walton, 11 Dylan Pietsch, 10 Tane Edmed, 9 Jake Gordon (c), 8 Langi Gleeson, 7 Charlie Gamble, 6 Ned Hanigan, 5 Fergus Lee-Warner, 4 Jed Holloway, 3 Harry Johnson-Holmes, 2 Julian Heaven, 1 Hayden Thompson-Stringer</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Jay Fonokalafi, 17 Angus Bell, 18 Tom Ross, 19 Miles Amatosero, 20 Hugh Sinclair, 21 Lachlan Swinton, 22 Jack Grant, 23 Harry Wilson</p>
        
            <p>Blues: 15 Zarn Sullivan, 14 Mark Tele'a, 13 Rieko Ioane, 12 Bryce Heem, 11 Caleb Clarke, 10 Stephen Perofeta, 9 Finlay Christie, 8 Hoskins Sotutu, 7 Dalton Papali'i (c), 6 Akira Ioane, 5 Laghlan McWhannell, 4 Josh Beehre, 3 Marcel Renata, 2 Kurt Eklund, 1 Ofa Tu'ungafasi</p>
        
            <p>Bench: 16 Soane Vikena, 17 Joshua Fusitu'a, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Cameron Suafoa, 20 Anton Segner, 21 Sam Nock, 22 Harry Plummer, 23 Cole Forbes</p>
