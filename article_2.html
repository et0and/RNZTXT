            <p>Eight pilot whales which were stranded at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay have been successfully refloated by rescuers.</p>
        
            <p>Ten whales originally stranded on Tuesday, but two had since died.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation confirmed the whales had been successfully refloated on Wednesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts to refloat the remaining whales started at high tide, at about 5pm, DOC's Golden Bay operations manager Ross Trotter said.</p>
        
            <p>Trotter said rain had been keeping the eight remaining whales wet and cool, but the health of three of them had deteriorated.</p>
        
            <p>They received the report about 6.30pm on Tuesday about the stranding in an area known as Triangle Flat at the base of Farewell Spit.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah and iwi assisted DOC with the refloat.</p>
        
            <p>Trotter said rescuers had not seen these whales at Farewell Spit previously. However, it was clear they had stranded in another location before.</p>
        
            <p>"They are showing signs of having been sunburnt and have healed over, so possibly in the last few weeks they have been beached somewhere else."</p>
        
            <p>While there were many theories about why strandings happened so often at Farewell Spit, the shape of the bay was a possible factor, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A pod of pilot whales was refloated several times in December.</p>
        
            <p>Not all of them survived.</p>
        
            <p>Among those that did, some were seen in the area even after being refloated again.</p>
