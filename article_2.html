            <p>Critically endangered short-tailed bats have been recorded in the Wellington region near the PƒÅkuratahi River, for the first time in more than seven years.</p>
        
            <p>The animals are the rarest mammals in New Zealand and were feared to be extinct in the lower North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City Council senior conservation advisor Ben Paris - also known as New Zealand's Batman - said, "Wellington isn't very well known for its bat fauna, so [this] is really exciting."</p>

            <p>Idyllic growing conditions have meant the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables is 25 percent lower compared to this time last year - and they are now at prices not seen for several years.</p>
        
            <p>United Fresh New Zealand president Jerry Prendergast said for the past 10 months, apart from a late summer drought in Horowhenua, growing conditions around the country have been "incredible" with rain and warm sunshine arriving "on cue".</p>

            <p>A Deaf person travelling on an Air New Zealand flight where cabin crew used sign language says the experience made him "feel seen".</p>
        
            <p>In what was claimed as a world first, Air NZ cabin crew signed in-flight passenger safety announcements, along with food and drink services to mark New Zealand Sign Language Week. Other passengers were encouraged to give NZSL a go too, with illustrated cards for popular items like "water", "cookie" and "lolly" placed on seats.</p>

            <p>The Project Prima Volta community programme, based in Hawke's Bay, was founded by professional mezzo soprano Anna Pierard and her husband Jose Aparicio, a conductor and musician, 10 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The charitable trust shares their passion for opera, with 30 teenagers taking part in the programme every year.</p>
        
            <p>The project - which involves 12 months of coaching and mentoring, culminating in a opera performance - helps teenagers build confidence and self-esteem.</p>

            <p>In a huge win for the capital and the country's film industry as a whole, two new Lord of the Rings movies will be produced by Peter Jackson in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Head of Attraction for Screen Wellington Mark Westerby said the production would also be a chance for a new generation of Kiwi film makers to prove themselves on the world's stage. Andy Serkis will return in his role as Gollum and will also direct the first film, which is set to hit screens in 2026.</p>
