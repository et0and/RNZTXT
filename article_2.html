            <p>A man has been arrested and charged following "extensive enquiries" by police into an aggravated burglary in Miramar.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still trying to establish whether there is a link between the burglary, and the death of 63-year-old Abdul Nabizadah, who was found critically injured at a nearby intersection shortly afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard says the man that has been arrested is 28 years old, and is due to appear in Wellington District Court on Thursday, charged with aggravated burglary and aggravated injury.</p>
        
            <p>At about 2am on Monday 17 March, police were called to a Darlington Road address, where the occupants had located an intruder inside their home.</p>
        
            <p>Police said after an altercation with the occupants of the house, the alleged offender fled. One person in the house received minor injuries and the other three were uninjured.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still searching for two men who might have seen or heard something that will help the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>One was seen walking down Camperdown Road from Totara Street and turned right in to Darlington Road from Camperdown Road at 12.28am, wearing a light-coloured top and dark pants.</p>
        
            <p>"We know Mr Nabizadah arrived in Totara Street in his silver-coloured Toyota Aqua, registration NQE681, at 12.25am, so this man may well have seen Mr Nabizadah and or his vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge this person, or anyone who may know them, to come forward as soon as possible."</p>
        
            <p>At 1.30am, a man in fitness clothing or activewear was seen running south on Darlington Road, before crossing the Camperdown Road intersection, wearing a blue shirt.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, residents held a meeting demanding more neighbourhood security, with close to 100 people in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>They heard from Wellington City Council officials, with safety advisor Joel Berryman explaining that police data informed resourcing for security measures such as lighting and CCTV cameras, with a single camera costing up to $25,000.</p>
        
            <p>Police said on Wednesday they understood the concern.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand these incidents are upsetting and concerning for the community and the investigation team are working tirelessly to determine the circumstances around Mr Nabizadah's death and to bring closure for his family."</p>
