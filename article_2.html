            <p>Supermarket shoppers are still holding out for savings on fruit and vegetables, after the announcement that prices have fallen.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths New Zealand says better growing conditions means some produce is up to 30 percent cheaper than this time last year.</p>
        
            <p>But shoppers in Auckland say they are yet to see much of a difference.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths general manager of fruit and vegetables Ryan McMullen told Midday Report yesterday that the weather situation had "significantly improved".</p>
        
            <p>"The weather patterns changed around mid-spring, and leading into summer, and got into a much more settled, normal weather pattern, where rainfall is predictable and has contributed to much better growing conditions for growers and therefore more product in the market."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths said household favourites such as lettuce were up to 40 percent cheaper.</p>
        
            <p>But outside Ponsonby's Countdown supermarket - run by Woolworths - shoppers said they were still searching for savings.</p>
        
            <p>"It's expensive, but everything is, it's not just fruit and vege, it's everything, everything has gone up," said one shopper.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is coming down gradually but not really enough to give you a shock," said another.</p>
        
            <p>One shopper, Jackson, said if the chain could afford the rebrand from Countdown to Woolworths, it could afford to keep costs low.</p>
        
            <p>"I think their prices are pretty crazy, especially when they've got all that money to rebrand for whatever reason they chose to," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Statistics New Zealand data showed food price inflation was slowing to its lowest point in more than two years.</p>
        
            <p>Data from February showed fruit and vegetables drove a 0.6 percent drop in the food price index last month, with smaller drops in meat and groceries.</p>
        
            <p>Cheaper fresh produce was the main influence on the annual figures, offset by more expensive takeaways and restaurant meals.</p>
        
            <p>Vegetables New Zealand chair John Murphy said the drop in veggie prices would make a big difference to households.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged shoppers to buy what was in season.</p>
        
            <p>"If you buy what's abundant, then it helps growers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason that prices come down is that we have a lot of that vegetable, so if you can learn some of the tricks about using different vegetables then you'll save quite a bit of money."</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs - which runs the New World and Pak'nSave supermarkets, said in a statement that it had been a challenging few years keeping food prices under control.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the company said they were determined to help shoppers get value at the checkout.</p>
