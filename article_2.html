            <p>The mother of a teenager who was lured by a man using Snapchat to have sexual activity in the bushes says the girl now carries a burden "she should never have had to bear".</p>
        
            <p>Roland Isaac McKop, 46, went by the username "Classicman" on the social media app and told the 13-year-old he wanted to be her "sugar daddy" and would pay her for monthly sexual liaisons.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, he appeared before Judge Noel Cocurullo in the Hamilton District Court where he was jailed for two years and six months.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Cocurullo told McKop that even if he got down to the two-year threshold where a sentence of home detention could be considered, he still would not have given him that, due to the pre-meditation, planning, and seriousness of his offending.</p>
        
            <p>The victim's mother told the court the hardest truth to live with was knowing that her daughter would carry the experience with her throughout her entire life.</p>
        
            <p>"A burden she should never have had to bear."</p>
        
            <p>McKop added the victim as a friend on Snapchat on 11 January last year and they began chatting.</p>
        
            <p>He told her he added her because her avatar looked cute. Through their messaging, he discovered she was only 13.</p>
        
            <p>McKop did not want to tell her his name or age but eventually claimed to be in his mid-30s and said he wanted to be her "sugar daddy".</p>
        
            <p>He then tried to establish some rules around that; namely, meeting once a month and that he would pay her and occasionally also bring her a gift.</p>
        
            <p>The victim agreed to meet at 3pm the next day at a spot just out of Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>McKop messaged saying he wanted to "do it" in his car but she declined, stating she did not want to get kidnapped.</p>
        
            <p>They agreed they would meet in the bushes.</p>
        
            <p>McKop began kissing her and got her to lie down.</p>
        
            <p>He asked if he could have sex with her, to which she said "no". He tried anyway.</p>
        
            <p>The victim asked if there was any other way to get money and he told her that they could do "everything else except sex".</p>
        
            <p>After paying her they both left.</p>
        
            <p>In a message to the victim that afternoon, McKop thanked her and said he wanted to do it again, but he quickly discovered she had blocked him.</p>
        
            <p>He then found her on another social media site but she blocked him again.</p>
        
            <p>At his sentencing, Crown solicitor Scarlett Hartstone said while McKop had taken part in a restorative justice conference with the victim and her family, any discount for that should be tempered by his continuous refusal to acknowledge he was sexually attracted to children.</p>
        
            <p>"Any rehabilitation couldn't be meaningfully addressed until he admits that he has a sexual attraction towards children."</p>
        
            <p>She submitted that McKop did not deserve any credit for previous good character due to the serious nature of what he had done.</p>
        
            <p>But his counsel, Richard Barnsdale, disagreed, submitting his client was still coming to grips with his offending.</p>
        
            <p>"I would submit he is only, at this stage, beginning the process of treatment for his problem.</p>
        
            <p>"His comments are a starting point ... he apologises in his own way. It may be if the court expected an abject apology, that will follow after he has been in therapy.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got a lot to work through in that area and he knows that."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Cocurullo told the victim's mother she had shown great courage in reading out her victim impact statement in court.</p>
        
            <p>He told McKop that his offending had a huge effect on the victim and said sending him to jail warned others that similar offending would result in a prison sentence.</p>
        
            <p>McKop was sentenced on seven charges including five of doing an indecent act with a girl under 16, having communication with a girl under 16 with intent to meet her, and entering into a contract with a person under 16 to provide sexual services to him.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to his term of imprisonment, he was ordered to pay $3500 in emotional harm reparation to the victim.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
