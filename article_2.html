            <p>A body has been removed from a sushi shop on Auckland's North Shore after a violent attack on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>The person died of self-inflicted injuries after committing an assault at Neco Sushi.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of the store was taken to Auckland Hospital with serious injuries but was now in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>It was an isolated incident and the pair were known to each other, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The Browns Bay Business Association town centre manager Kim Murdoch said the attack was a domestic, not random.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, it could have happened at their house, it could have happened anywhere and it's just really unfortunate that it had happened in the town centre."</p>
        
            <p>Murdoch said despite that, the attack would have left some businesses feeling nervous.</p>
