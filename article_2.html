            <p>It was a redemption story for the movies as the burly West Australian former bikie gang member Ryan Peake won his maiden title at the Milbrook Resort.</p>
        
            <p>Peake, 31, carded a final round of five-under-66 to finish at 23-under, a shot clear of Australian Jack Thompson, South African Ian Snyman and Kazuki Higa from Japan.</p>

            <p>Australia's Ryan Peake wins the 104th NZ Open golf tournament at Millbrook Resort, in Arrowtown.</p>
        
            <p>In becoming the 104th New Zealand Open champion, and with the rain falling at Milbrook, he was overcome with raw emotion.</p>
        
            <p>Proud at turning his life around, Peake said he would cherish the title.</p>
        
            <p>Peake was found guilty of serious assault as a 21-year-old and sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>"If I had suggested this win at the start of the week, you would have laughed at me," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm lost for words."</p>
        
            <p>He's not sure how he will celebrate but family and friends are top of the list.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't had a drink this year, to be honest I'll probably get ready for next week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight I'll be doing a lot of video calls with my friends and family."</p>
        
            <p>Peake won a $360,000 payday and is guaranteed a start at the 2025 British Open at Royal Portrush.</p>
