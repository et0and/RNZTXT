            <p>It was a shank Isaiya Katoa will never forget.</p>
        
            <p>With the scores locked at 24-all between the Kiwis and Tonga at Mount Smart, Katoa stepped up to nail one of the ugliest, but most memorable field goals in test history.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to say it was the best kick ever. But actually, no, it came right off the inside of my boot and I thought it was going to the left so I'm gonna give the wind the credit because it just kept its shape. It was just a kick and hope," Katoa said.</p>
        
            <p>Following Katoa's crucial one-pointer, the Kiwis had two pops at goal of their own, but neither found the mark as Tonga closed out an absolute classic.</p>
        
            <p>The Tongan support was deafening as the crimson army packed the stands in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a feeling I can't describe, to do that in front of the red sea is something I'll never forget."</p>
        
            <p>Katoa said the people of Tonga are the driving force behind the side.</p>
        
            <p>"I do it for my grandpa. He passed away when I was 10, but he was such a major influence to my life and the way I was raised. We all have very important reasons why we want to play footy and why we want to represent Tonga and they're the backbone of that. Our families, all the people back in Tonga."</p>

            <p>Eligible to play for both New Zealand and Australia, Katoa said it was ultimately an easy decision which nation to pledge his allegiance to.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a matter of what my heart feels and at the moment, it's with Tonga. These are the games you dream of as a kid. It's so much bigger than just our team and our family. It's the whole country, Tonga itself. So to give back to these fans that go parading every night, go crazy, and just show us so much support no matter what, win or lose is very special."</p>
        
            <p>Tonga prop Addin Fonua-Blake heaped the praise on his young halfback.</p>
        
            <p>"For a 20-year-old to kick a goal like that in a game like that, he's a pretty special player."</p>
        
            <p>Coach Kristian Woolf said his players draw tremendous inspiration from their supporters.</p>
        
            <p>"They take a lot out of the crowd, it is what these blokes want to be a part of and what they want to play for."</p>
        
            <p>Woolf said they had created something special in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"You go back a number of years and the word that was thrown around a lot by our leaders was legacy, they wanted to leave a legacy where young Tongan players wanted to play for Tonga first and were just as, if not more proud to play for Tonga than to play for New Zealand or Australia and that's what they've done."</p>
        
            <p>Also eligible for the Kiwis, Fonua-Blake signed for Tonga in 2017 after one test for New Zealand, inspired by teammate Jason Taumalolo.</p>
        
            <p>"He's changed the international game, he showed us there is more to play for than money, we will never look back because games like these make you feel like it was the right decision."</p>
