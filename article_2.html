            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will make a formal public apology at Parliament on 12 November to those who experienced abuse in state and faith-based care.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon announced the date for the apology at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing, saying it was important the Crown addressed and acknowledged their experiences at a national level.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry into Historical Abuse in State and Faith Based Care delivered its report to the Governor-General three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>The report and recommendations will be made public on Wednesday after it is presented to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he had started reading the the report, but it was huge - weighing 14kg.</p>
        
            <p>There would be a range of opinions on it, he said, "but let's be clear here, this is a shameful part of our history."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, RNZ reported on Monday that survivors have largely or completely covered the cost of travelling to Parliament to see the final report.</p>
        
            <p>Travel assistance for survivors registered with the Royal Commission was offered in the form of a small contribution through vouchers for those outside Wellington. However, many survivors were not even aware that was available, the story said.</p>
