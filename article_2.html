            <p>A water safety spokesperson wants to see the equivalent of a national road safety campaign targeting drowning prevention.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after annual statistics were released on Tuesday which Water Safety New Zealand (WSNZ) called "concerning" and "alarming".</p>
        
            <p>It showed 90 people died in preventable drownings last year, only slightly down from the 94 deaths recorded in 2022, but still above the 10-year average of 82.</p>
        
            <p>"Alarmingly, the under-five age group saw a spike in drownings, with eight fatalities, surpassing the 10-year average of five," WSNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>WSNZ chief executive Daniel Gerrard said local councils and central government should get behind a new initiative to help prevent more drownings - identifying the most dangerous areas in the country for fishing and swimming and designating them as 'black spots'.</p>
        
            <p>Places which did not have the highest rates of drowning deaths, but were still considered dangerous, would be labelled as 'hot spots'.</p>
        
            <p>"Southland, for example, has a far lower drowning rate than Northland, but Slope Point in Southland is a notorious rock fishing spot which is definitely a hot spot," Gerrard said.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped there would be signage at and around each spot, with phone notifications alerting members of the public if they were approaching dangerous areas.</p>
        
            <p>The areas would be designated using 25 years of collected data on fatal preventable drownings.</p>
        
            <p>However, Gerrard said the initiative was a massive undertaking and it needed a significant boost in funding, along with participation from elected leaders.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be looking at local and regional partners to leverage more investment to make that happen.</p>
        
            <p>"We just can't continue doing a broad-brush approach and doing national campaigns to do this and that - we don't have the resource. We've got to go local, and now that we know where those local spots are, that's what we have to do."</p>
        
            <p>Gerrard said he would like to see funding brought closer to match what is used in road safety campaigns.</p>
        
            <p>While preventable drownings were equal to about one-quarter the number of road deaths in 2023, $62 million was spent on the Road to Zero campaign, whereas WSNZ only received $4m.</p>
        
            <p>"There's big discrepancies there and I just don't want drowning in New Zealand to be just accepted as a thing that happens on an island nation."</p>
        
            <p>Just because water is built into the culture, he said drowning should not be normal.</p>
        
            <p>"It's either our playground or our pantry, we're either going out to feed the family or have a bloody great day out. Too often that whole thing is destroyed by a massive tragedy."</p>
        
            <p>A four-year water safety package of $63m was set aside in the 2020 Budget, which helped pay for Coastguard and Surf Life Saving services over the 2022/23 summer period.</p>
