            <p>A study to identify individual kākā using AI has received a funding boost of $1 million, one of a number of research projects using artificial intelligence "for good".</p>
        
            <p>The funding comes from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's (MBIE) Smart Ideas fund, which this year received 351 applications, and approved 53 of them.</p>
        
            <p>The kākā project is a collaboration between behavioural ecologist Dr Rachael Shaw and senior lecturer in artificial intelligence Andrew Lensen, both from Victoria University of Wellington, who have been working on a new way of identifying individual birds to make monitoring easier.</p>
        
            <p>Lensen said it was increasingly difficult to keep track of individuals as they spread out beyond Zealandia, where the species had flourished in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Not all birds were fitted with leg bands, and sometimes even those could become discoloured or hard to see, making keeping track of them tricky - and the city presented new threats, like disease, conflict with humans and unintentional poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>The project began with photographs taken in nesting boxes at Zealandia, perfectly set up to allow snapshots of the birds heads in profile while they fed.</p>
        
            <p>They were now achieving 90 to 95 percent accuracy with this method, Lensen said, but in a surprise twist, the AI was using posture rather than beaks, which the team had initially thought would be easiest, to tell birds apart.</p>
        
            <p>The next step would be to scale up the complexity and test the AI's ability to identify birds against a background of trees, rather than the inside of a feeding box.</p>

            <p>Lensen said the funding would allow them to put in more cameras, test new methods like deep learning, and lean more into a mātauranga Māori approach.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a big chunk of research around matauranga Māori, and trying to reconnect Māori with kākā," he said. "Before colonisation, they were seen as gods, or atua."</p>
        
            <p>Three proposals from the Victoria University faculty of engineering had received MBIE funding this year, all using what Lensen called "AI for good": the kākā project, another using AI to recognise kiwi calls and another for ice sheet modelling.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a reflection, I think, of where we are as academics," he said. "In contrast to in industry, where there is very much a capitalistic focus, we are quite privileged in that we have this freedom, or in some ways this mandate, to do good things with the technology."</p>
