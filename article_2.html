            <p>A broken water main has sent a stream of brown water gushing down Vivian Street on State Highway 1 in central Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter said the right-hand lane on the one-way route was closed, after the force of the water buckled the road and cracked the pavement.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency said due to flooding, the right-most lane between Taranaki Street and Tory Street was blocked.</p>
        
            <p>The road was the southern part of State Highway One to the airport and eastern suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists were warned to expect delays on Thursday afternoon as traffic on the major thoroughfare had to form a single file.</p>

            <p>Wellington Water said in a statement it had responded to a burst main on Vivian Street, in the suburb of Te Aro.</p>
        
            <p>Just before 3pm it said it was assessing the shutdown area and water would soon be turned off.</p>
        
            <p>"It is anticipated that service will be interrupted for at least five hours."</p>
        
            <p>An hour later, it said a team had successfully isolated the drinking water pipe and they were progressing with the repairs.</p>
        
            <p>A man working nearby alluded to the city's cycle lanes controversy, saying he thought the council was putting in a kayak lane, and lamented the impact on local businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Another person working on a nearby building said water had been cut off for about half an hour, and most of his work mates sent home for the rest of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Council contractors working with jackhammers had drained much of the flooding by 4pm.</p>
