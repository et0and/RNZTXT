            <p>Bevon-John Jacobs was picked up on the second day of the IPL auction for the minimum base price of $60,000.</p>
        
            <p>The uncapped Auckland batter is one of four New Zealand cricketers picked up on the second day of the Indian Premier League auction in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs was the only one of the 24 New Zealanders who entered the auction to not have played for his country.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old right-hand batter was the lowest-valued New Zealand player entered in the auction, registering for the minimum base price of $60,000.</p>
        
            <p>That is what the Mumbai Indians picked him up for.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs told Morning Report he was thrilled to have made the cut.</p>
        
            <p>"It was definitely a long shot. I woke up this morning with the big surprise and it was a surprise, it was awesome to see and I think it's just been a bit overwhelming," Jacobs said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to to the opportunity and I'm very grateful for it."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs believes the experience will be worth it even if he doesn't get to play.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, 100 percent. It's just a massive opportunity. If I get game time that's definitely a bonus. But just going over there and being able to learn as much as I can from the best in the world, that's probably the main takeaway for me. Just seeing how much I can absorb while I'm over there."</p>
        
            <p>Several big name players ply their trade at Mumbai Indians, including India test and one-day skipper Rohit Sharma and Black Caps spinner Mitchell Santner and seamer Trent Boult.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs is looking forward to rubbing shoulders with some of those stars.</p>
        
            <p>"They do have quite a few big names especially with the likes of Rohit Sharma and, a couple of Kiwi lads in there as well. I'm definitely very excited. I think it's gonna be just a great opportunity for me to learn as much as possible."</p>
        
            <p>However, Jacobs is focusing on the here and now.</p>
        
            <p>"Knowing that it (IPL) is a few months away I'm just keeping my head down a bit and I know that I've got to look at what's in front of me and that's still trying to put my best foot forward for Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs hasn't played a lot of T20s but has a strong strike rate of close to 200.</p>
        
            <p>He said he likes to score quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely give it my my best shot. I've only played nine matches, but I guess I've been chucked in at the finish or trying to come in at the back of the innings and I try and finish it off strong for the team (Auckland).</p>
        
            <p>"If I get that opportunity when I'm over there, then I'll grab it with both hands, and I'll try and do my very best."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ last week Jacobs said putting his name forward for the IPL player auction was a last minute decision.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's one of those things you think about, like 'what if?' so I just thought I'd put my name in the hat and see what happens. Obviously I know it's a long shot but you never know what might happen and who might have their eye on you. So I just thought that I'd take a shot and had some people help me sort that out so it was kind of last minute but happy I did it."</p>
        
            <p>Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Jacobs' family moved to New Zealand when he was three years old.</p>
