            <p>Warning: The images in this story could be upsetting</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 lambs have been killed by three roaming dogs, and more injured, in two separate incidents at a regional working farm in south Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The attacks occurred in the space of two days, on 16 January and 19 January, at Puhinui Reserve in Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 142 lambs were killed and another 86 injured in the two attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Council's regional parks farming business manager, Mozz Trueman, in a statement, said the incident was grisly.</p>
        
            <p>The council-run sheep and cattle farm is open to the public and has walking tracks.</p>
        
            <p>Staff took swift action to tidy up the site, before visitors saw the devastation.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a particularly tough week for staff," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope to never have to see this again."</p>

            <p>Three roaming dogs were believed to be responsible for the attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Animal Management found one dog, which was being held while evidence was gathered.</p>
        
            <p>One of the three dogs, which was believed to be responsible, returned to the farm on 20 January, but was prevented by a neighbour from reaching the stock.</p>
        
            <p>The incident has forced rangers to move the remaining flock to another site to keep them safe, and relocate others to a more visible part of the park.</p>
        
            <p>Trueman said they estimated the financial loss to be around $19,000.</p>
        
            <p>"This doesn't take into account the toll incidents like these take on staff, who are dedicated to looking after the animals.</p>
        
            <p>"And for members of the public who may be unlucky to come across the grisly scenes."</p>

The council is urging anyone with information to contact them, as investigations continue.

            <p>He was urging visitors to all regional working farms to call council urgently, if they saw uncontrolled dogs roaming.</p>
        
            <p>All dog owners must always keep their dogs secure on their properties when not under supervision, Trueman said.</p>
        
            <p>"This time of year is particularly worrying with young, vulnerable stock on all our farms."</p>
        
            <p>Animal Management acting manager Nikki Cripps said they were always grateful to receive calls from visitors and park neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>"It again emphasises the need for responsible pet ownership; dog owners need to know where their dogs are at all times and contain them on their properties," Cripps said.</p>
        
            <p>"Roaming dogs can present a serious risk not only to stock, but to people, other wildlife, and themselves."</p>
        
            <p>Under the Dog Control Act, it was an offence for dogs to injure, endanger, or cause distress to any stock, poultry, domestic animal or protected wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>Investigations were ongoing and a prosecution could follow.</p>
        
            <p>Council is urging anyone with information on these incidents, to contact them on 09 301 0101.</p>
