            <p>Former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station after forgetting to bring acceptable photo ID.</p>
        
            <p>As first reported by Sky News, he returned later with the necessary ID and was able to vote.</p>
        
            <p>He cast his ballot in South Oxfordshire, where voters are choosing a police and crime commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>New rules requiring photo ID to vote were introduced by Johnson's government in the Elections Act 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The change was rolled out last year, with local elections in May 2023 the first time voters needed to show ID.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Electoral Commission, about 14,000 people were unable to vote in last year's local elections in England as a result of the new rules.</p>
        
            <p>There were 22 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences, older or Disabled Person's bus passes and Oyster 60+ cards.</p>
        
            <p>People who were registered to vote could also apply for a free document known as a Voter Authority Certificate.</p>
        
            <p>The government had also said it intended to make veterans' ID cards a valid form of voter identification after some former service personnel were turned away from polling stations.</p>
        
            <p>Veterans minister Johnny Mercer apologised on social media to a man who said he was not able to use his veterans' ID card to vote.</p>
        
            <p>"The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I will do all I can to change it before the next one."</p>
        
            <p>A No 10 spokeswoman said: "It is our intention for the new Veteran Card, which was rolled out in January, to be added to the official list."</p>
        
            <p>The government was consulting on adding the card to the list of acceptable voter ID, which already included armed forces identity cards.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Conservative MP Tom Hunt said his dyspraxia caused him to lose his passport and he had to arrange an emergency proxy vote.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about problems reported over voter ID, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said there were "bound to be, when you have millions of people voting, a small number of issues".</p>
        
            <p>However, he said he thought "most voters have actually found it perfectly straightforward to vote with the necessary ID across the country".</p>
        
            <p>The Electoral Commission said "most voters who wanted to vote were able to do so", despite voter ID requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"We will now begin to collect evidence from voters, electoral administrators, partner organisations, and campaigners to understand their experiences of the elections and identify any potential obstacles to participation," a spokesman said.</p>
