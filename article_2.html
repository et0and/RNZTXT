            <p>A shearing champion says stubbornness and determination to prove critics wrong saw her crack a world record on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>In a scorching Wairarapa woolshed, Amy Silcock sheared 386 ewes - smashing the 2022 women's solo record held by British farmer Marie Prebble by 16 ewes.</p>
        
            <p>After waking up on Monday feeling like she'd been "beaten up", the 37-year-old said it was the physical and mental challenge that she most enjoyed.</p>
        
            <p>"You've gotta go to the darkest places in your mind to be able to get through that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're in so much pain and everything, and your body is saying stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.</p>
        
            <p>"But that's the fun part for me, is when your body goes, 'Nah I don't want to do it anymore', and then your brain goes 'Shut up, we're doing this'."</p>
        
            <p>Criticism after last year's unsuccessful attempt spurred her on to have another crack, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of backlash of like, why did you choose those sheep, and why did you do this, and why did you do that?</p>
        
            <p>"So I was just like, you know what? I'm going to prove you all wrong, so I'm going to get it."</p>
        
            <p>Despite now being a world record holder, Silcock maintained there were better shearers out there.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not really that good at it," she laughed.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people after year, will get a tally, you know, 200 or 300. And it took me forever.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only in the last, honestly, two years that I've been like, 'Oh, I've figured it out now'. Yeah, I was a bit slow on the uptake."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ on Monday from the pub where celebrations continued with "a couple of neck-oilers", Silcock said it was "amazing" to have her closest friends cheering her on throughout the day.</p>
        
            <p>"To be able to do something like that with all of your favourite humans by your side is awesome."</p>
