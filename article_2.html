            <p>A bus company has applauded the actions of one of its Napier drivers who was nearly hit by a 1 kilogram rock that sailed through the front window of his moving coach.</p>
        
            <p>The bus was carrying teenagers and being driven along Napier's Willowbank Avenue just before 2pm on Friday when a rock smashed through the window, narrowly missing the driver and one passenger, before landing on another passenger's lap.</p>
        
            <p>The rock weighed about 1kg and measured about 11 centimetres long. It left splinters of glass scattered across the dashboard and driver's seat.</p>
        
            <p>Tranzit bus and coach general manager Jenna Snelgrove said the driver handled the "frightening experience" extremely well.</p>

            <p>"We are very grateful that our driver and our passengers received no injuries as a result of this incident," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to commend our driver who controlled the bus, prioritised passenger safety and called for support to safely transfer passengers to another coach."</p>
        
            <p>The driver was being supported and the company was continuing to work with police, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd also like to say a big thank you to the Hawke's Bay community who have been very supportive over the last few days."</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Kevin Stewart said it seemed the rock was deliberately thrown at the bus - but it was not yet clear whether there was malicious intent.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to hear from the person who threw it, or anyone who saw what happened, he said.</p>
