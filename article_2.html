            <p>Police are once again urging people to come forward who may have recently seen missing man Tom Phillips on a stolen bike in the Waikato region.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Acting Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders said a red farm-style quad bike was stolen from a property in Te Anga at the beginning of this month and they believe Phillips and one of his children drove it south.</p>
        
            <p>The Marokopa man, who disappeared with his three children in December 2021, continues to evade police and is facing multiple criminal charges.</p>
        
            <p>Saunders said security camera footage showed the fugitive and one of his children breaking the glass frontage of a store in Piopio at about 2am on 2 November.</p>
        
            <p>Police said in May, Phillips was one of two people involved in the armed robbery of an ANZ bank in Te Kuiti and they have also charged him with aggravated wounding and unlawfully possessing a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Police have issued a warrant for his arrest and are worried about the welfare of his children.</p>
        
            <p>Police have set up a dedicated email address for members of the public to report any information they may have: op.curly@police.govt.nz</p>
