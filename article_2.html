        <h2>The Luke Littler phenomenon</h2>

            <p>It's the unlikely sports story of the summer: a 16-year-old teenage sensation tearing up a sport associated with portly, middle-aged men. Luke Littler is setting the world alight with a run in the annual PDC World Darts Championship that's certainly no fluke, due to the dominance he's shown over players old enough to be his dad.</p>
        
            <p>His victory in the semis today against 2018 champion Rob Cross has booked the rookie sensation - who isn't even old enough to order a beer despite competing in a sport whose natural venue is a pub - a spot in the Championship final.</p>

            <p>Littler stated, "I know I have the ability to go all the way. This is the first time I have thought about it. I have a good feeling in myself. It will take a lot to stop me, based on my past performances."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the electrifying 100-plus averages and the unprecedented attention his ascent has brought to the relatively niche but growing sport, Littler maintains a captivating mix of modesty and respect. When questioned about being the best player in the world at the moment, he responded with a humble touch, saying, "Not a chance, you've still got MVG [Michael van Gerwen] and Luke [Humphries]."</p>
        
            <p>As we witness Littler's journey, it prompts reflection on the larger narrative unfolding in the world of sports. His meteoric rise is not an isolated phenomenon but rather part of a broader trend where young athletes across various disciplines are making unprecedented strides and shattering records early in their careers. From the world of rugby league to cricket, here's a look at some other athletes that made their mark early.</p>

            <p>Vettori emerged as a key figure for New Zealand cricket early on, showcasing his prowess as the eighth allrounder to achieve the feat of 300 test wickets and 3000 runs. Recognized for his adept left-arm spin, Vettori's mastery lay in his ability to manipulate drift and introduce subtle variations in flight, speed, and length. Embarking on his cricket journey as a medium-pacer during his school days, Vettori underwent a transformative shift to become a spinner, marking the beginning of his remarkable success story.</p>
        
            <p>His test debut at the tender age of 18 against England in 1997 after only a handful of first class matches established him as the youngest Kiwi to play a Test match, followed by his ODI debut just a month later against Sri Lanka. Seizing the international stage, Vettori achieved the milestone of becoming the youngest Test cricketer to reach 100 test wickets at the remarkable age of 21, setting the tone for an illustrious career.</p>
        
            <p>Vettori quickly asserted his talent, exemplified by his remarkable 12-149 performance against Australia at Eden Park in March 2000. This marked the first of three 10-wicket hauls, with a notable consistency in his performances against Australia, securing 66 wickets from 19 matches. His excellence extended to encounters with Bangladesh, where he claimed 34 wickets in four away tests. Acknowledged as one of the premier spinners globally in the mid-2000s, this success culminated in his elevation to captain where he led New Zealand to eight wins in 11 games in 2006. This feat led to his permanent appointment as captain in 2007. Vettori's exceptional contributions were not limited to Tests, as he earned recognition in the limited-overs formats. Named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2007 T20 World Cup, he further solidified his standing by being voted into the ICC World ODI and T20 teams of 2008, attesting to his all-round prowess and impact on the global cricketing stage.</p>

            <p>Hailing from Wellington, Amelia Kerr is still a young and gifted cricketer who has already left a lasting impression on the global cricketing stage. Born in 2000 to parents having both represented Wellington, Kerr displayed early promise as an all-rounder, commencing her cricket journey at a tender age. Her debut for the Wellington Blaze in the 2016-17 Super Smash T20 aged 16 marked the beginning of a steady presence in the team. Recognising her outstanding performances in domestic cricket, national selectors included her in the New Zealand squad for the 2018 Women's World Cup, granting her an international debut the same year.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr's exceptional talent came to the forefront in 2018 when she etched her name in history as the youngest player to score a double century in international cricket. Facing Ireland, she amassed an extraordinary 232 runs off 145 balls, with 31 fours and two sixes. This remarkable achievement garnered widespread acclaim, solidifying Kerr's status as an emerging star in women's cricket. Subsequently, she maintained consistent excellence across all formats for the New Zealand team, positioning herself as a pivotal player for the years to come.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to her contributions on the international stage, Kerr has showcased her skills in major overseas leagues such as the Women's Big Bash League, proving her mettle alongside cricket's prominent figures. Renowned for her dual proficiency as a spin bowler and a powerful batsman, Kerr stands out as a valuable asset for any team fortunate enough to have her on their roster.</p>

            <p>Like many of his forebears, Dixon began his racing career in karting and won two titles in the Formula Vee series in New Zealand. Dixon moved to the Dayton Indy Lights series in North America, building on his achievements in Australia and New Zealand, where he won a title in the Formula Ford Series and was named "Rookie of the Year" in the Australian Formula Holden title.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon added to his accomplishments in the series in 2000 when he won another title with PacWest Racing. His stellar resume consisted of six wins, seven podium placements, and one pole position. He was only six days older than the late Greg Moore, making him the second-youngest driver in history to win the Indy Lights championship at that point.</p>
        
            <p>After winning a title in 2000, Dixon was given the chance to race in the CART Series in 2001. Dixon had an incredible start to the season at Monterrey, Mexico, when he led 14 laps in his first race of the year. Just two races later, at Nazareth, Pennsylvania, he made history by being the youngest winner of a major open-wheel race or a CART event, winning his first race at the age of 20. Building on this momentous accomplishment, Dixon showed off his skills once again, placing third at Milwaukee and fourth at Chicago, Road America, and Laguna Seca.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon will be with his beloved CGRT for 22 years in 2023, which is the longest stay for a driver in the team's history. Dixon is now placed second on the all-time record of Indycar victories and owns the distinction of being the most winning driver in the sport right now with 53 triumphs. He has also won a race in an unprecedented 18 straight IndyCar seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2001 and the present, Dixon has made 368 starts in the CART and IndyCar Series, with 53 victories, 28 poles, 192 top-five, and 270 top-10 results.</p>

            <p>At the age of 16 years and 238 days, Rankin achieved the distinction of being the third youngest player to make his debut in Australian first-grade rugby league. This noteworthy milestone occurred when he entered the field as a substitute for the Titans in round 22 against the Newcastle Knights. The only two players to have debuted at a younger age than Rankin are Ray Stehr of Eastern Suburbs in 1929 and Jack Arnold of Wests in 1936. Despite being selected for the Australian Schoolboys side set to face touring teams from England and France, Rankin had to forgo participating in the representative team to focus on training with the Titans squad in preparation for the upcoming game.</p>
        
            <p>Following his debut, Rankin made a return to the club's U20's NYC team, where he remained for the entirety of the 2008 season. Reflecting on his early entry into first-grade rugby league, Rankin acknowledged: "I'm not going to say I wasn't thrown in too young, but it was an opportunity I took... that I was given. It is one of those things I have to live with now. 16 is obviously, when you look at it now, a bit young."</p>
        
            <p>However, during the 2009 and 2010 seasons, Rankin did not contribute to his NRL game count, playing in the U20's competition for the Titans instead. After two seasons without an NRL appearance, Rankin made a comeback in round 16 against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Reflecting on the hiatus, he noted, "I played one game and didn't play for another two years, and that dents your confidence. I didn't play my natural game; I played a bit more conservative." Rankin currently captains Paramtta's second grade NSW Cup side having racked up a slim total of 40 NRL games over his 15-year career.</p>
