            <p>Daniel Spindler can't quite believe his luck - both good, and bad.</p>
        
            <p>A series of decisions made by Spindler and his wife in the early hours of Friday saved them from a once-in-a-generation cyclone after a tree came crashing through their dining room.</p>
        
            <p>"It all happened within five minutes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>And it was by the skin of their teeth.</p>
        
            <p>Spindler and his wife, along with their two young children and a 15-year-old Taiwanese exchange student, reside in Reedy Creek on Queensland's Gold Coast, which on Thursday evening was bearing the brunt of then-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.</p>

            <p>After securing the house, the father-of-two went to bed worried about the wind and the rain.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty intense," he said.</p>
        
            <p>After finally drifting off to sleep about 1am, he was awoken by his wife with a gentle nudge just a few hours later.</p>
        
            <p>"She asked if I wanted to get up and have a bit of a look around the house," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The wind was just so loud, and so was the rain. It was a bit of a symphony between the two."</p>
        
            <p>Walking towards the dining room, Spindler said he heard it before he saw it.</p>
        
            <p>"Crack," he shouted, describing the noise the tree made as it pierced his roof.</p>
        
            <p>He said at the time the sound didn't seem loud enough for the scale of the damage.</p>
        
            <p>"I turned around, standing in the dining room and there was the tree," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a surreal moment."</p>

            <p>But the dining room wasn't the only destruction.</p>
        
            <p>Unbeknownst to Spindler, just down the corridor, branches of the tree had compressed and shattered a window sending shards of glass into the couple's queen bed.</p>
        
            <p>His wife, he said, was thankfully right behind him.</p>
        
            <p>She had followed him down the corridor when he first got up.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't sure if she was going to follow me or not," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But she wanted to put some boxes into the hallway."</p>
        
            <p>The split-second decision meant the whole family was together and unhurt, huddled together in a room furthest from the dining room.</p>
        
            <p>When the couple walked back to their bedroom to inspect the damage, the reality of their close call set in.</p>
        
            <p>"There was huge jagged bits of glass, probably around the neck and head height," Spindler said, shaking his head in disbelief.</p>
        
            <p>"We were like, 'woah, that was weird'.</p>
        
            <p>"A bit surreal, but it happened within five minutes of the tree hitting."</p>
        
            <p>
These shards of glass were lying on the bed.

            <p>The family is now staying at an evacuation house in Broadbeach Waters.</p>
        
            <p>Spindler said he was just glad everyone escaped unscathed.</p>
        
            <p>"I can imagine the flooring is no good and there was several rooms pierced through the roof so it's all flooded through there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But the main priority was to keep everyone safe."</p>
        
            <p>And the 15-year-old Taiwanese exchange student staying with them?</p>
        
            <p>"They slept through the whole thing," Spindler said.</p>
