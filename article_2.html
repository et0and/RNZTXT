        <h2>Hundreds march in Wellington over access to puberty blockers</h2>
        <p>
Last year, health officials called for a new cautious approach after the government signalled an intent to consider regulating prescriptions to young people.

            <p>Hundreds of people are marching on Parliament to protest against moves that could change how puberty blockers are prescribed in gender affirming care.</p>

            <p>Regulatory measures could include restricting prescribing of puberty blockers in the context of gender affirming care but not its use in other contexts, the ministry said.</p>

            <p>Queer Endurance in Defiance spokesperson Wyatt Dawson said in a release that the transgender community and its allies were worried any changes will mean trans children lose access to hormone therapy that stalls unwanted physical changes.</p>
        
            <p>Puberty blockers should be available "on demand", they said.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's protest comes after the government directed the Ministry of Health to consult on whether there should be further safety measures for prescribing puberty blockers.</p>
        
            <p>It opened public submissions asking if further precautions or restrictions are needed, and what impacts this could have on young people.</p>

            <p>Half a dozen speakers from the queer community and its allies, including current and former Green Party MPs Benjamin Doyle and Elizabeth Kerekere, addressed the hundreds-strong crowd gathered at Parliament steps.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party has denounced moves by the government to regulate puberty blockers in gender-affirming care in young people.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Health's consultation on additional safety measures for the hormone therapy closed in January, but nothing has yet been publicly released.</p>
        
            <p>MP Benajmin Doyle added their voice to hundreds of protesters at Parliament grounds today condeming the review.</p>
        
            <p>They say the rights of trans and non-binary people should not be up for debate.</p>
        
            <p>"How dare they call for public consulation on whether we deserve to have life-saving treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"How dare they attempt to deny children healthcare ... access to healthcare is a human right."</p>
        
            <p>Doyle said the party is calling on the government to increase funding and access to puberty blockers for young trans people.</p>
        
            <p>The protest has now wrapped.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
