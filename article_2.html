            <p>A US influencer who became the target of online outrage after posting a video of herself snatching a baby wombat away from its mother has published a 900-word apology defending her actions.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Jones left Australia on Friday after the nation's home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said immigration authorities were reviewing her visa to see whether she breached the conditions of her stay, according an ABC report.</p>

            <p>On Saturday, Jones posted a statement to Instagram. In it, she claimed she only picked up the baby wombat off the road because she was "extremely concerned" for its safety.</p>
        
            <p>She also claimed that she did not intend to "rip the joey away from its mother", but ran away because she was scared the animal might attack her.</p>
        
            <p>However, she also claims to have realised after a "great deal of reflection", that she did not handle the situation well.</p>
        
            <p>"I have learned from this situation, and am truely (sic) sorry for the distress I have caused," the post read.</p>
        
            <p>In a second post soon after, she claims that as a result of the online backlash to the video "thousands" have now threatened her life.</p>
        
            <p>She then proceeds to explain that the Australian government permits the "slaughter of wombats".</p>
        
            <p>"Thousands each year are shot, poisoned to suffer, and trapped legally. Landowners rip up wombat burrows with heavy machinery, poison them with fumigation, and shoot them whenever they can.</p>
        
            <p>"Quietly, of course, so as not to face the wrath that has come upon me."</p>
