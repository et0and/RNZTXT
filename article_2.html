            <p>Several suburbs in Auckland are without water after a water main burst on Mountain Road on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>The suburbs include Henderson, Henderson Valley, Glen Eden, Oratia, Kauriland and McLaren Park.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare said homes may experience low water pressure or no water at all until the fault is repaired. Up to 10,000 people were affected, with about 3000 with no water and the rest with low pressure, Watercare said.</p>
        
            <p>A fix was expected to take 24 hours.</p>

            <p>Councillor for Waitākere Shane Henderson posted to Facebook that timeframes were unclear, but water may be off for 24 hours for some, especially those on the hills.</p>
        
            <p>Water tankers are available on several streets.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare said it does not yet know when supplies will be restored.</p>
        
            <p>It has asked residents with low water pressure to save water if possible, and avoid using their dishwasher or washing machine over the next 24 hours. It also advised keeping shorts short - four minutes or less.</p>
        
            <p>A section of Mountain Road has been closed off to traffic in both directions, and Watercare expect it to remain that way for at least 48 hours.</p>
