            <p>Excitement is building among tiny home builders and enthusiasts after the announcement of a potential overhaul of the rules for granny flats.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the government announced a discussion document which looks to shake up the rules around building small structures.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal includes changes to the Building Act which would remove the need for building or resource consents on granny flat style buildings in certain areas.</p>
        
            <p>Bryce Langston is a New Zealander who has amassed more than 4.5 million YouTube subscribers on his channel which looks at diverse ways people are building tiny houses around the world.</p>
        
            <p>He got interested in this type of housing in his late 20s.</p>
        
            <p>"I was watching the idea of home ownership move further and further away from me, and when I discovered tiny houses, it was like this light bulb went off in my head and it was this amazing thing whereby downsizing my home it became obtainable."</p>
        
            <p>Langston said the changes were a step in the right direction.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tremendously exciting development that I would love to see happen.</p>
        
            <p>"It is going to clear up a lot of unnecessary red tape and make it a lot easier to increase the housing supply which we desperately need to do."</p>

            <p>He believed 60 square metres - the size which some councils would be required to allow without consent - was plenty of room to work with.</p>
        
            <p>"You could have a comfortable home with a good-sized kitchen, a nice sized lounge, a nice sized bedroom, potentially even two bedrooms  bathroom, without really needing to get too creative."</p>
        
            <p>Site Scope builds a range of modular transportable homes which range from 17 to 50 square metres in size.</p>
        
            <p>Project facilitator Coen Wilson said they supported moves to make building these types of homes easier, if compliance standards were upheld.</p>
        
            <p>"Going down this route, we need to ensure that all the design and consenting has to be done by the like of LBPs [licensed building practitioners]."</p>
        
            <p>Often, Site Scope could offer the client a home at an achievable price, but extra costs like resource consents "blows the project out of the water" for them, Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>House Me is another tiny home builder which provides housing across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Co-owner Bryce Glover said they had 17 homes waiting for delivery to people.</p>
        
            <p>"They are sitting there begging to take possession of their unit, but they are waiting for the council process to get a wriggle on at the site end.</p>
        
            <p>"So, if you can unlock that, if you can speed that process up then businesses like ours, who have the capacity to build 1000 homes a year, we could actually play our part in solving this housing crisis."</p>
