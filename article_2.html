            <p>A US woman with a rare double uterus has given birth twice in two days - after a "one in a million" pregnancy and a total of 20 hours in labour.</p>
        
            <p>Kelsey Hatcher, 32, delivered one daughter on Tuesday, and a second on Wednesday, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Announcing the arrival of her "miracle babies" on social media, Hatcher hailed the medics as "incredible".</p>
        
            <p>The girls are described as fraternal twins - with rare separate birthdays.</p>
        
            <p>Hatcher said the family was now back at home and could "enjoy the holidays". She had previously expected a Christmas due date.</p>
        
            <p>The mother was told at age 17 she had a double uterus (uterus didelphys) - which the UAB described as a rare congenital anomaly affecting 0.3 percent of women.</p>
        
            <p>And the odds of becoming pregnant in both uteri - a dicavitary pregnancy - were even slimmer, at "one in a million", according to the UAB.</p>
        
            <p>Reported cases worldwide are extremely rare. In 2019, a doctor in Bangladesh told the BBC a woman had given birth to twins almost a month after delivering a premature baby in her other uterus.</p>
        
            <p>Hatcher had three previous, healthy pregnancies. This time, she believed herself to be pregnant in only one uterus - until a routine ultrasound revealed there was also a baby in her second.</p>
        
            <p>"I gasped... We just could not believe it," she recalled.</p>
        
            <p>She went on to document her unusual journey on Instagram. One update at 38 weeks asked: "What the heck?! HOW have we made it this far?!"</p>

            <p>The UAB described her pregnancy as routine. Prof Richard Davis, who co-managed the delivery, pointed out that each baby had enjoyed "extra space to grow and develop".</p>
        
            <p>This was because each baby had a womb to itself, he said - unlike in a typical twin pregnancy.</p>
        
            <p>Hatcher's labour was induced at 39 weeks, and required double the monitoring and charting at the hospital - as well as double the staffing.</p>
        
            <p>Her obstetrician described "a cheer from everyone in the room" when the first baby was delivered vaginally at about 19:45 local time on 19 December.</p>
        
            <p>The second came by C-section more than 10 hours later, at about 06:10 the following morning.</p>
        
            <p>Prof Davis said the girls could be called fraternal twins - a term used when each baby develops from a separate egg, each fertilised by a separate sperm.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day, it was two babies in one belly at the same time," he said. "They just had different apartments."</p>
