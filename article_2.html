            <p>A couple of New Zealand horses are out to spoil the party for Australian star trotter Swayzee in today's New Zealand Trotting Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Swayzee is the defending champion for the $1 million dollar event at Addington Raceway in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The Sydney connections paid a late nomination fee ($28,000) to get into the field and was now the one to beat following the scratching last Friday of hot favourite and fellow Australian, Leap to Fame.</p>
        
            <p>Swayzee only arrived in the country on Sunday night and was hoping to become just the seventh back to back winner of the race.</p>
        
            <p>He was in impressive form, coming from the back of the field to win the recent Victoria Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Hoping to chase down the Australian invader and grab the $540,000 first prize are a couple of New Zealand stars, Don't Stop Dreaming and Merlin, who were two of just four horses in single figure odds.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Purdon and Scott Phelan train Merlin and Mark Purdon and his son Nathan train Don't Stop Dreaming.</p>
        
            <p>The brothers have clashed many times in the Cup and today should be just as compteitive.</p>
        
            <p>In a recent warmup race Merlin headed home Don't Stop Dreaming in the Ashburton Flying Stakes.</p>
        
            <p>Merlin has won 20 from 31 and $1.2m in stakes while Don't Stop Dreaming has won 15 from 30 and around $900K.</p>
        
            <p>The only other horse in single figures (as of early Tuesday morning) was the one named after All Black star Richie Mo'unga.</p>
        
            <p>Mo'unga was just outside the top 15 for the big race before winning last Monday's Kaikoura Cup. That propelled the Regan Todd trained horse into the field.</p>
