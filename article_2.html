            <p>Neighbours of the man who was found dead at his home in Ellerslie say they are frightened by the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The body of 66-year-old Fuk-Fu Joseph Kwok was found by a relative at his Ellerslie home on Monday. Police have since launched a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe his wife who remains missing, Mei Han Chong, may also be the victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>They have grave concerns for her safety.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours of the couple remain shaken by the death.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a bit frightened, it's a scary thing happening so close, you hear about this stuff in the news all the time, but when you're in the area and you see it, it's a bit more real," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"Really really unfortunate, it's really sad that it's happened," another said.</p>
        
            <p>Kwok was an orthopaedic theatre nurse who worked at North Shore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A former colleague said he was hard working and highly regarded.</p>
        
            <p>She said Kwok had worked at the hospital more than 10 years and the family had moved to New Zealand from Hong Kong.</p>

            <p>Speaking to media today, Detective Inspector Scott Beard, from Auckland City CIB, said police know Kwok left work at 11pm on Saturday night and drove home.</p>
        
            <p>"A local resident said he was woken by the sound of a man and a woman arguing in English, about 1.30 in the morning, he then heard three loud bangs followed by silence"</p>
        
            <p>Information from the public was vital to making progress in the inquiry, he said.</p>

            <p>"Someone out there must know something or have seen something and it may seem trivial to them but it could very well be important to the police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know the motive and that's one of the aspects of the investigation we're looking at, but as I say someone out there may be able to help us and that's what we need."</p>
        
            <p>Police were appealing for sightings of Chong and the family car - a blue Kia Rio with the registration NJN927.</p>
        
            <p>Chong is 67 years old, about 5 feet tall, has grey hair and glasses. She does not drive and police believe she did not leave the house on her own accord.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination at the house continues.</p>
