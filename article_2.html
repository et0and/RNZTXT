            <p>Members of the rainbow community and supporters gathered in Auckland's Albert Park this afternoon to stand in solidarity against Destiny Church demonstrations targeting pride events last week.</p>
        
            <p>Members of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church "Man Up" group disrupted pride events in Auckland last Saturday, which prompted a number of calls to have its charitable status revoked.</p>

            <p>One demonstrator at Albert Park today told RNZ they personally knew some of those confronted by Destiny Church members last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>No counter protesters were present at the rally.</p>
        
            <p>There were a number of security staff present.</p>
        
            <p>Drag queen Medulla Oblongata spoke at today's rally, saying rainbow readings mattered.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't change who children are, they simply show them that who they are is perfectly fine. They remind our young people that everyone belongs, that they are a part of a rich, beautiful, and diverse tapestry constructed from many cultures and identities.</p>
        
            <p>"Stories don't hurt children, hate does, silence does, shame does."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland central MP and Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick spoke at the rally, and told RNZ what supporters hoped to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of the requests from the rally today, those have come directly from the community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And those are, first and foremost, the removal of the charitable status, and secondly, the ending of contracts between government agencies and Destiny Church."</p>

            <p>Swarbrick said the Green Party was focused on what parliament could do immediately to legislate and provide funding for ways to build love, understanding, and tolerance in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"That looks like funding grass-roots rainbow organisations, who are currently doing this mahi on the smell of an oily rag, ensuring that there is proper fulsome funding for gender-affirming care and surgeries, and, ultimately also our government taking some responsibility and getting rid of bills that look to inflame the culture wars of people's access to things like bathrooms.</p>
        
            <p>"Get a grip," she added.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said the backlash to the previous demonstrations from Destiny Church was love.</p>
        
            <p>"Look at how we've turned up in force and claimed our power," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A Destiny Church spokesperson said Sunday's protest was of zero interest to them.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't noticed any protest action this afternoon - did a protest happen?" they said.</p>

            <p>A police spokesperson said they were aware of the protest.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been in contact with organisers and there will be a police presence in the area," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus remains on peoples' safety and our staff will respond to any matters if they arise."</p>
