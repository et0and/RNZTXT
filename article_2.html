            <p>Human remains have been fished out of the sea in north Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Retiree Paul Middleton, who has been travelling around the country in a camper van fishing, made the gruesome discovery by the Gulf Harbour ferry terminal on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw a big lump out in the water that I thought might be a cow or something, so thought some kahawai might be hanging around nearby.</p>
        
            <p>"As I got closer I realised it was a big black plastic bag," Middleton told Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>According to Middleton, he unhooked his lure and pulled the bag towards him.</p>
        
            <p>"There was plastic bag inside of plastic bag inside of plastic bag.</p>
        
            <p>"To start with I thought someone had thrown away a big chunk of meat, but then I saw clothes on it - and then a hand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Middleton estimated what he thought was a body was wrapped in "at least" three plastic bags.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't want to disturb what might be a crime scene or whatever, so I did as much as I could to pull it up on the rocks.</p>
        
            <p>"It was bloody heavy, I couldn't pull it all the way up so wedged it there and called the cops."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed officers were at a reserve in Gulf Harbour after a body was found in the water by members of the public near Laurie Southwick Parade around 3.15pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A cordon is in place while police made enquiries, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no immediate risk to the public in relation to this death."</p>
        
            <p>Officers were seen taking a gurney down to the water shortly before 5pm.</p>
