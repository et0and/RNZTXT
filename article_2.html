            <p>The number of job ads has ticked up for the first time in a year.</p>
        
            <p>The Seek Employment report for July indicates the number of ads increased 3 percent from June, but were still down 29 percent year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>Applications per job ad were little changed from June's reading.</p>

            <p>Seek country manager Rob Clark said what had not changed was fierce competition among candidates - that showed "no sign of abating".</p>
        
            <p>"While it is pleasing to see an increase in job ad volumes, this comes after five months of consecutive declines, including an 8 percent fall in June," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Retail and consumer ads rose 24 percent, followed by hospitality and tourism up 20 percent, with government and defence up 22 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Consulting and strategy was the only sector to record a monthly fall in job listings - down 7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"In some of the larger regions, including Bay of Plenty, Auckland and Wellington, July saw the largest monthly rise in job ads in over two years," Clark said.</p>
