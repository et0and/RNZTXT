            <p>A tourist missing from a Milford Sound track has been found alive, only suffering a minor knee injury during his four-day ordeal.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the unprepared Belgian man was "extremely lucky" not to have suffered anything worse.</p>
        
            <p>He was separated from his group while crossing Dore Pass on Wednesday, police said on Monday, saying he "deviated" from the plan.</p>
        
            <p>Two search and rescue teams, assisted by a helicopter operator and a local boat charter company, started looking for him on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>He was found that day at Clinton Hut, near the Clinton River south of Mt Anau.</p>
        
            <p>"Dore Pass is a challenging route that requires route finding skills, river crossing and alpine experience," Sergeant Alun Griffiths said.</p>
        
            <p>"Attempting this type of activity in street shoes, limited suitable gear, and no means of emergency communication does not end well, and this man is extremely lucky the outcome was not worse."</p>
        
            <p>The man was taken to Te Anau Medical Centre and treated for a minor knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to remember to note your intentions in hut books, advise people of your route and stick to that plan, Griffiths said.</p>
        
            <p>"These basic precautions are designed to keep you safe and are vital if the weather should deteriorate or you are injured."</p>
        
            <p>Police urged other would-be trampers to take basic precautions before heading out, such as letting someone know where you are going and expect to return, taking an emergency locator beacon, wearing appropriate clothing and paying attention to weather forecasts.</p>
