People are learning about the Māori new year from their children and flocking to festivals in record numbers, organisers say.

            <p>Record numbers have attended Matariki events since it became a national holiday, according to festival organisers.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council Matariki Festival lead Melz Huata-Lucas (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Kāi Tahu, Ngāi Tahu) said the festival had grown as public awareness had increased.</p>
        
            <p>Matariki became an official public holiday in 2021, fulfilling a pre-election promise made by the-then Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>Huata-Lucas estimated more than 200,000 people had attended Matariki events in the city centre alone each year since.</p>
        
            <p>"It is continuing to grow and definitely being noticed by staff on the ground."</p>

            <p>Bay of Plenty Matariki Festival organiser Jackie Sanders said she was expecting the largest turnout yet for the event and had had to add more dates for sold-out events.</p>
        
            <p>She said more than 10,000 people attended the festival's events throughout the region in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, a pre-dawn ceremony on Pukekohekohe Hill marked the start of Auckland's Matariki Festival.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Tamaoho, which is the festival's iwi partner for the next three years, led a karakia and pōwhiri at Ngā Hau e Whā Marae.</p>

            <p>Huata-Lucas said more people were starting to get excited about Matariki and understand what it was about.</p>
        
            <p>"Māori have always celebrated Matariki as the start to the new year. It is a time to reflect on the year that has gone by and the people who have passed."</p>
        
            <p>She said people were also learning about Matariki from their children.</p>
        
            <p>"In schools, they are learning about what the stars represent and they can bring that home to their families."</p>

            <p>Huata-Lucas said organisers had been able to expand the Auckland festival to more than 90 Matariki events taking place across the city, many of which are free.</p>
        
            <p>She encouraged people to check what events were happening in their area and establish traditions with their families.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the Auckland Matariki Festival runs from 15-30 June, while the Matariki public holiday falls on 28 June.</p>
