            <p>The crucial Coromandel link State Highway 25a will reopen on 20 December - three months ahead of schedule.</p>
        
            <p>The road, a key link to towns like Whangamatā and Hāhei, was damaged earlier this year when its bridge was washed out in storms.</p>
        
            <p>Since then a 124-metre bridge has been built which spans the abyss in the severed highway.</p>
