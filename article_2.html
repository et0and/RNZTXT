            <p>A man has been found alive in his neighbour's cellar after going missing about 26 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Omar bin Omran disappeared from Djelfa, in Algeria, during the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, when he was in his late teens.</p>
        
            <p>Now aged 45, Bin Omran has been discovered just 200m from where he grew up.</p>
        
            <p>Officials confirmed they had arrested a 61-year-old man suspected of keeping him prisoner.</p>
        
            <p>Bin Omran's disappearance came in the middle of a decade-long conflict between Algeria's government and Islamist groups.</p>
        
            <p>His family feared he had been among an estimated 200,000 killed, or as many as 20,000 kidnapped, during the unrest.</p>
        
            <p>But he was found hidden in a sheepfold under haystacks on 12 May, according to reports.</p>
        
            <p>The public prosecutor's office received a complaint against an anonymous person claiming that Bin Omran was in the house of one of his neighbours, inside a sheepfold, a court official said.</p>
        
            <p>The court official said: "Following this report, the general prosecutor ordered the national gendarmerie to open an in-depth investigation and officers went to the house in question.</p>
        
            <p>"On 12 May at 8pm local time, [they] found victim Omar bin Omran, aged 45, in the cellar of his neighbour, BA, aged 61."</p>
        
            <p>The suspect reportedly attempted to flee the scene, but was restrained and arrested, the court official said.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said the investigation was still in progress and Bin Omran was in the process of receiving medical and psychological care.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesman described the crime as "heinous".</p>
        
            <p>Bin Omran told his rescuers he had at times seen his family from his prison, but claimed he had been unable to call out for help "because of a spell that his captor had cast on him", local media reported.</p>
        
            <p>His mother died in 2013.</p>
