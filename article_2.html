            <p>Kiwi golfer Lydia Ko will consider adding to her OIympic rings and fern tattoos if she can round off her Games medals collection in Paris this week.</p>
        
            <p>Ko has won silver and bronze at the two previous Olympics and would love to add the gold medal at Le Golf National just outside Paris.</p>
        
            <p>She says she has a fair number of tattoos already, but might consider a new one if she finished at the top of the leaderboard.</p>
        
            <p>"Let the golfing gods decide what's going to happen from here."</p>
        
            <p>The first of four rounds gets underway on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Kiwi pole vaulter Eliza McCartney says it's a "dream come true" for her to be competing at the Olympics at the same time as her partner.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was important she did not get too "emotionally invested" in how Lukas Walton-Keim was faring in his kite-foiling event, 800km away in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>Walton-Keim was named to compete at the Paris Olympics after he appealed his initial non-nomination at the Sports Tribunal which then ordered Yahting New Zealand to revisit its selection process.</p>
