        <h2>The great slanging match that is the US election</h2>
        <p>
The US election is a dog-eat-dog, no-holds-barred fight between two people who couldn't be more different to each other.

            <p>Kamala Harris is making inroads into Donald Trump's lead in the seven vital swing states. But it is only by a nose, and there are plenty of dirty politics to come</p>
        
            <p>With less than two months remaining until the 2024 United States presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris has overtaken rival and former President Donald Trump in several key polls - but only by what looks like less than the margin of error.</p>
        
            <p>Harris, who officially took over the Democratic ticket in August, is boosting stronger numbers than President Joe Biden did before his sudden exit, especially in the vital swing states.</p>
        
            <p>The Detail speaks to Republican strategist John Jordan, and legal and political analyst Danielle Mclaughlin, a New Zealander now living in New York.</p>
        
            <p>Mclaughlin says while Harris has the edge, it will be a "very, very tight race".</p>
        
            <p>"Based on what we are seeing in the polling ... it is Harris' to lose, she has the momentum," Mclaughlin says.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing this in nationwide polling and also in the very important seven swing states.</p>
        
            <p>"There is an energy and a directness about her campaign, that is lacking on the Trump side, and polling is indicating this as well.</p>
        
            <p>"He is off his game, he thought he was going to be up against Biden. So, I think it will be Harris for the win ... but by a nose."</p>
        
            <p>Harris is leading Trump, just, in key swing states Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where Biden struggled to make inroads. That could be crucial in determining the election's outcome.</p>
        
            <p>But Jordan tells The Detail Trump will ultimately succeed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tough race right now, this is uncharted territory with a new candidate coming in late," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But if I had to bet, I would say 55 to 45 or 60 to 40, Trump wins.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason I say that is his strength in the electoral college. Despite all the adoring media coverage that Harris has had, she's been unable to put him away."</p>
        
            <p>Trump and Harris will finally face off this week for a much-anticipated debate.</p>
        
            <p>"Trump needs it more because Harris has the momentum," Mclaughlin says.</p>
        
            <p>"But in saying that, she needs it too. This is about optics; she is a woman - America has never had a female president. She needs to show folks she can stand up to Trump, like she would to any other world leader, in the interests of America."</p>
        
            <p>Jordan says Harris will be wanting her "viral moment, where she is the alpha'".</p>
        
            <p>"That is what is she going to do, and while she's doing that she will avoid talking about the issues.</p>
        
            <p>"She is also going to pretend she is the candidate of change - it is so disingenuous."</p>
        
            <p>As the presidential race enters its final stretch, both sides are set to ramp up their efforts to secure arguably the world's most powerful job.</p>
        
            <p>The debate is on 10 September, while the election is 5 November.</p>
