            <p>The Highlanders were made to work for their first win of the Super Rugby Pacific season after coming from behind to beat Moana Pasifika 35-21 in Dunedin on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>In a night of running rugby a new look Moana had the early advantage before the Highlanders put on a show of their own scoring five tries.</p>
        
            <p>Moana's William Havili had kicked two penalties before the Highlanders fullback Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens scored the opening try of the game in the 15th minute to get the home side the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Saula Ma'u scored the Highlanders' second 10 minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>Flanker Fabian Holland was sin-binned for cynical play and Moana capitalised on their man advantage with Jacob Norris scoring the visitors' first try just after the half hour mark.</p>
        
            <p>Moana regained the lead on the stroke of half-time when Nigel Ah Wong scored near the posts off a sequence of play that started with a clever lineout move.</p>
        
            <p>Moana went into the sheds 18-14 ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Havili extended the lead with another successful penalty before the Highlanders hit back with a second converted try for Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens to level the score at 21-all less than 10 minutes into the half.</p>
        
            <p>Former Moana player turned Highlander winger Timoci Tavatavanawai gave the home side the lead after the hour by scoring his first try for his new team and Sam Gilbert continued his good form off the tee for his fourth conversion of the night.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides started to feel the physicality of playing in their first game of the season as medics started to come onto the field with regularity to stretch cramping legs.</p>
        
            <p>Gilbert added to his personal points tally with his first try of the season in the corner which he converted from the sideline with 10 minutes left in the game which was to be the last scoring act in the bonus point win.</p>
