            <p>The All Blacks are ignoring the critics.</p>
        
            <p>Following back-to-back losses in South Africa, and three losses to start new coach Scott Robertson's tenure, public sentiment has quickly shifted against the man touted as the side's saviour.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Ethan De Groot lamented the fickle nature of those who follow the side.</p>
        
            <p>"The fans and the media love us when we're going well, and they tend to pull us down when we're down. I don't personally buy into it. I think the team's in a good spot, and the coaching group and everyone here is working really hard to get the performances that the fans deserve to watch."</p>
        
            <p>He said he did his best to block out the noise.</p>
        
            <p>"It is tough at times, I just try not to read into what's out there or comments that are getting made."</p>
        
            <p>Team-mate Anton Lienert-Brown said no-one was tougher on the team than the team itself.</p>
        
            <p>"In this environment like we take losses personally. It's no more personal than it is to the group in here. So we don't listen to a lot of outside talk, but we understand the privilege it is to wear that big jersey and the responsibility that comes with it."</p>
        
            <p>He said he understood the public's frustration, and the players were feeling it too.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously going to South Africa, not getting the results, it hurts, but we use that hurt in the right way."</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks have the opportunity to bounce back in Sydney this weekend as they look to lock up the Bledisloe Cup for the 21st straight year.</p>
        
            <p>Australia are also coming off a horror final forty against Argentina as the Pumas ran in 38 unanswered points.</p>
        
            <p>"They're wounded beasts at the moment, but, so are we, and we want to get one back. So I think both teams will be up," de Groot said.</p>
        
            <p>Lienert-Brown said they had taken positives from their trip to Africa.</p>
        
            <p>"In 80 minutes, we put a lot of good moments together. But also know that we need to, need to get better."</p>
        
            <p>One area where they will need particular improvement is the bench.</p>
        
            <p>With South Africa's 'bomb squad' changing the nature of both tests, the All Blacks actually lost momentum when their reserves came on.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had those honest conversations about it. We know when we are at our best the bench come on and finish off the game and the reality is we haven't. We probably could have iced two games in South Africa, but we didn't. There's no shortage of talent coming off the bench. It's just the way we execute those last minutes."</p>
        
            <p>He said their focus now firmly shifted to keeping their Bledisloe streak intact.</p>
        
            <p>"For as long as I've been in here, we have spoken about the Bledisloe Cup being the second most important trophy you can lift and that's never lost it."</p>
