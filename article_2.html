            <p>The Reserve Bank has held the official cash rate unchanged at 5.5 percent for the eighth consecutive meeting, but hinted rate cuts may be closer than previously thought.</p>
        
            <p>The central bank said the economy has slowed, and labour market pressures are easing, but pockets of domestic inflation persisted.</p>
        
            <p>"Restrictive monetary policy has significantly reduced consumer price inflation, with the Committee expecting headline inflation to return to within the 1 to 3 percent target range in the second half of this year," the Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>It said annual consumer price inflation remained above the 1 to 3 percent target band, and monetary policy needed to remain restrictive to ensure inflation returns to target, but dropped previous direct comments about rates needing to stay higher for longer.</p>
        
            <p>"The extent of this restraint will be tempered over time consistent with the expected decline in inflation pressures."</p>
        
            <p>The decision was in line with financial market and analysts' expectations.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ did not issue any updated forecasts, but in May indicated it expected to hold the OCR at 5.5 percent until after mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
