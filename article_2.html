        <h2>Auckland's decades-old stadium shuffle</h2>
        <p>
The stadium debate in Auckland has been raging for decades and may be close to a final decision. That doesn't mean the argument is over.

            <p>If building one of Auckland's possible waterfront stadiums was funded privately, it would need to hold a sold-out Ed Sheeran concert every weekday for 25 years.</p>
        
            <p>That's Rob Hamlin's finding - he's a senior marketing lecturer at the University of Otago.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not going to happen - forget about it," he tells The Detail. </p>
        
            <p>Auckland is the latest New Zealand city to go through a contentious stadium debate. An Auckland Council working group is considering four proposals to upgrade its stadia - three options in the central city and one to redevelop Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Upgrading Eden Park looks like being the frontrunner, but Hamlin isn't convinced city councillors won't pull a surprise on us. </p>
        
            <p>"Let's say we're looking at the option known as 'The Crater'," Hamlin says. That's a proposal for a waterfront stadium sunk into the seabed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the most expensive of the three - by a small margin. That's $2 billion, so if you were going to say that's entirely built by private money... you're going to have to generate, after all of your expenses have been paid, $160 million a year to justify the use of that private capital in that building. That's $3 million a week."</p>
        
            <p>Hamlin sees what's going on in Auckland as a repeat of the Dunedin debate, as its roofed Forsyth Barr Stadium, built in 2011, caused conflict and controversy.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, the events are tracking along very similarly,'' he says.</p>
        
            <p>"The Dunedin stadium started with a proposal to upgrade the old stadium at Carisbrook ... then all of a sudden this suggestion came more or less out of left field that we should build a new stadium up in the other end of town near the university."</p>
        
            <p>The cost reached $224.4 million, and Hamlin believes it's been a bad use of ratepayers' money.</p>
        
            <p>"Professional sport is now a business and if that sport cannot pay its way, it doesn't happen in the form that they would want it to happen."</p>
        
            <p>Public affairs consultant Brian Finn has written extensively about stadia, especially in Auckland. He takes The Detail through where Auckland's four stadia - Eden Park, Mt Smart, North Harbour and Western Springs - are at now; then considers the four proposals to upgrade the city's stadium. </p>
        
            <p>"You can't put a roof on Eden Park and build two new stands and do it much cheaper, if cheaper at all, than building a new stadium, the structural work is so significant," he argues.</p>
        
            <p>His pick out of the three options is "Te Tōangaroa" - a development beside Spark Arena, featuring a 50,000 seat stadium and an All Blacks branded hotel. </p>
        
            <p>"Full disclosure - I don't work for that group but I've had a connection to them going back a few years," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually think it's a really compelling vision - it's not the waterfront and it makes use of a part of town that's currently underused and not fully developed."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillors are due to discuss the stadium proposal at the end of the month, after its working group has given a recommendation. </p>
