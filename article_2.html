            <p>Hīkoi activation events have now concluded for Te Waipounamu ahead of their convoy to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Last Monday, around 200 people from the southern-most part of the country met for an early morning karakia, coinciding with the beginning of the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti in Te Kao.</p>
        
            <p>From pēpi and tamariki to kaumātua, participants linked up under the infamous signpost at Stirling Point. Toitū te Tiriti Waihōpai hīkoi organiser Rivah Hura told RNZ tamariki are the reason for the nationwide hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>The next day, people in Ōtepoti Dunedin filled the Octagon Central waiata. The local Kura Kaupapa kids also performed in front of the crowd.</p>

            <p>While the North Island hīkoi trekked over the Auckland Harbour Bridge in masses on Wednesday, nearly 2000 people of all cultures turned up at the Bridge of Remembrance in Ōtautahi Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>In front of the sea of tino rangatiratanga flags was the organiser Teresa Butler who was surprised to see everyone rallied.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Tangata Tiriti [were] here, they understand what's happening," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When it's mokopuna focused and Tīpuna driven - they are guiding us in the right space to see all of our whānau."</p>
        
            <p>Butler said the tamariki today have more quality Māori education than before.</p>
        
            <p>"We were fed information through education that was wrong, dismantling, and whakaiti us all the time. We learnt about colonial history but not about our own Māoritanga."</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Butler handed the microphone to rangatahi who shared their whakaaro.</p>
        
            <p>One young tāne directed his speech to Christopher Luxon, David Seymour, and Winston Peters and said, 'enough is enough.'</p>
        
            <p>"You're cutting down our benefit, you're taking our Māori place names from us, you're taking our kids away from us, you're taking our rights away from us. What's next? Our people?"</p>
        
            <p>"I hope you know the damage you have created to our people and our Ātua," he said in front of the crowd.</p>

            <p>Butler said she is excited about the new generation coming through.</p>
        
            <p>"This is what I love, our rangatahi Māori and rangatahi non-Māori, they get it. They understand te Tiriti."</p>
        
            <p>The final activation event was held at the top of the South Island on Thursday - the same day as the first reading of the controversial Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Voices could be heard streets away from Trafalgar Square in Nelson, but the gathering was managed well to allow steady traffic flow and safety for all involved.</p>
        
            <p>The focus shifted away from just the young ones carrying the mantle to everyone becoming educators.</p>
        
            <p>Tākuta Ferris said the movement is for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"Toitū te Tiriti is for everybody. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is what protects everybody."</p>

            <p>On Sunday, 17 November, people from as far as Bluff and Invercargill will drive up to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The next day they'll then meet the Christchurch-based crew at Tuahiwi Marae - the same venue for the final hui for unity last month.</p>
        
            <p>Karakia will be held at 5:30am before the convoy departs for a Picton to Wellington ferry crossing.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday, 19 November will mark day 10 of the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti and kotahitanga o Ngā Iwi ki Waitangi Park - everyone will meet at Waitangi Park on Wellington's waterfont before walking to the steps of the beehive.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi was meant to finish the day after the introduction of the Treaty Principles Bill. The bills introduction was brought forward and has since passed its first reading.</p>
