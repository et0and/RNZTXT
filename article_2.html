            <p>Former Green MP Darleen Tana is heading to court today in an attempt to stop the party from using the waka jumping law against her.</p>
        
            <p>Tana filed proceedings against the Greens to prevent a meeting, scheduled for the weekend, to decide whether to oust the now independent MP from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The interim injunction aims to block the Greens' special general meeting from taking place, as well as calling for a judicial review of the party's co-leaders Chl√∂e Swarbrick and Marama Davidson, and the party.</p>
        
            <p>Tana's problems with her former party stem from allegations of worker exploitation at her husband's business and her failure to disclose her knowledge of the situation.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens have called on Tana to resign, which they have not done.</p>
        
            <p>The party has a contentious history with the party-hopping legislation which they were opposed to.</p>
        
            <p>But they've now said they would use it to evict Tana from Parliament if the party's membership agrees. The legislation only requires the party's leader to begin the process.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said the legal challenge was in line with Tana's actions over the last few months.</p>
        
            <p>A hearing was set down for 10am Thursday at the Auckland High Court.</p>
