            <p>Silver Ferns defender Kelly Jackson has won a third straight Dame Lois Muir Supreme Award, becoming just the second player alongside legend Laura Langman to claim the accolade three times.</p>
        
            <p>The supreme award honours New Zealand's best netballer across all competitions and campaigns, and Jackson's consistency shone across the domestic and international seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Former Silver Fern Langman won the supreme title in 2015, 2016 and 2019. The pair are the only multiple winners of the award.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson shared the title with shooter Grace Nweke in 2022 while claiming the title outright in 2023 and 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old said never in her wildest dreams did she think it was possible.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty unbelievable achievement and I'm a little bit speechless to be honest," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge honour and I'm very humble to receive the award once again. I just know I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such supportive family, friends, teammates and management and feel so lucky I can share this award with them."</p>
        
            <p>With 72 test caps under her belt, the 1.92m Jackson has cemented herself as a regular starter for the Silver Ferns. She featured in all 11 tests the Silver Ferns played this year, and played a strong hand in the 3-1 series win over Australia in the Constellation Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The Wānanga o Raukawa Pulse co-captain also led the rebound, deflection and intercept counts across all ANZ Premiership players this season.</p>

            <p>At Monday night's 2024 New Zealand Netball Awards, other reward recipients included shooter Nweke, who took out the Sandra Edge Medal as the Silver Ferns Player of the Year, as voted by the players.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old was an outstanding presence for the Silver Ferns in the Constellation Cup, where she consistently got the better of Australia's defenders.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke is heading off to play in the Australian league next year, which will make her ineligible for the Silver Ferns. The same policy ruled Langman out of the black dress in 2017 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio took out this year's Casey Kopua MVP as the 2024 ANZ Premiership Player of the Year for her role in the Magic's resurgence.</p>
        
            <p>For the second successive year, Ekenasio's teammates also voted her as the player who best upholds the mana of the Silver Ferns - Te Tuaka Rau Mataaho - Silver Ferns Players' Award.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran Magic defender Georgia Tong showed she was getting better with age. The 30-year-old clinched the Te Rau Mataaho - ANZ Premiership Players' Award - for the overall best performer of the 2024 ANZ Premiership, voted by her peers.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ Premiership break-out star Martina Salmon won the 2024 Aspiring Silver Fern Award after making the most of her opportunities when she was called up to the Pulse from the National Netball League as an injury replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Salmon's six-point winner on the stroke of full-time to help the FAST5 Ferns edge past South Africa 41-40 in the semi-finals of November's FAST5 Netball World Series was also voted the Moment of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>Midcourt pocket rocket Maddy Gordon was voted the Silver Ferns Fan Favourite after leaving a strong imprint during the end of year internationals.</p>
        
            <p>After guiding the Mystics to back-to-back ANZ Premiership titles, Tia Winikerei was awarded the Robyn Broughton Trophy as the ANZ Premiership Coach of the Year in 2024, for a second successive year.</p>
