            <p>Police say they have zero tolerance for the dangerous driving seen in Auckland yesterday when dozens of dirtbike riders blocked intersections and drove on the wrong side of the road.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement today, Senior Sergeant Anton Maisey of Counties Manukau Police said four people were arrested and had their bikes impounded when police intercepted the large group of riders in South Auckland on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He said a group of 20 riders started to congregate in Manurewa about 12.30pm and drove north towards central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"The group got larger and drove into Newmarket, Parnell then Tamaki Drive before heading back into Counties Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>"They continued back to Manurewa and turned off at Mahia Road, onto Roscommon Road where a number of Police units intercepted the group and were able to disrupt them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>More than 40 complaints were received from members of the public over dangerous driving, with close to 80 dirtbike riders at one point on the streets.</p>
        
            <p>Maisey said those riders showed a "complete disregard" for others on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"Police and the wider community have zero tolerance for this dangerous driving that puts other motorists and members of the public at risk."</p>
        
            <p>He said yesterday's actions would continue to be investigated.</p>
        
            <p>"Police don't tolerate offending on our roads and will continue to monitor group bike rides."</p>
        
            <p>The four people arrested included a 21-year-old man charged with dangerous driving, resisting police, disorderly behaviour, unlawfully taking a motor vehicle and assault; a 25-year-old man charged with dangerous driving and failing to stop; and a 24-year-old man charged with threatening behaviour and resisting police.</p>
        
            <p>They will all appear in Manukau District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A 14-year-old was also referred to Youth Aid Services.</p>
