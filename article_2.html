            <p>US President Joe Biden, under fire from fellow Democrats to drop his re-election campaign, tested positive for Covid-19 while on a trip to Las Vegas and is experiencing mild symptoms, the White House said.</p>
        
            <p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced the positive test for the 81-year-old Democrat after the president of UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation, said Biden would not be able to speak at a scheduled event due to the diagnosis.</p>
        
            <p>"He is vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms," Jean-Pierre said.</p>
        
            <p>Minutes after the announcement, the president's motorcade was on the move from taping a radio interview in Las Vegas to the Las Vegas airport. The president was returning to Delaware to self-isolate, the White House said.</p>
        
            <p>Biden had just greeted a couple of dozen people at a Mexican restaurant prior to going behind closed doors for the interview. When Biden was late for the start of the UnidosUS event, the organiser announced he had tested positive.</p>
        
            <p>Biden spent two nights in Vegas on the campaign trail.</p>
        
            <p>Biden is locked in a battle with some fellow Democrats who worry he is too old to seek re-election and want him to step aside in favour of another candidate.</p>
        
            <p>He suffered a blow earlier in the day when a prominent Democratic member of the US House of Representatives, Adam Schiff of California, said it was time for Biden to "pass the torch" to someone else.</p>
        
            <p>"He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time," said Jean-Pierre.</p>
