            <p>Environmental protesters have thrown soup at the glass-protected Mona Lisa in France, calling for the right to "healthy and sustainable food".</p>
        
            <p>The 16th Century painting by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the world's most famous artworks, and is held at the Louvre in central Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The Louvre said the work was behind protective glass and was not damaged.</p>
        
            <p>Video shows two female protesters wearing T-shirts that read "food counterattack" throwing the liquid.</p>
        
            <p>They then stand in front of the painting, saying: "What is more important? Art or the right to healthy and sustainable food?</p>
        
            <p>"Your agricultural system is sick. Our farmers are dying at work," they add.</p>
        
            <p>Museum security are then seen putting black screens in front of them before the room is evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>A group called Riposte Alimentaire (Food Counterattack) claimed responsibility for the stunt.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, it said the protest was part of efforts to integrate "food into the general social security system".</p>
        
            <p>It said that the current model for food "stigmatises the most precarious and does not respect our fundamental right to food".</p>
        
            <p>The group called for a food card worth €150 (£128) to be given to citizens each month to be used on food.</p>
        
            <p>The Louvre said that members of Riposte Alimentaire, which it described as an environmental movement, sprayed pumpkin soup on the painting at around 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT), and that there was no damage.</p>
        
            <p>It said the Salle des Etats, where the work is displayed, was evacuated, and reopened to visitors at 11.30am after cleaning was carried out.</p>
        
            <p>"The museum will lodge a complaint," it added.</p>
        
            <p>Rachida Dati, France's Minister for Culture, said "no cause" could justify the Mona Lisa being targeted.</p>
        
            <p>"Like our heritage [the painting] belongs to future generations," she said on X.</p>
        
            <p>The French capital has seen protests by farmers in recent days, calling for an end to rising fuel costs and for regulations to be simplified - on Friday they blocked key roads in and out of Paris.</p>
        
            <p>The Mona Lisa has been behind safety glass since the early 1950s, when it was damaged by a visitor who poured acid on it.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, the museum said it had installed a more transparent form of bulletproof glass to protect it.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, an activist threw cake at the painting, urging people to "think of the Earth".</p>
        
            <p>The painting was stolen from the Louvre in 1911, causing an international sensation. Vincenzo Peruggia, an employee of the world's most visited museum, hid in a cupboard overnight to take the painting.</p>
        
            <p>It was recovered two years later when he tried to sell it to an antiques dealer in Florence, Italy.</p>
