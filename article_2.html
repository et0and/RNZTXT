        <h2>Watch live: Papua New Guinea PM and Luxon speak at meeting</h2>
        <p>

</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, James Marape, and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon are holding a signing ceremony and media conference following a bilateral meeting.</p>
        
            <p>It is due to begin at 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>Marape arrived in New Zealand on Tuesday morning for a three-day state visit.</p>
        
            <p>The two prime ministers were set to discuss to discuss trade, investment, agriculture, fisheries, education and security as well as other areas of mutual concern between the two nations.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand signed a Statement of Partnership (2021-2024) with Papua New Guinea under former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>"This is being refreshed this week," a statement from Marape's office said.</p>
        
            <p>This is Marape's first official visit to New Zealand following his re-election as prime minister in the last national elections in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>According to the PNG government, the visit signals a growing relationship between the two countries, especially in trade and investment, cultural exchange, and the newly-added Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme that New Zealand has extended to Papua New Guineans to work in Aotearoa.</p>
