            <p>Two police officers and two cab drivers were attacked in a large brawl outside Palmerston North Hospital's emergency department on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A cab and another vehicle were involved in a minor collision on the hospital grounds late this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The car's occupants then attacked the cab driver, along with another cabbie who was nearby and became involved.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses described the attackers as being gang members.</p>
        
            <p>Hospital security called police and two officers arrived, but a witness said they were quickly overwhelmed by up to 14 people.</p>
        
            <p>The cab driver involved in the crash was taken to the emergency department and "hidden" from the attackers who were threatening to kill him.</p>
        
            <p>"There was shouting and swearing. It was violent and the police were beaten up," the witness said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their police car was attacked too. It was frightening and disgraceful."</p>
        
            <p>Six other police cars arrived soon after and the witness said officers deployed pepper spray and a taser to end the altercation.</p>
        
            <p>The government provided extra security to the highest risk hospital emergency departments over the summer as part of its 100 day plan, but the number of round-the-clock security guards at some EDs was reduced in April this year.</p>
