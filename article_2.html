            <p>Two years on from when he first disappeared, police believe Tom Phillips is hiding out with his children in Western Waikato within Marokopa or the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips and his school aged children Jayda, Maverick, and Ember went missing in December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders says the one focus of police working on the case is to bring the children home.</p>
        
            <p>"Although the environment is challenging for investigators, we continue to devote resources to this operation and follow up on all reported sightings," Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>New evidence and information relating to the case was continuing to be reviewed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police do not have a plan to offer a reward, but have asked for information from the community that could help with the children's return.</p>
        
            <p>"While we cannot comment on speculation about any assistance or support Phillips may be receiving, or rumours around the Te Kuiti bank robbery and who the possible accomplice could be, we have previously confirmed that Phillips is the suspect of the attempted burglary of the Piopio superette store.</p>
        
            <p>"Tom Phillips faces charges in relation to aggravated robbery, aggravated wounding, and unlawful possession of a firearm."</p>
        
            <p>Police considered Phillips to be "armed and dangerous" and said he should not be approached.</p>
        
            <p>In November, police appealed for sightings of Phillips riding a red farm-style quad bike.</p>
        
            <p>Police said security footage showed Phillips and one of his children breaking the glass frontage of a store in Piopio.</p>
        
            <p>In May, Phillips was one of two people involved in the armed robbery of an ANZ bank in Te Kūiti and he was charged with aggravated wounding and unlawfully possessing a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips and his children had previously disappeared in September 2021.</p>
        
            <p>A large search and rescue operation was suspended after 17 days when he and the children walked into his family's farmhouse.</p>
        
            <p>They had been living in a tent in dense bush, inland from Kiritehere beach, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips was charged with wasting police resources. But after failing to appear at Te Kūiti District Court for a scheduled hearing in mid-January 2022, a warrant for his arrest was issued.</p>
