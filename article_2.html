            <p>A Northland man has been arrested as part of an investigation into alleged historical sex offending that spanned three decades when he was part of a secretive sect that meets in people's homes.</p>
        
            <p>The religious group known as the Two by Twos, or The Truth, is under investigation by the FBI for historical child sexual abuse. Former members warn it is a highly controlling and insular group, with many unwritten rules.</p>
        
            <p>The Christian sect has about 2500 members and 60 ministers in New Zealand, is not registered as a charity and has no official name nor church buildings.</p>
        
            <p>Ealier this year, its spokesperson confirmed police here were investigating at least one former minister for historical abuse and it was aware of 14 cases of allegations against members.</p>
        
            <p>Police have this month laid numerous charges against a man who was part of the sect.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage, 17 charges of indecent assault have been laid against the man relating to alleged offending against four victims between the 1960s and 1980s.</p>
        
            <p>The 79-year-old man has interim name suppression and is due to reappear before Kaikohe District Court next week.</p>
        
            <p>The sect's overseer Wayne Dean said they encouraged abuse to be reported.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst it would be inappropriate for us to comment on any specific case that may be before the courts or in the hands of the police, I can confirm that we as a group encourage and support the reporting of abuse to the authorities, and respect all action taken by the authorities in response to criminal behaviour," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our heartfelt message to all survivors/victims is one of support and encouragement. We recognise they have experienced pain and suffering through no fault of their own. We acknowledge the courage of those who have shared their experience, and are mindful also of those whose voices are still silent, unable to speak of the trauma endured."</p>
        
            <p>In May, the sect's Australasian leaders launched a website with information about its response to historical child sexual abuse and a written apology to victims.</p>
        
            <p>The website does not carry any name for the sect but refers to the group as "our fellowship" or "our church".</p>
        
            <p>Victim advocate Jillian Hishon runs a hotline - The Brave Truth Australia and New Zealand - for abuse survivors in the sect.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the fact that there's been an arrest I think it will be really encouraging for victims to see this moving forward," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really hard for victims to make those reports [to police] but seeing something move forward ... is a really good thing."</p>
        
            <p>Hishon said the hotline had received calls from at least 15 New Zealand people alleging they are victims since the FBI announced it was investigating the global sect.</p>
        
            <p>"Oftentimes for a victim to report to us, they just want to be able to tell their story and be listened to."</p>
        
            <p>In February, the FBI confirmed it had launched a global investigation into the sect known as the Two by Twos, or The Truth.</p>
        
            <p>"Because the FBI Omaha field office is seeking the public's help in identifying potential victims, I can confirm an investigation," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"In order to preserve the integrity and capabilities of the investigation, I cannot share any details of the ongoing process. We encourage anyone with information to provide it through [www.fbi.gov/2x2 its website]."</p>
        
            <p>The FBI said it encouraged reporting from anyone who thought they may have been a victim.</p>
