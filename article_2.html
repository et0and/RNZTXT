            <p>The Māori Queen, Nga wai hono i te po, will join the national hīkoi to Parliament on Tuesday, saying she will not accept a process which undermines Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of supporters of the hīkoi against the Treaty Principles Bill reached Porirua, north of Wellington, on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>They will have a rest day on Monday before heading to Wellington and Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiingitangi said the Māori Queen was willing to help lead a conversation about nationhood and national unity.</p>
        
            <p>It said she was calling for the nation to come together, work through divisions and embrace a shared identity moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Our nation's strength lies in honouring the promises we make to each other."</p>
