            <p>Three people have been killed and others wounded in a stabbing attack at a festival on Friday night in the western German city of Solingen, police confirm.</p>
        
            <p>Bild newspaper reported a man knifed passers-by at random at the festival at around 9.45 pm and that at least three people were dead and multiple wounded.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses said the perpetrator was at large, the paper added.</p>
        
            <p>German police said they assumed the stabbings was the result of a single perpetrator.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor of the city confirmed there were dead and injured due to an attack, but did not go into details.</p>
        
            <p>"It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives," Mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The police said the attack occurred at a festival to honour the town's 650th anniversary.</p>
        
            <p>"There are multiple dead and injured due to a knife attack," the police said in a post on X.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, local police said they could not comment over the phone.</p>
        
            <p>The attack occurred at the Fronhof, the mayor's statement said, a market square where live bands were playing.</p>
        
            <p>Solingen is in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany's most populous and bordering the Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>Fatal stabbings and shootings in Germany were relatively uncommon.</p>
        
            <p>In June, a 29-year-old policeman died after being stabbed in the German city of Mannheim during an attack on a right-wing demonstration.</p>
        
            <p>There was a stabbing attack on a train in 2021, injuring several.</p>
        
            <p>The German government has been aiming to toughen rules on knives that can be carried in public by reducing the length allowed.</p>
