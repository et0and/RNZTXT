            <p>New Zealand driver Liam Lawson managed 91 laps on the second day of Formula 1 pre-season testing in Bahrain.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was the only Red Bull driver in action today with four-time champion Max Verstappen taking over on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Only one driver from each team was allowed to drive in either the morning or afternoon session.</p>
        
            <p>While the 23-year-old Kiwi got through a reasonable number of laps, he also spent a lot of time in the team garage with Red Bull saying the car needed regular servicing.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's RB21 also had water system issues that kept him in the garage for more than half an hour during the morning session.</p>
        
            <p>Commentators at the test did say they felt the Red Bull wasn't as quick as their rivals.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was seventh fastest on the day with his best time of 1:30.252 more than a second slower than Williams driver Carlos Sainz.</p>
        
            <p>Then came the two Ferrari's of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc followed by the Mercedes' of George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli.</p>
        
            <p>Sainz completed the most laps today, 127.</p>
        
            <p>Constrictors champions McLaren had Lando Norris, fastest on Wednesday, only 14th but the Briton aborted a lap that was quickest of all in the middle sector.</p>
        
            <p>The Bahrain testing finishes Saturday with the 2025 season opening in Melbourne on March 16.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile Lewis Hamilton said he was "really enjoying" his new Ferrari.</p>
        
            <p>The seven-time champion moved to the Italian team this year after 12 seasons with Mercedes.</p>
        
            <p>"I am really enjoying the car. We're slowly bonding. Yesterday was a so-so day, just OK. But we got through all our run-plan. I was not doing set-up changes or directing where I want the car to go," Hamilton said.</p>
