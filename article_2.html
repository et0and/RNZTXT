            <p>New Zealand boxer Joseph Parker has revived his professional career with an emphatic points win over American big-hitter Deontay Wilder in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        
            <p>Parker was a firm underdog for the clash of two former world champions but he dominated from the outset against his listless 38-year-old opponent and nearly produced a knockout in the eighth round.</p>
        
            <p>The judges unanimously scored the 12-round contest in Parker's favour, which potentially opens the door to another world title shot.</p>
        
            <p>Parker was already dominating the fight when he caught Wilder with a flurry of punches late in the eighth round, sparked by a wild right hand that connected with his back-pedalling opponent.</p>
        
            <p>The three judges scored it 118-111, 118-110, and 120-108 to Parker indicating they had him winning virtually every round.</p>

            <p>Parker shouted "I'm back!" after receiving the decision.</p>
        
            <p>The Aucklander said his preparation had been spot on.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a lot of respect for WIlder but we trained very hard for this. Everyone had plans but this is God's plan," he told broadcaster DAZN.</p>
        
            <p>"The strategy was to be really fit, stay calm, stay relaxed. Maybe inactivity played a big part (for Wilder)."</p>
        
            <p>* See how the bout unfolded with RNZ's live blog.</p>
        
            <p>It's Parker's fourth win of the year after a points victory over Jack Massey and knockout wins over Faiga Opelu and Simon Kean.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022 he suffered a massive setback when he was stopped in 11 rounds by another Briton Joe Joyce, but has had a stellar year which he attributes to working with Tyson Fury's camp.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Junior Fa fought on the opening fight of the card but was well beaten by undefeated Cuban Frank Sanchez.</p>
        
            <p>Fa, 34, defended Sanchez's attacks well through the early rounds but was caught in the seventh by the 31-year-old before the referee called off the contest, handing him a third career defeat.</p>
        
            <p>Also on the card, British heavyweight Daniel Dubois stopped unbeaten American Jarrell Miller in the tenth and final round while Dmitriy Bivol defended his portion of the world light-heavyeight title with a wide 12-round points victory over England's Lyndon Arthur.</p>
