            <p>McDonald's has started paying out holiday pay owed to tens of thousands of staff almost five years since it agreed to.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2019, Unite Union announced it had reached a deal with the fast food giant to go back 10 years to reimburse employees over a payroll botch-up.</p>
        
            <p>McDonald's was one of hundreds of companies caught up by payroll systems incorrectly calculating holiday pay.</p>
        
            <p>On its website this week, the company said it had been given approval by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to begin remediation.</p>
        
            <p>It said current and former staff who worked during the remediation period between 2009 and 2019 should go to an online portal to check their payment.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the union deal, Unite said as many as 60,000 McDonald's workers and millions of dollars would be involved in the process.</p>
