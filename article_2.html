            <p>At least 43 people have been killed after a fire broke out in a multi-storey building in Bangladesh, the country's health minister says.</p>
        
            <p>According to local media, the blaze began in a restaurant at about 10pm on Thursday (local time) in the capital, Dhaka.</p>
        
            <p>It spread quickly through the building, trapping dozens of people.</p>
        
            <p>Fire officials said the fire has now been bought under control. It is not clear what caused it.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh's Health Minister, Samanta Lal Sen, said that at least 33 people, including women and children, were declared dead at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>At least 10 others died at the city's main burns hospital. Dozens more people have been sent there for treatment, Sen said.</p>
        
            <p>The emergency services were called to the Kacchi Bhai Restaurant, which according to the Daily Bangladesh newspaper, has seven floors.</p>
        
            <p>"We were at the sixth floor when we first saw smoke racing through the staircase," said a restaurant manager called Sohel, according to AFP. He was rescued safely.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people rushed upstairs. We used a water pipe to climb down the building.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of us were injured as they jumped from upstairs."</p>
