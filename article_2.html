            <p>Police are urging the public to stay away from the Waimakariri riverbed following heavy rainfall on the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Westland issued a state of emergency yesterday in preparation for a deluge of wet weather.</p>
        
            <p>While the region fared better than originally forecast, 500 to 600 millimetres of rain still fell on some Westland ranges.</p>
        
            <p>Police are warning a large volume of water is moving through the Waimakariri River in Canterbury carrying logs and debris.</p>
        
            <p>They advise anyone in the bed of the river, or between the Waimakariri Gorge and sea, to leave.</p>
        
            <p>They said there is no risk to anyone outside of the riverbed.</p>
