            <p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump has been labelled a "tyrant" for suggesting a former Republican politician should face a firing squad for her foreign policy stance.</p>
        
            <p>Trump called Liz Cheney - one of the highest-profile Republicans to turn against Trump and endorse his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris - a "very dumb individual" and a "radical war hawk" at a campaign event in Arizona.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained to her face," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Cheney, the daughter of former Republican vice president Dick Cheney, said Trump's comment showed he was a "petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant".</p>
        
            <p>"This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death."</p>
        
            <p>Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office was investigating whether it was a death threat under state law.</p>
        
            <p>With just days to go until the US presidential election, Trump and Harris are both targeting swing states, including Wisconsin, in a bid to win crucial votes.</p>
