            <p>A heroic spell by debutant fast bowler Ben Sears got the Black Caps close - but Australia survived to win the second cricket test in Christchurch by three wickets and take the series 2-0.</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeeper Alex Carey was the hero for Australia - making an unbeaten 98 - to guide his side to victory, together with skipper Pat Cummins (32*). The pair put on 61 for the eighth wicket to seal the win.</p>
        
            <p>The start of play was delayed for an hour this morning, with the match eventually getting underway at midday.</p>
        
            <p>Australia resumed on 77-4 with Mitchell Marsh on 27 and Travis Head on 18 and Australia still needing a further 202 runs.</p>
        
            <p>Marsh slashed at a wide delivery from Black Caps skipper Tim Southee early on, offering a relatively straight forward chance to Rachin Ravindra at point who spilled it - a miss that ultimately proved hugely expensive with Marsh going to make 80.</p>
        
            <p>But in the very next ball, Southee had the left-handed Travis Head caught at point by Will Young, leaving Australia 80-5.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand thought they had a sixth wicket when Alex Carey was on 19, and was given out lbw to the bowling of Matt Henry, but a subsequent review by Carey saw the decision overturned.</p>

            <p>Marsh and Carey then combined for a 140 run sixth-wicket stand taking Australia through to 220-5, when Marsh fell lbw to debutant Sears, to keep the Black Caps hopes alive.</p>
        
            <p>Sears removed Mitchell Starc on the very next ball to be sitting on a hattrick with the tourists 220-7 and New Zealand back in the match.</p>
        
            <p>However Carey and Cummins combined to see the tourists home at Hagley Oval and again deny New Zealand a home victory against Australia - the last one being 31 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Sears finished with 4-90 in the second innings, to go with his one wicket in the first innings, while Matt Henry took 2-94.</p>

            <p>"The partnership with Mitchell Marsh and Alex Carey broke the back of our attack," said Black Caps skipper Tim Southee told TVNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Referring to the costly miss of Marsh, Southee said "no-one means to drop catches... but when you are playing the number one test side in the world we've just got to be a bit better for longer."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Southee's lean wicket taking trot continues, taking just one wicket in each innings of the match, having also only taken two in the first test.</p>
        
            <p>Player of the match Carey told TVNZ the Black Caps had the upper hand at the start of the day, but the intent Mitch Marsh brought in his 80 swung the pendulum in Australia's favour.</p>
        
            <p>Carey was left two runs short of a second test century, but had no complaints when skipper Cummins hit the winning runs.</p>
        
            <p>"I was happy with that. I didn't want to be on strike again."</p>
        
            <p>Carey also had a good test with the gloves equalling Adam Gilchrist's record for Australia with 10 catches.</p>
