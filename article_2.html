        <h2>Long-tailed bat the weight of a AAA battery believed to be NZ's oldest</h2>
        <p>
The bat, known as T7787, is at least 26 and "going a little grey", DOC says.

            <p>A bat of at least 26 years is officially New Zealand's oldest known long-tailed bat/pekapeka.</p>
        
            <p>Known as T7787, she was caught as part of a bat monitoring programme in Fiordland this month.</p>
        
            <p>She was given a quick health check, then released to rejoin her colony at Walker Creek in the Eglinton Valley, where she has lived her entire life.</p>
        
            <p>She weighs just 10.5 grams, about the same as a AAA battery.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation principal scientist Colin O'Donnell, who leads the bat monitoring work, said that T7787 was first caught in 2000 when she was a young mother, and again this month.</p>

            <p>As female bats are able to breed from two years old, O'Donnell said she was at least 26, but possibly as old as 28.</p>
        
            <p>"She's going a little grey but still appears in good health," he said.</p>
        
            <p>O'Donnell said the signs of her age included that she has stopped breeding, but had produced a pup every year for 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the 1400 bat species around the world live between six and 20 years on average, although a small number are known to live more than 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know how long our bats live for so it's exciting to get this record," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Long-tailed bats were threatened with extinction, having declined dramatically since pre-human times because of habitat loss and predation by introduced pests.</p>
        
            <p>However, long-term monitoring of both long-tailed and short-tailed bats by DOC has shown a steady increase in bat numbers in response to large-scale predator control using trapping, bait stations and aerial 1080 to target rats, stoats and possums.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to 2000, the long-tailed bat population was declining by 5 percent every year but that has been reversed and is now growing by 5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Before T7787, the previous oldest long-tailed bat, recorded and last seen in 2015, was another female, A78806, who was 25.</p>
