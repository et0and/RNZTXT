            <p>Gordon Ramsay says he is "looking like a purple potato" after coming off his bike and getting "a bit bruised up".</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted to his social media pages, the celebrity chef pulls up his top to show a dark bruise appearing to cover the entire left side of his torso.</p>
        
            <p>He said the "really bad accident" happened in Connecticut earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>"It really shook me and honestly, I'm lucky to be here now," the Kitchen Nightmares star told fans.</p>
        
            <p>On Instagram, he included a photograph of his badly damaged helmet.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm thankful for all the doctors, nurses and staff at Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London who looked after me and checked me out, but most thankful for my helmet that saved my life," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>He urged everyone to wear helmets when they cycle.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't care how short the journey is. I don't care the fact that these helmets cost money, but they're crucial. Even with the kids, a short journey, they've got to wear a helmetâ€¦</p>
        
            <p>"I'm lucky to be standing here. I'm in pain. It's been a brutal week, and I'm sort of getting through it. But I cannot tell you the importance of wearing a helmet."</p>
        
            <p>Ramsay said he did not break any bones or suffer any major injuries, aside from the bruise.</p>
