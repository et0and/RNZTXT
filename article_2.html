            <p>Local resident Chamsey told RNZ she heard a big noise just before midday, and ran out to see what had happened. She said her house had no power connection following the accident.</p>
        
            <p>Another local, Quinton Feldberg, said they had a visitor who told them about the accident, and they had come down for a look. He said he heard sirens earlier on, and was surprised to find the bus had driven into a power pole when he arrived at the scene. His power had not been affected.</p>
        
            <p>Pat Shardlow said she was cleaning her windows when she heard the bang, which she assumed was the bus hitting the street sign.</p>
        
            <p>"Then I saw him go straight into a lamp post. And then the next thing, the transformer over there, there was a big bang and a big cloud of smoke, and I thought, 'That's the power gone.'"</p>
        
            <p>She said her daughter, who lived around the corner, had lost power too. She said she had watched people get off the bus, and two ambulances arrived. She said although the bus was not going very fast, it would have still shaken up the passengers.</p>
        
            <p>Another person in the area said she heard a loud bang from several blocks away and the power in her house flickered. She said she and other locals' power was out, and they could hear lots of sirens.</p>
