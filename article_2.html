            <p>George Russell has taken pole position for Mercedes at the Las Vegas Grand Prix as Red Bull's Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen qualified ahead of McLaren rival Lando Norris.</p>
        
            <p>Verstappen, who could seal his fourth successive championship this weekend, will line up fifth on the starting grid with Norris sixth.</p>
        
            <p>Ferrari's Carlos Sainz joined Russell on the front row with Alpine's Pierre Gasly an impressive third fastest.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Red Bull driver Liam Lawson will start at 15th on the grid in the championship on Sunday night (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>In the last practice session ahead of the qualifiers, Lawson complained about nearly getting "rear-ended" by his team-mate Yuki Tsunoda, who had to swerve to avoid hitting Lawson's car.</p>
        
            <p>"Mate, Yuki just about rear-ended me," Lawson was heard saying following the near-miss.</p>
        
            <p>But British commentator David Croft said on the Sky Sport feed that Tsunoda was not to blame.</p>
        
            <p>"To be fair, Liam, what's he supposed to do when you're [sitting] in the middle of the track as he's coming into the braking zone," Croft said.</p>
