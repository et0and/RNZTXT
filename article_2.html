            <p>Kaipara District Council has voted to disestablish its Māori ward, becoming the first council to do so under new rules, in a tense council meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors voted 6 to 3 in favour of disestablishing the Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward with one abstention.</p>
        
            <p>An extraordinary council meeting deciding the fate of the council's Māori ward was attended by councillors, members of the public and at least 150 demonstrators at the council's Mangawhai office.</p>
        
            <p>Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward councillor Pera Paniora twice opened the council chamber doors allowing waiata and karanga from outside to flow inside, interrupting the meeting.</p>

            <p>Mayor Craig Jepson threatened to oust Paniora if her behaviour continued, under council's standing orders, and paused the meeting briefly.</p>
        
            <p>Paniora moved to postpone the vote until iwi and hapu had been consulted as per legal obligation under section 81 of the Local Government Act.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Eryn Wilson-Collins supported the motion and told fellow councillors voting to scrap Māori wards without their input would be detrimental to ongoing relationships with iwi.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not just Māori that are asking us to have the Māori wards. It is not just Māori who are asking us to live in a modern bicultural society," she told the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Jonathan Larsen compared the scenes that played out as an example of "tribal warfare" and "civil unrest".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to demonstrators earlier on Wednesday, a representative from Ngāti Whātua said the iwi had filed an injunction with the High Court in an attempt to stop the vote.</p>
        
            <p>Councils have until 6 September to decide whether to drop the wards. If they don't reach a decision, a binding referendum must be held alongside the election.</p>
        
            <p>Jepson has been called on to resign by iwi groups over his stance to remove the Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward.</p>
