            <p>National MP David MacLeod failed to declare 19 candidate donations worth $178,000 to the Electoral Commission, in what he says was an inadvertent error.</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister and National leader Christopher Luxon has stood Mr MacLeod down immediately from his roles on both the Environment and Finance select committees.</p>
        
            <p>MacLeod says he thought the return was for the 2023 year only so failed to declare the 18 donations he'd received when he became a candidate in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>However, he also failed to a disclose a $10,000 donation in 2023.</p>
