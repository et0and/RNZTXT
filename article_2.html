            <p>A steer running loose in the streets of Hamilton caused injuries and damage to people and property on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were injured and a small number of properties were damaged before the police used a gun to euthanise the steer.</p>
        
            <p>A Hato Hone St John spokesperson said it transported two patients, both in moderate conditions, to Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they are making enquiries into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The steer may have come from the local Frankton salesyard where a NZ Farmers Livestock cattle sale was due to occur at 11.30am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reached out to the local office of NZ Farmer but were told they would not be commenting.</p>
