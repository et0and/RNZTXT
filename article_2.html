            <p>The Commerce Commission's decision not to allow a planned merger of Foodstuffs' North Island and South Island divisions could be bad news for shoppers - at least initially.</p>
        
            <p>The commission said on Tuesday it was declining the proposal because it would substantially lessen competition.</p>
        
            <p>Chair John Small said it would reduce the number of buyers of grocery products in New Zealand, and give them more power to extract lower prices from suppliers.</p>
        
            <p>University of Auckland emeritus professor Timothy Hazledine said, while the decision to decline the merger was the right one, in the very near future it could mean higher prices.</p>
        
            <p>"They've still go to compete with each other with grocery product suppliers - those suppliers have still got three independent supermarket chains to sell to, rather than two, which would have swung the power a bit over to the buyers.</p>
        
            <p>"If anything in the short run sense, not allowing them to be more powerful dealing with their suppliers could mean a higher price for their suppliers - that is what their suppliers hope - and that could mean higher prices for consumers. In the short run it's not necessarily good news for consumers."</p>
        
            <p>But he said, in the long run, he agreed with the commission view that more competition was better than less.</p>
        
            <p>Hazledine said he would have been disappointed if the merger had been allowed to go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>He had hoped that the commission might have directed the two Foodstuffs businesses to compete at the retail level, too.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer spokesperson Gemma Rasmussen said she was also pleased with the decision.</p>
        
            <p>But she said New Zealand should not necessarily focus on the idea of a third player joining the market as the solution to competition.</p>
        
            <p>She said, in Australia, competition had "curdled" over time as Aldi had realised it could comfortably sit behind Coles and Woolworths and still make healthy profits, without driving prices down.</p>
        
            <p>"When I came back from Australia in 2021 I immediately noticed my like for like grocery shop was $100 to $150 more expensive here but analysis by Consumer over time has shown the gap between Australia and New Zealand closing in terms of affordability."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was not convincing to argue that savings from the suppliers would have been passed on to shoppers.</p>
        
            <p>The commission said the merger would make it harder for other retailers to grow, potentially depriving consumers of more shopping options.</p>
        
            <p>It also said the commission as also concerned that the consolidation with the proposed merger would lead to reduced investment and innovation by suppliers, meaning reduced consumer choice and/or quality of grocery products in New Zealand for consumers.</p>
        
            <p>Hazledine and Rasmussen said the supermarkets seemed to be coming under more regulatory pressure in Australia, even though it was a less highly concentrated market.</p>
        
            <p>Hazledine said there were already enough supermarket outlets around the country that they could compete with each other without having to build new ones, if the settings were right.</p>
