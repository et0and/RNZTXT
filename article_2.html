            <p>Police have fined 20 people for walking on Auckland's motorway during a protest led by Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki last November.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the convoy caused long delays on State Highway 1 as they made their way to the Auckland Domain for a 'Make New Zealand Great Again' rally.</p>
        
            <p>Police Superintendent Naila Hassan said they identified 20 protesters who were on foot on the motorway, taking enforcement action against them.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe the actions of the group posed serious safety risks to themselves and other motorists using the network at the time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Protesters were issued infringement notices with a fine of $250 for being a pedestrian on the motorway.</p>
        
            <p>Destiny Church said it did not organise the protest, and was unaware if infringement notices had been issued or not.</p>
        
            <p>The fines came a day after four people were arrested over a protest linked to Destiny Church at an Auckland Pride event last month. Police arrested four people as part of their investigation into a protest at the Te Atatū Community Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Officers had been investigating complaints about protesters' actions on 15 February. Around 30 adults and young children had to be barricaded into a room in a library in West Auckland, when a group linked to Destiny Church tried to drown out a children's event taking place at the centre as part of the annual festival.</p>
        
            <p>Police said eight victims filed complaints with police which had been "thoroughly investigated" in recent weeks. There were also six witnesses who supplied statements.</p>
