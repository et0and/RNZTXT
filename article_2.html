            <p>North Canterbury firefighters and four helicopters are tackling another large scrub blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency was alerted around 1pm to the fast-moving fire near Cheviot.</p>
        
            <p>Crews from Cheviot, Hurunui, Waipara, Scargill and Motunau are at the scene, plus a command unit from Christchurch and heavy machinery diggers.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the flames had jumped the Hurunui River but it was hoped that a large hill would slow down the fire.</p>
        
            <p>It had already burned through around 100 hectares of vegetation.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters spent last weekend extinguishing fires at Amberley, Loburn and on the Waimakariri Riverbank, northwest of Christchurch.</p>
