            <p>A person who died after falling from a cliff near Haihei Beach in Coromandel was 13 years old, according to reports.</p>
        
            <p>Thames-Coromandel mayor Len Salt said there would be an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of a young person who fell from a cliff near Hahei Beach in Coromandel.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two people aged under-18 fell from a cliff on Saturday evening; one died at the scene, the other was rescued uninjured.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff reported it had been told by the Duty Coroner's officer on Monday that the deceased was 13.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said the victim's name would be released in due course, but would not say how old he or she was, except that the person was under 18.</p>
        
            <p>It is a break with the usual protocol of providing the age of accident victims and police have been asked why the person's age was not being released in this case.</p>
        
            <p>Salt said details of the incident were still coming in and there would be an investigation into the circumstances behind what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts go out to the families and the loved ones of the young person who lost their life ... it's heartbreaking to happen at any time of the year, certainly at this time."</p>
        
            <p>Further details about exactly what happened would come from the police or St Johns, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand it was the north end of Hahei in a cliff area, I'm still waiting for a full briefing."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, the Department of Conservation said the incident was not a DOC track. Police later confirmed the death was not on a council track either.</p>
        
            <p>"That area there has a mix of DOC land, there's some council responsibility for some of the beach front area and there's a lot of private land which is above those tracks as well and there's a number of walking tracks and beach access areas as well down there," Salt said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tricky area, we always encourage people to stay to the tracks to make sure that, especially after dark, that they take extra care."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether there was appropriate signage in the area, Salt said the council went "to extraordinary lengths" to put up appropriate signs and give guidance to people in tracks and access areas which could be dangerous or may have difficult access, but in this case the details were not available.</p>
        
            <p>The local community was very upset after the incident after the death, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's never easy for communities to manage but in this case where you've got a young person who's lost a life in a holiday community, an area where people go to enjoy their summer, it has an effect, there's no doubt about it."</p>
