            <p>Police are conducting fresh enquiries after a reported sighting of Tom Phillips and his children near Marokopa.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are conducting enquiries in the wider Marokopa area today after a reported sighting of Tom Phillips and his three children Ember, Maverick, and Jayda Phillips," Acting Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>"A visible police presence will be in the area while this is ongoing."</p>
        
            <p>The Herald is reporting a group of young pig hunters believe they sighted Phillips and his children in bushland near Marokopa, reporting it to police on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>And the owner of a local cafe on the road into Marokopa said she saw at least two police station wagons driving towards the settlement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The cafe owner said she saw police cars drive past in the opposite direction on Friday night, heading back towards Marokopa on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Phillips and his three children Jayda, now 11, Maverick, 9, and Ember, 8, have not been seen since 12 December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In June, police announced an $80,000 reward, along with potential immunity from prosecution for anyone who may have previously assisted Phillips, who now provided information that led to the safe return of the children.</p>
        
            <p>It expired at midnight on 25 June with no sign of the fugitive father or his kids.</p>

            <p>On Jayda's 11th birthday in June - the children's mother Cat made an emotional plea for their return in a video posted online by police.</p>
        
            <p>She begged for the public's help to bring her "babies home", saying they were innocent children who did not deserve the situation they were in.</p>
        
            <p>"They do not deserve the life that is being provided to them right now," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What Thomas is doing is not okay. It is not okay to divide and conquer. It is not okay to isolate and control."</p>
        
            <p>She called Phillips' actions tantamount to child abuse, neglect, abandonment and endangerment.</p>
        
            <p>"My babies deserve better. I'm just a mother standing here in front of the world begging you all to help me bring my babies home."</p>

            <p>Cat, who has never shown her face publicly over the situation before, was criticised on social media for the video.</p>
        
            <p>The next night, on 19 June, she posted an unsigned and undated hand-written letter purportedly from Phillips to her apologising for hurtful past actions.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood Phillips had custody of the children when they first disappeared in September 2021, sparking a 17-day search in dense bush surrounding Marokopa.</p>
        
            <p>Police charged Phillips with wasteful deployment of police resources, but he failed to show at Te KÅ«iti District Court on 12 January 2022.</p>
        
            <p>A Marokopa resident, who did not want to be named, knew Phillips in passing and described him as "very religious" and "different".</p>
