            <p>Wells Fargo has conducted a rash of sackings in recent weeks after claims some of its employees were faking keyboard activity to fool the firm into thinking they were working.</p>
        
            <p>America's third largest bank disclosed the decisions in broker filings with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra).</p>
        
            <p>The firm did not respond to questions about how the alleged issue was discovered, or whether it was related to remote work.</p>
        
            <p>New rules came into effect in the US this month that mean offices that brokers are using to work from home need to be inspected every three years.</p>
        
            <p>"Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behaviour," spokeswoman Laurie Kight said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Some large companies have been using increasingly sophisticated tools to monitor employees since remote work expanded during the Covid pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Such services can track keystrokes and eye movements, take screenshots and log which websites are visited.</p>
        
            <p>But tech has also evolved to evade the surveillance, including so-called "mouse jigglers", aimed at making computers appear to be in active use, which are widely available.</p>
        
            <p>According to Amazon, where they can be found for less than $10, thousands have been sold in the last month.</p>
        
            <p>In the filings, Wells Fargo said staff had resigned or been fired "after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work".</p>
        
            <p>Bloomberg, which first reported the firings, said more than a dozen people had been affected.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC has confirmed six instances in which staff had been discharged after review, and one case in which a person resigned voluntarily after being confronted with the claims.</p>
        
            <p>Many of them had worked for the firm for less than five years.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as many firms, especially in the financial industry, are pushing staff to return to the office.</p>
        
            <p>Remote work remains popular since the pandemic, but numbers have been drifting lower.</p>
        
            <p>In the US, just under 27% of paid days last month were work-from-home days, compared with more than 60% at the height in 2020, according to research by professors at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) Business School, Stanford and University of Chicago.</p>
        
            <p>As of this spring, about 13% of full-time employees in the US were fully remote, and another 26% enjoyed a hybrid arrangement, according to the researchers.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, Wells Fargo said it had adopted a hybrid flexible model for most of its employees.</p>
