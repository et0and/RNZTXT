            <p>Preview: Dai Henwood likens the brutal regime of chemotherapy he has undergone to "keeping a classic car on the road" until further treatments emerge.</p>
        
            <p>Henwood was diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer three years ago. It had spread to his liver and cancer was also detected in his lungs.</p>
        
            <p>Over three episodes, Live and Let Dai, which drops on Three on Monday night, documents the popular TV host's courageous and determined battle to keep going with positivity.</p>

            <p>"Optimism won't cure me, but pessimism will kill me," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Henwood, who has hosted shows like Dancing with the Stars, 7 Days, Family Feud and Lego Masters, has undergone major surgeries and numerous bouts of chemotherapy. The chemo is tough on body and soul, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine the worst hangover you've ever had, make that hangover last for four to five days, and you don't even have that small period of good times."</p>
        
            <p>We see Henwood recovering in West Auckland's Piha, after day one of a chemo session.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel sad, I feel broken, I feel so sick."</p>
        
            <p>Things look better on day two, however.</p>
        
            <p>"I've smashed a pie and had a coffee."</p>

            <p>Piha is his spiritual home, and the family have a place there. It is where he heals and works on his comedy.</p>
        
            <p>In between bouts of gruelling treatment, Henwood continues to work, telling a crowd in Devonport: "Cancer doesn't all have downsides, I've never been given so much weed in my life."</p>
        
            <p>Much unsolicited medical advice comes his way, he says - little of it based in evidence.</p>
        
            <p>"Turmeric up your bum won't cure anything, it's strictly recreational."</p>
        
            <p>Henwood has had a decades-long love affair with Japan and has practised mediation for years. It forms an important part of his healing.</p>
        
            <p>He meditates on death every day, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Mediation slows and calms the waters of my brain."</p>
        
            <p>He explains how living with cancer occupies his thoughts constantly.</p>
        
            <p>"I think so often, 'what did I think about before I had cancer?'"</p>
        
            <p>Among the most moving moments in the doco are Henwood's distress that he might not be there for his family. He feels guilt for bringing a heaviness to family life.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I need to apologise for having cancer."</p>
        
            <p>While chemo is holding the cancer at bay, there will come a time where he develops resistance, he said.</p>

            <p>The "hail Mary" is a drug trial. Progress is being made with immunotherapy for various cancers and Henwood visits an institute in Melbourne which is researching CAR T-cell therapy in solid tumours.</p>
        
            <p>"What was happening as a potential cure for me was happening on our doorstep."</p>
        
            <p>It is a cause for optimism, but tempered with the reality that treatment in a clinical setting is years away.</p>
        
            <p>After 18 rounds of chemo, Henwood takes a break to visit Japan. There, in a monastery, we see him write a letter, tears streaming down his face.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't deserve to be where you are," he writes.</p>
        
            <p>It is part of a Tabidachi or 'departure ceremony'. Henwood must write down, under the watchful eye of a monk, the three most important objects, spiritual practices and people in his life and one by one let them go.</p>
        
            <p>The process leaves Henwood bruised but lighter, he said, he had never "cried so much".</p>
        
            <p>"You have become the wind, you have departed", the monk says, "Get up and feel the joy of living."</p>
        
            <p>"It was almost as if my soul was a chicken, and I was plucking feathers off it 'til it was raw." Henwood says.</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, it was a cathartic experience for him.</p>
        
            <p>"Because the fear of death is gone, the joy of living is all that remains."</p>
        
            <p>We also see Henwood where he is most at home, bringing the roof down at the Opera House in Wellington for his Dai Hard one-man show.</p>
        
            <p>"Laughter is now crucial for me to survive," he says.</p>
        
            <p>The documentary is equal parts heavy and light. Henwood says: "I am also confident it is the funniest cancer documentary ever made."</p>
