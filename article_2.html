            <p>A teenager has been arrested after police disrupted a "sophisticated smishing scam" using technology never seen in New Zealand before.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said the Department of Internal Affairs was made aware of the scam in July.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple agencies, including Australia's cybercrime team, soon launched Operation Orca.</p>
        
            <p>Police described smishing - a form of phishing - as when a device known as an SMS Blaster is used as a fake cell tower and tricks nearby cellphones to connect to its fraudulent network.</p>
        
            <p>The SMS Blaster can then send texts, claiming to be from banks to try get people to share their personal information like passwords and credit card details.</p>
        
            <p>Police executed a search warrant at an address in central Auckland on 23 August where they arrested a 19-year-old man and seized a smishing device.</p>
        
            <p>
The SMS Blaster was found by police in a vehicle.

            <p>Detective Superintendent Greg Williams said this was the first case ever of such a device being used in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"By working together, we have been able to counter this technology, locate the alleged offender and prevent what could have been large-scale financial losses for many New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"The device in question is believed to have sent thousands of scam text messages, including around 700 in one night.</p>
        
            <p>"The text claimed the recipient's bank account was being checked for fraudulent funds and urged them to click a verification link."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said about 120 people are known to have been affected by this scam but no one has lost any money.</p>
        
            <p>"Cyber-enabled scams are becoming increasingly prevalent, with unscrupulous fraudsters stopping at nothing in their attempts to swindle innocent people out of their hard-earned money," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"NZ Police recognise the life-changing impact of financial crime and will continue to work closely with partner agencies and private industries to keep New Zealanders safe."</p>
        
            <p>Banks said they are continuing to monitor customer transactions in real-time to minimise risk.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager has been charged with interfering with a computer system and will next appear in Auckland District Court on 10 December.</p>
