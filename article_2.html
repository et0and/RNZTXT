            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has told Parliament he believes Māori ceded sovereignty to the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>During Question Time, Green Co-Leader Chloe Swarbrick pushed him on the issue multiple times, asking "does the prime minister believe that Māori ceded sovereignty?"</p>
        
            <p>Luxon responded saying "our position is the Crown is sovereign."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters interjected, citing prominent former Māori MP Sir Apirana Ngata from 1922.</p>
        
            <p>"Is it a fact that, 102 years ago in a major thesis, Sir Apirana Ngata set out the very circumstances of the Treaty, and he said that Māori ceded sovereignty."</p>
        
            <p>"As I said, our position is the Crown is sovereign," repeated Luxon, "and also importantly the Treaty of Waitangi has protections in there for both Crown and Māori interests."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick repeated her question, "are we to take from that answer that the prime minister believes that Māori ceded sovereignty?"</p>
        
            <p>Luxon then replied saying he did not know how he could be clearer in answer to the first question.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick then asked Luxon directly when Māori ceded sovereignty.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon responded saying the Treaty of Waitangi was the founding document of New Zealand and it had protection for both Māori and Crown interests.</p>
        
            <p>"But as I said to you, the position is very clear, the Crown, Māori ceded sovereignty to the Crown."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick also referenced Waitangi Tribunal finding from 10 years ago that "the rangatira who signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi in February 1840 did not cede their sovereignty to Britain".</p>
