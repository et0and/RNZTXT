            <p>The men's and women's medal races in the skiff class have been postponed due to light, shifty conditions in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>Race officials twice got the men's 49er medal race, featuring New Zealand duo Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie, underway, but both times the wind dropped out mid-race forcing the races to be abandoned.</p>
        
            <p>McHardie and McKenzie are in bronze position heading into the double-points medal race, within touching distance of silver. But with 12 points separating second to seventh, there remain a number of crews in with a shot of snatching a medal.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand rowers have added gold, silver and bronze medals to New Zealand's tally.</p>
        
            <p>Women's double sculls team Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won gold in their event, while the men's coxless four team took silver and the women's four took bronze.</p>
