            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer is defending protest action just days into a new government taking office.</p>
        
            <p>Demonstrations are underway around the country today, against what Te Pāti Māori says is an assault on tangata whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi, by the new coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>The Nationwide Action Day aligns with the opening of the 54th term of Parliament, where all MPs are required to swear an oath of allegiance.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer admitted she was reluctant to attach herself to King Charles when all MPs were sworn in later today.</p>
        
            <p>She said her party will mark the oath their own way and media would have to "wait and see" if members took the oath although they did so in 2020.</p>

            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said the protests were a sign of what's to come over the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>The real intention was for communities to show up for each other and unite, she told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>She said the protest action was necessary as part of Māori's strong culture of standing up for injustice.</p>
        
            <p>The government's focus should be on resolving the inequities facing Māori, based on solutions advanced by tangata whenua. Instead it was intent on "disbanding, disestablishing and showing a true disconnect with tangata whenua across the motu".</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said it was not too early to show opposition because her party had had three years of listening to their policies on the Opposition benches.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a government that has insulted and upset at least 20 percent of the population..."</p>

            <p>New Zealand First and ACT had never tried to reach out and engage with Māori, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She accused the parties now in government of perpetuating "racist carry-on" while they were in opposition and nothing had changed.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, the Prime Minister and his government have exactly confirmed our worst fears. We have to kick back and push back."</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer was asked about a social media post showing two guns crossing each other. She replied this would have been the work of one of the social media influencers who were promoting the protest action.</p>
        
            <p>It was a reminder of the colonised history of Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"They [the social media posts] are all reflections of artists saying what they think of our history."</p>
        
            <p>She was expecting hundreds of people at protest centres such as Whanganui, Porirua and Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>"Every area is standing up in its own way."</p>
        
            <p>She did not expect the protest action to be as disruptive or as disrespectful as the rallies undertaken by Groundswell.</p>

            <p>Māori health campaigner Lady Tureiti Moxon says the new government is taking the country back 100 years to the days of colonisation.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report the new government doesn't have the support of the people who many of its policies target.</p>
        
            <p>Lady Tureiti who is taking part in the action in Hamilton said Māori were feeling under attack "every which way but loose", because a lot of the policies were anti-Māori.</p>
        
            <p>She was surprised by the number of policies directed at Māori in the coalition agreement and believed they would take the country back 100 years.</p>
        
            <p>"And what we're saying is no, we've worked too hard on race relations in our organisations and this country to bring about a bit better partnership in terms of Te Tiriti with the government and with all those partners that we now have very good relationships with.</p>
        
            <p>"And yet here we are with this sweeping suite of policies and they are archaic."</p>
        
            <p>She believed the government had decided to take back all the power and control for themselves in the face of iwi efforts to have "a partnership that actually had meaning".</p>
        
            <p>"It includes Māori in decision-making and in co-governance ... and just at the swipe of a pen they [the government] decide, nah, we're not having that any more."</p>
        
            <p>They had not considered the consequences with no guarantee of tino rangatiratanga as laid down in the Treaty of Waitangi, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Waitangi Tribunal had been around for 50 years and had been the main body in developing Treaty principles and jurisprudence yet the government was now trying to ignore it.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of people did not know much about the Treaty and would like it to become "invisible". Now they had a government that seemed to share this goal, Lady Tureiti said. </p>
        
            <p>"Well, it's not invisible, it's the founding document of this country."</p>
        
            <p>She accused the government of marginalising Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Police are warning commuters in Auckland and Wellington in particular to expect significant delays this morning because of the National Māori Action Day protests.</p>
        
            <p>In what the party is describing as a "first hitout" objecting to policies introduced by the new coalition government - protesters are expected to gather at multiple locations across the North Island Te Ika-a-Māui by 7am.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand police assistant commissioner Sandra Venables said with multiple protests across several venues across the country police are being deployed "to react and control any behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>She said, while police supported lawful protest, officers would be acting on anything that stepped outside the boundaries, such as endangering the public.</p>
        
            <p>No special precautions were being taken in the grounds of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Police had established "good liaison" with protest organisers beforehand and had made their own expectations clear on behaviour.</p>
