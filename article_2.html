        <h2>The biggest difference between Hīkoi mō te Tiriti and past hīkoi</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - The diversity of voices during the hīkoi was noticeable - from tangata moana to young immigrants to elderly Pākehā from the South Island.

            <p>Analysis - Scenes that we saw play out over the past two weeks of Hīkoi mō te Tiriti have played out before in the history of Māori resistance - the Auckland Harbour Bridge swaying under the weight of marchers, a sea of flags flying on Parliament grounds.</p>
        
            <p>But one of the biggest differences between this hīkoi and past Māori protest movements was the number of non-Māori supporting the cause.</p>
        
            <p>During the Foreshore and Seabed hīkoi of 2004 it was predominantly Māori who took part - and while the majority of marchers for Hīkoi mo te Tiriti were still Māori, the number of tangata Tiriti lending their voices of support where noticeable.</p>
        
            <p>The diversity of voices was also noticeable - from tangata moana to young immigrants to elderly Pākehā from the South Island.</p>

            <p>Noel O'Malley, 76, drove up from Balclutha to join the convoy making its way up from Te Waipounamu and crossing the Cook Strait to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"What's been put down is unacceptable, completely unacceptable, it's not backed by any sound evidence and it's destructive on our community and a great shame on the government for doing what they are doing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>O'Malley recently completed a Masters in Peace and Conflict studies during which he learned a lot of New Zealand's history for the first time - including the history of Parihaka, something he said he was embarrassed not to have known before.</p>
        
            <p>"The injustices that occurred then are being continued in our society today, so the inequality that's there is real and there is no point in talking about people being equal until they have an equal base to start from."</p>
        
            <p>The most pleasing thing to come from his decision to join the hīkoi has been the support he received from his family, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Asians Supporting Tino Rangatiratanga spokesperson Kirsty Fong said Te Tiriti was relevant to everybody.</p>
        
            <p>"It is Te Tiriti that gives us the opportunity to live here and to belong and that belonging is like a reciprocal relationship with hapū and iwi Māori who have so generously opened their arms for us to live here."</p>
        
            <p>There was often a misconception that issues around Te Tiriti were just a Māori/Pākehā issue, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a Tiriti facilitator, and usually people also ask, why is Te Tiriti relevant to me? Why is this relevant to me, because I'm not included? And I think it's also just going back down to the basics and saying, actually, it's an invitation for everybody."</p>

            <p>Misbah, a young Hawke's Bay local who joined the hīkoi in Hastings, said if tangata Tiriti lent their voices of support to Māori, it would make a world of difference.</p>
        
            <p>"I took up the responsibility as tangata Tiriti, we need to make our stand clear about Te Tiriti... as tangata Tiriti we need to put our voice out there and make it clear that we are with tangata whenua and we are with all the people that are suffering all around the world."</p>
        
            <p>Palmerston North local Lise Bakker was one of a large group of tangata Tiriti who joined the hīkoi as it passed through Manawatū - many of whom carried signs reading 'we stand with Māori'.</p>
        
            <p>Pākehā must not be afraid to take a stand on Māori issues, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think so many of these really important te ao Māori causes kinda get shunted aside by Pākehā, and we go 'it's not our culture, it's not our problem', but this is.</p>
        
            <p>"This affects all of us and we need to be here to support our whānau. Because Māori are our whānau and we are all a part of Aotearoa."</p>

            <p>Taranaki Whānui ki te Upoko o Te Ika said they were uplifted by the wairua of those who joined the hīkoi to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki Whānui chief executive Kara Puketapu said the iwi was humbled by the immense presence of all peoples who gathered at Te Upoko o te Ika.</p>
        
            <p>"This collective expression revealed the beauty of te ao Māori and the extraordinary power of Kotahitanga-a unifying message carried forth to the nation by Te Arikinui Kuini, Nga wai hono i te po," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As mana whenua, we laid down Te Kahu o te Raukura to ensure the hīkoi was conducted in accordance with our tikanga of peace, honour and goodwill, and that was achieved."</p>
        
            <p>"We mihi to Te Arikinui and to all of the rangatira from across the motu, the leaders of the hīkoi, the Māori wardens, marae, the Tiriti Action Group, volunteers, police, councils and all of the Tangata Whenua and Tangata Tiriti who joined in the movement, ensuring that the mana of the kaupapa was upheld with dignity and strength."</p>

            <p>"The reason I am here today is really to encourage all Pākehā - all tangata Tiriti but mainly Pākehā in this country - to really learn our history."</p>
