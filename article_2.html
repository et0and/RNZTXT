            <p>Matildas captain Sam Kerr has been charged over alleged racially aggravated harassment of a police officer in London early last year.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said Kerr was given a court summons on January 21.</p>
        
            <p>"The charge relates to an incident involving a police officer who was responding to a complaint involving a taxi fare on January 30, 2023 in Twickenham," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr appeared in court in London on Monday, where British media is reporting she pleaded not guilty, and is set to face a trial in February 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old is among the biggest names in Australian sport, and overcame a calf injury to dazzle at last year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>She plays for Chelsea in England's Women's Super League, but is sidelined with a knee injury.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr's Australian-based manager Niki White declined to comment.</p>
        
            <p>The Perth-born striker has scored 58 goals for Chelsea in the WSL where she's played since 2020 after stints in Australia and the US.</p>
        
            <p>She's found the back of the net 69 times in 128 games for the Matildas.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the sport's governing body Football Australia said it was aware of the legal proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>"As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide further comment at this time. Our focus remains on supporting all our players, both on and off the field. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide support as appropriate."</p>
