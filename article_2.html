            <p>The world champion Black Ferns have suffered a historic 22-19 loss to Canada in their Pacific Four rugby test decider in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The Canadian women claimed the nail-biting win, beating New Zealand for the first time and claiming the Pacific Four Series title.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns will slip to third place in the women's World Rugby rankings, with Canada moving ahead of New Zealand to No 2.</p>
        
            <p>England tops the rankings by a margin, but Canada makes its first appearance inside the top two.</p>
        
            <p>Canadian captain Sophie de Goede said she felt speechless after the victory.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been knocking on the door and pushing to make a statement on the world stage for a while now.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see the experience growing within our team and the young ones coming up."</p>
        
            <p>De Goede credited the tireless effort on defence of her players.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see when you watch how special it is, but I'm just so proud to be Canadian and to play alongside these incredible women."</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns co-captain Kennedy Simon credited Canada for their stunning performance, with the pressure piling on the home side in the chilly conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We let them get on top of us.</p>
        
            <p>"We're lethal when we have the ball in hand and when we're in control - it's just [about] having more of those moments.</p>
        
            <p>"We were trying to focus on our set piece and have the ball in hand."</p>
        
            <p>Black Ferns winger Katelyn Vaha'akolo scored two first-half tries, as the home side went to an early lead.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand held a 14-10 half-time advantage but they had no answer to Canada after the break.</p>
        
            <p>Canada's momentum continued as Fancy Bermudez added her second try of the match in the 60th minute.</p>
        
            <p>Bermudez's try was a testament to her speed and power close to the line, breaking through New Zealand's defence in impressive fashion.</p>
        
            <p>A successful conversion by de Goede extended Canada's lead to eight, putting them in a strong position as the match entered its final stages.</p>
        
            <p>Despite New Zealand's late surge, Canada's defence held firm, and they managed to maintain their slim lead until the final whistle.</p>
