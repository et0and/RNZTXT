            <p>Warriors assistant coach Richard Agar has been charged with breaching the NRL code of conduct, relating to an alleged altercation with a journalist at Last Vegas earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland club played their season-opener against Canberra Raiders in the United States, falling 30-8, but their onfield lapse wasn't the only scar they brought back from 'Sin City'.</p>
        
            <p>Agar became the subject of an Integrity Unit probe over allegations that he physically assaulted English journalist John Davidson in the media box at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The breach notice issued Monday proposes a $10,000 fine and three-game suspension, along with a requirement for appropriate education and training. The ban would prohibit him from any gameday activities with the team and he would be unable to travel for road games.</p>
        
            <p>Agar has five days to respond to the notice. The club had no comment, when contacted for reaction by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors host Sydney Roosters on Friday, which falls within the five days, while their next three games are away to Wests Tigers (30 March) and Melbourne Storm (13 April), and at home against Brisbane Broncos (19 April). They have a bye in round five (3-6 April).</p>
        
            <p>The confrontation reportedly traced back several years, when Agar coached Leeds in the Super League. He also served as head coach at Hull and Wakefield Trinity, before joining the Auckland club in 2022, as Webster's deputy.</p>
        
            <p>Agar, 53, has been on the training field with his team and Warriors chief executive Cam George was quick to dismiss any notion he might be stood down during the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Warriors coach Andrew Webster insisted the ongoing investigation hadn't affected his team's preparation for their first home game of the NRL season, their 36-16 win over Manly Sea Eagles on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Webster and Agar have served together as Toa Samoa assistant coaches, while Webster's older brother, James, was Agar's assistant at Hull and replaced him as Wakefield Trinity head coach in 2014.</p>
