        <h2>Mortgagee sales on the rise as homeowners 'let it all go too long'</h2>
        <p>
While people generally get ample warning before the bank forces them to sell their home, some are in deep denial, expert says.

            <p>The number of mortgagee sales looks to be on the rise - but they are still just a fraction of the total market, experts say.</p>
        
            <p>A mortgagee sale happens when a homeowner does not meet their mortgage repayments, so the property must be sold to repay the debt owed to the bank.</p>
        
            <p>TradeMe currently has 65 residential properties listed as mortgagee sales, which is 35 percent up on the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>But the site's property sales director Gavin Lloyd said that number was "quite small" - less than one percent of TradeMe's more than 42,000 property listings.</p>
        
            <p>"In the market overall we are seeing properties generally taking longer to sell so this could also be contributing to the number of mortgagee listings increasing.</p>
        
            <p>"We know it's a tough time with the rising cost of living and interest rates taking its toll on homeowners, however mortgagee sales are often a last resort so some sellers may also look to proactively list their properties before they are required to by lenders."</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, Bayleys regional general manager Grant Henderson said his team would usually appraise up to three properties a year for banks considering mortgagee sales.</p>
        
            <p>But lately, staff were hitting that number each month.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a broad range, from developers who've found themselves in a sticky situation due to funding, we've found mums and dads that've got themselves just in the wrong situation, but also investors.</p>
        
            <p>"People have probably let it all go too long, and there's a lot of denial around the situation they're in."</p>
        
            <p>Banks did not take such sales lightly, and it was an absolute last resort, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on some of the things we've seen, these people have been in financial difficulty for a long time, it's not just like, 'you lost your job last month, this month we're gonna close you down', this takes a long time for the banks ... to get to the point where they have to pull the pin."</p>
        
            <p>People got plenty of warning and communication from the bank - up to three years' worth - before they exercise their mortgagee rights and force a sale, said Henderson.</p>
        
            <p>"Most pragmatic and practical mums and dads will get through it, but some people are just in that denial phase," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Climbing interest rates, insurance costs and council rates had been tipping homeowners into difficulty in recent times.</p>
        
            <p>For those reason, an increasing number of mortgagee sales was not surprising, CoreLogic chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>But it was "nothing like" the peak in 2009 after the global financial crisis, which was an extraordinary period.</p>
        
            <p>That year, New Zealand saw up to 800 mortgagee sales in a month, compared to 24 in the first quarter of this year, Davidson said.</p>
