            <p>History: The Melbourne Cup has been run every year since 1861 although to took a break during World War I and World War II.</p>
        
            <p>The first Tuesday in November has been a public holiday for most of Victoria since 1876.</p>
        
            <p>Qualifying: Initial entry fee is around $600 while the fourth and final acceptance fee is $46,000.</p>
        
            <p>To get the field down to 24, horses are gradually balloted out based on a number of factors including wins, placings, prize money and handicaps.</p>
        
            <p>There are also a number of races that the winner of is exempt of the balloting for the Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Handicap: Handicap races are meant to even out the field with the more fancied horses carrying more weight.</p>
        
            <p>The extra weight (over and above the weight of the jockey) are held in pockets on the saddle.</p>
        
            <p>Trophy: The first winner of the Melbourne Cup received a gold watch. A new trophy is struck every year An 18-carat solid gold trophy valued at around $600,000 is awarded to the winner.</p>
        
            <p>Distance: 3200m. The distance is the equivalent of the old two miles (2 miles). The Melbourne Cup distance was cut from 3219m to 3200m in 1972 when Australia adopted the metric system.</p>
        
            <p>Prize money: $9.4 million (World's richest handicap race) Winner earns $4.8 million. Prize money for horses finishing first to 12th.</p>
        
            <p>Race time: The Race is scheduled to start at 5pm NZ time. Kingston Rule set the current Melbourne Cup race record winning in a time of 3 minutes 16.3 seconds in 1990.</p>
        
            <p>NZ records: New Zealand bred horses have won the Melbourne Cup 43 times with 19 of those horses also owned in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The last New Zealand bred horse to win the Melbourne Cup was Verry Elleegant in 2021 and the last New Zealand owned and trained horse to win was Ethereal in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>2021 was a good year for New Zealand with Verry Elleegant trained by Chris Waller and ridden by James McDonald.</p>
        
            <p>Betting: Last year: In 2023 the race was won by Australian stayer Without A Fight.</p>
        
            <p>There was $13.4 million gambled by New Zealand punters on the Cup with a turnover of $28.4m on the day.</p>
