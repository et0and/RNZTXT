        <h2>GPs call for better resources to ease pressure on hospital system</h2>
        <p>
Te Whatu Ora is "wilfully" ignoring the GP shortage, an advocacy group says.

            <p>Better resources for general practitioners would ease the pressure on stressed doctors as well as the overstretched hospital system, GPs say.</p>
        
            <p>This week, doctors in Whanganui said a shortage of specialists at the local hospital was putting additional pressure on GPs already under strain.</p>
        
            <p>They spoke out after Health NZ asked them to consider "all options of care" before referring patients to specialist orthopaedic care.</p>
        
            <p>General Practitioners Aotearoa interim chair Dr Buzz Burrell said it showed Te Whatu Ora was "wilfully" ignoring the problem, which was not enough GPs across the motu.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Whatu Ora is implying that if the hospital had more staff, there would not be a problem. The opposite is the case.</p>
        
            <p>"If the community had an adequately staffed, resourced and funded general practice workforce, there would not be a problem in Whanganui's base hospital."</p>
        
            <p>He said studies showed that increasing care in primary health reduced the number of hospital admissions.</p>
        
            <p>The timing of Te Whatu Ora's request was unfortunate, Burrell added.</p>
        
            <p>"The secondary sector has reduced capacity to help [and] we've got a primary sector with not enough GPs. [So] for the government to be setting targets is naive on a good day, dumb on a bad day.</p>
        
            <p>"The only way you can meet those targets is by underservicing or not delivering the care that's needed - and that is heartbreaking for a first world country, we should not be seeing that."</p>
        
            <p>GPs felt frustrated, he said. "[But] that's a polite synonym."</p>
        
            <p>A Health NZ spokesperson told RNZ that general practice and wider primary care were the "cornerstones" of the health system, and "growing the GP workforce" was a priority.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ had several initiatives underway to support general practice and wider primary care, the spokesperson added.</p>
        
            <p>They included:</p>
        
            <p>"As this work is being undertaken in the face of a national and international shortage of GPs, it will take time to increase numbers in New Zealand," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to working closely with general practice to address the pressures and complexities they are facing so they can continue to provide vital care to their patients and communities."</p>
