            <p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown is hoping to have "an opportunity to talk" with the New Zealand government to "heal some of the rift that has occurred from our side."</p>
        
            <p>Brown returned to Avarua on Monday afternoon (Sunday, Cook Islands Time), following his week-long state visit to China, where he signed a "comprehensive strategic partnership" to boost its relationship with Beijing.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to signing the deal, he said that there was "no need for New Zealand to sit in the room with us" after the New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister raised concerns about the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Responding to reporters for the first time since signing the China deal, he said: "I haven't met the New Zealand government as, but I'm hoping that in the coming weeks, we will have an opportunity to talk with them."</p>
        
            <p>"Because they will be able to share in this document that we've signed and for themselves see where there are areas that they have concerns with.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm confident that there will be no areas of concern. And this is something that will benefit Cook Islanders and the Cook Islands people."</p>
        
            <p>He said the agreement with Beijing will be made public "very shortly".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure once the New Zealand government has a look at it there will be nothing for them to be concerned about."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he was not concerned by any consequences the New Zealand government may impose.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands leader is returning to a motion of no confidence filed against his government and protesters against his leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident that my statements in parliament, and my returning comments that I will make to our people, will overcome some of the concerns that have been raised and the speculation that has been rife, particularly throughout the New Zealand media, about the purpose of this trip to China and the contents of our action plan that we've signed with China."</p>
        
            <p>1News Pacific correspondent Barbara Dreaver was at the airport but was not let into the room where the press conference was held.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand government wanted to see the agreement prior to Brown going to China, which did not happen.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Brown had a requirement to share the contents of the agreement and anything else he signed under the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the difference in opinion provides an opportunity for the two governments to get together and "heal some of the rift that has occurred from our side".</p>
        
            <p>"We maintain that our relationship with New Zealand remains strong and we remain open to having conversations with the New Zealand government on issues of concern.</p>
        
            <p>"They've raised their concerns around security in the Pacific. We've raised our concerns around our priorities, which is economic development for our people."</p>
        
            <p>Brown has previously said New Zealand did not consult the Cook Islands on its comprehensive strategic partnership with China in 2014, which they should have done if the Cook Islands had a requirement to do so.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped people will read New Zealand's deal along with his and show him "where the differences are that causes concern".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Leader of Cook Islands United Party, Teariki Heather said Cook Islanders are sitting nervously with a question mark waiting for the agreement to be made public.</p>

            <p>"That's the problem we have now, we haven't been disclosed or told of anything about what has been signed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes we hear about the marine the seabed minerals exploration, talk about infrastructure, exchange of students and all that, but we haven't seen what's been signed."</p>
        
            <p>However, Heather said he wasn't worried about what was signed but more the damage that it could have created with New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Heather is responsible for filing the motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister and his cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>The opposition only makes up eight seats of the 24 in Cook Islands parliament is about showing support to New Zealand, not about toppling the Government.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about the numbers for this one, but purposely to show New Zealand, this is how far we will go if the vote of no confidence is not sort of accepted by both of the majority members, at least we've given the support of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Heather has also been the leader planned for a protest Monday local time (Tuesday NZ). Protesters will be bringing their New Zealand passports as a badge of support for Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"Our relationship [with New Zealand] we want to keep that."</p>
