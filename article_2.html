        <h2>Syrians explore ousted Assad's Damascus home</h2>
        <p>
"I am taking pictures, because I am so happy to be here in the middle of his house," one man says.

            <p>Roaming the opulent Damascus home of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Abu Omar felt a sense of giddy defiance being in the residence of the man he said had long oppressed him.</p>
        
            <p>"I am taking pictures, because I am so happy to be here in the middle of his house," said the 44-year-old, showing photographs he took on his mobile phone.</p>
        
            <p>He was among the dozens an AFP correspondent saw entering Assad's home after Assad fled the country -- to Moscow according to Russian news agencies -- as rebels took control of the capital in an 11-day lightning offensive.</p>
        
            <p>The swift campaign by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies ended more than five decades of brutal rule by the Assad family.</p>
        
            <p>"I came for revenge. They oppressed us in incredible ways," Abu Omar added from the compound of three six-storey buildings in the upscale al-Maliki neighbourhood.</p>

            <p>Jubilant men, women, and children wandered the home and its sprawling garden in a daze, the rooms stripped bare except for some furniture and a portrait of Assad discarded on the floor.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the Syrian capital were seen cheering in the streets, as the rebel factions heralded the departure of "tyrant" Assad.</p>
        
            <p>The government fell more than 13 years after Assad's crackdown on anti-government protests ignited Syria's civil war, which has drawn in foreign powers, jihadists and claimed more than half a million lives.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, video circulating online showed crowds peeking into the bedrooms in the Assad residence, which was previously off limits to ordinary citizens.</p>
        
            <p>They could be seen snatching clothes, plates and whatever belongings they could find including a Louis Vuitton cardboard shopping bag.</p>
        
            <p>In one video, a man could be heard yelling that everything was on "Sale! Sale!".</p>
        
            <p>Umm Nader, 35, came with her husband from a nearby district to tour the residence that once inspired fear and awe, and which one visitor now described as a "museum".</p>

            <p>"I came to see this place that we were banned from, because they wanted us to live in poverty and deprivation," she told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>Nader said the former inhabitants of the residence had left without cutting off the heating and electricity, "meanwhile our children are getting sick from the cold".</p>
        
            <p>Daily power outages that last for hours have been a fact of life in Syria, reeling from successive economic crises after more than a decade of war and Western sanctions.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the population has been pushed into poverty, according to the United Nations.</p>
        
            <p>An AFP correspondent also saw a charred reception hall at the Damascus presidential palace a couple kilometres away.</p>
        
            <p>As he moved from room to room, Abu Omar said he felt overjoyed.</p>
        
            <p>"I no longer feel afraid. My only concern is that we unite (as Syrians) and build this country together," he said, full of emotion.</p>
