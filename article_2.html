            <p>New Zealand's National Butchery Team - the Hellers Sharp Blacks - will be representing New Zealand on the global stage later this month.</p>
        
            <p>The eight-strong team comprising Riki Kerekere, Reuben Sharples, Luka Young, Dank Klink, Cherise Redden, Corey White, Samantha Weller and Brydon Heller are heading to the World Butchers' Challenge in Paris to represent New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It is a competition which attracts butchers from 14 countries around the world where they test their skillsets.</p>
        
            <p>Mangawhai butcher Dan Klink has been a butcher for over 20 years. He started in the industry first wanting to be a chef but found he loved it.</p>
        
            <p>It was a career which has taken him abroad where he sharpened his skills in places like London and Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>
Dan Klink took over the  local butchery where he first started his apprenticeship, Mangawhai Meat Shop.

            <p>He moved back to take over the butchery where he first started his apprenticeship, Mangawhai Meat Shop, about 13 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>It will be the second time Klink's represented New Zealand, having also travelled to Sacramento with the team in 2022 where they won bronze.</p>
        
            <p>"So we've managed to keep the same team together which is real fortunate. So we're the same lot."</p>
        
            <p>He said each brought different skillsets to the competition - his speciality was sausages which are a favourite in his household.</p>

            <p>Klink said the competition was a good opportunity to highlight the industry and encourage others to join the profession.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice to just showcase our industry in a different kind of light. People look at butchery and it's sort of the blood and guts of it while this is more the glitz and glamour."</p>
        
            <p>It involves competitors being judged on their product displays, yields and the amount of meat wasted, the overall cookability and salability of the products, cleanliness and hygiene, as well as teamwork.</p>
        
            <p>Klink said the team was excited to be heading over to Pairs at the end of the month, and was busy with planning and training.</p>
        
            <p>He said having worked together before was a real advantage.</p>
        
            <p>The World Butchers' Challenge is taking place on 31 March.</p>
