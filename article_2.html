        <h2>10 households evacuated as fire threatens homes</h2>
        <p>
The fire is currently contained, but it is unclear whether evacuees will be able to return to their properties tonight, FENZ says.

            <p>Ten households have been evacuated in Te Puna after a shelterbelt fire broke out.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is currently contained but is estimated to have burned around 3.5km of shelterbelt, Fire and Emergency NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Shelterbelts are rows of trees planted to provide wind breaks and improve micro climates.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said crews were called about 3.20pm on Wednesday to "reports of multiple shelter belts on fire" near Snodgrass Road.</p>
        
            <p>At 6.30pm, there were 16 fire engines at the blaze with multiple support vehicles, it said.</p>
        
            <p>It was not clear whether the evacuees would be able to return to their homes tonight, FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Crews will be working overnight and a helicopter will continue working to extinguish the fire until twilight.</p>

            <p>Wind and the tinder-dry hedgerows were two reasons the fire was still burning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire brigade will be there for a while," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His business was near to Snodgrass Road, but he was not worried about the fire getting out of control, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police have advised the community to avoid the area as emergency services work to control the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"If your home is impacted by smoke, please keep your windows and doors closed, and turn off any air conditioning units," FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Snodgrass Road is currently blocked and police are considering other road closures.</p>
        
            <p>A manager at a Te Puna business said the fire was far from the village centre, but they could see smoke.</p>
