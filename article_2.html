            <p>The Kiwi rowers have added another medal to the haul - the third in an hour of frantic action.</p>
        
            <p>The men's coxless four of Logan Ullrich, Ollie Maclean, Tom Murray, Matt Macdonald are Olympic silver medallists, and were just edged by the United States in another thrilling race.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi and American rowers shot out to first and second, from where the two crews fought fiercely for the lead.</p>
        
            <p>The Italians were also rowing strongly in third, but it was New Zealand and the US barely an inch apart at the midway mark.</p>
        
            <p>The US were holding off the Kiwi crew on the final leg, but New Zealand were set for a sprint finish.</p>
        
            <p>Just as the Kiwis were creeping up, the States found another gear to claim gold for the first time in the men's fours since 1960, while the Kiwis crossed in second for silver and Great Britain bagged the bronze.</p>
