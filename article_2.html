            <p>Sheep have been killed during a burglary in South Otago - one of a spate of burglaries at rural properties in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two separate burglaries were reported last month at a farm on Beacon Hill Road in Wairuna.</p>
        
            <p>"During the first incident, on 19 May, a vehicle entered the paddock, driving towards a number of sheep before intentionally colliding with several of them, killing four," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"A week later on 25 May, the same property was entered, and bales were damaged with a tool, causing them to spoil."</p>
        
            <p>Two other farms were burgled on Saturday night - one on Whiteside Road, where more bales were damaged, and one on Waipahi Highway, where electric fence reels were stolen from a paddock.</p>
        
            <p>Fences and gates were damaged at both farms, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police want to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the Waipahi area last night, or from anyone with information on the incidents in Wairuna last month.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes sightings of suspicious vehicles or people."</p>
        
            <p>Police could call police on 105 or go to police.govt.nz and use "Update Report" and the file number 240519/7760.</p>
