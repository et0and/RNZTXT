            <p>New Zealand's six Super Rugby Pacific sides name their squads for next season today. The Hurricanes and Crusaders have already been named (see below), next up we have last year's beaten finalists, the Chiefs.</p>
        
            <p>Brodie McAlister has been lured north from the Crusaders in an interesting move, he completes the hookers alongside Samisoni Taukei'aho and Bradley Slater. Jahrome Brown moves home after five seasons at the Brumbies to join a powerful unit that includes the red hot Wallace Sititi, as well as Luke Jacobon, Simon Parker and Kaylum Boshier.</p>
        
            <p>Clayton McMillan has also added World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year nominee Leroy Carter, while Josh Jacomb joins as a full squad member after playing four games last season.</p>

            <p>Rob Penney has made one big off season signing, with former Wallaby James O'Connor joining a Crusaders team desperate to get back to winning ways. They missed the playoffs last season after winning seven titles in a row, due in part to a shocking run of injuries and tough draw.</p>
        
            <p>Promising Wellington halfback Kyle Preston joins Mitch Drummond and Noah Hotham, with Rivez Reihana and Taha Kemara retained outside them. Penney's other rookies are the Waikato duo of flanker Xavier Saifoloi and NZ U20 fullback Aki Tuivailala.</p>

            <p>Hurricanes coach Clark Laidlaw has brought in nine new players for next season. While Brett Cameron has been named, he faces a lengthy rehab for an ACL injury, so first five Riley Hohepa returns to the Hurricanes after a season with the Crusaders. Two South Island locks also make the move north, Will Tucker from the Highlanders and Zach Gallagher from the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>Ere Enari joins the Canes after spending three seasons at Moana Pasifika, while rookies Tjay Clarke, Kade Banks, Arese Poliko, Fehi Fineanganofo and Lucas Cashmore come in as well.</p>
        
            <p>Laidlaw will have to look for some leadership in new areas, their biggest losses are All Blacks Jordie Barrett and TJ Perenara. Barrett will be back after a season in Ireland, but his absence gives the highly rated Riley Higgins a free run to start in the midfield. Josh Moorby has also left, which means the door is wide open for Clarke and Banks to make a case to start in the back three.</p>
