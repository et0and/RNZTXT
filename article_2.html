            <p>We're now deep into the rugby and league seasons, while the pinnacle of the A-League and English Premier League are just around the corner. There's also a couple of big combat sport dates, plus the Black Ferns open their 2024 campaign this month.</p>

            <p>The A-League grand final will take place on 25 May, exactly where is still to be decided but one fixture is definitely locked in a week before. The Phoenix will host the second leg of their semi final at Sky Stadium on the 19th, against an as yet undetermined opponent. If they win and the Central Coast Mariners lose, we'll be heading back to the capital for an unprecedented home final for Giancarlo Italiano's outstanding side.</p>

            <p>Do the Black Ferns have a bit of a point to prove this year? You could argue they do, considering they're coming off a season that saw them drop two tests at home for the first time ever, and also get dusted up by England in the WXV 1 decider. They should dominate the Pac 4 tournament against the amateur Australian, Canadian and American sides with three tests in three weekends starting on 11 May.</p>

            <p>The Blues and Hurricanes look like they're on a collision course at the top of the Super Rugby ladder, with their fixture at Eden Park on 11 May potentially being the crucial result that will decide who gets home advantage leading into the play offs. Meanwhile, the Crusaders are looking better but face an uphill battle to retain their title, while the Chiefs are flying under the radar a bit despite playing some excellent rugby.</p>

            <p>Magic Round sees the Warriors square off against the Panthers again, a tough assignment that also somehow counts as a home game. They certainly will have plenty of support in Brisbane and will need it, as it caps off a three-game stretch away from Mt Smart against tough opponents. Fair to say that by the end of the month, we'll have a good idea of whether this really is the Warriors' year.</p>

            <p>The biggest fight of the year happens in Riyadh on 18 May after being delayed from an original date in March, when Tyson Fury puts his lineal world heavyweight championship on the line against Oleksandr Usyk. The Ukranian currently holds the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO titles, so the winner will walk away as the first undisputed champion of the world since Lennox Lewis. This will be massive, not only in hype but also money - the fighters will be splitting a purse rumoured to be over $150 million. Someone else cashing in is Kiwi cruiserweight David Nyika, who will be fighting German Michael Seitz on the preliminary card.</p>

            <p>Light heavyweight Carlos Ulberg will be looking to improve his 10-1 record when he headlines UFC Fight Night against Alonzo Menifield on 12 May. It's the first time the Aucklander has been back in the octagon since September of last year, after a frustrating period that saw two fights cancelled due to his opponents getting injured. Menifield comes in with a 15-3-1 record and a five-fight win streak.</p>

            <p>Will Red Bull finally let Liam Lawson back into the driver's seat? The Kiwi hasn't had a look in so far this season, making his feelings known publicly about potentially shifting teams and causing everyone's attention to be on every little slip up that Daniel Ricciardo makes. Yuki Tsunoda is currently occupying the other V-CARB seat and has finished in the top 10 twice this season, but both he and Ricciardo both retired from the latest race in Shanghai. Lawson will be desperate to get a drive in Miami, Imola and the iconic Monaco races coming up this month.</p>
