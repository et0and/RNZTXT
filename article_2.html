            <p>A small business which worked on school lunch provider Libelle Group's production line equipment said it was "blindsided" by the provider going into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>A report by liquidators' Robert Campbell and David Webb of Deloitte on Tuesday found Libelle Group owed more than $14 million to 248 creditors.</p>
        
            <p>One of them is the Hamilton company Echo Automation, whose owner Sean Donovan told Checkpoint Libelle Group owed them about $15,000.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything's pretty tough right now, but it's just another spanner in the works, isn't it?" he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you work that on about a 15 percent return, that's about $100,000 we've got to make before we start making any profit again."</p>
        
            <p>Donovan said it was a lot of money for a small business to lose.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll struggle, but yeah, we'll figure something out.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a big hit. I'm not going to lie about that. It's going to hurt."</p>
        
            <p>Donovan said the first he heard about the liquidation was through the news.</p>
        
            <p>He said communication with Libelle was really good at the start, but had slowly changed.</p>
        
            <p>"The email stopped getting answered, and then the account's phone number was disconnected, and then we were starting to think, 'Well, what's going on here?' So then we started emailing a few more people, and then we saw the news."</p>
        
            <p>Donovan said Echo Automation had made machines that put the meals in the trays, sealed them up, and boxed them away.</p>
        
            <p>"They would often break down, and different parts of them broke down over time, and instead of fixing them or adjusting them - coming up with a different approach - they would quite often just remove that machine and somebody would turn up with a spoon instead."</p>
        
            <p>Donovan said he had seen staff spooning meals manually into containers.</p>
        
            <p>"They had equipment designed to do it, but there was issues with getting it working properly, and I think going manual was the easiest solution for them."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Libelle Group's liquidators' said they could not comment on what had happened prior to their involvement until their review of the business was complete.</p>
        
            <p>They said they were working with suppliers and creditors to identify how many there were and what they were owed.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has also contacted Libelle Group directly for comment.</p>
