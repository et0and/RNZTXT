            <p>Last year saw the highest number of civilian casualties killed or injured by explosives in more than a decade, according to new research.</p>
        
            <p>The UK-based charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) recorded a 122 percent increase in civilian fatalities caused by explosives in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The rise is largely due to the war being fought between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia also contributed.</p>
        
            <p>Research by the London-based charity is used by international forums such as the UN. It has also presented its evidence to the UK's Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, AOAV identified at least 7307 explosive incidents around the globe, up from 4322 recorded the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>The attacks caused the deaths of at least 15,305 civilians, accounting for a rise of 122 percent from 2022. Tens of thousands more were injured.</p>
        
            <p>AOAV describes Israel's war in Gaza as "a major cause for such a dramatic increase" in civilian casualties, accounting for around one third of the global total.</p>
        
            <p>It recorded 920 incidents of explosive weapons use in Gaza, resulting in 9334 people being killed. That is lower than other estimates.</p>
        
            <p>AOAV says its data does not capture all harm, but does highlight clear trends in explosive violence. It says the data includes reports from reputable media organisations.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military operation, which began on 7 October in response to the Hamas attacks, also contributed to a huge increase in the number of air strikes recorded, the charity said.</p>
        
            <p>AOAV says the use of air-launched weapons across the globe increased by 226 percent in 2023 - rising from 519 incidents in 2022 to 1694 last year.</p>
        
            <p>Israel has repeatedly stated it has taken unprecedented steps to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing warnings in advance of air strikes.</p>
        
            <p>But AOAV's research shows that when explosive weapons are used in populated areas, the vast majority of those injured are likely to be civilians.</p>
        
            <p>AOAV's director, Iain Overton, says its data should be a stark warning to states that using explosive weapons in urban areas disproportionately impacts civilians.</p>
        
            <p>The charity also recorded a significant increase in the use of ground-launched weapons in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Across the globe, state actors were responsible for 77 percent of the civilian casualties caused by explosives.</p>
        
            <p>AOAV says Israel "was by far the most injurious state actor in 2023", with more than 1000 attacks leading to 12,950 civilian casualties - dead and injured.</p>
        
            <p>Russia was second, with its war in Ukraine causing 8351 civilian casualties.</p>
        
            <p>Ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Myanmar, Syria and Somalia also contributed to the highest civilian casualties recorded by AOAV since 2010.</p>
        
            <p>Non-state actors, including militants and proscribed groups, were also behind the increase in the use of explosive weapons last year. However, AOAV recorded the number of civilians killed by non-state actors as falling by 8 percent.</p>
