            <p>The sickening images being shared among people in Hainault capture in unforgiving detail the horror which unfolded on Tuesday (local time).</p>
        
            <p>As panic spread around this corner of north-east London, some did the only thing they felt they could: took out their phones and captured the attack as it happened.</p>
        
            <p>One video shows what appears to be a body in the street.</p>
        
            <p>The stunned resident filming can be heard shrieking, swearing and then saying these unimaginable words: "He just killed that boy. He just killed him right outside my house."</p>
        
            <p>It is hard to take in what people here have seen - and I am told that video has been circulated on Instagram amongst local school children.</p>
        
            <p>The people of Hainault are still processing how a quiet, sunny spring morning descended into bloody panic.</p>
        
            <p>By the end of it, a 14-year-old boy was dead, and four other people were in hospital.</p>

            <p>The attacker was seen looking into people's homes and clambering into gardens as he marauded around the area.</p>
        
            <p>One woman described her fear as she hid from him.</p>
        
            <p>She said: "We were very scared and trying to hide and not show ourselves through the window, because he was standing right next to our house.</p>
        
            <p>"He could have seen us if he looked up."</p>
        
            <p>The shock and sadness of residents here has been palpable all day.</p>
        
            <p>In the hours between the attack ending and police confirming the death of the child, Alisha Khan spoke to us from her doorstep - close to where police had blocked off roads next to the town's Underground station.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing like that ever happens here," she said, before opening up about how she feared for her traumatised young daughter who woke to the sight of police swarming their neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>The first residents knew of the attack was when a car "smashed into a house", as one person who lived opposite put it.</p>
        
            <p>Eyewitness James Fernando, 39, said the attacker approached his female neighbour and asked her to "take the telephone from him to tell whoever was on the phone his location".</p>
        
            <p>Realising something was not right, she started running away as he "pulled a samurai sword from the back of his trousers".</p>

            <p>Fernando said the woman then shouted out to a "boy who was on his way to school".</p>
        
            <p>The attacker struck the boy and then continued to prowl the streets "with the sword in his hand looking for victims", Fernando said.</p>
        
            <p>Another eyewitness, Manpreet Singh, said he walked out of his office to see "chaos" on the other side of the road as passers-by tried to contain the attacker.</p>
        
            <p>He told the BBC: "I saw a group of people, five or six of them, trying to fight off a guy - he had a sword in his hand."</p>
        
            <p>Singh said one of those involved in the effort was stabbed, as the others tried to call the police and ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>The attacker fled and tried to enter a home but could not get the door to open.</p>
        
            <p>David Maguire was on his way to the station when he saw an injured person with blood covering his hands.</p>
        
            <p>He said: "With everyone rushing towards you, you don't know who to trust in that situation. You don't know who has got the knife, who hasn't got the knife.</p>
        
            <p>"It turns out it was a lone person 50 yards up from where I was ... Two minutes earlier, it could have been me."</p>
        
            <p>As the police pursued the 36-year-old suspect, they were heard shouting at him to "drop the sword" but their warnings were ignored.</p>

            <p>They pursued the suspect as he climbed onto a garage roof and into someone's garden.</p>
        
            <p>A police officer can be heard desperately screaming out "lock your doors, everyone lock your doors".</p>
        
            <p>The attack was brought to an end when the man was Tasered in a garden.</p>
        
            <p>Footage from a doorbell camera captures the moment the suspect was finally cornered and forced back against a front door, before being pinned down.</p>
        
            <p>We spoke to a person outside whose home the rampage came to an end.</p>
        
            <p>He said: "He went into that driveway and he was being Tasered, being told to stop, then he jumped into that other neighbour's driveway there.</p>
        
            <p>"He was being Tasered, went to the floor with all the armed police officers around and he was subdued there for half an hour."</p>
        
            <p>Four people - two of whom are police officers - are still in hospital being treated for their wounds.</p>
        
            <p>The carnage played out over just 22 minutes - but it will take far longer than that for the people of Hainault to comprehend what they have seen.</p>
