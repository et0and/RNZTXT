        <p>
The property market is in an "arm wrestle", a developer says, with three quarters of Kiwis locked out by high interest rates. Audio

            <p>An Auckland property developer is offering cashback deals of up to $20,000 in a bid to move unsold apartments in a multimillion-dollar development.</p>
        
            <p>There are about 40 unsold apartments in Ockham's 210-unit Maanaki apartment block in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>One-bedroom apartments in the development start at around $670,000, with those buyers eligible for $10,000 cash back.</p>
        
            <p>The cheapest three-bedroom apartment is about $895,000, with buyers eligible for $20,000 cash back.</p>
        
            <p>Ockham Residential co-founder Mark Todd told Checkpoint the property market had been an "arm wrestle" since the end of 2021, with sales down right across the sector.</p>
        
            <p>"Three quarters of New Zealanders or more cannot really afford housing with the current interest rates," he said.</p>
        
            <p>While the costs for developers were no longer rising, they were not falling either, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't build new houses for anything less than what they're worth now, people can't afford them, that's why we're seeing low sales volumes. So what we're actually doing is showing a bit of manaaki, generosity of spirit."</p>
        
            <p>Ockham was also keen to sell the last Manaaki apartments to "free up" capital for its next developments, Todd told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"If we have to we could sit on them for three years and lease them out, but it's much more productive for us to build more apartment blocks."</p>

            <p>Todd said he was offering cashback deals instead of simply lowering the ticket price so he could "protect the value" of the apartments for Manaaki's 170 existing owners.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he would be offering retrospective cashback deals to those owners, he said he would not.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't go back through in time. Everyone's got to play their chips on the board," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're the ones that borrowed $80-odd million and had $30-odd million of equity in that development to get it built. Everyone took a certain risk profile."</p>
        
            <p>The sales of those 170 apartments were settled two months ago without any problems, Todd said.</p>
        
            <p>"What I would say is the purchasers from three years ago bought at lower prices, the price went up and now it's come down again and it's worth roughly what it was."</p>
