            <p>Holiday-makers heading home from holidays and a handful of crashes have slowed traffic in Waikato, Wellington and at the Homer Tunnel to Milford Sound.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 3 is closed near Mokoia Road following a crash. The two-vehicle crash was reported at 5.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>Initial indications are that there are serious injuries, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Diversions are in place, at Gladstone Road in Hawera and Whakamara Road just south of Mokoia.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was told just after 4pm on Sunday that a crash north of Wellington had caused traffic to back up along State Highway 1, at Raumati Beach, with a recommendation to divert through Paraparaumu and Waikanae on the old highway.</p>
        
            <p>A two-car crash on State Highway 94 in Fiordland was reported to emergency services about 3:45pm on Sunday, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>And as a result, the Homer Tunnel was blocked. It is the only road in and out of Milford Sound.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services are responding to the incident, and "initial indications suggest there are injuries," police said.</p>
        
            <p>St Johns told RNZ early indications were people have been injured, their status ranging from moderate to serious.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers should expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Sunday, police said Waikato traffic was being impacted by two crashes.</p>
        
            <p>The first, a two-car crash on State Highway 1 and Maungatautari Road at Karapiro, was reported to police at 11.35am.</p>
        
            <p>And another two-car crash not far away, at the intersection of State Highway 29 and Totman Road, reported to police at 12.40pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It was not thought that anyone had been injured badly in either, but police said they had slowed traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities have urged drivers to take it easy on the roads this summer, to make sure they reach their destinations safely.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said people should be patient, and use their online Journey Planner tool, to see where traffic was building up, and find alternative routes.</p>
        
            <p>This summer, the provisional holiday road toll counted 13 people who died between 24 December and 3 January. While the provisional road toll for all of 2024 was 291 deaths, the lowest in ten years.</p>
