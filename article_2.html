        <h2>Wild horse lovers hustle to find homes for herd</h2>
        <p>
After last year's muster was cancelled, nearly half the herd is looking for homes - and they are running out of time.

            <p>Advocates are desperately seeking hundreds of homes for wild Kaimanawa horses before their muster in a few weeks' time.</p>
        
            <p>The horses - descended from ponies released by early European settlers - have roamed the Waiouru Military Training area in the central North Island since the 1800s.</p>
        
            <p>They are mustered annually to keep the herd at a maximum of 300 animals and protect the native plants that are unique to the area.</p>
        
            <p>Mustered horses are then available for adoption by experienced horse owners.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's muster was cancelled due to Cyclone Gabrielle, so this year, 230 horses will be seeking homes after the round-up on 25 April.</p>
        
            <p>However, only 14 people have applied, according to the charity Kaimanawa Heritage Horses.</p>
        
            <p>"This year it is proving to be a very difficult time to find homes that can provide the care needed for a wild horse, although we are still hopeful that many horses will successfully be rehomed and this is what we are working hard to achieve," the charity said in a Facebook post.</p>
        
            <p>"Our purpose is to place horses in homes where they will be most likely to be successfully tamed and cared for by knowledgeable owners."</p>

            <p>An aerial survey carried out last month by the Department of Conservation (DOC) showed the herd had increased to nearly double the recommended number of horses for the area.</p>
        
            <p>"The large herd means damage to the environment, and the wild horses outstripping their food supply," DOC central plateau operations manager Dave Conley said.</p>
        
            <p>"A herd this size also increases the risk of horses wandering towards the Desert Road and becoming a hazard for drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"The need for the muster is clear, we just hope we can find plenty of good homes for the horses."</p>
        
            <p>Kaimanawa Heritage Horses chair Carolyn Haigh encouraged people to contact the charity as soon as possible. Its welfare team would provide more information about the rehoming process, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Those interested would also need to complete a property check.</p>
        
            <p>"With not long until applications close, there's not a lot of time for interested parties to deliberate," Haigh said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a real concern that some people may simply run out of time."</p>
        
            <p>The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation lists Kaimanawa horses as a group with special genetic value, comparable to the mustangs of the western United States and wild zebras.</p>
        
            <p>The herd grew to greater prominence in 2015 with the release of the Wilson sisters' TV show Keeping Up with the Kaimanawas.</p>
        
            <p>Released in 2015, the show followed the trio - Vicki, Kelly and Amanda - as they attempted to tame some of the wild horses and turn them into show jumpers.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2022, contraceptive injections have been given to some Kaimanawa horses in hopes of keeping their numbers low and taking some of the pressure off the rehoming programme.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone interested in adopting one of the horses can contact Kaimanawa Heritage Horses at muster@kaimanawaheritagehorses.org or visit https://kaimanawaheritagehorses.org/muster-information/.</p>
