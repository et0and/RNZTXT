            <p>A Jewish community centre in Auckland has been vandalised, with graffiti sprayed on the fence and apparent fires attempted.</p>
        
            <p>The fence, which is at the back of Beth Shalom, the Auckland Congregation for Progressive Judaism, in Epsom was sprayed with the words Gaza, save the children, ceasefire and 'f..' on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Behind the fence is a building that until earlier this year was the home of Jewish youth group Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff understands the site was targeted because on Google it is listed as the Consulate of Israel, which it no longer is.</p>
        
            <p>The words 'Free Gaza' are also spray-painted on the concrete outside a nearby empty lot.</p>
        
            <p>The Embassy of Israel has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called out to the site late on Tuesday night and returned on Wednesday morning around 10am.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment.</p>

            <p>New Zealand Jewish Council spokeswoman Juliet Moses said the attack is part of an "escalating pattern" of incidents towards Jewish and Israeli communities since Hamas attacked Israeli towns and kibbutzim on 7 October.</p>
        
            <p>Hamas killed around 1400 Israelis in the overnight attack, that included livestreaming attacks on the victims' phones, and took around 240 hostages into Gaza. Four have been released and one rescued.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, Israel launched a war against Hamas, whose official spokespeople have repeatedly told media and the public they intend to repeat the attacks.</p>
        
            <p>In the month since the war began, Palestinian officials say over 10,000 Gazans have been killed in near constant military bombardments by Israel.</p>
        
            <p>"It's of course completely legitimate to protest against Israel, but it's unlawful to attempt to set a fire and deface a property," Moses said.</p>
        
            <p>"As we've been saying repeatedly, we're in a very highly charged environment now where there has been a lot of inflammatory rhetoric coming from politicians and people with large platforms.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't pin this on anyone in particular or on any event but this is part of an escalating pattern where we've seen other graffiti, death threats, businesses targeted, a lot of online abuse... It's all part of that ratcheting up of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic manifestations."</p>
        
            <p>Epsom electorate MP and ACT leader David Seymour said he was driving home when he came across the fire late on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Petrol poured on the road had led to a fairly large fire, and neighbours alerted emergency services, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It appears to be a hate-motivated crime and obviously, it's very disturbing," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>He said while New Zealand politicians can't control what happens in Israel or in Gaza as the war continues, they can respond to what happens locally.</p>
        
            <p>He said politicians should be urging people to prioritise peace and respect amongst each other in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is not alone in seeing Jewish communities targeted after the Hamas-Israel war broke out.</p>
        
            <p>The Guardian reports France has had 257 anti-Semitic attacks in the Paris region alone since 7 October, and 90 arrests made, according to the Paris police chief Laurent Nunez.</p>
        
            <p>There are over 500,000 Jews in France. It's the largest Jewish population in Europe and the third biggest globally.</p>
