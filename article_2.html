            <p>Foodstuffs North Island has been hit with a $3.25 million fine for deliberate and serious blocking of competitors.</p>
        
            <p>A High Court judge ruled the supermarket company, which runs the chains New World and Pak N Save, deliberately used covenants on land to hinder rivals.</p>
        
            <p>The practice came to light in a Commerce Commission market study in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Paul James Radich said the practice was to hinder rivals opening in three locations - Newtown and Petone in Wellington and Tamatea in South Napier.</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission said the penalty shows the seriousness of the conduct.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
