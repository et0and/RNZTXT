            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman's sentencing has been delayed until Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old appeared in the Auckland District Court this afternoon to be sentenced for shoplifting for which she ealier entered guilty pleas.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Jelas had allowed Ghahraman to sit in the public gallery for the sentencing, saying she would not be receiving a custodial sentence.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock contested Ghahraman's mental health being a direct cause of her shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock said the mental health report submitted indicates there is a possibility of a link between Gharaman's undiagnosed PTSD and the offending.</p>
        
            <p>But McClintock said the link is tenuous and tempers the extent to which this can be used to lower her culpability.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock put Ghahraman's culpability at medium to high gravity of offending.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's lawyer Annabel Cresswell asked for a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's early acceptance of responsibility, show of remorse, and low likelihood of re-offending should be considered in sentencing, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Sentencing was reserved til Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman earlier admitted four shoplifting charges relating to the theft of thousands of dollars' worth of clothing when she appeared in the Auckland District Court in March.</p>
        
            <p>She had resigned as an MP earlier in the year after the charges came to light.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement in January, Ghahraman said stress relating to her work had led her to "act in ways that are completely out of character".</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The former politician was charged with stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx Store on 22 October, 2023 and a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue in Newmarket on 22 December.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with two counts of shoplifting from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby - $5773 of items on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods on 23 December.</p>
