            <p>For the first time in its 14-year history, Massey University's Quote of the Year competition has been won by an animal.</p>
        
            <p>The honours in 2024 went to a stolen six-year-old cockatoo who blurted out "hello darling" when she was found.</p>
        
            <p>Pepper was stolen from her Staglands Wildlife Reserve aviary on 17 November, and recovered a week later. Police were were able to confirm her identity when she squawked her catchphrase excitedly when Staglands staff arrived to pick her up.</p>

            <p>"This is the first time in the 14 years of the competition that a bird - in fact, a non-human - has won the popular vote," Massey said in a statement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It turned out Pepper had been purchased - and the new 'owners' only realised they had bought her when the story of her birdnapping aired on 1 News.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's boast of being "wealthy" and "sorted" financially came in second.</p>
        
            <p>Previous winners in the annual competition include Chris Hipkins' "spread your legs" (later turned into a mug), Simon Bridges' "Paula Benefit" gaffe and David Seymour's jibe about a former finance minister and lamingtons: "I would have thought that Grant Robertson would be a much bigger threat to lamingtons than lamingtons would be a threat to Grant Robertson."</p>
        
            <p>Three Cyclone Gabrielle heroes won it last year.</p>
        
            <p>According to Massey, these were the top 10 quotes of the year.</p>
