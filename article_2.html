Ahead of a critical press conference, the US President made another serious gaffe on stage. Video

            <p>US President Joe Biden has made another serious on-stage gaffe, introducing Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky as "President Putin" at NATO.</p>
        
            <p>Biden is set to hold his first solo press conference since November 2023, amid growing calls for him to end his reelection bid.</p>
        
            <p>The 81-year-old has been under pressure to make way for someone younger to represent the Democratic Party in the upcoming presidential election, after a shambolic debate performance last month.</p>
        
            <p>Biden - who defeated presumptive Republican candidate and incumbent Donald Trump in 2020 - has refused to budge, saying he is the best-qualified to beat the convicted fraudster in November.</p>
        
            <p>But there are concerns his cognitive abilities have slipped over the past few years.</p>
        
            <p>The latest faux pas happened at the NATO summit in Washington DC on Friday (NZ time) when he accidentally referred to Volodymyr Zelensky as "President Putin" - mixing up the Ukrainian president with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered his country's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.</p>

            <p>Biden made the mistake on stage in front of audibly shocked delegates, BBC News reported. He stepped away from the microphone before realising his mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"President Putin? He's going to beat President Putin," he said. "President Zelensky. I'm so worried about beating Putin, we've got to worry about it. Anyway."</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky took it in stride, walking up to the microphone and saying, "I'm better."</p>
        
            <p>Biden replied, "You are a hell of a lot better."</p>
