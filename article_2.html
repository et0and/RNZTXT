            <p>Burying a toad in a pot was once a sure-fire way to guarantee a happy new year and a good harvest.</p>
        
            <p>Or, so the ancients thought.</p>
        
            <p>Resolutions and rituals to secure a prosperous new year have a history stretching back at least 4000 years.</p>
        
            <p>But they started out very differently from modern resolutions, which most of us will set this January.</p>
        
            <p>The Babylonians were the first known people to come up with good intentions for the new year.</p>
        
            <p>That was when the year began in mid-March, around the time that new crops were being planted.</p>
        
            <p>The practice of celebrating the start of the year in March continued with the Romans - and still to this day for some communities in the Mediterranean region.</p>
        
            <p>"The Romans made what we call - or could translate as - 'vows' on New Year," says Tamara Lewit, a Roman wine and oil historian at the University of Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"But that meaning was a little bit different from what we think of as resolutions.</p>
        
            <p>"At the time, the view of the future wasn't the same kind of science-based view that we might have.</p>
        
            <p>"They saw their world as determined by deities, by gods and goddesses, or spirits, or even magic spells."</p>
        
            <p>New year vows were pledges made to please the gods in return for a good year and a good harvest, Lewit says.</p>
        
            <p>Spells, such as "abracadabra", were invoked to bring good health, while farmers who wanted to protect crops from diseases or bad weather would bury a toad in a pot in the field.</p>
        
            <p>Husbands and wives were legally allowed to exchange gifts - the only time of year when this wasn't forbidden - and pregnant women would literally let their hair down on visits to temples for the goddess Juno.</p>
        
            <p>"But the most quirky thing which the Romans did on this festival in March was a role reversal between slaves and slave owners," Lewit says.</p>
        
            <p>"Women served a meal to their household slaves, instead of the slave serving the slave owners."</p>
        
            <p>The first day of January would later become the beginning of the Roman year and was cemented in modern times with the Gregorian calendar of the 16th century.</p>
        
            <p>Modern resolutions have been around for at least 200 years and were common enough by the 19th century to become the butt of satirical jokes.</p>
        
            <p>Now, our resolutions are promises to ourselves for self-improvement, which may make them all the harder to keep.</p>
        
            <p>Eating healthier, exercising more and losing weight are the top goals of most Australians, according to an annual Finder consumer survey.</p>
        
            <p>About 10 percent of all respondents said they planned to quit smoking, vaping or gambling in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>And zero baby boomers vowed to quit drinking, compared to 5 percent of gen Z respondents.</p>
        
            <p>So, would the Romans have vowed to eat better or drink less alcohol in the new year?</p>
        
            <p>"That's a very modern type of resolution," Lewit says.</p>
        
            <p>"Wine was absolutely essential to the diet in the ancient world … because wine was safer to drink than water.</p>
        
            <p>"Wine was not only essential for drinking, but it was an absolutely fundamental religious ritual.</p>
        
            <p>"The main offering that you would make to a deity in a festival, whether it was new year or any other kind of festival was … offerings to the wine god."</p>
