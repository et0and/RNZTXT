            <p>Opposition parties are joining forces to stop "dangerous changes" to early childhood education (ECE), as the government welcomes submissions on regulation for the sector.</p>
        
            <p>The government launched the sector-wide review of ECE regulation last month.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first such review carried out by ACT leader David Seymour's Ministry for Regulation.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori said it was being rushed through, with a bill to be proposed in October.</p>
        
            <p>They said it would "negatively affect our youngest tamariki" and they were joining forces, along with the NZEI education union, to hold a series of public hearings.</p>
        
            <p>"There is widespread concern that the Coalition Government's review will take education for our children backwards," Labour's Education spokesperson Jan Tinetti said. "That is why as an opposition we are uniting to stop the Government's potentially disastrous changes. Together we will hear from affected parents, whānau, teachers, and community members on the changes we actually need."</p>
        
            <p>Green Education spokesperson Teanau Tuiono said ECE needed better teacher-to-child ratios, with teachers who were trained and qualified and decently paid.</p>
        
            <p>"This review is not about solving these real issues, but instead it's about pushing through changes to allow big businesses to cut costs and drive down employment conditions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori education spokesperson Tākuta Ferris said if the government was really interested in hearing from the public it would allow more than six weeks of consultation.</p>
        
            <p>"This government does not intend to meaningfully consult anyone, so we must contest their agenda," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In his own statement shortly after, Seymour said the government had received more than 740 submissions in the first 20 days of the review, and he was asking the ministry to extend the submission period by a further two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"From the conversations I've been having, I know people are keen to have a bit more time to have their say," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Parents are saying they want more types of early childhood education, easier access, and more affordable options. Some parents also want fewer children per teacher.</p>
        
            <p>"Teachers have said they would like to spend less time on compliance-based paperwork that does not benefit the children's learning or care. They have also said they want a limit on group sizes, and fewer children per adult. Providers are saying they are experiencing regulatory requirements being inconsistently applied, and there seems to be lack of clarity between what is a regulatory requirement and what is guidance."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was telling that "no stakeholders think the current regulatory system is working", and encouraged everyone who was interested to have their say before the end of August.</p>
