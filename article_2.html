            <p>The Department of Conservation is calling on dog owners - and "all organisations involved" - to lift their game after a spate of kiwi killings in one small area of the Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend, RNZ revealed nine kiwi had died at Wharengaere Bay on the Purerua Peninsula since late January, with most showing injuries consistent with dog attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Four of the strictly protected birds died in just three days, between 6 and 8 March.</p>
        
            <p>DOC Bay of Islands operations manager Bronwyn Bauer-Hunt said the deaths were "devastating".</p>
        
            <p>"This situation needs urgent action. Kiwi are a taonga species found only in Aotearoa, and if they disappear from here, they're gone forever. Dog owners and all organisations involved must take their responsibilities seriously," she said.</p>

            <p>Bauer-Hunt said DOC rangers met Far North District Council staff last month to discuss roaming dogs at Wharengaere Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Dog Control Act, only the council had the authority to enter private property and seize dogs suspected of attacking kiwi, she said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands conservation groups have lodged complaints with the council about dogs roaming in the area since mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>They had also captured trail-cam footage identifying specific wandering dogs.</p>
        
            <p>However, the council earlier told RNZ it had received reports of the nine kiwi deaths, but DOC had not been able to attribute the killings to particular dogs.</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt said DOC had been working closely with Kiwi Coast, a community-led conservation initiative, to examine the kiwi, collect DNA samples where possible, and record details of each case.</p>
        
            <p>All kiwi in good enough condition would undergo a post-mortem examination to determine the cause of death.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the carcasses were also being tested for canine DNA.</p>

            <p>Bauer-Hunt urged people living in kiwi zones to keep their dogs under control at all times, but especially at night.</p>
        
            <p>She said anyone with information about uncontrolled dogs in the Far North should call the council on 0800 920 029 or DOC on 0800 DOC HOT.</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first spate of kiwi deaths at Wharengaere Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The deaths of six birds in 2019 led to a rare prosecution and the destruction of a dog.</p>
        
            <p>The owner was convicted and ordered to pay $300 in reparations.</p>
