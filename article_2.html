            <p>US President Donald Trump says he might meet Russian President Vladimir Putin this month and dismissed Ukraine's concern about being left out of US-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the Ukraine war.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably," Trump said as he ended a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach when asked if he still expected to meet with Putin before the end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>Briefing reporters on US-Russian talks in Riyadh earlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the two sides did not establish a date for a Trump-Putin summit to discuss Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Trump spoke for the first time since a US delegation established a working dialogue with Russia about Ukraine during talks in Riyadh earlier in the day.</p>
        
            <p>He brushed aside Ukraine's concern about being left out of the meeting, saying Kyiv could have made a deal with Russia three years ago to avert the invasion by Moscow.</p>
        
            <p>"Today I heard, 'oh, we weren't invited.' Well you've been there for three years, you should have ended it... you should have never started it. You could have made a deal," said Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Sean Savett, who was spokesperson for the White House National Security Council under former President Joe Biden, said in a social media post that Russia started the war.</p>
        
            <p>"Sounds like Trump bought Putin's propaganda hook, line, and sinker," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A reminder no one should need: Putin started the war by invading Ukraine unprovoked and his forces have committed war crimes against the Ukrainian people. Russia is the party responsible for this war continuing."</p>

            <p>Trump blasted Biden for his handling of Ukraine. Biden had worked to ensure Ukraine had the weapons to try to fight off the Russian invaders.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I have the power to end this war," said Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Trump also said Ukraine should hold elections.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not a Russia thing, that's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Trump said he would not oppose Europeans if they want to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>European leaders have discussed sending peacekeepers to provide security guarantees in the event of a peace deal.</p>
        
            <p>"Having troops over there would be fine, I wouldn't object to it at all," Trump said.</p>
