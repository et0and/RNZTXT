            <p>Hawke's Bay Civil Defence group controller Ian MacDonald says Wairoa is the biggest concern in the area right now.</p>
        
            <p>State of emergencies have been declared in the Heretaunga Ward in Hastings and Wairoa, due to the potential risk to lives and properties.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 2 connecting Napier to Wairoa is closed due to slips and about 90 people have been evacuated. A slip on State Highway 38 earlier closed the road but it has since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald said flooding threats to the substation meant the south of Wairoa was without power.</p>
        
            <p>The big issue was the sea large swells were preventing the rain from being able to get out the rivermouth, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The water is backing up towards the town, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He expected further evacuations on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Mayor Craig Little said he spoke to the local supermarket operator and had been assured supplies would be able to get into the region.</p>
