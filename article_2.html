            <p>The infamous over-the-suit T-shirt worn by the prime minister at a Parliament barbecue has gone on sale to raise funds for children living in poverty, in a TradeMe auction.</p>
        
            <p>The black National Lamb Day T-shirt shirt raised eyebrows earlier this week when Christopher Luxon posted a video of himself wearing it pulled on over a dark blue suit with shirt collars sticking up.</p>
        
            <p>The video was spotted and called out in a tweet by Canadian fashion writer Derek Guy, known as 'the menswear guy'.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1.5 million people saw the critique, with replies varying from support for the PM's fashion flare - "Bbq sauce protection" and "it's kinda cool looking", to revulsion, and various claims Luxon should go before a court for the crime.</p>
        
            <p>are you wearing a t-shirt over a suit jacket?? https://t.co/8xumZmWST2</p>
        
            <p>After which, Luxon posted a tongue in cheek reboot T-shirt-over-suit video - talking candidly about his reflections on the "scandal" - this time wearing a white T-shirt printed with the phrase: "Economic growth - more money in your back pocket".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was making no apologies for the ensemble, but also admitted to "kinda agreeing" with those who said it was a fashion crime.</p>
        
            <p>Guy came back to the party, firing with: "Is that a shift dress over a suit jacket?", and "Prime Minister of New Zealand looking like the fifth member of Dem Franchize Boyz".</p>
        
            <p>is that a shift dress over a suit jacket?? https://t.co/t2Onmju6ac</p>
        
            <p>Now, the original Lamb Day T-shirt, signed by Luxon, is being sold off by Beef and Lamb NZ to raise funds for charity KidsCan - a charity that helps provide food, clothes and basic necessities for Kiwi children living in poverty:</p>
        
            <p>"Compared to everything from Friends' Joey Tribbiani to high-fashion runway looks, this one-of-a-kind piece is now up for auction ... A unique chance to own a piece of political fashion history while supporting a good cause," the auction listing reads.</p>
        
            <p>National Lamb Day committee member and Ag Proud chairman Jo Pemberton said the publicity from the PM's had been "fantastic" for raising the profile of National Lamb Day: "Fashion and farming don't often collide, but you take your wins when you can. We hope this will raise a little smile and a lot of money for a great cause."</p>
        
            <p>By mid-afternoon Saturday, the auction had reached $600.</p>
        
            <p>Interestingly, Luxon was not the only international politician to be dragged by Guy for his fashion choices - with the Canadian also drubbing the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth for standing out by wearing a blue suit in a formal photo of black-suit wearing international representatives at his first visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels.</p>
