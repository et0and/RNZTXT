            <p>RNZ understands repairs will continue into the night after in an attempt to get thousands of homes and businesses in the Kaipara District back online.</p>
        
            <p>A Spark spokeswoman said the damaged fibre-optic cable contained a mixture of Spark and Chorus cables, leading to broadband outages across multiple providers.</p>
        
            <p>She said Chorus technicians were on site and making progress on repairs. As of 6pm one of the damaged cables had been repaired.</p>
        
            <p>The spokeswoman said broadband customers could make use of Spark's outage assist service, which offered free mobile data while fibre connections were down.</p>
        
            <p>A Northpower spokesperson said the cable supplied broadband to all customers in Dargaville, Ruawai, Paparoa and Maungaturoto.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2070 customers were affected, with many businesses forced to close or switch to cash-only transactions.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower said the damage was caused by a digger pulling up the main fibre cable.</p>
        
            <p>Dargaville resident Rose Dixon said there were huge queues at the town's supermarket because Eftpos was down and customers without sufficient cash had to fill in credit notes instead.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands repairs to the cable will continue into the night. There is currently no estimate for the restoration time.</p>
        
            <p>Chorus could not be contacted for comment.</p>
