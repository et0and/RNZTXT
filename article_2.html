            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has told The Spinoff, she does not think Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is a "nice person" in the wake of his comments about Wellington's councils.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Luxon called the fact the Wellington region had not put forward a city or regional deal "lame".</p>
        
            <p>"Well it's pretty lame-o is my view of it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Here we have a government doing everything it can to make sure that we attract capital to this country which has been a problem for a long period of time and you can't even get Wellington councils to submit a regional or a city deal."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau told RNZ the comments were "poor form" and the councils were sticking to their timeline to get it right.</p>
        
            <p>She said that Wellington City Council Crown observer Lindsay McKenzie provided an update to council officers on 24 February that noted that the Wellington region's current priority was water reform.</p>
        
            <p>"As such, our Wellington councils are rightly focused on water reform first and we will work towards a comprehensive and meaningful regional deal in due course. We're not going to waste our time chasing the mirage of a short-term regional deal.</p>
        
            <p>"With due respect, Prime Minister, we will deliver a deal, it will just be on our timeline. We are determined to get this right."</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with The Spinoff, published on Friday, Whanau said Luxon targeted the capital because "Wellington didn't vote for him".</p>
        
            <p>"Wellington is a Green city, and they've been picking on us since the beginning," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She told The Spinoff she acknowledged the conflict could benefit her politically.</p>
        
            <p>"It works for me because a lot of people in Wellington don't like him."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached the Prime Minister's office for comment.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, Whanau said she felt it was important to speak out and address unfair criticism of the city.</p>
        
            <p>"All we're seeking is fairness. Wellington region was singled out for not submitting a proposal for a regional deal and subjected to name-calling.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt it was pretty unfair."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said she would not be pressured into submitting a "half-baked" proposal to meet a deadline.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus remains on the essential water infrastructure our city needs."</p>
