            <p>Police have named the mystery woman found dead in Auckland's Gulf Harbour seven months ago as Shulai Wang, 70, of China.</p>
        
            <p>Her remains were found inside a bag, pulled out of the sea by a fisherman on 12 March.</p>
        
            <p>Kaixiao Liu, 36, and Lanyue Xiao, 36 have since been charged in relation to the homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>They were charged with offering an indignity to a dead human body after being stopped and arrested at the airport in early July.</p>
        
            <p>They have plead not guilty and are currently on bail.</p>

            <p>Videos of Kaixiao Liu singing what appears to be Christian worship music have been uploaded to YouTube in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>Extensive work had been done out to identify the victim, including officers going to China, acting Detective Inspector Tim Williams, of WaitematƒÅ CIB, said</p>
        
            <p>Wang came to New Zealand in August 2023 from China, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"She had no family in New Zealand and had not been reported missing,' he said.</p>

            <p>"Mrs Wang's family back in China have been advised of her death and we are working with them and international authorities to repatriate Mrs Wang and return her to her family</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation team has been working tirelessly in the months since the homicide investigation was launched to piece together who this victim was, and the events leading up to her death.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation into Wang's death was ongoing, police said.</p>
