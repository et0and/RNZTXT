            <p>Work to prevent widespread pollution from the sunken navy vessel Manawanui in Samoa will be scaled down during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting next week.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts to recover three containers from the ship that have ended up on the reef in the waters south of Upolu were due to get underway on Saturday, weather permitting.</p>
        
            <p>Two were empty and the other one had around three tonnes of food inside.</p>
        
            <p>They will be floated and towed to shore.</p>
