            <p>Ancient Greek athletes dined on dried figs, moist cheese and wheat to power their sporting pursuits.</p>
        
            <p>But US Olympian Ryan Crouser, the only three-time gold medal winning shot putter, eats a nine-egg burrito - and that's just for breakfast. He consumes more than 5000 calories a day, twice the recommended amount for a man his age (31). Crouser is 6ft 7in and weights about 145kgs.</p>

            <p>In 2019, he told The New York Times that he doesn't even like food anymore, having to eat five meals a day.</p>
        
            <p>"If I ever feel hungry during the day that means I'm not doing my job," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, I eat all the time. Sometimes before another meal I'll stare at it for a while, like, 'This again'."</p>
        
            <p>Can a regular person - a woman, five years younger, three times lighter - eat that nine egg breakfast burrito? Samantha Mythen gives it a try.</p>

            <p>I've bought eggs, sour cream, salsa, sausages, cheese, and wraps - it's expensive - just over $40. I whisk all the eggs in one bowl and make two omelettes with the mixture - I don't have a big enough pan for one big one.</p>
        
            <p>I cook two bacon maple sausages, I wonder if Crouser eats the whole half a dozen?</p>
        
            <p>Once the omelettes are cooked, I place a wrap in the pan, add one omelette, some cheese and spinach, wrap it up repeat.</p>
        
            <p>A dollop of spicy salsa and sour cream to finish off.</p>
        
            <p>It's a quick and easy to make, taking about 20 minutes all up.</p>
        
            <p>Crouser says he spends $USD1000 (NZ$1665) a month on food. He told GQ food is "almost a part of training for me."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm always trying to keep my body weight up. I was the taller, skinnier kid growing up, and it's always been a battle for me to gain weight."</p>
        
            <p>He's not the only Olympian bulker.</p>
        
            <p>Sprint gold medalist Usain Bolt said he ate 100 chicken McNuggets a day while competing during the Beijing Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>The most decorated Olympian Michael Phelps consumed as many as 10,000 calories a day - starting with his favourite breakfast of three fried egg, cheese and lettuce sandwiches, one omelette, a bowl of grits, three slices of sugared french toast and three choc chip pancakes.</p>

            <p>Crouser doesn't go three hours without eating but looking at the mighty meal in front of me, I think it might take me three hours to eat.</p>
        
            <p>It tasted delicious - thanks to the chef genes inherited from my mum. But I only managed half of one burrito and the two sausages. Fair to say, that was enough to have me feeling full for the next few hours. I could only fit in two pieces of fruit before dinner.</p>
        
            <p>I pondered about joining an Athletic Club to see if my baby giraffe limbs had suddenly become great at throwing things, but it was raining so maybe will consider again tomorrow.</p>
