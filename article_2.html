            <p>Two bodies have been found by the team searching for Sydney couple Luke Davies and Jesse Baird, police say.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb confirmed the discovery this afternoon after investigators established a crime scene at a second property at Bungonia, southwest of Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Webb said that was where the bodies were found.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is an important day in this investigation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This afternoon detectives attached to Strike Force Ashfordby have located a second crime scene in Bungonia which is separate [to one] which they had been searching yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very confident that we have located Luke and Jesse."</p>
        
            <p>Detective Superintendent Daniel Doherty said police had located "two surf bags" as part of their investigations.</p>
        
            <p>"We allege [they] were used to transport the bodies from the house in Paddington," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they understood the bodies were found near a "fence line, near the entrance to the property" in Bungonia.</p>
        
            <p>"A driveway goes up to a property and a fence line there, and [the human remains were] off the side of the driveway, covered in, an attempt appeared to have been made to cover the bodies with rock and debris," Doherty said.</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales senior constable Beau Lamarre-Condon has been charged with their murders, which police have alleged happened last Monday, 19 February, at Baird's home in Paddington.</p>
        
            <p>Doherty said police would allege that Lamarre-Condon was the "sole person responsible".</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Webb said the discovery of the bodies "did come with the assistance of the accused".</p>
        
            <p>Police have set up a crime scene at a second rural property at Bungonia in the Southern Tablelands.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today the search area was also expanded to the Royal National Park in Sydney's south.</p>
        
            <p>Police divers spent four hours scouring dams at a rural property at Bungonia near Goulburn yesterday, while officers searched surrounding farmland.</p>
        
            <p>Doherty said there had been a "relationship" between Baird and Lamarre-Condon.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding [was that] at some stage it was a relationship. There's been a lot of information, a mountain of information," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been a huge investigation. The scope has been far and ranging."</p>
        
            <p>Doherty said the families of Baird and Davies would travel down to Goulburn.</p>
        
            <p>"Arrangements have been made for the family to travel down to the Goulburn area and we'll provide that ongoing support as we need to," Superintendent Doherty said.</p>
