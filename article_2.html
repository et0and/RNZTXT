            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries has stopped providing staff to Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson's office.</p>
        
            <p>1News has reported that a whistleblower revealed that staff laid formal complaints, with more than one ministry staffer leaving the office.</p>
        
            <p>Patterson - a New Zealand First List MP who is also Associate Minister of Agriculture and Regional Development - is understood not to be directly involved.</p>
        
            <p>Ministries often provide secondees into the offices of ministers for support.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) confirmed it did not have any staff in the minister's office.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with Ministerial Services regarding staffing of the office, but as we have a duty of care to our employees, and to protect their privacy, we cannot comment further at this time.</p>
        
            <p>"MPI does not currently have any staff in Minister Patterson's office. Please direct any further enquiries to Ministerial Services."</p>
        
            <p>Patterson's office said he would not be commenting as it was a contractual matter between the staffers and their employer Ministerial Services.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ministerial Services said it was aware of complaints involving staff in Patterson's office, but the complaints were not related to the minister.</p>
        
            <p>"As this is an employment matter, we will not be providing further details."</p>
