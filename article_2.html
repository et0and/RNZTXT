            <p>Fewer tertiary students accessed funds through the Student Loan Scheme last year, but the amount they borrowed was up.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile in the last three years, money written off due to bankruptcy has increased 114 percent to nearly $6 million.</p>
        
            <p>The Student Loan Scheme Annual Report says $1.4 billion was borrowed through the Scheme, an increase of 0.4 percent compared to 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The report shows 120,918 students borrowed from the scheme, down 6.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Students used around just over half (57 percent) of the total they borrowed to pay for course fees.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile loan repayments were similar in the last financial year, but overdue repayments were up by $200m, with overseas-based borrowers owing the majority of the debt.</p>
        
            <p>The report said overseas-based borrower defaults also made up an increasingly large amount of overdue repayments.</p>
        
            <p>Just over 70 of overseas-based borrowers owed 92.6 percent of the total overdue student loan debt as of 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>The report said that was a continuation of a long-term trend, and those who remained in New Zealand were more likely to pay their loan off in half of the time.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether a borrower stays in New Zealand or goes overseas makes a significant difference to the forecast repayment times. Half of the borrowers who remain in New Zealand can expect to repay their student loans within 5.2 years, while three-quarters can expect to repay within 9.1 years.</p>
        
            <p>"For borrowers who spend time overseas, half can expect to take 11.0 years to repay their student loan, while three-quarters can expect to repay within 18.6 years."</p>
        
            <p>In the year to 30 June, $5.7m was written off due to the bankruptcy of 151 individuals - more than double that in 2022/23 when $2.5m of loan debts were written off for 76 people.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021/22, 34 people went bankrupt with $0.05m written off due to bankruptcy (although $0.56m was reversed, resulting in a net negative write-off of $0.06m).</p>
        
            <p>In the year to 30 June 2024, 52,368 borrowers repaid their loans in full. The report said that between April and June 2024, Inland Revenue returned to using a range of approaches to improve compliance and reduce overdue repayments. This resulted in 10,500 more customers meeting their obligations and a $13.6m drop in overdue debt.</p>
        
            <p>More than 934,000 borrowers have fully repaid their loans since 1992, when the scheme began. Average amounts borrowed per year have increased since that time, from $282 to $11,508.</p>
