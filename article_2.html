            <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Paula Bennett has been appointed as the new board chair of the drug-buying agency Pharmac.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister David Seymour announced the appointment on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Pharmac is a critical part of New Zealand's health system and plays a significant role in ensuring that Kiwis have the best possible access to medicines," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"As chair, Paula will lead the Pharmac board in their role of managing the pharmaceutical schedule and driving greater efficiencies and access to medicine for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he was confident Bennett had the right leadership and decision-making skills for the role.</p>
        
            <p>"Paula brings a wealth of experience to this role, with extensive experience in governance and organisational change."</p>
        
            <p>During her 15-year political career, Bennett served as deputy prime minister under Sir Bill English and a Cabinet minister with portfolios including social development, associate finance, state services, social housing, police, local government, and tourism.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said Pharmac board chair was an important role.</p>
        
            <p>"Globally, changes in medicine are making them more useful and presenting new opportunities for our health, while at the same time presenting new challenges that need to be navigated."</p>
        
            <p>Former Pharmac board chair Steve Maharey, who was previously a Labour minister, resigned from the role - and as the board chair of the Accident Compensation Corporation - in December last year.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour thanked acting chair Dr Peter Bramley for serving in the role during the search for a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>He said Bramley would remain as a Pharmac board member.</p>
        
            <p>Bennett will start in the role on 13 May.</p>
