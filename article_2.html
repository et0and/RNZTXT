            <p>Interislander's Aratere ferry had received an overhaul of its steering system just three weeks before it veered off-course and hit the shore.</p>
        
            <p>The Aratere ran aground 3km north of Picton on Friday night with 47 people on board.</p>
        
            <p>All passengers had since disembarked and KiwiRail was planning to refloat the ferry on the high tide at 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>At a press conference on Saturday afternoon, Interislander executive general manager Duncan Roy said the Aratere had wet dock maintenance work just three weeks before last night's breakdown.</p>
        
            <p>The work saw a number of systems upgraded on the ship, including the pre-emptive replacement of its steering system, Roy said.</p>
        
            <p>"That was part of our commitment to improving the maintenance and reliability of the ferries."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Friday night, KiwiRail said the ship ran aground following a steering failure.</p>
        
            <p>But KiwiRail chief executive Peter Reidy said on Saturday they could not be sure yet what caused the accident, and were very disappointed with what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"It is serious that we have had a ship grounded so we will look through  root cause investigation, but we have invested significant money and time recently in upgrading the steering system."</p>
        
            <p>The grounding came just days after Transport Minister Simeon Brown raised serious concerns about KiwiRail's maintenance of its fleet.</p>
        
            <p>It was fortunate that the incident did not happen in the middle of Cook Strait, Reidy said.</p>
        
            <p>Two dive operations were underway, and they had discovered the ship was resting on sand and gravel rather than jagged rocks.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Accident Investigation Commission has opened an inquiry into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the press conference was interrupted by a man walking his dog nearby who shouted, "Blame the Prime Minister [for] cancelling the new ferries."</p>
        
            <p>Discussions around a replacement for the ferries was for another day, Reidy said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is about recovery of the ship."</p>
