            <p>Ambulance officers will strike for a second time at the end of the month after rejecting a pay offer from Hato Hone St John.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 officers will strike for 24 hours on 27 and 30 September.</p>
        
            <p>The industrial action followed rolling strikes by ambulance workers and call takers in August - the first time they had ever taken strike action.</p>
        
            <p>Ambulance officers have been negotiating over pay and conditions with the employer, St John, since their collective agreement expired in December 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The unions - New Zealand Ambulance Association and First Union - had rejected a settlement proposal by St John.</p>
        
            <p>First Union organiser Faye McCann said the offer from St John included minimal pay increases, below the rate of inflation.</p>
        
            <p>Ambulance officers would continue to leave the workforce if a fair pay agreement was not reached, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're burnt out, they're underpaid, and they're not being listened to by the government or St John.</p>
        
            <p>"They need better working conditions and this is the action that they're having to take to be heard."</p>
        
            <p>There was a major funding gap and a critical need for a fully funded ambulance service, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very peculiar for us to hear that the government won't step up and fully fund the ambulance service when that's what the public needs, that's what the staff need."</p>
