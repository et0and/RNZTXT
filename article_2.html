            <p>A Sydney bishop is among multiple people allegedly stabbed during a church service in the city's south-west on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>The attack occurred at the Assyrian Orthodox Church, Christ The Good Shepherd Church in Wakeley, with graphic video showing a man lunging at Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel with something in his hand during a mass that was being broadcast online.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Ambulance said three other people were also stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police said a male was arrested at the scene and "he has been removed from the church and taken to an undisclosed location".</p>
        
            <p>They said those stabbed suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were treated by paramedics before being taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>However, a spokesperson for NSW Health said the bishop's condition was critical but stable, and was being treated at Liverpool Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The hospital went into partial lockdown but people needing immediate care were able to access services.</p>
        
            <p>The public were advised to avoid the area during the large-scale police response which started just after 7pm local time.</p>
        
            <p>Vision from outside the church shows chaotic scenes with a large crowd of people.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Premier Chris Minns said he has been briefed by the Police Commissioner and NSW Health about the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and first responders who are working to keep us safe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important that the community remain calm and continue to listen and act to the directions of police and emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a strong community in NSW and it's important that we all stick together, particularly in the face of adversity."</p>
        
            <p>Late on Monday night, Minns convened a meeting of government officials and leaders representing religious communities in Western Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Minns said the group of 11 "endorsed and supported a unanimous condemnation of violence in any form".</p>
        
            <p>"We're calling on everyone to act with kindness and respect for each other," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The incident comes two days after a man killed six people in a stabbing attack at Westfield Bondi Junction on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Just before 1am on Tuesday, police said the operation had ended but two officers had been injured, and police cars damaged.</p>
        
            <p>"A constable was hit with a metal object and sustained a twisted knee and a chipped tooth," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Another constable sustained a broken jaw after he was hit with a brick and a fence paling.</p>
        
            <p>"They were both taken to hospital for treatment."</p>
        
            <p>Faith NSW chief executive Murray Norman described the stabbing of Bishop Emmanuel as "horrific" and deeply shocking.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight, Bishop Emmanuel was stabbed, it's a hideous thing, I can't believe this can happen in Australia during a mass, it's just horrible," he told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't heard about his condition, but the faith communities are desperately grieving and praying for the bishop, it's just horrible that this could happen after everything that's happened this week."</p>
        
            <p>Jewish community leader Alex Ryvchin, from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he was "horrified by the stabbing attack".</p>
        
            <p>"I stand in complete solidarity with the beautiful Assyrian community and pray that the injured recover fully in body and soul," he said.</p>
        
            <p>I H Kauser, the national president and Grand Imam of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Australia, expressed "profound sadness and shock".</p>
        
            <p>"The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Australia unequivocally condemns tonight's attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in the strongest possible terms.</p>
        
            <p>"We extend our deepest sympathy to all those injured in the attack and wish them a speedy and complete recovery."</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the ABC.</p>
