            <p>Famous Queenstown burger joint, Fergburger has apologised to a customer after an order receipt contained a racial slur.</p>
        
            <p>A customer ordered from the restaurant on Sunday and photos on social media show a server had written "ching chang" on the docket.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Fergburger said it had written a formal apology to the customer.</p>
        
            <p>"Fergburger acknowledges and deeply regrets a recent incident involving inappropriate and insensitive labelling on a customer order. We extend our sincere apologies to the customer affected and to anyone else who may have been hurt or offended.</p>
        
            <p>"At Fergburger, we are committed to creating an environment where all customers feel welcome, respected, and valued. The behaviour displayed in this incident is completely unacceptable and does not reflect the values we uphold.</p>
        
            <p>"Upon learning of the incident, we immediately launched a thorough internal investigation to understand how this occurred and to ensure accountability."</p>
        
            <p>Fergburger has been operating since 2001 and has become so popular wait times can be hours long, with the line often going outside of the store and down the street.</p>
        
            <p>The burger joint said it has written a formal apology to the customer and has personally invited the customer to contact the general manager directly should they wish to discuss the matter further.</p>
        
            <p>It said it is also working with the employee responsible - who was not the person identified on the receipt.</p>
        
            <p>"We are addressing the matter directly with the employee involved to ensure appropriate action is taken. We want to clarify that the employee identified on the receipt was not the employee that was responsible for this incident."</p>
        
            <p>Fergburger said it would also be implementing additional cultural sensitivity and inclusivity training for all team members to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
        
            <p>It said it would also conduct a comprehensive review of internal policies and procedures to reinforce its commitment to respectful and inclusive practices.</p>
