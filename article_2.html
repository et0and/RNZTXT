            <p>The Reserve Bank (RBNZ) got what it wanted and should back down on its threat of future interest rate hikes, a high-profile economist says.</p>
        
            <p>The economy shrank in the third quarter as households spent less, exports fell, and manufacturing activity decreased, new figures showed on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only did we get a contraction on the quarter, the statisticians revised down all the previous quarters over the last year or so," Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr told Checkpoint. </p>
        
            <p>"So our economy is actually, you know, 2 percent smaller than we thought it was. What that means is that the government's tax take is going to be less - the economy is simply smaller, less GST, less corporate tax."</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data showed seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.3 percent in the third quarter, the opposite of the RBNZ's forecast growth of 0.3 percent. </p>
        
            <p>"We are in recession - we recorded one last summer and we're going to record one this summer," Kerr said. "So the rapid rise in interest rates, the RBNZ has hiked aggressively with a heavy hand, has had an impact and households are hurting and, and so are small-to-medium businesses."</p>
        
            <p>The official cash rate has risen from 0.25 percent two years ago to 5.5 percent. RBNZ head Adrian Orr admitted its goal was to engineer a recession to bring inflation back down to its 1-3 percent target range. </p>
        
            <p>In November the RBNZ said inflation was dropping, but not as quickly as it would like - so further hikes could be on the cards.</p>
        
            <p>"This is exactly what they've been trying to engineer - they told us, you know, late last year that they wanted to engineer a recession. They needed to do so in order to get inflation pressure back down. So from their point of view, it's kind of 'job done'.</p>

            <p>"What we're saying is that, you know, the job is done - stop telling us that you're going to keep hiking rates because it's not needed… The next discussion should be rate cuts, not hikes." </p>
        
            <p>The fall in GDP comes despite a huge influx of migrants. </p>
        
            <p>"We've got a contraction of 0.3 percent despite the fact that we've imported 130,000 net migrants over the last year.</p>
        
            <p>"So when you look at things on a per capita basis, per head, they were down 0.9 percent on the quarter and we're down 3 percent over the year.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you know, the RBNZ rate hikes are having a big impact on households and we've seen consumption coming off even though there's a lot more people in the economy."</p>
        
            <p>The consequences posed a problem for the new government, Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're basically waiting for the Treasury's numbers next week to get a good handle. But it's going to be weaker than they thought, and it's going to be weaker than what was in the Budget earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the main point - less revenue. That means it's going to be tougher on the other side, on the spending side.</p>
        
            <p>"Potentially, you know - they're going to have to work through what they can cut and what they, what they are gonna stick to with their, with their promises.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a very tough job. These numbers don't help."</p>
        
            <p>The government has scrapped numerous initiatives put in motion by its predecessor to help pay for its promised tax cuts and reinstatement of deductibility for landlords.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said there was some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>"Look, I think there are some bright spots. I mean, the housing market seems to be recovering quite nicely. We'll see house price gains next year. That'll be good for a lot of Kiwis. </p>
        
            <p>"Tourism is picking up. We're hearing anecdotes of Chinese tourism slowly picking up, which is key. They've been a missing ingredient. So hopefully we get a bumper summer, you know, particularly in tourist numbers and student numbers and you we'll be on a better footing, I think later next year."</p>
