            <p>Commissioners have declined to grant consent for a McDonald's restaurant to open in Wānaka.</p>
        
            <p>Consent was being sought to open a 455-square metre restaurant with a drive-thru at the Wānaka-Luggate Highway, below Mt Iron.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Lakes District Council opened the proposal up for public submissions and of the 367 made, the majority were against it.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were concerned about the visual and aesthetic impact on the town, as well as the area's values about protecting the natural environment.</p>
        
            <p>Wao Aotearoa Charitable Trust was one group that strongly opposed the idea due to the impact it would have on the town.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed mitigation measures, including planting and mounding, are insufficient to address the impacts of the building, signage, lighting, and parking areas.</p>
        
            <p>"This site does not align with the community's objective to protect and enhance our natural landscapes."</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners noted in their decision that the proposed development would be at odds with the towns 'rural living' environment and activities.</p>
        
            <p>So far, Wanaka has avoided most fast-food chains, but it does have a Subway and a Domino's.</p>
