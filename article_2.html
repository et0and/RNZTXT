            <p>An initial post-mortem examination on the body of Dr Michael Mosley has concluded he died of natural causes, the BBC has been told.</p>
        
            <p>The TV presenter's remains were found in a rocky area on the Greek island of Symi on Sunday - four days after he went missing while on holiday.</p>
        
            <p>Greek police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told the BBC that the initial post-mortem found no injuries on his body that could have caused his death.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley's time of death was around 4pm local time Wednesday, the day he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>Dimoglidou said the initial conclusion that Mosley died of natural causes was based on the position his body was found in, as well as a lack of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A toxicology report and a histology report have now been ordered.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC has seen CCTV footage that appears to show Mosley disappear from view as he slowly makes his way down a hillside close to where his body was later found.</p>
        
            <p>The recording, taken near to the Agia Marina beach bar, is the last known footage of Mosley.</p>
        
            <p>The 67-year-old father-of-four was reported missing after he left Agios Nikolaos beach to set off on a walk at about 1.30pm local time on Wednesday. Mosley's wife, Dr Clare Bailey Mosley, raised the alarm after her husband did not return.</p>
        
            <p>Greek authorities conducted an extensive search for Mosley amid high temperatures, deploying police officers, firefighters, divers and a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>A bar manager found his body after the island's mayor "saw something" by the fence of the bar and alerted staff, PA news agency reported.</p>
        
            <p>A police source told BBC News he had been dead "for a number of days".</p>
        
            <p>Bailey Mosley said on Sunday that her family was "taking comfort in the fact" that her husband "so very nearly made it".</p>
        
            <p>"He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn't be easily seen by the extensive search team," Bailey Mosley said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>She also paid tribute to her "wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant" husband after the "devastating" news his body had been found.</p>
        
            <p>"We had an incredibly lucky life together," Bailey Mosley said.</p>
        
            <p>"We loved each other very much and were so happy together."</p>
        
            <p>The former deputy leader of the Labour Party, Lord Tom Watson, was among those to pay fresh tributes to Mosley on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"He certainly changed my life. He gave me the idea that I wasn't broken," Watson, who said in 2018 that he had "reversed" his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p>
