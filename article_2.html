            <p>Conservative US commentator Candace Owens will be allowed into New Zealand after the overturning of Immigration New Zealand's ban on her entering the country.</p>
        
            <p>Known for controversial views including downplaying the holocaust and claiming muslims started slavery, she was denied entry to Australia in October after she announced a speaking tour.</p>
        
            <p>Groups including Young Labour urged the government to also ban her from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She had an application for an Entertainers Work Visa denied last month.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Immigration Minister Chris Penk made the decision to overturn New Zealand's ban.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, he said she had requested ministerial intervention.</p>
        
            <p>"Immigration New Zealand originally declined her visa application on the basis of section 15(1)(f) of the Immigration Act following Ms Owens being denied entry to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Subsequently, Ms Owens requested intervention from the Associate Minister of Immigration to exercise his discretion and grant her a visa.</p>
        
            <p>"The Minister made his decision after considering representations made to him, including the importance of free speech."</p>
        
            <p>Penk refused to be interviewed or comment further, saying he did not comment on individual cases of ministerial intervention due to concerns including privacy.</p>
