            <p>Car crashes on the country's state highways are an almost daily occurrence, especially with many of us on the move over the summer break.</p>
        
            <p>Getting stuck when a road is closed after a serious crash or having to snake around long detours can be annoying. But why does it take so long to clear?</p>
        
            <p>But the reason the road needs to be closed for so long is because it's a crime scene, Sergeant Andy Heath from the Counties Manukau Serious Crash Unit said in a video posted online.</p>
        
            <p>He said this happens after a serious crash - which is when someone has died, has the potential to die, or has suffered life-altering injuries.</p>
        
            <p>There was, provisionally, 374 fatalities from 337 crashes in 2022, according to Ministry of Transport data.</p>
        
            <p>This is 56 more fatalities and 52 more crashes than in 2021, but that doesn't count the scores of crashes where people are seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>And as frustrating as the delays can be, Heath said police had a duty to the coroner, the victims and the families of victims to fully and thoroughly investigate the crashes.</p>
        
            <p>This was important so that if there was culpability, they needed the "best evidence possible" to prove that in court.</p>
        
            <p>He described turning up at the scene of a serious crash like chaos. Officers are dealing with members of the public, witnesses and other emergency services who need space to do what they do best.</p>

            <p>He said closing the road was the first thing they did to make sure the scene was safe.</p>
        
            <p>"So once we've got the scene safe, there's not cars flying through at high speed. Emergency services can get in, then they'll start dealing and helping the people that are inside.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a scene where medical staff were dealing with a person for an hour. They were too unstable, to be, too unstable to be put in the ambulance of flown out so they dealt with them there on the ground."</p>
        
            <p>Then, the Serious Crash Unit took over to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>"We freeze the scene, control it and try and preserve all the evidence," Heath said.</p>

            <p>Once everything was uplifted from the scene, police made sure the road was free of lubricants, oils and spills "because what we don't want is another crash happening".</p>
        
            <p>It was only then that they reopened the road.</p>
        
            <p>Heath said in the meantime, detours were set up. But if the crash was in an awkward location, that was just unfortunate.</p>
        
            <p>Heath said they tried to funnel people down the nearest side roads.</p>
        
            <p>"The road controlling authorities, what they want is the road open as soon as possible. They want to keep that network moving, so we have to be mindful of that."</p>
        
            <p>But, he said he understood how frustrating it was to be late because of the road closures.</p>
        
            <p>"People who are delayed and they don't know why they're delayed is very, very frustrating.</p>
        
            <p>"I always kind of have it in the back of my mind that you're not having an any worse day than the people here in the crash."</p>
        
            <p>"You're late to your meeting, you're late for whatever, you know. You're not dead."</p>
