            <p>A 24-year-old man has been charged with aggravated wounding after a serious assault in Newmarket, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred on Broadway, near Westfield Mall, about 2.35pm.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Martin Friend, of Auckland City CIB, said security guards had approached a man when he produced a knife.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the guards has sustained a serious stab injury to the neck as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point, we have established they were trying to engage with the man in relation to an earlier incident."</p>
        
            <p>A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene and will appear in the Auckland District Court tomorrow, charged with aggravated wounding. Police said they would be opposing the man's bail.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, police cordoned the area, near the intersection with Mortimer Pass, and said an investigation was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"The victim has sustained serious injuries and is receiving medical treatment," Friend said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Hato Hone St John said one patient in a critical condition had been transported to Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>It was notified of an incident on Broadway, Newmarket, at 2.38pm. One ambulance, one rapid response vehicle, and one operations manager attended.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not seeking anyone else in relation to what has unfolded this afternoon," Friend said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to acknowledge the quick actions of security staff this afternoon given what has occurred."</p>
        
            <p>Police asked any witnesses to contact 105, using reference number P060688447.</p>
        
            <p>A security guard at the scene told a RNZ journalist that the mall would put out a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The bus stop at the mall has been closed.</p>
