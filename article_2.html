            <p>A long-awaited report scrutinising Hawke's Bay Civil Defence's response to Cyclone Gabrielle will be made public today.</p>
        
            <p>The findings and recommendations from an independent review headed up by former police commissioner Mike Bush are due to be released on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The review was commissioned almost a year ago by the Hawke's Bay Civil Defence Emergency Management Joint Committee - made up of the region's four mayors, the regional council chief executive, and mana whenua representatives.</p>
        
            <p>It investigated how well prepared officials were prior to the cyclone, as well as the agency's immediate emergency response.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay suffered the biggest loss of lives in the cyclone. Rivers burst their banks and sodden land gave way, sweeping eight people to their deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Homes and infrastructure were destroyed, communications and power were cut, livelihoods were lost, and some rural communities were isolated for weeks.</p>
        
            <p>When the review was announced, regional council and joint committee chair Hinewai Ormsby said it was vital the councils identified any lessons that could be learnt</p>
        
            <p>"The impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle on our region have been devastating and far reaching, first and foremost on our people, particularly those whānau who have lost loved ones," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important we move with pace on this review, to ensure our communities are prepared for any event in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Some mayors later expressed frustration that the review process was taking so long.</p>
        
            <p>In early January, Mike Bush said the review had attracted more than 1000 community submissions.</p>
        
            <p>The Civil Defence response came under fire from locals soon after the cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>Some were furious they had not received evacuation alerts, or received them too late - and pinned deaths on that failure.</p>
        
            <p>And a community leader from the coastal town of Waimārama, Richard Gaddum, said Civil Defence was set up to fail.</p>
        
            <p>In June he told a joint committee meeting the wheels started falling off in 2014 when about a dozen community-based Civil Defence groups were disestablished, and the remit was moved to more centralised management under Hawke's Bay Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>Cyclone Gabrielle proved the consequences of those changes, he argued.</p>
        
            <p>"To expect a skeleton crew from Civil Defence personnel to cope with such a catastrophic event over the whole of Hawke's Bay region was an impossible task, and proved to be so."</p>
        
            <p>The public deserved better, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after the independent review was announced, RNZ revealed Hawke's Bay Civil Defence had been in the throes of a major overhaul when Cyclone Gabrielle hit.</p>
        
            <p>Well before the cyclone, another independent review found it lacked experienced and well-trained staff, vital information was not being shared between Civil Defence and emergency services due to IT system constraints, and the organisational structure needed a rethink.</p>
        
            <p>The 2021 review, carried out by ContextusSolutions, was commissioned in the wake of the 2020 Napier floods and the impact of Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>The emergency response structure, staffing and systems were identified as needing to be "addressed with urgency", it said.</p>
        
            <p>In April, Civil Defence said work on implementing that review's 17 recommendations was mostly on track.</p>
        
            <p>But it said staff vacancies, Covid-19 sickness, the pandemic response, lack of funding and the national emergency management reforms were all identified as risks that could hinder progress.</p>
        
            <p>It was likely the Mike Bush review would take into account that Civil Defence was going through big changes when the cyclone hit, it said.</p>
