            <p>The government is bringing in immediate changes to the Accredited Employer Worker Visa, which it says will help protect migrants from exploitation and address unsustainable net migration.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, a near-record 173,000 non-New Zealand citizens migrated to the country.</p>
        
            <p>The changes to the work visa scheme include introducing an English language requirement for migrants applying for low-skilled jobs.</p>
        
            <p>A number of construction roles will also no longer be added to the green-light list due to less demand, and the franchisee accreditation category will be disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration Minister Erica Stanford said the changes focus on using the local labour market first, while still attracting high-skill migrants where there are skill shortages.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting our immigration settings right is critical to this government's plan to rebuild the economy," she said on Sunday in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The government is focused on attracting and retaining the highly skilled migrants such as secondary teachers, where there is a skill shortage. At the same time we need to ensure that New Zealanders are put to the front of the line for jobs where there are no skills shortages."</p>
        
            <p>She said having an English language requirement would mean migrants "will be better able to understand their rights or raise concerns about an employer early".</p>
        
            <p>"These changes are the start of a more comprehensive work programme to create a smarter immigration system that manages net migration, responds to our changing economic context, attracts top talent, revitalises international education, is self-funding and sustainable, and better manages risk."</p>
        
            <p>The changes are immediate, applying from today or Monday, 8 April.</p>
        
            <p>The full list of changes to the AEWV scheme can be found on the Immigration website.</p>
