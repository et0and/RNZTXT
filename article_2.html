            <p>Labour is demanding the coalition government explain how it will deliver its promised tax cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis on Wednesday unveiled her mini-Budget, but it contained few details on how tax relief will be delivered and how much it will cost.</p>
        
            <p>She is confident changes to tax thresholds will be rolled out responsibly next year.</p>
        
            <p>"The advice we have received so far gives the government confidence that we can responsibly deliver the tax relief New Zealanders deserve," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>But Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson wants proof.</p>
        
            <p>"No one is any the wiser as to how National will pay for its tax cuts."</p>
        
            <p>Willis, however, said New Zealanders cared more about the size of the tax cut, rather than how it was delivered - something the government is yet to work out.</p>
        
            <p>NationaI campaigned on shifting income tax brackets and expanding tax credits.</p>
        
            <p>During negotiations, the ACT Party convinced National to consider other ways of delivering the same amount - or more.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour said the government was committed to delivering "the level of tax relief that was in the National Party manifesto".</p>
        
            <p>"We are all committed to doing it in the most efficient, fairest and simplest way possible.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, going into a Budget we are taking a range of advice on how to do that," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>National's election policy predicts changes to tax thresholds will cost just under $9 billion, over four years.</p>
        
            <p>But, given the final makeup of the government's tax package is still unclear, so, too, is the final cost.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said the government was already taking steps to pay for it.</p>
        
            <p>"The mini-Budget contained seven and a half billion dollars of savings, as well as concrete actions to deliver the next range of savings that will support tax relief."</p>
        
            <p>The government has committed to rolling out that relief next year.</p>
        
            <p>But New Zealanders will need to wait until May's Budget to know the full cost and how it will be delivered.</p>
