            <p>A car passenger is in a critical condition after being stabbed at a red light in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the driver objected to the loud music they were playing, in an apparent road rage attack, although police were yet to establish the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant James Haigh said the stabbing happened at the intersection of Clarence Street and Blenheim Road in Riccarton at 5.40pm Thursday.</p>

            <p>"Two cars were at the red lights on Clarence Street, when a male has gotten out of one of the vehicles and attacked the victim who was in the other car."</p>
        
            <p>The offender then fled, Haigh said.</p>
        
            <p>The victim remained in Christchurch Hospital in a critical condition. Police confirmed he was the rear passenger in a red car carrying four adults.</p>
        
            <p>The offending male was the driver and sole occupant of the other car.</p>
