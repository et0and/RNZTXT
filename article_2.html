            <p>An innocent member of the public was pumping petrol when he gave a Head Hunter a friendly nod across a Northland forecourt.</p>
        
            <p>Moments later, he and his partner were viciously attacked by the gang member and his friend, leaving the man seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>The attack was part of a crime spree that also saw Kevin Grey fire two shots into the air at a packed car event after a disagreement broke out with rival gang members.</p>
        
            <p>But that spree has come to an end and this week, the 27-year-old appeared for sentencing in the Whangārei District Court on nine charges including unlawfully entering motor vehicles, assault with intent to injure, male assaults female and discharging a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>In court, Grey's offending was labelled "quite a contrast" to the way he conducted himself within his community.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Philip Rzepecky said Grey was an integrated member of his marae where he upheld roles as a gravedigger and a butcher for events.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite your history, you do play a role in your community at your marae ... you've probably got some talent with carving and artwork and that's what you need to focus on in the future," the judge said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a contrast to what I'm reading."</p>
        
            <p>The court heard the offending kicked off in March last year when Grey unsuccessfully tried to steal a vehicle in Maunu, Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>He smashed the car's ignition and inadvertently left blood behind which later linked him to the crime.</p>
        
            <p>Then in July, Grey was at the Z petrol station in Te Kamo alongside another car, occupied by a woman and a man.</p>
        
            <p>The woman went into the shop to pay while the man pumped the petrol.</p>
        
            <p>While he was filling up, the man gave Grey a friendly head nod. Shortly after, Grey approached him and, without warning, king-hit the man and then punched him twice.</p>
        
            <p>An associate of Grey's became involved, striking the man from behind and eventually taking him to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>They continued to kick and punch him.</p>
        
            <p>The woman inside the store saw the assault and ran to their vehicle and removed the keys from the ignition.</p>
        
            <p>Grey turned his attention to her, kicking her in the back and pushing her into the car door frame.</p>
        
            <p>He then returned to the male victim, who was now lying in a foetal position, and continued to kick him.</p>
        
            <p>When the woman tried to help her partner, Grey struck her in the face with an open hand before attempting to fight members of the public who had tried to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>Grey and his associates fled the scene, leaving the male concussed with various other injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Then in October, Grey was attending a car burn-out rally in Pipiwai, north of Whangārei, with prospects of the Head Hunter North Shore chapter.</p>
        
            <p>There were about 200 people present, including rival Black Power members, when a disagreement broke out.</p>
        
            <p>Grey pulled out a rifle and fired two shots in the air before fleeing.</p>
        
            <p>He was later found in the North Shore with the gun still in the vehicle. Ammunition was also located at his girlfriend's address.</p>
        
            <p>In court, Grey's lawyer John Day said he acknowledged his client was "no stranger to the courts" but when arrested, he was cooperative and admitted the charges.</p>
        
            <p>Day accepted Grey's extensive criminal history which included aggravated robbery and agreed prison was the most likely outcome.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Rzepecky viewed the firearms charge as the most serious and said discharging the gun was particularly aggravating behaviour amongst gang people.</p>
        
            <p>Grey was sentenced to 38 months imprisonment.</p>
