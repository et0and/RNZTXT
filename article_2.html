        <h2>Theories behind The Hum phenomenon, which only some people can hear</h2>
        <p>
For thousands of people around the world it starts out as a low-level vibrational buzz, but the sound that becomes a persistent annoyance for many is not heard by everyone.

            <p>For thousands of people around the world it starts out as a low-level vibrational buzz, but the sound that becomes a persistent annoyance for many is not heard by everyone.</p>
        
            <p>What has become known as "The Hum", is a modern-day mystery that for decades has been reported in Sydney, and other major cities from London to Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of reports continually get added monthly to an interactive user-generated map created in December 2012. The locations people claim to experience this elusive noise span the globe.</p>

            <p>Georgina Johanson, who was living in the northern Sydney suburb of Killarney Heights about six years ago, is one of thousands who has marked her experience on the map.</p>
        
            <p>There are 15 locations marked in the Greater Sydney region of people describing their experience of what they have heard.</p>
        
            <p>Johanson said it began as a "pulsating" noise she believed was generated by construction work on an oval nearby.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like a low rumbling of a diesel engine, which is why I got confused originally, because I just thought it was the continuance of the machines across the road, digging up all the ground," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But then I noticed when we drove past the fields that there's no machines there anymore. I'm thinking 'What the hell is that noise'?"</p>
        
            <p>She could only hear it in her house, and nobody else could.</p>
        
            <p>"Even when I said to my husband, 'I can feel it standing here, come here', he said, 'Nope, I can't hear it'.</p>
        
            <p>"I said, 'My chest is vibrating'."</p>
        
            <p>She discussed it with radiography colleagues at work, but they were also stumped.</p>
        
            <p>"I spoke to a few doctors I worked with and nobody had ever heard of it, they all thought I was a nut."</p>
        
            <p>Johanson has since moved to Lismore, and said she can no longer hear the sound, and is "too afraid" to try and listen out for it again.</p>

Waverley Council, which presides over Bondi, received so many complaints about a mysterious sound more than a decade ago, they voted for the EPA to investigate.

            <p>Ten years ago, Waverley Council voted for the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to investigate a humming noise in Sydney's eastern suburbs after so many residents complained.</p>
        
            <p>While the EPA did not end up looking into the issue, it said it has not received any formal complaints since.</p>
        
            <p>"Given this issue appears to still be a concern for some residents, the EPA will contact [Waverley] Council to see if they would like us to assist them in trying to identify the source," a NSW EPA spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Glen MacPherson started The World Hum Map and Database Project after he first heard it living on Canada's Sunshine Coast.</p>

            <p>"The first night in my house, the hum absolutely roared," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was absolutely loud enough to be a nuisance."</p>
        
            <p>The project started by the school teacher has since collected more than 6500 different people's experience of the phenomenon.</p>
        
            <p>And it has led to some startling discoveries, Dr MacPherson said.</p>
        
            <p>The first hum report came out of England in the mid-late 1970s, and theories as to its cause abound, including lightning strikes and ocean waves, industrial plants, and mobile phone towers.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no such thing as a hum hotspot," Dr MacPherson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial researchers were quite incorrect."</p>
        
            <p>He said if you look at where the data is focused in the world, it correlates with population density.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely striking," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believes the most likely theory is the sound or vibration is generated internally, similar to tinnitus, but it is distinctly not that auditory condition.</p>
        
            <p>Tinnitus, which can cause a ringing or other noises in one or both ears, affects up to 20 percent of Australians to some degree in their lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>"Tinnitus is a perception of a noise that's generated internally by the human body," Dr MacPherson said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have a brief bout of tinnitus, nobody else can hear that.</p>
        
            <p>"Like you get the world's best recording equipment, nobody can record that noise.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a lot of evidence to suggest that The World Hum is like that ... At least that's the most reasonable theory of the four that we're pursuing."</p>
        
            <p>Acoustic consultant Camille Hanrahan-Tan has investigated low frequency sounds in Sydney that others cannot hear.</p>
        
            <p>She said one client believed a persistent noise was emanating from a nearby train shed in Oatley. He described to her a sound that started as a pulsating, but also felt like "a vibration".</p>
        
            <p>Hanrahan-Tan ended up using equipment to measure and record something between 12 and 25 hertz inside his house, a sound she could not hear.</p>
        
            <p>But according to Dr MacPherson, The Hum is an internally-generated sound, and would therefore be unable to be recorded in this way.</p>
        
            <p>Differentiating between the many different murmurs a heaving city produces has proven difficult, given the similarity in tones.</p>
        
            <p>But regardless of its source, those who experience any low-frequency sound overwhelmingly report how incessant it is.</p>

            <p>According to another acoustic expert Glenn Leembruggen, this is because what people all over the world are describing as pulsating and intermittent, is inherently irritating.</p>
        
            <p>"The Environment Protection Authority in their noise policy document does make what they call a penalty, for any noise source, for a factory or something, that is pulsating," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Going up and down, because it tends to be more annoying."</p>
        
            <p>Dr MacPherson's goal is for the data to be picked up by a private laboratory, or a university to investigate further.</p>
        
            <p>"And if they do, they have access to the equipment that I can't afford. And they'll have this thing wrapped up in 18 months," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But for now, Dr MacPherson continues to filter the data entered daily, to ensure the map doesn't include reports where the sound generation is obvious.</p>
        
            <p>"In Northern Ireland right now the one that's going crazy, they call it the Omagh Hum, it's got nothing to do with what I'm studying," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's an industrial noise phenomenon".</p>
