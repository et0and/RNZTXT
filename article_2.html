            <p>Got a nose for whiskey and the desire to live in beautiful Central Otago?</p>
        
            <p>Distilling company Scapegrace thinks its got the "best job in the world" for you.</p>
        
            <p>The distillery on the shores of Lake Dunstan is looking for an assistant distillery manager and master blender.</p>
        
            <p>Co-founder Daniel McLaughlin said they've begun an international search.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the chance to live in one of the most beautiful places in the world and work in a state-of-the-art facility, helping to carve a path globally for New Zealand spirits," he said.</p>
        
            <p>And on your days off "you'll be skiing in the nearby mountains, boating on the lake and enjoying New Zealand's world-famous nature. This truly is the best job in the world".</p>
        
            <p>Bad news for most, though: The successful candidate will need at least five years' experience distilling whiskey.</p>
