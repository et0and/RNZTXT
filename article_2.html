            <p>Dame Whina Cooper's daughter says a treasure trove of historic photos - including images of her late mother - should never have left Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>The photos are part of the Fairfax newspaper archive, which was shipped to America as part of an ill-fated digitisation project and almost ended up in landfill after the US company went under.</p>
        
            <p>Hinerangi Cooper-Puru, of Panguru in Northland, welcomed news the images had been saved and part of the collection was about to return home.</p>
        
            <p>However, she was concerned historically significant photos of Māori were still being sent overseas without permission from iwi or the subject's families.</p>
        
            <p>"We want it stopped. This must not happen again," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were going to dump the pictures they were hoping to maybe sell, which is not good. I'm concerned that they ever left our country, Aotearoa."</p>
        
            <p>Cooper-Puru said she was looking forward to seeing the photos of her mother once they return to New Zealand.</p>
