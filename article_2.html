        <h2>Cause of fire at Auckland backpackers lodge probed</h2>
        <p>
Firefighters remained on standby overnight after the hostel in Parnell went up in flames.
</p>
        
            <p>Fire investigators are expected to return to the scene of a central Auckland blaze that forced about 10 people to evacuate on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to City Garden Lodge in Parnell just after 4.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Crews worked to contain the blaze, with firefighters remaining on standby overnight.</p>

            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said smoke could be smelt from a block away, with thick plumes of smoke spilling out onto the street.</p>
        
            <p>Local MP David Seymour was also at the scene, and said crews had done an extraordinary job controlling the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, they couldn't save a building that is a 120-year-old wooden building, already alight, but they prevented the fire spreading, and they allowed people to escape," he said.</p>

The fire at City Garden Lodge could be seen across the city.

            <p>Residents near the scene said it was only a matter of time before something happened at the backpackers.</p>
        
            <p>John Eichelbaum said residents at the lodge were often unruly.</p>
        
            <p>"The police are down here all the time."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said there had been "a lot of unrest and disturbance" from three hostels in the area, but that was only caused by a relatively small number of residents and "good people" also lived there.</p>
        
            <p>According to the hostel's website, the building was originally the embassy of Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III, who ruled Tonga from 1918 to 1965.</p>
        
            <p>Its visitors ranged from "young people and students on a shoestring budget to open-minded mature travellers", the website said.</p>
