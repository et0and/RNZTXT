            <p>Frustrated drivers are leading to deadly mistakes on roads, driving advocates say after the worst Easter weekend road toll since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The official road death toll for the Easter period remains unconfirmed, but police have counted seven deaths on the roads from 4pm Thursday until 6am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Transport's toll remains at six - with questions over whether a crash between a motorbike and a tractor was being counted.</p>
        
            <p>The Automobile Association says impatient and frustrated drivers are leading to more people making bad decisions on our roads.</p>
        
            <p>AA road safety spokesperson Dylan Thomsen told Morning Report drivers were losing their lives as a result of risky behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The road toll is the worst it has been since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Early on Sunday morning, one person died in a crash on State Highway 5, Whakarewarewa, south of Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Another person died in a three-vehicle crash at Okaramio, northwest of Blenheim on Sunday afternoon. The person died at the scene, and two others were injured.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday morning, a motorcyclist died in hospital after crashing into a tractor in the Matamata-Piako district.</p>
        
            <p>There were three tractor crashes on the same day.</p>
        
            <p>And four people died in a crash between two vehicles and a motorcycle near Lake Pukaki. Three of them died at the scene on Saturday afternoon, and another who was seriously injured died in hospital two days later.</p>
        
            <p>Two foreign students from the University of Canterbury were among those who died. One of the deceased was riding a motorcycle.</p>
