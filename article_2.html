            <p>"At about the lap 50 I said I think we can make it on no more stops if we do one now.. we didn't go that risky but the team called it perfectly and we were on the right strategy."</p>
        
            <p>It's Dixon's 58th career victory, putting him within nine wins of AJ Foyt's record of 67 career wins.</p>
