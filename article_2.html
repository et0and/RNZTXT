            <p>Two strong earthquakes have rocked parts of Asia, with high-rises swaying for about a minute, according to international media.</p>
        
            <p>A 6.3-magnitude earthquake shook Indonesia's main island, Java, on Saturday (local time), Reuters said.</p>
        
            <p>The German Research Centre for Geosciences reported the quake was at a depth of 65km. It was centred south of Java, in the Indian Ocean.</p>
        
            <p>According to ABC News in the United States, high-rises in the capital, Jakarta, swayed for about a minute and homes in Bandung, Depok, Tangerang, Bogor and Bekasi shook strongly.</p>
        
            <p>Many locals were forced to evacuate their buildings amid the shaking.</p>
        
            <p>"I screamed to my wife and kids to tell them to get out of the house," Bandung resident Iman Krisnawan told the French news agency AFP.</p>
        
            <p>There were no reports of injuries, but residents were warned to prepare for aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>Indonesia experiences frequent earthquakes due to its position on the Ring of Fire, an arc of intersecting tectonic plates that stretches across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2022, hundreds of people died after a 5.6-magnitude quake struck West Java at a depth of just 11km.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2018, more than 4,000 people died on Sulawesi Island after a 7-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit Japan's remote Bonin Islands late on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters reported the quake had been registered by the United States Geological Survey as striking 503km below the sea floor.</p>
        
            <p>No tsunami warning was issued.</p>
        
            <p>The Bonin Islands, about 1000km south of Tokyo, were a very seismically active area, Reuters said.</p>
