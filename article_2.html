            <p>A whopping 950kg. The daunting total pack weight of the All Blacks forwards awaiting the Japanese in Yokohama this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand kick off their end of year tour with a test against the Brave Blossoms, and brave is just what Japan will need to be against almost a tonne of All Black beef.</p>
        
            <p>Pasilio Tosi and Tamaiti Williams have both been named to start at prop, both tipping the scales at 140kg.</p>
        
            <p>Joining them in the front row will be Asafo Aumua (108kg), with Patrick Tuipulotu (120kg) and Sam Darry (110kg) locking up the scrum.</p>
        
            <p>At the back is the lightest of the forwards in Sam Cane (103kg), Wallace Sititi (113kg), and Samipeni Finau (115kg).</p>
        
            <p>The total surpasses that of the pack which played the 2023 World Cup final by 49kg, coming in at 901, made up of Codie Taylor (108kg), Cane, Ethan de Groot (122kg), Tyrel Lomax (127kg), Brodie Retallick (123kg), Scott Barrett (111kg), Ardie Savea (99kg), and Shannon Frizell (108kg).</p>
        
            <p>The largest pack ever fielded in a test is believed to be France, who brought a 971kg mountain of man to the 2024 Six Nations.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Scott Robertson said he has been in awe of the size of his squad.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a big pack, watching them train today, it's a big forward pack. When you have five locks who are 6 foot 6 inches and a lot of the tight five are over 6'3" as well, but they are mobile with good skills."</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the scale at 90kg is fullback Ruben Love, who is in line to make his All Black debut in Yokohama from the bench.</p>
        
            <p>"Ruben has trained with us for the majority of the year and a great opportunity fo him to lead his country."</p>
        
            <p>Love said his All Black selection has been a lifetime in the making.</p>

            <p>"Twenty-three years of working hard to have this moment, it just means so much to myself and everyone back home."</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricane said he will be incredibly proud to wear the silver fern.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to do the best I can to represent my family and friends and represent New Zealand as well."</p>
        
            <p>Spending several weeks with the squad, Love has been a sponge, soaking it up with some of the best in the game.</p>
        
            <p>"Rubbing shoulders with people like Beauden (Barrett), Will (Jordan) and Dmac (Damian McKenzie), and learning what it takes to be a test level player, hopefully I can use that knowledge and put it to the test."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said it was a fine balance between selecting both senior players and rookies for the Japan test.</p>
        
            <p>"Balance is the right term, we have a really good mix of experienced players in key positions and young talent."</p>
        
            <p>Also in line for a first test, Wellington loose forward Peter Lakai.</p>
        
            <p>"Peter has slipped straight in, he is a hell of a humble young kid, and an incredible young athlete," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>Lock Patrick Tuipulotu has been named to lead the team with Scott Barrett sitting out the test.</p>
        
            <p>"You need mana and Patrick has got plenty of that. The respect he has in the group, the boys will follow him."</p>
