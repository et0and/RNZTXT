            <p>Celebrities have been gracing the red carpet at the Met Gala 2024 in New York City, including New Zealand director Taika Waititi.</p>
        
            <p>Stars were told to dress in "Garden of Time" attire for the invitation-only event, known for its A-list celebrities and extravagant outfits.</p>

            <p>Film and TV star Zendaya, a host of this year's event, sported heavy eyeliner and a dark blue lam+ and organza bias-cut dress worn over a duchess satin corset. Designed by John Galliano, the gown featured clusters of grapes on a hip and arm, a large ruffle on one side and a blue hummingbird on a shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>Jennifer Lopez, another host, wore a beaded, see-through Schiaparelli gown. "Thor" actor Chris Hemsworth and musician Bad Bunny also were named hosts of the evening.</p>
        
            <p>The high-profile Met Gala is a benefit event for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and marks the opening of its Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit.</p>
        
            <p>This year's exhibit, called "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion," will feature rare items that have been dormant in the Costume Institute's permanent collection, including designs so fragile that they will be displayed only through animation and projections.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese-owned TikTok, which faces a US ban unless its owners sell the social media app to allay security concerns, was among the sponsors of the event. TikTok's chief executive Shou Chew was named an honorary co-chair of the gala and was expected to mingle with guests at the event.</p>
