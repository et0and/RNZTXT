            <p>The Climate Change Minister says the new global deal at COP28 summit to call on all countries to move away fossil fuels is a historic agreement.</p>
        
            <p>A new global deal on climate change has been approved by almost 200 countries.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time there has been a clear reference to the future of all fossil fuels in a United Nations summit text.</p>
        
            <p>But the deal does not include any wording on the "phase out" of fossil fuels, something many countries were demanding.</p>
        
            <p>Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said New Zealand was calling for more ambition but "at the end of the day, we've got a step forward and that's pretty historic".</p>
        
            <p>Watts told Morning Report the reality was all countries had agreed to align their ambitions.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a pretty historic agreement in the context that we've now got consensus and countries have committed not only to get to net zero energy, but also to build a world that no longer relies on fossil fuels - first time that's happened," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Could more be done and should more be done going forward? Yes, but this is a significant step forward for a consensus decision."</p>
        
            <p>Pacific climate warrior Brianna Fruean of a Pacific Islands youth-led grassroots network said she could not celebrate a deal that puts their survival on the line, given it would not limit warming to less than 1.5 degrees celsius.</p>
        
            <p>Asked what New Zealand was doing to stand up for Pacific Island nations, Watts said he had been continuing dialogue with them over the past five days alongside Australia.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand acknowledges the serious concerns raised by Samoa on behalf of the alliance of small island states, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And New Zealand stands with our Pacific Island neighbours."</p>
        
            <p>Implementation of the agreement would be the challenge, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm optimistic because we have to be optimistic because we do not have a choice and our Pacific neighbours know that they do not have a choice if others around them don't act, so we're taking that pretty seriously."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand needs to start getting a clear plan to allow us to decarbonise, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Significant work on methane reduction in the agriculture sector was also needed, he said.</p>
