            <p>The investigation into suspended Green MP Darleen Tana has cost $43,000 so far.</p>
        
            <p>The list MP was stood down on 14 March, after allegations of migrant exploitation relating to her husband's e-bike company surfaced.</p>
        
            <p>The money has come out of the Green Party leaders' office budget, which is funded through the Parliamentary Service, paid for by the taxpayer.</p>
        
            <p>"Natural justice is important to the Green Party and that's why an independent investigation into the very serious allegations surrounding Darleen Tana is taking place, which has so far cost $43,000," a Green Party spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>She has been off work and away from Parliament for half its sitting days this year, while continuing to collect her full pay.</p>
        
            <p>Greens co-leader Chloe Swarbrick told Morning Report on Monday that the investigation report was out of her hands but was hoping it would be wrapped up soon.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation, led by barrister Rachel Burt, has now lasted nine weeks but is yet to report back, with the party co-leaders not setting a deadline.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the natural justice process requires that people are not suspended without pay on the basis of those allegations alone. Again, that innocent until proven guilty principle is critical in a country like ours," Swarbrick said.</p>
