            <p>A well-known international ultrarunner seeking to log the shortest-ever traverse of New Zealand's Te Araroa trail has reported being attacked by dogs near the start.</p>
        
            <p>Belgian Karel Sabbe shares his running and hiking adventures with a large number of social media followers, and set out early on Thursday to run 3054 kilometres along the trail from from Cape Reinga to Bluff Hill Motup≈çhue in Southland.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday morning - Sabbe's fourth day on the trail - he posted that he was 415km into his trail journey, but he and his support crew had been attacked by wild dogs.</p>
        
            <p>The attack happened on Sunday, and one of his support crew was bitten, and had fallen and broke his elbow,</p>
        
            <p>"Locals who were following brought [him] to the hospital, where he received first care," Sabbe posted.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope he heals well and that he can rejoin the adventure in a couple of days."</p>

            <p>Sabbe himself continued on his run on Monday, and was north of Warkworth by Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Before the attack, Sabbe had posted that he was overwhelmed by the local support he was receiving - including sampling a slice of home-made pizza along the way.</p>
        
            <p>The ultrarunner has hiked and run in many countries, including covering the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail, but said he was glad to return to New Zealand after a previous visit.</p>
        
            <p>Before the attack, he said he and the crew were feeling good about the trip: "It's ... a very unique place ... we're so excited to be ready for this FKT [Fastest Known Time] attempt."</p>
        
            <p>After the start of his attempt he posted footage of himself running along a long empty beach, and after reaching the first stretch of native bush on the trail, posted an update:</p>
        
            <p>"These sections are always very slow and difficult, but beautiful and peaceful. So I'm trying to see it as a dance with the forest, navigating between the roots and the trees on my way up and down.</p>
        
            <p>"So good fun - slow going, but good times."</p>
        
            <p>Recent ACC figures showed Northland had the country's proportionally highest number of dog attacks, with 427 claims in the 2022-23 year; or 5.88 dog related injuries per 100,000 people.</p>
