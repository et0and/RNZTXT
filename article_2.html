            <p>Residents in Te Karaka, inland from Gisborne in Tai Rāwhiti, are being asked to evacuate as the Waipaoa River rises.</p>
        
            <p>At about 6am on Sunday Tai Rāwhiti Civil Defence said the Waipaoa River level was creeping up to 7m.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone in a low lying area or anyone who felt unsafe should evacuate now, taking their whānau with them as well as pets and pet food supplies, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone else in the area should be prepare to evacuate if the river level reaches 7.5m.</p>
        
            <p>"Tairāwhiti Emergency Management and Māhaki Tiaki Tangata are closely watching the levels. We will update people as the situation changes," Tai Rāwhiti Civil Defence posted.</p>
        
            <p>Te Karaka Area School had been opened for anyone who needed somewhere to go and as the headquarters for iwi response team Mahaki Tiaki Tangata.</p>
        
            <p>A MetService heavy rain warning was extended until late Sunday morning for Tai Rāwhiti-Gisborne and the Wairoa District of Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"The rain may ease for a time between 7am and 9am then increase again before easing significantly late morning," forecasters said.</p>
        
            <p>The high rainfall could cause flooding and slips and driving conditions could be hazardous, while waterways could rise rapidly, MetService warned.</p>
        
            <p>The heavy rain and rain warning began on Friday, and up to 180mm had been forecast to fall in that time for some areas.</p>
        
            <p>However the region was vulnerable as it was already saturated, with significant downpours just two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight between Saturday and Sunday the Waipaoa River fell a little before rising again as the rain came back in, Tai Rāwhiti Civil Defence said.</p>
