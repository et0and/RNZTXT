            <p>However, the officials warned the event could be cancelled because of tense relations between Copenhagen and Washington, it added.</p>
        
            <p>The US State Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland from 2 to 4 April for talks with the new government of the semi-autonomous territory just days after a visit by US Vice President JD Vance.</p>
        
            <p>On his trip, Vance accused Denmark of not doing a good job of keeping the island safe and suggested the United States would better protect the strategically located island.</p>
