            <p>Self-made multi-millionaire farmer Allan Pye, known as the "Spud King", has passed away.</p>
        
            <p>Pye, who grew a vast potato farming empire on both sides of the Tasman, died on Saturday, aged 83, according to a death notice in his local paper, The Timaru Herald.</p>
        
            <p>A funeral service will be held at a South Canterbury farm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Pye left school at 14, leased two acres of land and started growing potatoes.</p>
        
            <p>Seven decades later, the Spud King's family business is estimated to be worth $1 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Pye gave a rare interview to the Herald, giving them a tour of one of his farms on the Canterbury Plains between Rakaia and Methven.</p>
        
            <p>The interview revealed a quiet, unassuming farming mogul with few interests outside of working the land and turning a profit.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no interest in playing golf, or bowls, or billiards; I just enjoy farming," he said several times during the interview.</p>
        
            <p>His South Canterbury farm, where he lived in a humble house, now amounts to almost 3000 hectares where he grew lots of spuds, carrots and other crops. He also owned nine dairy farms, milking 9000 cows.</p>
        
            <p>Despite his huge success, Pye eschewed many luxury items coveted by other wealthy businessmen like flash cars, big houses or international travel.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, he was never happier than when he was working on the farm.</p>
        
            <p>"I love sitting on a header. There's nothing more satisfying than sitting on a header and harvesting 10 to 12 tonne per hectare crop of wheat. It's better than anything. Sex is good but only lasts for a short time. Driving a header, it goes on all day and all night," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pye was born in the South Canterbury pottery town of Temuka in 1941.</p>
        
            <p>At 14, he left school and started growing potatoes.</p>
        
            <p>The determined, self-taught young farmer gained early success and kept slowly building his enterprise.</p>
        
            <p>The goal was always to make money, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems a bit stupid really, there should be something else in life than just money but that was important to me."</p>
        
            <p>And when asked how he likes his spuds, perhaps with a Sunday dinner, there are shades of shrimp enthusiast Bubba Blue in Forrest Gump.</p>
        
            <p>"I like spuds mashed, boiled, roasted... anyway at all," he smiled.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing better than spuds."</p>
