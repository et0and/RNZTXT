            <p>A new 'three-strikes' system will be introduced across Southland in a bid to clamp down on reckless recyclers.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the Waste Advisory Group approved the system which meant offenders who received three red tags in one calendar year would lose their bin.</p>
        
            <p>A report prepared for the meeting showed the contamination rate in recycling bins for the three years to 2022/23 was around 20 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023/24 alone, almost $340,000 was spent redirecting waste from recycling bins to landfill.</p>
        
            <p>Under the new system, offenders will have their recycling service suspended until they sign and return a reinstatement form.</p>
        
            <p>Southland District Council's strategic manager for water and waste, Grant Isaacs, said his council had not been able to enforce a three-strikes system in the past but had sent letters that proved effective.</p>
        
            <p>"Once they get that education and know what's happening, they get their act together," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Southland mayor Rob Scott told Local Democracy Reporting a large driver for the new system was cost.</p>
        
            <p>Just one bin of waste could contaminate an entire load of recycling, forcing it to divert to landfill, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If one person gets it wrong then it costs the rest of us."</p>
        
            <p>The new system will begin on 31 March and follows the reintroduction of bin inspections which began this month.</p>
        
            <p>It will only be rolled out in Invercargill and Southland, with Gore missing the cut due to not currently having a recycling service.</p>
        
            <p>Other councils around the country that have adopted similar approaches include Dunedin City Council, Tauranga City Council and Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>An update on the number of bins inspected and how people performed will be provided at a Waste Advisory Group meeting in April.</p>
