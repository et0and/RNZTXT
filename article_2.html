        <h2>What do the All Blacks coaches tell players on the fringes of selection?</h2>
        <p>
There are many reasons players get picked for the All Blacks, but what are the messages given to those on the edge of being selected?

            <p>There are many reasons players get picked for the All Blacks, but what are the messages given to those on the edge of being selected, or those in the squad that don't regularly feature?</p>
        
            <p>How do they crack into the starting side or matchday 23?</p>

            <p>One of those players is the Blues first-five come fullback Stephen Perofeta, who is currently sidelined with a calf injury and hoping to be back for the defending champions in round four of the Super Rugby season.</p>
        
            <p>Perofeta was first selected for the All Blacks in 2022, but due to injuries and form, he's only played six tests for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>So what does he need to do to become a regular in the All Blacks' game day side?</p>
        
            <p>Staying healthy and fit would be number one. He was in good form during last year's July series against England and produced two impressive performances at fullback before injury ruled him out of the Rugby Championship tests against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>He was picked again for the end of year tour and started at 15 in the win over Japan, but missed selection for the following test victory against England. He was on the bench for the win over Ireland but was left out of the side for the loss to France and the win over Italy.</p>

            <p>He's now dealing with a calf injury again and hoping to be back for the Blues in time to push his case for All Blacks selection in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"First and foremost for me is to get my body right, so I'm able to put my best foot forward," Perofeta told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether that be at first-five or fullback I don't mind, I can have an input in both positions and I'm easy either way.</p>
        
            <p>"For me to start for the Blues (ahead of Beauden Barrett and Harry Plummer) would be a big ask coming off a long injury. So getting rugby fit first is where I'm focused. The rest is in the coaches' hands."</p>
        
            <p>Perofeta admits it was frustrating being struck down by injury when he was starting to stamp his mark in the All Blacks' environment.</p>
        
            <p>"I like to have an optimistic view on it. There's definitely frustration with what's happened in the past with injuries, but I've learned to take it in my stride.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a bit of momentum loss when you're trying to get to playing back at that level (test rugby). There's always that aspect of frustration, but I try and channel it towards positive growth and getting back on the field."</p>
        
            <p>Perofeta said he learned a lot in the All Blacks camp last year under new coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"The main one was that the preparation at that level is at another level. Also, the opportunities on the field for a team. At international level there are far fewer chances to score or make big plays and if you miss too many of those opportunities, you won't get back to test footy again."</p>

            <p>Perofeta said he's been given some straightforward instructions on what parts of his game he needs to improve to achieve that dream, suggesting the All Blacks coaches see him primarily as a fullback.</p>
        
            <p>"I worked tightly with Jason Holland (All Blacks assistant coach) and he was very clear around the big rocks in my position if I'm playing at 15. The big rocks that I need - keep nailing and keep levelling up," Perofeta said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's being better under the high ball and in the in-air contest. With the rule changes and the way other test teams approach the kicking game, you have to be a real strength in the air as an outside back.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep working on my tactical kicks, positional kicks and general game awareness around how I can help our drivers, our midfielders and give information to them so that we're able to make space or take advantage of space. Those things are a big focus for me."</p>
        
            <p>Perofeta won't be available for the Blues this weekend against the Highlanders in Dunedin as the defending champs seek to bounce back from their opening round defeat to the Chiefs.</p>
