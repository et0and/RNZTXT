            <p>Breakers point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright has been charged with grabbing, pushing or mishandling a game official in their Christmas Day Australian NBL game.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened late in the fourth quarter of the Breakers' 97-82 loss to Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright was knocked to the floor by former Breaker Reuben Te Rangi with 3:33 remaining in Wednesday's game in Hobart. In response the American import got to his feet and charged at Te Rangi before referees stepped in.</p>
        
            <p>One official was knocked over while attempting to restrain Jackson-Cartwright.</p>
        
            <p>Their altercation was defused as the officials separated both players away from one another. Neither player was ejected from the game.</p>
        
            <p>The NBL Game Review Panel (GRP) has since completed its assessment of the incident and Jackson-Cartwright has been referred directly to a single member tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson-Cartwright will face the tribunal on Saturday evening and could face suspension.</p>
        
            <p>There is nothing explicit in the NBL's rules that prohibits players from touching match officials and players will frequently make light contact as they address a referee during basketball's regular stoppages.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers are on an eight-game losing streak and any time without Jackson-Cartwright - who is their leading point-scorer and one of the competition leaders in assists - will be a blow to their play-off chances.</p>
        
            <p>With 11 games to play in their regular season, the Breakers are two wins out of the top six, where they must finish to feature in the play-in tournament.</p>
        
            <p>The Breakers' next game is against the Cairns Taipans, who are the only side lower on the ladder than they are, on New Year's Eve.</p>
