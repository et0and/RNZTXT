            <p>A homicide investigation into the death of Abdul Nabizadah in Miramar, Wellington, last week has been launched by police.</p>
        
            <p>Nabizadah, 63, was found with serious head injuries at the intersection of Camperdown Rd and Totara Rd about 2.20am on 17 March.</p>
        
            <p>He was spotted by police carrying out an investigation after a serious burglary that happened a short distance away about 20 minutes earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Nabizadah passed away in hospital the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a post-mortem determined Nabizadah died as a result of blunt force injury after being assaulted, and further enquiries led to the investigation being upgraded to a homicide on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the investigation, police were urgently wanting to hear from two people who had earlier passed the street where Nabizadah was found.</p>
        
            <p>At 12.28am, a man was seen walking down Camperdown Rd from Totara St and turned right in to Darlington Rd from Totara St.</p>
        
            <p>The man was wearing a light-coloured top and dark pants.</p>
        
            <p>"We know Mr Nabizadah arrived in Totara Street in his silver-coloured Toyota Aqua, registration NQE681, at 12.25am, so this man may well have seen Mr Nabizadah and or his vehicle," Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge this person, or anyone who may know them, to come forward as soon as possible."</p>
        
            <p>At 1.30am, a man in fitness clothing or activewear was seen running south on Darlington Rd, before crossing the Camperdown Rd intersection.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing a blue shirt, and police also need to hear from him.</p>
        
            <p>Police investigators want to hear from any motorist who had dashcam footage and was in the Miramar area between midnight and 3am on 17 March, in particular anyone who travelled through the intersection of Totara St and Camperdown Rd.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if your footage shows no cars or people on the street, it's important that we see it," police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were continuing to investigate a "disturbing" burglary which happened near where Nabizadah was found.</p>
        
            <p>It is still unknown if these two events are linked.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two people found an intruder rummaging through their Darlington Road house at about 2am on 17 March.</p>
        
            <p>"During the burglary there was a physical altercation which caused an injury to the homeowner," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>Police have yet to locate this offender, who had been wearing gumboots and a white cap, and is described by witnesses as possibly being of MƒÅori descent, between 177-180cm tall and of and athletic build.</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard said investigators have been speaking with neighbours and reviewing evidence gathered at the scene, but have yet to establish a link between the burglary and the death of Nabizadah.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, police are continuing to carry out reassurance patrols in the Miramar area.</p>
        
            <p>"We know these events are upsetting and concerning for the community, but the investigation teams are working doggedly to get justice for the victims of the homicide and burglary, and their families. Police are providing ongoing support to both families," Pritchard said.</p>
