        <h2>Sewage doesn't put MP off swimming in Wellington Harbour</h2>
        <p>
Asked if he would swim in the harbour if there was sewage, Greg O'Connor said: "Yeah, I do." But Chris Hipkins said he "probably" would not.

            <p>Labour's Ōhāriu MP Greg O'Connor has launched a passionate defence of Wellington's vibrancy, declaring that he regularly swims in the harbour, unbothered by pollution or sewage warnings.</p>
        
            <p>The capital has seen a string of businesses call time in recent months, citing the economic downturn, public sector job cuts and city council decisions.</p>
        
            <p>But speaking to reporters at Parliament on Tuesday, O'Connor rejected the notion that Wellington was dying and said he would happily holiday there.</p>
        
            <p>He said he frequently visited the harbour and waterfront himself, and encouraged his constituents to do the same.</p>
        
            <p>"Just wander down and see what a great city we do have. That waterfront is fantastic. If it's windy, wrap up. If it's sunny, put some sunscreen on.</p>
        
            <p>"When I get visitors, I take them down there, and they just about always marvel at it."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether he was talking about the same harbour that got polluted when there was heavy rain, O'Connor said such comments were "typical".</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't stop people swimming in there, does it?" O'Connor said. "They've been advising people not to do that for years, but people have done it."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he personally would swim in the harbour if there was sewage overflow, O'Connor replied forcefully: "Yeah, I do. I do swim in the harbour. I'm not sure - I haven't seen any warnings lately, but I actually do, and I take my son out there. I love swimming in the harbour."</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor then queried why he was being asked about the topic when there were no current swimming bans along the waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>"Why bring all this up then? The positive is that you can swim in Wellington Harbour today... Good. Report that."</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday afternoon, Oriental Bay had an orange water quality rating, meaning caution was advised: "there may be an increased risk of illness for young children and older people".</p>
        
            <p>A no-swim notice was issued for part of Wellington Harbour in January after tests returned high results of the bacteria Enterococci, an indicator of faecal contamination.</p>
        
            <p>Following O'Connor's remarks, Labour leader Chris Hipkins was separately asked whether he would swim in the harbour despite a do-not-swim alert.</p>
        
            <p>A somewhat bemused Hipkins responded: "Probably not."</p>
