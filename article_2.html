It's farewell but not a complete goodbye for a craft store, which is closing its doors after 45 years. Audio

            <p>It's farewell but not goodbye for a long standing Auckland craft store, which is closing its doors after 45 years.</p>
        
            <p>Geoff's Emporium on Dominion Road was opened in 1980, by its namesake, Geoff Lamb.</p>
        
            <p>It's become an institution for some in Auckand, especially those on the hunt for some bargain fabric or arts and crafts projects.</p>

            <p>After nearly five decades, Geoff's son Derrol is shutting up shop on their flagship site to relocate to their Browns Bay site for semi-retirement.</p>
        
            <p>He co-owns the Emporium with his wife Heather, and told RNZ the community had been an integral part of his experience with the shop.</p>
        
            <p>"The old business has chugged along, I think initially we thought 'maybe six years, probably see us out,'. Forty years later we're still here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we announced the closing, the people who have come in and thanked us for being here, I always try to say 'well look, it's a double edged sword.'</p>
        
            <p>"It's thanks to them, otherwise, we wouldn't have lasted for as long as we did."</p>
        
            <p>Lamb said it would be tough to farewell the central Auckland site.</p>
        
            <p>"I've managed to keep myself so busy over the last two months, I really haven't had a chance to think about it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know when I close the door for the final time, it's going to be emotional, there's no doubt of that."</p>
        
            <p>
The store has catered for customers seeking knick knacks, costumes, fabrics or pieces for arts and crafts projects.

            <p>For the past 40 plus years, the shop had been a magnet for people seeking knick knacks, costumes, fabrics or pieces for arts and crafts projects.</p>
        
            <p>There was almost always a bargain of some sort - and the shop was regarded by some as an institution in the city.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very sad that it's closing, I'm going to miss it terribly," said one customer, "and there are fewer and fewer of these shops."</p>
        
            <p>Another said: "It's a great loss really, especially a lot of home sewers have shopped here for years."</p>
        
            <p>Kirstin Gedye has spent hours poring over the rows and rows of fabric in the shop.</p>
        
            <p>She travelled from Northland to check out the store one last time.</p>
        
            <p>"There's so many clothes that I've made from this place, I've spent hours here," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a textiles teacher, so I used to come as a teacher here to bring all the students."</p>
        
            <p>Gedye said it was a massive loss to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such an amazing shop, it's been such an important part of the community, we've actually come back from Northland just to come and have a look."</p>
        
            <p>But while the central city store is shutting down, customers could still get all their sewing needs from the North Shore location.</p>
