            <p>West Coast councillors are not happy after their own expert consultant expressed a view there was "no need" for a controversial sand mine proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Australian-based Tiga Minerals and Metals has applied for consent to operate a mineral sands mine on about 63 hectares of the Barrytown Flat, north of Greymouth.</p>
        
            <p>During the consent hearing, the council's own expert said "there is no need to extract minerals from that site" and raised concerns about the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>This sparked frustration from councillors, who said they were "pro the miners" and it was not the regional council's stance.</p>
        
            <p>A decision from a joint West Coast Regional and Grey District councils independent panel is due about 23 April.</p>
        
            <p>Regional council Resource Management Committee chairperson Brett Cummings said said he was concerned at the oppositional position taken by council's expert reporting officer during the hearing on 19 March.</p>
        
            <p>"He was saying the mine should not be going ahead. That's not our stance. It's not for him to make that call on behalf of the regional council," Cummings said.</p>
        
            <p>"All the councillors are pro the miners. It's not his decision to be passing comments like that."</p>
        
            <p>Cummings said he had canvassed all the other councillors.</p>
        
            <p>"None of us are happy with his stance."</p>
        
            <p>The council officer, a contracted consultant, spoke about his expert report on 19 March.</p>
        
            <p>The consultant argued "a functional need" was not present as the minerals sought were available elsewhere in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Hearing panel chairperson John Maassen questioned the officer's understanding of the "functional need" for the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>The consultant responded: "To me that means there is no need to extract minerals from that site."</p>
        
            <p>The council officer also said the proposal to install ancillary facilities within 100m of a wetland setback to protect the adjoining wetback during mining should be declined.</p>
        
            <p>"My recommendation is to refuse consent for that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed ancillary facilities include pumps and water infiltration wells to help protect and supplement the hydrology of Canoe Creek wetland.</p>
        
            <p>Cummings, a trained hearing commissioner and gold miner, said the officer should have taken a neutral approach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not (the reporting officer's) decision to be passing comments like that."</p>
        
            <p>Cummings said Crown agency NZ Petroleum and Minerals had already permitted the proposed mine area.</p>
        
            <p>"The government has decided it's ok to mine that area … We're in favour of the mine going ahead if it ticks all the boxes."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Peter Ewen said the expert's comments seemed extraordinary.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought he overstepped his mandate ... it was inappropriate," Ewen said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't come with a pre-determined view without hearing all the evidence. You're meant to be impartial. At the end of the day the commissioners will make their decision."</p>
        
            <p>On 3 April, West Coast Regional Council chief executive Darryl Lew said the reporting officer, an independent planning expert, was there on behalf of the council as the consenting body.</p>
        
            <p>"He has to abide by the code of ethics for planners … that must include not being biased in any way," Lew said.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue is some councillors are frustrated why this (proposal) can't just go ahead. But from a council officer's perspective, what we have to do is compare the application to the law."</p>
        
            <p>Lew said he would respond more fully in a written reply to LDR, but noted neither council management or councillors could influence the hearing panel's decision.</p>
        
            <p>Tiga's proposal had been declined once already, in 2022, due to insufficient supporting information.</p>
        
            <p>The fresh hearing panel for the proposal convened on 5 February.</p>
        
            <p>The Grey District Council's independent expert found the proposal "would have only a minor adverse effect on the amenity of neighbouring properties".</p>
        
            <p>A total of 357 submissions were received - 153 in support, 194 in opposition and nine either neutral or not stated.</p>
