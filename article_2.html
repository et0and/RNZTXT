            <p>The Employment Court has dismissed TVNZ's appeal to its earlier ruling in a case brought by E tū Union.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcaster appeared in the Employment Court in Auckland on Wednesday to appeal a ruling that it failed to consult with staff before cancelling programmes, including Sunday and Fair Go, and making about 70 employees redundant.</p>
        
            <p>E tū said a clause in its contract with TVNZ, specified employees needed to be involved in workplace changing decisions.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ lawyer Paul Wicks KC said the broadcaster's dire financial situation required labour savings of $10 million.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ chief operating officer Brent McAnulty told the court a downturn in revenue began at the start of 2023, and by November, all cost-savings had been "exhausted", apart from cutting jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were not made aware of the proposal until March 2024, McAnulty said, because they believed telling staff before the Christmas break would have had a "catastrophic impact on morale".</p>
        
            <p>The appeal ruling said in short, that yes, TVNZ did breach its collective agreement by not letting staff know about its plans.</p>
        
            <p>In her ruling, Chief judge Christina Inglis said TVNZ must comply with clause 10.1.1 of the agreement within 20 working days.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
