            <p>The first liquidator's report on failed online food retailer Supie has shown the company and its related companies Workerly and Bevie owed $2.1 million to over 4000 creditors.</p>
        
            <p>Creditors include companies from NZ Post to Sealord, Tegel, Warehouse Stationery, Foodstuffs and Woolworths, Fonterra and Coca Cola.</p>
        
            <p>Released on Thursday evening, the report shows Inland Revenue is owed almost $900,000.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the companies' former staff have been paid owed wages thanks to an anonymous donation but the report shows 89 of the 122 staff are still owed $120,000 in outstanding wages and holiday pay. They received no redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>Supie had $179,000 in the bank on the day it went into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>The independent virtual supermarket was set up in 2021 by director Sarah Balle in an attempt to disrupt the two major supermarkets.</p>
        
            <p>But the report cites a lack of sales and scale as a contributor to the company's demise on 30 October.</p>
        
            <p>This is despite Balle's claims the company had 60,000 customers on its database.</p>
        
            <p>Administrator Richard Nacey from PWC was not available for an interview on Checkpoint.</p>
