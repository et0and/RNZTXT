            <p>Tami Neilson, the Canadian born/ NZ-based country singer, has broken new ground for Kiwi country music - she has been welcomed into Willie Nelson’s tribe. </p>
        
            <p>Last year we heard the beautiful duet she sang with Willie ‘Beyond the Stars’, and that song is now part of a collection of Willie Nelson covers that Tami recorded in Willie’s studio in Texas. </p>
        
            <p>It’s a dream come true, but I feel like we’ve been saying that a lot lately about Tami, who is about to play country music's greatest stage - the Grand Ole Opry and later the iconic Dollywood.</p>
        
            <p>Neilson sings Nelson was released just yesterday.</p>
