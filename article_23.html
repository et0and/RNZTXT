            <p>Formed in 1974, The Stranglers are one of the longest-surviving and successful bands to have originated in the UK punk scene.</p>
        
            <p>They stood out for their musicianship, their often aggressive or confrontational attitude, and their ability to evolve musically over time.</p>
        
            <p>Despite line up changes, including the passing of founding keyboardist Dave Greenfield in 2020, the band has maintained a loyal fan base and remained active for decades.</p>
        
            <p>The Stranglers return to New Zealand next month for the ‘Fifty Years In Black’ anniversary tour.</p>
