            <p>Christchurch composer Eva Bedggood is based in Melbourne these days, but NZ Trio will premiere her latest work back in her hometown.</p>
        
            <p>Bedggood's new piece is part of the trio's latest tour, Triptych 3: Untamed Hope, which will take it to thirteen centres around the country, starting with Christchurch on 10 October. The programme also includes music by Fanny Mendelssohn, Joan Tower and Ethel Smyth.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump spoke with Bedggood about the new piece, life in Melbourne and whether composing has taken over from her other musical talents, playing the trumpet and the piano.</p>
