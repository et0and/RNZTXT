            <p>It's over two hundred years old, but there's still more to be discovered about Beethoven's Emperor Concerto.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese-born Haochen Zhang will make his New Zealand debut playing the composer's 5th Piano Concerto with the Auckland Philharmonia this week.</p>
        
            <p>Zhang spoke with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump ahead of the concert. Crump wanted to know how he made such a well-known piece of music his own.</p>
        
            <p>Zhang told Crump that as he's got older and wiser, he's looked less at stamping his own personality on a performance, and focused more on discovering the sometimes hidden wonders of Beethoven's music.</p>

            <p>There are new things for Zhang discover with every performance of the Emperor Concerto, and those discoveries are a constant source of joy.</p>
        
            <p>Zhang regards Beethoven as one of music's most "honest" creators, and if he can be just as honest in turn as a performer, then he's doing his job.</p>
        
            <p>And if Beethoven's Emperor is a bit too brash for you, try Zhang's version of its opposite twin, Beethoven's 4th concerto.</p>
