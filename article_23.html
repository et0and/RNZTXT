            <p>For the first time since RNZ moved out of Broadcasting House to its current Wellington office, RNZ Concert has a new broadcast mixing desk.</p>
        
            <p>That's 27 years.</p>
        
            <p>A tribute to the previous mixing machine - and those who maintained it, right up to a few weeks ago - can be seen below.</p>

            <p>The new digital desk replaces old analogue technology and brings many improvements for presenters as well as better connections with other places such as live performances or broadcasting from other locations. It also allowed for a complete refit of Concert's Wellington studio, which meant our announcers broadcast out of temporary digs in the drama studio for a couple of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>That gave us the chance to set up and familiarise ourselves with the new desk with minimum on-air drama.</p>
        
            <p>Then, over the last weekend of May, the RNZ technical team moved the whole thing to its permanent home.</p>
        
            <p>Big thanks to Wayne Jarvis, who not only sorted the technical side, but fashioned a new tabletop out of a beautiful piece of polished macrocarpa. Wayne, it's a work of art.</p>
        
            <p>Also thanks to Shaun Wharton, Sam Smaill, Blair Stagpoole, Steve Burridge and Concert's on-air presentation lead, Clarissa Dunn.</p>
