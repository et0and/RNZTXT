        <h2>Realising a dying man's wish: recording Matt Dibble's 24 Preludes & Fugues</h2>
        <p>
When his close friend Matt Dibble died suddenly, Jon Hargreaves was determined to realise Matt's dream to have his preludes and fugues recorded by the pianist Freddy Kempf. Video, Audio

            <p>Matt Dibble was a shining star in the London music scene.</p>
        
            <p>He played sax and clarinet, mixed in jazz, classical and klezmer  circles, and quietly - just like JS Bach - was writing 24 preludes and fugues for the keyboard.</p>

            <p>Then in 2021, barely into his 40s, Dibble died of complications from a massive stroke after receiving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination.</p>
        
            <p>During his last few days in hospital, Dibble told his mother about the set of preludes and fugues he'd been writing.</p>
        
            <p>Few knew about these pieces, but someone who did was his close friend, the composer and conductor Jon Hargreaves. Matt had also told Hargreaves that it was his dream to have the great pianist Freddy Kempf record them.</p>
        
            <p>Hargreaves, who is the partner of New Zealand conductor Holly Mathieson, took it upon himself to lead the crowdfunding and facilitation of the project.</p>
        
            <p>Most importantly, he asked Freddy Kempf if he would record them. Even more crucially, Kempf said yes.</p>
        
            <p>It's not difficult to hear why. Just listen to Kempf playing Dibble's "Prelude and Fugue on F-sharp".</p>
        
            <p>Hargreaves spoke to RNZ Concert host David Morriss about his dear friend, and his final gift to him.</p>
        
            <p>Hargreaves told Morriss while Dibble was a man who was full of life and energy, he kept his composing side mostly to himself.</p>
        
            <p>He'd been writing the preludes and fugues for years, but not many people knew.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily for us all, we know now.</p>
