            <p>God bless our land, in every generation,
God bless our people, growing as one nation,
God bless our islands, home and whenua,
Aotearoa, Aotearoa

God give us hope in common cause and caring,
each bringing treasures, baskets for the sharing,
grieving the wrongs of history no more –
Aotearoa, Aotearoa

God bless our land, its beauty and its blending
into communities of warm befriending,
proud in the cultures settled on our shore –
Aotearoa, Aotearoa

God bless the child whose feet are firmly planted
here in our place of freedoms daily granted,
seedbed and soil for peace and aroha –
Aotearoa, Aotearoa</p>

            <p>How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him,
Who brings good news, good news,
Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness:
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
Refrain:
Our God reigns (x 3)

Waste places of Jerusalem break forth with joy
Shout for your king, your king
The Lord has saved and comforted his people
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
Refrain:
Our God reigns (x 3)

Ends of the earth, see the salvation of your God
Jesus is Lord, is Lord
Before the nations He has bared His holy arm
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
Refrain:
Our God reigns (x 3)</p>

            <p>Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,
when the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
will your anchor drift, or firm remain?
Refrain:
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
steadfast and sure while the billows roll;
fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
grounded firm and deep in the Saviour’s love!

Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear,
when the breakers roar and the reef is near?
While the surges rage, and the wild winds blow,
shall the angry waves then your barque o'erflow?
Refrain:

Will your eyes behold through the morning light
the city of gold and the harbour bright?
Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore,
when life's storms are past for evermore?
Refrain:</p>

            <p>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Alleluia.
Amen</p>

            <p>Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
the darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away.
Change and decay in all around I see.
O Lord who changes not, abide with me.

I fear no foe with you at hand to bless,
though ills have weight, and tears their bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</p>
        
            <p>Artist: Titahi Bay Gospel Chapel congregation
Words/Music: Romans Ch 8/Felicia Edgecombe
Recording: Private 2428</p>
        
            <p>Nothing now can separate us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus.
Not trouble, nor poverty, nor danger, nor death;
For in all these things
we can be conquerors through Jesus;
Nothing can separate us from his love.

Jesus you were human,
and you understand my weakness;
my disappointments, loneliness and fear.
And you’ve been there before me,
You have suffered all those hard things.
Please turn me around and lead me on.

When I look around me,
l see everyone has troubles,
and all of nature’s subject to decay.
So how I long for freedom
from its frailty and its bondage,
now living with Christ in full control.

Spirit comes to help us,
and he bears us up in weakness;
he pleads for us according to God’s will.
He gives us faith to see God
working in our lives for good
thus making us sons, setting us free.</p>
