        <h2>Terence Dennis: First choice accompanist</h2>
        <p>
Terence Dennis is a busy man. Having just performed with all ten of this year's Lexus Song Quest semi-finalists, the country's go-to accompanist is preparing to do it again for the final this weekend. RNZ's Bryan Crump caught up with him between gigs. Audio

            <p>Terence Dennis is a busy man.</p>
        
            <p>Having just performed with all ten of this year's Lexus Song Quest semi-finalists, the country's go-to accompanist is preparing to do it again for the final this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It's not quite 'just another day at the office' but Dennis has been accompanying contestants in the final rounds of the Lexus since before it was sponsored by Lexus. Since 1991, to be precise.</p>
        
            <p>Bryan Crump spoke with Dennis between gigs on RNZ Concert, asking - among other things - how he divides his energy evenly and fairly between the contestants, why he enjoys accompanying so much, and what he does when he's not playing the piano.</p>

            <p>Turns out one pastime still involves music: he's President of the Wagner Society of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>When Dennis really wants a break, he turns to stamps. He's on the expert committee of the Royal Philatelic Society of New Zealand where he helps to assess and verify New Zealand's oldest stamps.</p>
        
            <p>He also goes to the gym. </p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy that immensely. Keep my body moving at my age," he laughs. </p>
        
            <p>It might be another key to his extraordinary stamina.</p>
        
            <p>"The body's a machine. The better you can keep it, the better it likes you."</p>
        
            <p>That stamina will once again be on display at the Michael Fowler Centre this Saturday 3 August. You can listen to the RNZ Concert live broadcast of the Lexus Song Quest Final from 7.30pm.</p>
