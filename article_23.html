            <p>O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works thy hand hath made.
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Refrain:
Then sings my soul, my saviour God, to thee;
How great thou art, how great thou art!

And when I think that God, his son not sparing,
Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin:
Refrain

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then shall I bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art!

            <p>The King of love my shepherd is,
whose goodness faileth never.
I nothing lack if I am his,
and he is mine forever.

Where streams of living water flow,
my ransomed soul he leadeth;
and where the verdant pastures grow,
with food celestial feedeth.

Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
but yet in love he sought me;
and on his shoulder gently laid,
and home, rejoicing, brought me.

In death's dark vale I fear no ill,
with thee, dear Lord, beside me;
thy rod and staff my comfort still,
thy cross before to guide me.

Thou spreadst a table in my sight;
thy unction grace bestoweth;
and oh, what transport of delight
from thy pure chalice floweth!

And so through all the length of days,
thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise
within thy house forever.</p>

            <p>Te Karakia O Te Atua
(The Lord’s Prayer)
E tō mātou Matua i te rangi
(Our Parent in the spirit world)
Kia tapu tou Ingoa
(Sacred is your Name)
Kia tae mai tou rangatira-tanga.
(Bring us Your Chiefly rule);
Kia meatia tau e pai ai
(May it happen in the way that is to You, good)
ki runga i te whenua,
(may it happen on earth)
kia rite ano ki to te rangi.
(In the same way as in spirit world).
Homai ki a mātou aianei
(Give us now)
he taro mā mātou mo tēnei ra.
(The food we need this day).
Murua o mātou hara
(Strip us of our sins);
Me mātou hoki e muru nei
(Give us back what we have lost);
i o te hunga e hara ana ki a mātou.
(So that we, the slaves of sin, may be with you again).
Aua hoki mātou e kawea kia whaka-waia;
(Do not lead us into temptation);
Engari whaka-orangia mātou, i te kino:
(May we be whole, away from things evil);
Nou hoki te rangatira-tanga,
(Through your chiefly position, is)
te kaha,
(the power)
me te kororia,
(and the glory).
Ake, ake, ake.
(Forever and ever)
Āmine.
(Amen)</p>

            <p>O God, you search me and you know me
All my thoughts lie open to your gaze
When I walk or lie down you are before me:
Ever the maker and keeper of my days.

You know my resting and my rising
You discern my purpose from afar
And with love everlasting you besiege me:
In ev'ry moment of life or death, you are.

Before a word is on my tongue, Lord,
You have known its meaning through and through.
You are with me beyond my understanding:
God of my present, my past and future, too.

Although your Spirit is upon me,
Still I search for shelter from your light.
There is nowhere on earth I can escape you:
Even the darkness is radiant in your sight.

For you created me and shaped me,
Gave me life within my mother's womb.
For the wonder of who I am, I praise you:
safe in your hands, all creation is made new.</p>

            <p>Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,
Praise him, all creatures here below,
Praise him above, ye heavenly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

            <p>God, that madest earth and heaven,
darkness and night,
who the day for toil has given,
for rest the night;
may thine angel-guards defend us,
slumber sweet thy mercy send us,
holy dreams and hope attend us,
this livelong night.

Guard us waking, guard us sleeping;
and, when we die,
may we in thy mighty keeping
all peaceful lie;
when the last dread call shall wake us,
do not thou our God forsake us,
but to reign in glory take us
with thee on high.</p>

            <p>Ye holy angels bright,
who wait at God's right hand,
or through the realms of light
fly at your Lord's command,
assist our song,
for else the theme
too high doth seem
for mortal tongue.

You blessed souls at rest,
who ran this earthly race
and now, from sin released,
behold your saviour's face,
his praises sound,
as in his sight
with sweet delight
you do abound.

You saints, who toil below,
adore your heavenly King,
and onward as ye go
some joyful anthem sing;
take what he gives
and praise him still,
through good or ill,
who ever lives.

My soul, bear thou thy part,
triumph in God above:
and with a well-tuned heart
sing thou the songs of love!
Let all thy days
till life shall end,
whate'er he send,
be filled with praise!</p>

            <p>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path

When I feel afraid
Think I've lost my way
Still you're there right beside me
And nothing will I fear
As long as you are near
Please be near me to the end

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path

I will not forget
Your love for me and yet
My heart forever is wandering
Jesus be my guide
And hold me to your side
I will love you to the end
Nothing will I fear as long as you are near
Please be near me to the end

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
And a light unto my path
You're the light unto my path</p>

            <p>O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace! [last line x 4]

My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread thro' all the earth abroad
the honours of thy name. [last line x 4]

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease,
that bids our sorrows cease,
'tis music in the sinner's ears,
'tis life and health and peace. [last line x 4]

In Christ, your head, you then shall know,
shall feel your sins forgiven,
shall feel your sins forgiven,
Anticipate your heaven below
And own that love is heaven. [last line x 4]</p>
