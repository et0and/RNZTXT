Not quite beneath the stars, but there'll certainly be more than ten guitars.

            <p>Summer is the time for summer music schools, and if you're into fretted strings, Nelson is the place to go in January.</p>
        
            <p>Dominique Blatti is excited to be co-directing the 2025 Classical Guitar Summer School at the cityâ€™s Centre of Musical Arts, especially as one of the school's tutors is the Australian-born virtuoso, Craig Ogden.</p>
        
            <p>If you're wondering why she's so excited about Ogden, have a look at this.</p>
        
            <p>Blatti and fellow director Miles Jackson have also been able to enlist the talents of English guitarist Vincent Lindsey-Clark and French-born Ingrid Riollot, while fellow New Zealander Julian Raphael will be in charge of firing up the general musical skills of participants each day.</p>

            <p>The School begins on Saturday 11 January and runs until Friday 17. There are concerts on the last three days of the event, culminating with a public performance by all of the participants on the final night.</p>
        
            <p>Blatti, originally from near Geneva in the Swiss-speaking part of Switzerland, moved to New Zealand because her dairy farming parents wanted to have their own farm.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to uproot three teenage daughters from Europe and bring them to Taranaki initially didn't go down well with the children.</p>
        
            <p>However, Blatti decided to stay close to her parents and now lives by the sea with her New Plymouth-raised partner.</p>

            <p>It turns out Taranaki is a great place to be a classical guitarist (she initially organised summer schools in New Plymouth).</p>
        
            <p>Blatti is also lead singer of a French cafe ensemble Le Mer, and performs regularly with Julian Raphael who (when not playing classical guitar) has been a passionate advocate of a capella and community singing, first in Wellington and now in New Plymouth.</p>
