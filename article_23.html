            <p>Although the brothers admit to being naturally competitive (in sport or chess, for example), when it comes to singing it's a different story.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all quite into it, and it's a pretty tricky world to live in [being a singer]," says Alfred, "and so I think we've always been supportive of each other.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess there is a friendly rivalry here and there, but... it's a tricky sort of craft to master. We're always trying to figure out ways together to develop and get better every day." </p>
