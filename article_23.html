        <h2>Vote now for Settling the Score 2024</h2>
        <p>
Tell us about the classical music you love, and why, here.
Then listen to the radio on Labour Day as RNZ Concert celebrates New Zealand's most-loved classical music for 2024.
</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's classic countdown is a fun way for you to share the classical music you love with our radio audience, and for new listeners to find out a bit more about both the music and the radio station. There is more information about Settling the Score 2024 below the voting form.</p>
        
            <p>On the voting form your first three selections are made from a drop-down list compiled from previous popular STS music choices.</p>
        
            <p>This 'short list' helps more people join in by prompting them with the names of composers and pieces. It also helps us to deliver a day of guaranteed audience favourites. Without a list, we end up with thousands of different pieces each receiving only a small number of votes.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a 'free choice' where you can type in a favourite piece that is not on the short list. These pieces make up the selection broadcast between 6 - 8pm on Labour Day, can be included in next year's short list, and are considered for further broadcast on RNZ Concert.</p>
        
            <p>While you are voting, you can choose to enter the draw for passes to 2025 concerts courtesy of our friends at NZ Trio, New Zealand String Quartet, Orchestra Wellington or the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra 
There are also RNZ Concert drink bottles up for grabs - a limited-edition collector's item for the discerning fan!
(Please note: Tickets are for entry to a qualifying performance only. Any related costs such as travel are the responsibility of the ticket holder.) </p>
