            <p>It may be an inconvenient truth, but if you want to make a living in the classical music world without being in the thrall of the church, an aristocrat or a government, it pays to be able to demonstrate a little razzle dazzle.</p>
        
            <p>Maksim Mrvica has it in spades - or ebony and ivory, to be precise.</p>
        
            <p>The Croatian classical crossover pianist rips into his work with gusto, good looks and plenty of amplification.</p>
        
            <p>And if it was good enough for Paganini and Liszt, why not Mrvica?</p>
        
            <p>The 48-year-old pianist is embarking on a tour down under, which will see him reach Auckland's Civic Theatre on March 21st complete with drum, bass, his own orchestra, a light show and a powerful PA system.</p>
        
            <p>But, speaking with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Mrvica acknowledged he was a "classical purist" earlier in his career.</p>
        
            <p>So what happened?</p>
        
            <p>"When I was studying with teachers I was a classical puritan, but afterwards I was trying to find some other way to present classical music. I would still play classical repertoire, but I would change the scenery on the stage, so I would have like a light show with lasers... I would play Rachmaninov piano concerto with orchestra but I would have a laser show while I was playing."</p>
        
            <p>The pyrotechnic touch possibly came from Mrvica's taste for rave music, but soon he was going beyond adding lights. He wanted to change up the music itself.</p>

            <p>A typical Mrvica show involves arrangements of classical tunes for a rock orchestra, and rock tunes arranged for his classical piano.</p>
        
            <p>And for every one of the 'purists' who struggles with the Mrvica approach, he'll find you mums and dads who will vouch for his shows getting their offspring into classical music.</p>
        
            <p>"I have so many parents who are coming after my shows and they tell me that I inspire their children to practise more."</p>
        
            <p>Given Mrvica grew up dodging shells and bullets during Croatia's war with Serbia, perhaps he's earned the right to play music the way he wants to.</p>
        
            <p>"It was for four or five years and it was really difficult, so a lot of the time was just spent in the basement hiding and hoping the bombs will not get us."</p>
        
            <p>In such an extreme situation, music became a touchstone for hope.</p>
        
            <p>"Me and my teacher, we would go to the music school in the basement and we would practice for hours. I think it was a kind of oasis for us to escape the horrible environment that we lived in, so I think this period had a lot of impact and made me more determined to become what I always wanted to be."</p>
        
            <p>And when he's not on stage, what piano music does Mrvica play for himself at home?</p>
        
            <p>"Chopin," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Even today when I want to sit, for my soul and myself, I almost never play crossover music, I play classical."</p>
