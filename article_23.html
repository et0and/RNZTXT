        <h2>The amazing sound of the recorder: from sopranino to baroque bass</h2>
        <p>
Recorder specialist Kamala Bain brings a selection of her instruments into the RNZ Concert studio, from the little sopranino recorder to the baroque bass recorder, and gives us a taste of what a recorder can sound like in the hands of an expert. Audio

            <p>She spoke with RNZ Concert's Bryan Crump about the different types of recorder, and why she keeps a hot water bottle in her instrument bag alongside the wooden instruments.</p>
        
            <p>"Recorders speak much better if they're warm - they don't really like the chill in the Wellington air particularly. They tend to clog and fog up if they're feeling a bit chilly."</p>

            <p>The recorder was Kamala's first instrument.</p>
        
            <p>"I started, like many people, at primary school... I'm sometimes am amazed that I continued, because we used to play on the asphalt in the summer, in small circles, with a child leading these small circles."</p>
        
            <p>"So I think by Standard 2... I was already leading a group, and it was a cacophony of sound because each group was playing something different at the same time outside!"</p>
        
            <p>"But I really loved [the recorder] and... continued playing."</p>
        
            <p>Kamala also demonstrated playing two recorders at once, as well as a variety of 'extended techniques' - non-traditional ways of playing to produce unusual sounds and effects, such as multiphonics (producing several notes at once) on a single instrument.</p>
