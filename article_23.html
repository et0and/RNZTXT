            <p>English sonic experimenter, producer, and composer Jon Hopkins has always approached his music with a clear sense of intention. His latest record, RITUAL, exemplifies this meticulous approach, serving as a deep dive into his extensive musical background. </p>
        
            <p>In a recent conversation from his East London home studio, Hopkins spoke with Maggie Tweedie about his creative workspace, designed to be "creatively nourishing." This studio is not just a place of work but a sanctuary where time seems to stand still. Hopkins has carefully curated the environment to suit his artistic needs, opting for a palette of various shades of purple, violet, and bright green, complemented by candlelight. This choice, he explains, helps to counteract his sensitivity to fluorescent lights and sets a contemplative tone for recording. “It’s quiet, very well padded and timeless,” he describes, underscoring the importance of a supportive environment in his creative process. </p>
        
            <p>Hopkins’ previous record, Music for Psychedelic Therapy (2021), was crafted under unusual circumstances—recorded inside a cave in Ecuador. “We didn't see daylight really for three days,” he recalls. The only light came from candles and head torches, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that paradoxically proved to be calming and conducive to creativity. The experience highlights Hopkins’ unique approach to music-making, drawing inspiration from both natural and man-made environments. </p>
        
            <p>His latest project, RITUAL, was inspired by an immersive installation in London called Dream Machine. This project involved audiences lying in a circle, listening to music while stroboscopic lights flashed above them. “There’s a phenomenon called the flicker effect,” Hopkins explains. “When stratospheric lights flash on closed eyelids, the human brain creates extraordinary images and geometric patterns.” The experience of this installation left a profound impact on him, prompting him to revisit the project and explore its potential as a full-length album. </p>
        
            <p>In RITUAL, each track is prefaced with the word “Part,” suggesting that the album is conceived as a cohesive whole rather than a collection of individual pieces. “The truth is it is one piece,” Hopkins admits, “but if I released a single 41-minute piece into the world, I don’t think anyone would listen to it.” This approach reflects his vision of the album as a unified artistic expression, despite the practicality of dividing it into separate tracks for listeners. </p>
        
            <p>Though RITUAL does not fit neatly into the ambient genre, Hopkins acknowledges its influence. He suggests that the term “ambient” can be subjective, likening it to an aroma in a room—something that permeates but is not always immediately identifiable. The opening track, titled “Altar,” sets the tone for the album by creating a collective breath, a psychological and physical preparation for the musical journey ahead. </p>

            <p>After two decades in the music industry, Hopkins is increasingly embracing collaboration. RITUAL features a rich tapestry of sounds, including beautiful crystal bowls and the vocals of musician and medicine woman Vylana. He has also borrowed modular synthesisers and vintage synths from friends, highlighting a shift towards a more collaborative and fluid approach to music-making. “It’s a very productive and joyful way to work,” he reflects. “It encourages a certain liberation in the music-making process.” </p>
        
            <p>Critics often compare Hopkins to Brian Eno, citing him as the “future Brian Eno.” A compliment he suggests is flattering but not accurate. Eno’s influence on Hopkins is undeniable, particularly in teaching him the basics of creative freedom and the joy of music-making. “Before meeting Brian Eno,” Hopkins recalls, “I assumed the artist would be very professorial and precise. Actually, he’s quite the opposite—very funny and not very serious. He just really loves to play around.” </p>
