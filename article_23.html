            <p>There aren't too many instruments that you have to play seated, but the cello is usually one of them.</p>
        
            <p>Yet Heleen du Plessis, who teaches the instrument at Otago University, is about to embark on a concert she hopes will make people want to get on their feet.</p>
        
            <p>Du Plessis and seven other Dunedin cellists are joining forces with the Dunedin City Jazz Orchestra led by sax player Nick Cornish, for a gig titled "Be Moved! A Musical Journey of Heart and Soul".</p>
        
            <p>Talking with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, du Plessis said the concert was the embodiment of the "'Kama Muta Experience", a Hindi phrase best translated as the sounds that give you goosebumps, or a thrill you experience in the bosom of your chest.</p>
        
            <p>She also told Crump about her own battles to overcome chronic pain, and why that's made her value her physical wellbeing and a musician - and the importance of moving to music - even more.</p>
