</p>
        
            <p>It doesn't get much grimmer.</p>
        
            <p>A young gay man in his prime is abducted, chained to a fence, beaten and left to die.</p>
        
            <p>The murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998 in Laramie, Wyoming, sparked a debate in the United States about hate crime against members of the nation's rainbow community.</p>
        
            <p>It also moved the composer Craig Hella Johnson to write an oratorio.</p>
        
            <p>Exactly 26 years after his death, the combined youth choirs of Wellington and Christchurch will perform "Considering Matthew Shepard" in Wellington's Cathedral of St Paul.</p>
        
            <p>It's not just a major musical event, but also continues Wellington Youth Choir's kaupapa of centring queer artists and stories.</p>
        
            <p>Singers Etienne Wain and Herbert Zielinski joined RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump to talk about the piece, and why it matters so much to the choir.</p>
