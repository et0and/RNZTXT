            <p>The instruments are getting bigger - from violin to viola now. And Zephyr Wills is wielding it. He actually plays a few instruments, but for this recital he sticks with his favourite classical music instrument. Zephyr studied at the New Zealand School of Music under Gillian Ansell. He is joined by young pianist Otis Prescott-Mason.</p>

            <p>And now we’re moving on to the last musician in this programme. And the instrument is getting bigger again. We have a cellist now: Begonia Chan, who came back to NZ just recently and now plays with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra. She's joined by pianist Stephen De Pledge. </p>
