            <p>At the same time she was building her reputation as DJ Tina Turntables, firstly on a small underground station Fleet FM, and then for Auckland student radio bFM, predominantly on the Sunday afternoon soul show Back On The Goodfoot. </p>
        
            <p>She has DJ’d every kind of party, from outdoor festivals to dive bars, including after parties for Peaches, Fleetwood Mac, Prince, The Black Keys, and The Rolling Stones. </p>
        
            <p>Since moving to Ōtepoti she calls herself very lucky to be working as the manager of the student radio station, Radio One. </p>
