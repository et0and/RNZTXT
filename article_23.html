            <p>American Songwriter Bill Callahan has been writing music under the name Smog and his own name since the early 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>His distinctive baritone voice and melancholy songs often sound like poems set to music.</p>
        
            <p>Last year while on tour celebrating his album Reality, they made a recording of their live show in Chicago. The result, a live album Resuscitate! that explodes some of his best loved songs. </p>
        
            <p>Charlotte speaks to Bill Callahan about the special qualities of the live album and how he finds musical inspiration. </p>
