        <h2>New Horizons: A Tribute to Henry Mancini</h2>
        <p>
William Dart salutes Henry Mancini, born 100 years ago, a man whose music provided a stylish backdrop for the best of America's more conservative popular culture. Audio

            <p>William Dart interviewed singer Monica Mancini, the daughter of Henry Mancini in 2003 – she was in NZ to perform with the Auckland Philharmonia and she was worried that her set might be a bit ballad-heavy. He suggested she might consider her father's little-known bar-room belter 'He Shouldn't-A, Hadn't-A, Oughtn't-A Swang On Me' as a possible uptempo number and she remarked, "Boy, you really are a fan aren't you!"</p>
        
            <p>She was right and now William Dart salutes Henry Mancini, born 100 years ago, a man whose music provided a stylish backdrop for the best of America's mainstream popular culture.</p>
