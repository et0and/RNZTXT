            <p>Te Karakia O Te Atua
(The Lord’s Prayer)
E tō mātou Matua i te rangi
(Our Parent in the spirit world)
Kia tapu tou Ingoa
(Sacred is your Name)
Kia tae mai tou rangatira-tanga.
(Bring us Your Chiefly rule);
Kia meatia tau e pai ai
(May it happen in the way that is to You, good)
ki runga i te whenua,
(may it happen on earth)
kia rite ano ki to te rangi.
(In the same way as in spirit world).
Homai ki a mātou aianei
(Give us now)
he taro mā mātou mo tēnei ra.
(The food we need this day).
Murua o mātou hara
(Strip us of our sins);
Me mātou hoki e muru nei
(Give us back what we have lost);
i o te hunga e hara ana ki a mātou.
(So that we, the slaves of sin, may be with you again).
Aua hoki mātou e kawea kia whaka-waia;
(Do not lead us into temptation);
Engari whaka-orangia mātou, i te kino:
(May we be whole, away from things evil);
Nou hoki te rangatira-tanga,
(Through your chiefly position, is)
te kaha,
(the power)
me te kororia,
(and the glory).
Ake, ake, ake.
(Forever and ever)
Āmine.
(Amen)</p>
        
            <p>Where mountains rise to open skies
your name, O God, is echoed far,
from island beach to kauri's reach,
in water's light, in lake and star.

Your people's heart, your people's part
be in our caring for this land,
for faith to flower, for aroha
to let each other's mana stand.

From broken word, from conflict stirred,
from lack of vision, set us free
to see the line of your design,
to feel creation's energy.

Your love be known, compassion shown,
that every child have equal scope:
in justice done, in trust begun
shall be our heritage and hope.

Where mountains rise to open skies
your way of peace distil the air,
your spirit bind all humankind,
one covenant of life to share!</p>

            <p>God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and show us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us;
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God; yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth make forth her increase; and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.
Amen.</p>

            <p>Give to our God immortal praise:
mercy and truth are all his ways;
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat his mercies in your song.

Give to the Lord of lords renown;
the King of kings with glory crown:
his mercies ever shall endure,
when lords and kings are known no more.

He built the earth, he spread the sky,
and fixed the starry lights on high:
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat his mercies in your song.

He sent His Son with power to save
from guilt and darkness and the grave;
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat his mercies in your song.</p>

            <p>Pāora tino toa, o te Atua nui
Kei ā koe te rama o te aroha
Mā te Kāraiti, i tau māu Hei whakapupuri, māu ki ētahi mātou
Hato Pāora āu tama āwhinatia mai
I te whāwhai māia, me te whāwhai pai
Ki te whakamutu kaha, i te whakataetae
Ko te hiahia me noho te Kāriti ki roto
I a mātou, me e whakarongo ki āu kupu
Whaia tōnu rā te tika, whaia, whaia ake nei</p>
        
            <p>[Paul, warrior of God
You who carry the light of love
Descending from Christ to you
To hold and share with us
St Paul, be with us
In our struggles in pursuit of what is right and just
Our efforts will be without end
For our desire is for Christ’s presence
And to heed his words
To pursue the path, the path of righteousness.]</p>

            <p>"Great is thy faithfulness," O God my Father,
There is no shadow of turning with thee;
Thou changest not, thy compassions, they fail not;
As thou hast been thou forever wilt be.

Refrain:
"Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness!"
Morning by morning new mercies I see:
All I have needed thy hand hath provided,
"Great is thy faithfulness," Lord unto me!

Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
Refrain:

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!

            <p>For all the saints, who from their labours rest;
who thee by faith before the world confessed,
thy Name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Thou wast their rock, their fortress and their might;
thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

O blest communion, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
the saints triumphant rise in bright array;
the King of glory passes on his way.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

From earth’s wide bounds, from ocean’s farthest coast,
through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
