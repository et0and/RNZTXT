            <p>Julian Bliss doesn't do things by halves. At the age of ten he'd already left home to study clarinet in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend, he's performing not one, but two concertos with the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        
            <p>One is the world premiere of a new work written for him by New Zealander Ross Harris, the other is a 1940s creation by the American jazz great, Artie Shaw.</p>

            <p>Bliss joined RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump ahead of the concert to talk about his love of the clarinet, mixing it in the jazz world (including getting a concerto out of another jazz giant, Wayne Shorter), and how he met Ross Harris, but is yet to meet his heavy metal rock idol, Ozzy Osbourne. </p>
