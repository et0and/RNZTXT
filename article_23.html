            <p>Those doubting the ability of the different peoples of Aotearoa/New Zealand to live and work in harmony need look no further than the country's national youth choir: Tangata Whenua, Tangata Moana and Pakeha, all making music at the highest level.</p>
        
            <p>This Waitangi Day, the choir will be part of the commemorations on the Treaty Ground itself.</p>

            <p>RNZ Concert Host Bryan Crump spoke with choir member Tess Dalgety-Evans ahead of the concerts.</p>
        
            <p>She's doubly excited to be taking part. This is her first visit to the Treaty Grounds, and her day job involves taking people around an exhibit of Te Tiriti at Te Puna Mātauranga, the National Library of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Dalgety-Evans talked to Crump about the importance of history, her multi-lingual background (she spent time as a child in Germany) and how music-making gives her a sense of belonging.</p>
