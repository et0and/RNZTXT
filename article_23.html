            <p>The Caribbean Southern Stars, a steelpan orchestra that used the Marist Rugby league clubrooms in Mt Albert as a rehearsal space and to store their instruments, have lost a crucial part of their cultural group to a fire last week.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze entirely gutted the club rooms destroying all the band's instruments and equipment that had been stored there, along with club trophies and about a 100 years of history. </p>

            <p>The Marist Saints rugby club was founded in 1919 and the clubrooms moved to Murray Hallberg park in Mt Albert in  the 1970s. Over the years the association of this place grew beyond rugby for community members as a cultural space. </p>
