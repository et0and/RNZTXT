            <p>For the past couple of decades, composer and music educator Rachel Leach has been designing and leading education projects with orchestras and opera companies around the UK.</p>
        
            <p>Sheâ€™s come out to Aotearoa as guest presenter, or animateur, for a series of children's concerts with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra,</p>
        
            <p>She spoke with Bryan Crump about what her role as an animateur involves.</p>

            <p>"I like to think of myself, when I'm on stage, as being the... interpreter between what's going on within the orchestra and what's going on in the audience," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"And my job is to break it down and make it accessible, take away any elitism."</p>
        
            <p>"And when I'm in the classroom... I'm doing exactly the same but from a hands-on perspective - so I'm getting children to interact with the music by doing it."</p>
