            <p>A trio from New Zealand have completed a 12-day Rickshaw Run covering more than 3000km in India.</p>
        
            <p>People from around the world can go on their own rickshaw marathon around India with the help from UK-based The Adventurists, with the goal for each team to raise at least 500 pounds for the Cool Earth Foundation.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis - Clair Scott along with her friends, Fiona Sandford and Ellen Richardson - surpassed their fundraising goal.</p>
        
            <p>Now that it has been seven days since her return, Scott says she would recommend the experience to others.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an incredible experience. I would call it type two fun," she told Afternoons host Jesse Mulligan.</p>
        
            <p>"Type two fun is something that you do at the time and you absolutely hate but after you've done it and you've recovered a bit, you're like 'Oh, actually maybe I had a good time'.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to plan the route yourself and you have to know where you're going to go and you have to fix anything along the way, so breakdowns, malfunctions, they don't help. Like you can't just call an 0800 number and they come pick [you] up."</p>
        
            <p>Their three-wheeler rickshaw, also known as a tuktuk, broke down on day one after sand blocked their fuel filter while they were in a desert area at the top of India, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole theme of it is just India. It's definitely down to luck. I remember I met a rickshaw driver on my very first day in Delhi and when he found out what we were doing he was like 'oh okay, all you need is good brakes, good horn, and good luck'."</p>

            <p>As it was her first trip to India, she says wasn't sure what to expect but she was amazed by how warm and welcoming everyone was.</p>
        
            <p>"When we first flew in, we had this strict [diet] like we're just going to go vegetarian only. But on day one we went into the mutton and the chicken straight away, because somebody picked us up for a food tour and they're like 'this is good'.</p>
        
            <p>"So we just got into it. To be honest, I think I'm not too sure what ended up taking me down, but only two of us got sick. Fiona was fine â€¦ I have to say the food over there was amazing and I wouldn't put any restrictions next time I go."</p>
        
            <p>The only scary experience for them was the roads, she says. They were clocking about 250-300km a day.</p>
        
            <p>"Honking is a vibe like if you don't answer with your honk, you're not part of the cool kids. And if you can fit in a gap, it's yours to take.</p>
        
            <p>"If there's a bus, they get right of way, if it's a cow obviously it gets right of way. Being in a rickshaw, you're right at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
        
            <p>"First few days were terrifying, we were like 'oh my God, what have we got ourselves into, we're going to die on these roads'. But by day 10, we were in there, honking, right up with the buses and trucks and stuff like that. It was a bit like a video game in the end, just seeing how fast you could get places."</p>
        
            <p>She says it was "mind-blowing" to witness the cultural diversity and rich history of India.</p>
        
            <p>"Being in New Zealand, we're such a new country that we can't quite comprehend the age of things And just being able to see the difference from the north to the south of India and travelling down it, the different buildings and the different religions and the way the cities have adapted to their surroundings like deserts versus lakes and that sort of thing.</p>
        
            <p>"It was epic. I met the most amazing people. I have got some incredible memories stored in the bank now. I've started looking into what else do they do.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a really amazing way to see India. You see real India. If you're going there to see all the tourist [spots] and to get all the Instagram-worthy photos and stuff like that, it's probably not the trip for you. But if you really want to engage with the Indian culture and you really want to meet the people, it's such an incredible way to do it."</p>
