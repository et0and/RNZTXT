            <p>Do you have a sheep dog?</p>
        
            <p>Do you know stuff about sheep?</p>
        
            <p>Are you a shepherd?</p>
        
            <p>If so, the King needs you!</p>
        
            <p>Sandringham Farm, as in the royal estate and "much loved country retreat" for King Charles and Queen Camilla, is in need of a shepherd, according to a job advertisement on the farm's website.</p>
        
            <p>Sandringham Farm, which is within Sandringham Estate, is about two hours north of London in the Norfolk Coast area and is a dream for any outdoor loving New Zealander with agricultural knowhow.</p>
        
            <p>There is of course a magnificent house and garden. Beyond that, the wider estate features forestry and hunting areas and there are about 2300 hectares of organic cropping, including wheat, barley, rye, oats, peas and beans.</p>

            <p>About 200 hectares of grassland is for breeding sheep and beef cattle. There are 2000 sheep in the King's flock. The lambs are sold to a premium supermarket retailer.</p>
        
            <p>The farm has a small herd of pedigree beef shorthorn-based sucklers (a suckler is a cow bred for meat rather than dairy). The estate is hoping to increase the herd to 100 head of cattle in the next few years.</p>
        
            <p>"Day to day shepherding will form the majority of this role..." according to the job advertisement.</p>
        
            <p>The ideal candidate will need to uphold high animal welfare standards, be flexible and work calmly under pressure, among a number of other attributes.</p>
        
            <p>Shepherds hoping for success with their application will need their own working dogs, a full and clean UK driving licence and have the right to work in the UK (potentially ruling out many of New Zealand's top shepherds).</p>
        
            <p>Applications for the job close on 27 September.</p>
        
            <p>Good luck.</p>
