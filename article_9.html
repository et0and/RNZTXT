            <p>Tony Stamp looks back at a year of musical offerings from the UK and North America. From industrial disco to affable country, these were 10 of the year's best.</p>
        
            <p>The eighth album by the Scottish duo is bittersweet, anthemic, angry and uplifting, and preoccupied with the internet. Social media specifically, and what it's doing to the way we interact.</p>
        
            <p>Lyrics like "there's no true you, just today's persona/ Gregarious extrovert, timid loner", 'Haven't You Heard', alludes to the way we reinvent ourselves online, and throughout the pair spin tales of disaffected people over inspired musical choices.</p>
        
            <p>Portishead singer Beth Gibbons's solo debut was a long time coming (not counting a 2002 collaboration with Rustin Man). The results are revelatory, and suggest she spent a good deal of time creating and immersing herself in a unique sonic landscape.</p>
        
            <p>The kind of autumnal, vaguely Celtic tinge to the tunes was unexpected, but very rewarding.</p>
        
            <p>Each song on Nil√ºfer Yanya's third album felt like it had materialised fully formed. Her singing was always relaxed, and now the music matched it.</p>
        
            <p>Yanya's breathy, billowing voice delivers plaintive verses that unfurl into comforting choruses, balancing beauty and pathos for the entire runtime.</p>
        
            <p>In the liner notes to Jess Cornelius' Care/Taking, she says: "The biggest shift for me that has happened over the last few years is that I had a kid. What that did was make me think about death more than I have in my entire life."</p>
        
            <p>Those twin impulses, the joy of new life and the fear it can provoke, propel their way through the album. It's compelling stuff, and even more impressive is the composition: bold choices confidently made.</p>
        
            <p>The partnership of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross may have seemed an unlikely fit for Hollywood, but they've gone on to win two Oscars. For Luda Guadanino's sexually-charged tennis movie Challengers, they ramped up the adrenalin to fit.</p>
        
            <p>Pundits have remarked how different this is to Reznor's often moody, sometimes excoriating work as Nine Inch Nails. But the sounds here are not unfamiliar, just slightly more disco-fied.</p>
        
            <p>With her second solo record, Kim Gordon, aged 70, made something so casually challenging, and effortlessly cool, it put many similarly-inclined artists her junior to shame.</p>
        
            <p>As soon as I hit play onThe Collective I felt on unsteady ground, which, if you're like me, is a fun place to be. Others will just find it unpleasant, but Gordon has been one of the coolest people on the planet for a long time now, and I doubt she cares what anyone thinks.</p>
        
            <p>This album of scrappy alt-country gems prompted critics worldwide to pay attention. Lenderman himself is perhaps not what people expected from his music: young, handsome, often clad in a t-shirt or hoodie. More Steven Malkmus than Steve Earle.</p>
        
            <p>His singing voice can be unsteady, but it conveys a huge amount of personality, as do his affable songs.</p>
        
            <p>My Light, My Destroyer by New York singer-songwriter Cassandra Jenkins is catchy, funny and exploratory in equal measure, and very self-assured for someone who came close to quitting music.</p>
        
            <p>She was once an editorial assistant at The New Yorker, so her skill with words makes sense. I particularly enjoyed the line "The walls are blushing landlord pink", and casual details like a "heart-shaped duct tape wallet".</p>
        
            <p>The third album by Canadian musical collective Crack Cloud is crammed with ideas - philosophical, musical, satirical - but they're presented in easily digestible four-chord charmers that draw on classic rock. Frontman Zack Choy grafts these to a certain punk attitude, with results that always feel concise for a band that currently has ten members.</p>
        
            <p>His words are as bruising in their honesty as they are delivery, but surrounded with music that's always tuneful, and often lovely. The result is a mix of broad and blunt, and very fun to listen to.</p>
        
            <p>My first listen to 'Alone', the first single from The Cure's Songs of a Lost World, was a strangely suspenseful experience. The music proceeds for over three minutes before Robert Smith starts singing, and when he does, it's as triumphant as the gloriously protracted intro.</p>
        
            <p>The album proceeds accordingly: most of the tracks unfurl slowly, relishing in the chord progressions before a single lyric. Songs of a Lost World luxuriates in pop-tinged gloom, and the good news is there are two more Cure albums in the pipeline.</p>
