            <p>Multi-disciplinary artist Liv Tennet is trying to be a cool mum - without losing her cool. Her new solo dance show For You To Know and Me To Find Out has been brewing for the past few years amidst the juggle of creativity, work, art and motherhood. </p>
        
            <p>“I’ve built a career on collaborating with people but this year I’ve had an urge to put my own artistic voice out there.”</p>
        
            <p>Tennet has more than 20 years in the industry, across film and television appearing in Shortland Street, 800 Words, Lord of the Rings and Kiri & Lou. She also has extensive dance training and works as a choreographer for film and television. </p>
        
            <p>“Dance is probably my first love, of all the art forms, but it’s the one I do the least.”</p>

            <p>Her new solo work is at the Basement Theatre in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland from 6-10 August and explores the existential quest and concept of ‘having it all’ and what that even means. </p>

            <p>While she relishes the role of being a parent and is grateful for the privilege, Tennet has felt the pull between having a small child and juggling an artistic career “pretty relentless.”</p>
        
            <p>With her partner also in the arts, drummer and musician Tom Broome, it’s an ongoing conversation in their household. </p>
        
            <p>The fickle environment that can be the arts, comes with inconsistency in work, financial uncertainty and an unpredictable routine.</p>
        
            <p>“That’s crazy enough if those three things weren’t exactly what you’re trying to create for your child who you now share your life with!”</p>

            <p>For You To Know and Me To Find Out is a show expressing her experiences from the past four years but she’s been creating the show only within kindergarten hours. Talk about a meta experience.</p>
        
            <p>She’s also aware there can be hesitation and connotations around the concept of a “dance show”.</p>
        
            <p>“People can be a little wary of them because they feel like ‘if I’m not a dance audience then I’m not going to know what’s going on’ - they may not feel they can connect with it on a deeper level.”</p>
        
            <p>But in this new movement work, dance is one part of the narrative and Tennet has deliberately worked to make it accessible for both dance and non-dance audiences. There’s use of voice-over and her soundtrack samples an eclectic mix from her own toddler’s toy box, including a wide range of both dance genres and music. </p>

            <p>While it’s a solo show, performer, actor and comedian Barnie Duncan who recently won the Fred Award at the NZ International Comedy Festival was brought in as a dramaturg.</p>
        
            <p>“He’s helped with the overall tone of the show. Transitions in and out of the dance and of course - a few gags.”</p>
        
            <p>As a performer, parenthood has transformed her process. She doesn’t strive for perfection anymore.</p>
        
            <p>“Like parenting, making art can be profound and profoundly frustrating. You’re not going to get everything right and sometimes those flaws are what makes the work really interesting.</p>
        
            <p>“Some of those things that I get wrong, hopefully it’ll add colour to my son’s life and maybe add things that are actually productive and good.”</p>
        
            <p>Liv Tennet hopes the piece will be uplifting and give audiences a glimpse into her joyful, exhausting, relentless, absurd and humorous experience of being a mum. </p>
