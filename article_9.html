Taking short breaks from everyday life doesn't just help you appreciate the good things, says neuroscientist Dr Tali Sharot. It also helps you identify what needs to change. Audio

            <p>The key to finding joy in your everyday life is to take a short break, so you can appreciate your circumstances anew on your return, a neuroscientist says.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Tali Sharot is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at both University College London and MIT in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>She is the co-author, with Harvard law professor Cass R. Sunstein, of Look Again: The power of noticing what was always there.</p>
        
            <p>She told Sunday Morning host Jim Mora the process of habituation could be likened to growing used to a new perfume.</p>
        
            <p>"When you first put the perfume on you, you can really detect its scent ... a month goes by and you can't detect the smell of your own perfume."</p>
        
            <p>Sharot said many people had great spouses, homes, jobs and friends.</p>
        
            <p>However, "because those things have been there for quite a long time, they don't really elicit the same job, the same happiness as they would otherwise", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Going away for a few days - whether on a business trip or a holiday - had been scientifically proven to help people see and appreciate what they had, she said.</p>
        
            <p>That reset was referred to by neuroscientists as dishabituation.</p>
        
            <p>It was also known as "resparkling" - a term Sharot said was coined by actress Julia Roberts.</p>
        
            <p>"[Roberts said], 'If I did the same thing again and again and again every day for years, it would be boring, but I don't. I go away for filming, and when I come back, there's pixie dust on it.'"</p>
        
            <p>On a smaller scale, people could attain greater happiness by taking a short break during a massage, so that they appreciated the entire thing, or watching one episode of a Netflix show at a time, rather than bingeing the whole series.</p>
        
            <p>Conversely, negative tasks should be tackled in one go, because the suffering associated with them went down over time as people became habituated to them, Sharot said.</p>
        
            <p>"Break up the good into bits, but swallow the bad whole."</p>
        
            <p>Taking a short break from everyday life did not just help people to appreciate the good - it also helped them to identify aspects they were not happy with, but had got used to, she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, that unhappiness was not necessarily bad: "It drives people to change their own reality."</p>
