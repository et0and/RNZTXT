            <p>If you are driving in Illinois it is mandated your car must have a steering wheel, on Christmas Island the crabs get right of way and in Alabama legislators felt it necessary to prohibit driving while blindfolded.</p>
        
            <p>Autotrader in the UK has put together a map of global driving etiquette in 180 countries, and Laura McNally from Autotrader UK joined Summer Times for a trip around the world's driving etiquette.</p>
        
            <p>The US, perhaps unsurprisingly, has some of the oddest rules, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In Alaska, for example, it's illegal to tether a dog to your car while driving. it's just curious that things like that have to be written into the law.</p>
        
            <p>"Also, driving blindfolded is prohibited in Alabama. Another one is driving without a steering wheel is explicitly illegal in Illinois.</p>
        
            <p>"And In the State of Wyoming is illegal to ski while being towed behind a vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>Animals are kings of the road elsewhere, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"While in other countries around the world require drivers to give way to animals. On Christmas Island, they really go one step further.</p>
        
            <p>"So, during crab migration season, roads on the island are completely closed and drivers are legally obliged to wait for the crabs to pass before continuing with their journey."</p>
        
            <p>Here in New Zealand, of course, we must give way to sheep, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Africa has its share of legal oddities too.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the more random driving laws in that continent include it being illegal to reverse for more than 50 meters In Ethiopia.</p>
        
            <p>"In Rwanda, there's no driving on Sundays."</p>
        
            <p>Thailand, meanwhile, takes a dim view of Buddha iconography.</p>
        
            <p>"It's illegal to disrespectfully transport Buddha statues or images there. So, it would be considered offensive to have a miniature Buddha statue decorate the interior of your car."</p>
        
            <p>Driving a dirty car in Aman is illegal, you can be fined for it, also the case in Kazakhstan, Iran and Azerbaijan, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxury car drivers in Jordan get a free ride, however.</p>
        
            <p>"Luxury cars are exempt from many rules … drivers of the luxury cars there don't even need to drive with a license plate, which is a legal requirement for everyone else."</p>
        
            <p>Politeness is mandated in Cuba, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Drivers are expected to pick up hitchhikers, it's common courtesy to do that there."</p>
        
            <p>In South America, Paraguay and Brazil insist on well shod drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"In Paraguay, they you're not allowed to drive without wearing shoes. In Brazil as well, it's illegal to drive wearing flip flops, which I'd imagine would, be a point of contention in many other countries where that's the daily footwear."</p>
        
            <p>French and Slovakian drivers must have a breathalyser on board she said, while Cypriots are forbidden from drinking water or soft drinks while driving.</p>
        
            <p>Eating on the move is also prohibited in New Zealand, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not allowed to eat in the vehicle or hold a person or package or animal in your lap or arms."</p>
