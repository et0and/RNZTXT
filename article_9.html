            <p>Review - Tim Burton's ghostly 1980s hit returns in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. But has the 36-year wait been worth it?</p>
        
            <p>Burton's audience was earned with a string of uniquely distinctive hits in the 80s and 90s - Gothic fables including Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Alice in Wonderland.</p>
        
            <p>But it's been a while since his last big-screen success, so now he's turned to a belated sequel to his first big hit - Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.</p>
        
            <p>He was like a solitary, genius kid playing with toys of his own creation, and endlessly devising spooky Halloween stories to go with them.</p>
        
            <p>And the most Tim Burton movie of all was the 1988 hyperactive ghost comedy Beetlejuice.</p>
        
            <p>It was funny, it was sweet-natured, it was endlessly inventive, even if by the end the film Beetlejuice, a brilliant Michael Keaton, started to wear out his welcome a bit.</p>
        
            <p>But it was loved for decades - thanks in part to endless repeats on TV - and the fans kept calling for a follow-up. So finally, here it is.</p>
        
            <p>We forget that the original Beetlejuice was neither written nor produced by Burton. He just directed it - though he very much made it his own with his soon-to-be trademark blend of the macabre and the childlike.</p>
        
            <p>The sequel went through several changes of writing teams, all trying to retain as many elements of the original as possible.</p>
        
            <p>Burton kept the three most obvious actors - Keaton, of course, the permanently over-the-top Catherine O'Hara - once the mother, now the grandmother of the haunted family - and Burton's old muse Winona Ryder as the grown-up version of Goth teenager Lydia.</p>
        
            <p>Lydia is now a mother herself - to the even more gloomy teen, Astrid - while holding down a job as the host of a paranormal reality TV show. What else would she do?</p>
        
            <p>Astrid is played by a recent Burton favourite Jenna Ortega - they met when he was directing her TV show Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The family are invited back to the old, haunted house when Grandpa is eaten by a shark.</p>
        
            <p>Grandma organises the funeral as a tribute to herself - there's a lot of self-absorption in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Lydia and Astrid discover some old, unpleasant memories up in the attic. Don't say Beetlejuice's name three times, you may remember.</p>
        
            <p>But of course, Astrid is both a stroppy teenager, open to any excuse to annoy her mother, and also a post-millennial kid who doesn't believe all that Gen X superstitious nonsense.</p>
        
            <p>Third time's the charm, and up pops our old friend.</p>
        
            <p>Beetlejuice may be a little frayed round the edges - though he always was. But he's still keen on getting his old flame Lydia up the aisle, then down to the Afterlife as Mrs Beetlejuice.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the wishes of Lydia's actual fianc√©, the oily Justin Theroux.</p>
        
            <p>As further proof that the course of true love never runs smooth, it seems Beetlejuice also has a furious ex, played by Monica Bellucci.</p>
        
            <p>She still wants Beetlejuice in the worst way, it seems. Their relationship isn't particularly clarified when Beetlejuice explains it entirely in obviously dubbed Italian.</p>
        
            <p>But frankly we never used to go to a Burton movie because the plot made much sense.</p>
        
            <p>The appeal was always the details - like the endlessly inventive ways the dead inhabitants of the Afterlife met their particular demises.</p>
        
            <p>But Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is also evidence that time marches on, and what was once novel, creepy fun back in 1988 is a bit retro and cheesy in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It also reminded me that my affection for the original Beetlejuice was lukewarm at best - it was never my favourite Tim Burton film. And while I have residual affection for many of the cast of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, I prefer them in other things.</p>
        
            <p>I'm certainly not clamouring for a Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.</p>
