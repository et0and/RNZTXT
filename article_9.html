            <p>Being organised is a skill, and not one we are all born with, says professional organiser Natalie Jane.</p>
        
            <p>Organising spaces came naturally to the former professional ballet dancer, and in recent years she's turned this trait into a career. </p>

            <p>It's been a decade since she launched Be Organised, and has since starred alongside Kanoa Lloyd in the television series Sort Your Life Out NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Fear of letting go is the most common challenge for people who are trying to sort their life out, Jane says.</p>
        
            <p>“I might need that one day or, I spent money on that I can't possibly let that go that go.</p>
        
            <p>“But actually, many times working with many clients over the nearly 11 years I've been doing this, they always say to me how much lighter they feel when they have let go.”</p>
        
            <p>Cluttered houses make for anxious lives, Jane says.</p>

If you're overwhelmed by mess and clutter, your health will suffer says decluttering expert Natalie Jane.

            <p>“I do help people to gain control, or take back control, of their environment, so that they can feel relaxed in their home so that they can feel that sense of joy, and that our homes really should be our haven.</p>
        
            <p>“Many of us very, very busy lives, you know, we've got a lot going on, the last thing we need is to be coming in to a cluttered home. So yes, it does have health issues... it can stop us from sleeping well, if you're constantly in that space of feeling anxious, you know, it stops us from being present.”</p>
        
            <p>Jane shared the following tips with Summer Times.</p>
        
            <p>
“It's just so important with kids to keep on top of it, otherwise, you just get into a big mess," Jane says.

            <p>Culling wardrobes and linen cupboards</p>
        
            <p>We are responsible for everything that comes into our home, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“Be conscious every time you purchase something... do you really need that item? Ask yourself that question, before it even comes in the door.”</p>
        
            <p>But once the clutter has piled up, she suggests one category of clothing a day.</p>
        
            <p>“Maybe you've only got 10 minutes, pencil it in your diary, make sure it's a time that's gonna work for you and just do your socks, or just do your jeans, or just do one category of clothes at a time.</p>
        
            <p>“And imagine if you were to do that for 10 minutes a day? You would eventually get there.”</p>
        
            <p>She suggests a permanent donation basket for families with growing children.</p>
        
            <p>“So that every single time they grow out of a piece of clothing, or they no longer want it … put it into that basket immediately as soon as you touch it, so it doesn't go back into the wardrobe.”</p>
        
            <p>De-cluttering seasonally or every school holiday is another way to keep on top of things, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“It's just so important with kids to keep on top of it, otherwise, you just get into a big mess.”</p>
        
            <p>The downsizing de-clutter</p>
        
            <p>“When it comes to downsizing, many people of that generation haven't ever decluttered, so it's really got on top of them.</p>
        
            <p>“So, the whole idea that I have is, if you declutter on a regular basis, it gets easier and easier and easier, like anything you do, the more you do something, the easier it becomes.”</p>

            <p>Coping with photos, large family albums and journals</p>
        
            <p>"One family that I'm working with at the moment, they're digitising everything, They're getting all the photos out and they're not keeping multiples of photos that they have.</p>
        
            <p>“They're not keeping photos of themselves or other people that they either don't know or don't like.”</p>
        
            <p>What about when a parent dies?</p>
        
            <p>What is a treasure to one person is quite often not special to another person, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I was also working with another beautiful woman on the show, and she had lots and lots and lots and lots of treasures for her from her family.</p>
        
            <p>“But I asked her to pick out five of her most special memories, so she was able to let go of a whole lot of stuff on their travel and their trips and postcards and little ornamental things.”</p>
        
            <p>The thing to remember is if everything is treated as a treasure, nothing is special, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“Put limits around how many items you're going to keep, I think that can really help.”</p>
