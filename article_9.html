            <p>This review contains spoilers.</p>
        
            <p>A single, fatal blow from King Helm's fist ignites a war for the ages in Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.</p>
        
            <p>Set some 200 years before the events of Peter Jackson's trilogy, the latest feature - directed by Kenji Kamiyama - brings the richness of Tolkien's lore to life with beautiful hand-crafted animation, commanding vocal performances and a compelling story that unfolds almost like a Shakespearean tragedy.</p>

            <p>The War of the Rohirrim follows the tale of Helm Hammerhand, the King of Rohan and his courageous daughter Hera, who finds herself swept up in the turmoil of the titular conflict. It begins with the fractured bond between Hera and Wulf, childhood friends torn apart by their fathers' enmity.</p>
        
            <p>Helm, a fierce and proud leader, clashes with Freca, Wulf's father and a Dunlending lord - so when Wulf proposes marriage to Hera, Helm is incensed at what he feels is a ploy to steal his throne.</p>
        
            <p>A bitter exchange of words soon turns physical, and in a fit of rage, Helm strikes Freca down with a fatal blow, right before Wulf's eyes. Banished from Rohan, Wulf retreats to Dunland, nursing a vendetta that spirals intro war.</p>

            <p>Luke Pasqualino brings incredible depth as the voice of Wulf - disappearing entirely into a character who is equal parts wounded, vengeful, and impulsive - while Brian Cox's King Helm, vocally commanding and unbelievably badass, could strike fear into the hearts of any adversary. But truly, the entire cast gives rich vocal performances, immersing you fully into the animated Middle Earth.</p>
        
            <p>The grandeur of Tolkien's world even translates in animation: the cinematography is atmospheric and breathtaking, with sweeping landscape shots and large-scale battle scenes rivalling those in Jackson's original trilogy. The film also sets traditional anime-style characters against more scenic, three-dimensional backdrops, making scenes set amidst fire and snowfall particularly visually impactful.</p>
        
            <p>Composer Stephen Gallagher brings his A-game, composing a swelling and epic score on par with Howard Shore's, even reprising the Riders of Rohan theme as a nod to Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. </p>

            <p>Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim melds anime artistry and Tolkien's lore really well, creating a visually beautiful and narratively compelling film that stands confidently on its own.</p>
        
            <p>There aren't many overt references to magic or Sauron or the Rings, but considering the film chronicles the events of Rohan, it feels more grounded in a familiar environment of Men. And despite Tolkien's vast tapestry of names and places, it also does a good job of equipping each of its ensemble cast with a significant role and narrative purpose.</p>

            <p>The story is simple and self-contained - you don't necessarily need to be immersed in Lord of the Rings lore in order to watch and appreciate this film, which is important to the legacy of such powerful IP.</p>
        
            <p>There were moments in this film that genuinely sent shivers down my spine, and a couple that had me a bit teary-eyed. Death and betrayal felt epic and impactful, while fight scenes carried some surprising emotional weight. There were also nods to the earlier films that fans will appreciate, including the story behind how Helm's Deep got its name.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, The Hobbit trilogy and The Rings of Power series had dulled my love for Lord of the Rings. But The War of the Rohirrim has brought me back to Tolkien's world with a renewed sense of warmth - and I hope it does the same for you.</p>
