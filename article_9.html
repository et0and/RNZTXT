            <p>Auckland alt-pop band Ha The Unclear (formerly known as Brown) perform tracks from their upcoming album A Kingdom in a Cul-de-sac.</p>
        
            <p>The quartet – whose name is an anagram for 'nuclear health' – was originally formed in Dunedin and later migrated to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Lead singer Michael Cathro, who grew up in a Dunedin cul de sac, tells Jesse Mulligan that songwriting is a way to process and later reflect on his experiences.</p>
        
            <p>"A part of what creating does is it gives you an opportunity to express what you need to express but also to transform yourself in one way, to get something out and be able to change yourself in some way."</p>
        
            <p>"Trying to make sense of it at the time, [you ask] why is this coming out of me? Why is this the theme of this thing? I just try and make it its own thing."</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>A Kingdom in a Cul-de-sac is due out next April on the French record label Think Zik! Ha The Unclear will then head overseas to promote the album before returning for an NZ tour. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>The Theme from White Lotus (composed by Cristobal Tapia de Veer): "This is an amazing intro for a series that I really like."</p>
        
            <p>'Fish': "It's a bit drive-ier than what we usually do, I just tried to keep it simple."</p>
        
            <p>'Strangers': "It's about these little tiny threads we have, these interconnections with people that we dont even know ... this kind of web of interconnectedness."</p>
        
            <p>'Julius Caesar'</p>
        
            <p>'Mind Over Matter': inspired by Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.</p>
