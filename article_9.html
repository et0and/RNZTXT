            <p>Review - I told two of my musical friends I was reviewing Bryan Adams tonight and one of them suggested I name the piece 'Everything I Review, I Review It For You', which set off a round of grown man giggling, the type of laughter reserved only for your inner circle. Laughter that makes your sides hurt.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps that was part of the inspiration for the name of Adams' 'So Happy It Hurts' tour? I can just imagine him sitting around with the band, instruments in hand, coming up with witty wordplay between songs. "How about 'Summer of 69 Tour Dates?'" he says to chuckles from the band.</p>
        
            <p>But no. That isn't what happened apparently. The name is inspired by the post-Covid return to life, freedom, spontaneity, autonomy, the thrill of the open road. Sounds ideal. I stick my metaphorical thumb out, standing on the highway roadside, and hitch a ride.</p>
        
            <p>There's a buzz at Wolfbrook tonight. Like we all know the gag to a joke that is about to be revealed. In the drinks queue, the couple in front of me are laughing away, someone has dropped their phone in the toilet and it's proper stuck. They're in there, wrist deep trying to fish it out now, apparently laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation they're in.</p>
        
            <p>Opening act James Arthur introduces himself. "I'm James Arthur," he says. Two lonesome cheers float up from the crowd. "Oh cool, two of you have heard of me."</p>
        
            <p>Self-effacing Arthur has billions of streams on Spotify and yet the way he comes across is less international pop star and more one of the lads from the pub sharing a yarn, having a laugh. He later shows his ability to work a crowd, having the whole arena on their feet, waving their arms and singing along. Effortlessly funny and talented to boot, James Arthur was the warm-up we didn't know we needed.</p>
        
            <p>If Arthur's performance was to set up the joke, Bryan Adams' performance delivered the punch line spectacularly. It's almost as if he set it up intentionally. Everything about this show was unexpectedly wild. High energy fun. Incredible musicianship. Hilarious crowd participation. The few low-energy moments were a welcome break for the aches and pains I was gathering from laughing and cheering so hard.</p>
        
            <p>The songs played spanned four decades of hits - '18 Til I Die', 'Somebody', 'Can't Stop This Thing We Started', 'Please Forgive Me', to name a few. If you were expecting him to play something, chances are he did. Crazy thing is he could've played anything and it would've been amazing. From the music, to the backdrop, to the production, to the random drone-controlled inflatable balloons, the show was unforgettably good.</p>
        
            <p>I won't spoil it by divulging any further details other than this: if you have tickets to a show on this tour, wear something you can take off and swing around over your head. Trust me. You'll thank me later.</p>
