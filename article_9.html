            <p>It has been a year for Sunday Morning host, Jim Mora. Losing his voice took him off air for a number of months but now happily match-fit, he picks his 5 favourite interviews from 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Leon: Startling research on scent and brain function</p>
        
            <p>When I initially came across this  University of California Irvine study, it was difficult not to be skeptical about findings reporting a 226 percent increase in cognitive capacity in adults 60 years and older who were exposed to different smells.</p>
        
            <p>However, Dr Micheal Leon makes sense of it. And the Sunday Morning audience got in touch in their droves, and it turns out this was something that our listeners had known for some time – some using perfume or essential oils, others using herbs from the garden and all of them reporting that it really did help get their brains into gear.</p>
        
            <p>It was no surprise that this was one of our most downloaded interviews of 2023.</p>

            <p>Lorin Clarke: Would that be funny? Growing up with John Clarke</p>
        
            <p>It was such a pleasure to chat to Lorin about her dad, John Clarke.  He’s someone who is held in such high regard by all of us in New Zealand and hearing Lorin recount how he was as a father really cemented the idea that he really was just a lovely man.</p>

            <p>Joan Armatrading: Celebrating 50 years of music</p>
        
            <p>Joan Armatrading's voice really is a one in a generation and it was such a privilege to talk to her about a new book of her lyrics called The Weakness in Me. Despite how emotionally charged her songs and songwriting are, she remains very guarded about her own.</p>

            <p>Bryan Johnson: The tech billionaire reversing his age</p>
        
            <p>We’d all like to look younger, but I was fascinated by the lengths to which Bryan Johnson goes to that end. We weren’t that confident when we approached him that he’d be keen to talk, but his people got back straight away, and he was a real pleasure to talk to.  I’m not sure I’ll be adopting any of his ideas anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Kim Hill: The Jim Mora interview</p>
        
            <p>Of course, my 2023 list wouldn’t be complete without the interview with Kim marking her final Saturday Morning show after 22 years at the helm.  I won’t deny it was a little disconcerting interviewing another interviewer, but she was a great sport and I think we both had fun – I certainly did.</p>
