            <p>Are they winding back feminism, or cleverly turning clicks into cash with their portrayal of being old-fashioned wives and mothers?</p>

            <p>If you haven't heard of "tradwives" yet, hop on Instagram or TikTok and be prepared to go down a rabbit hole of clashing ideologies. </p>
        
            <p>On the surface they are "traditional wives" - women who are happily married, busy pumping out children, cooking family meals from scratch and being happy to take orders from their husbands. </p>
        
            <p>But the content they produce is highly curated, designed for clicks and has become its own business - and it takes time away from the family to do that successfully. </p>
        
            <p>Today on The Detail we look at this phenomenon and its place in the culture wars. </p>
        
            <p>Megan Agnew is a writer for The Times of London who earlier this year spent a day with the so-called Queen of Tradwives Hannah Neeleman, her husband Daniel and their eight children. Hannah's social media posts are under the name "Ballerina Farm" - she was training to be a ballerina before she met Daniel. </p>
        
            <p>She went viral recently for a video of her excitedly opening a birthday present from Daniel, hoping all the while it would be her much-hinted for holiday to Greece ... only to find an egg-collecting apron, which she then danced around the kitchen wearing, with supposed joy. </p>
        
            <p>Hannah says she's not a tradwife but she fits the description. </p>
        
            <p>She grew up in a traditional Mormon family in Utah and now uses her account to promote their farm business, which she does while home-schooling her children. </p>
        
            <p>She also competed in the Mrs World beauty pageant 12 days after giving birth to her eighth child and has nine million followers on Instagram. </p>
        
            <p>In her posts "everything just feels idyllic and peaceful and perfect," says Agnew. </p>
        
            <p>But not everyone swallows her public-facing picture, and she's faced a lot of criticism online. </p>
        
            <p>"She was attacked for making motherhood look too easy, for promoting a really traditional lifestyle at home when it came to gender roles."</p>
        
            <p>What Agnew found on Ballerina Farm was not quite what she expected. </p>
        
            <p>"She was much softer, and much more passive than I thought she was going to be, particularly within the role of the company. She was the face of it, and really was the brains behind putting it all on Instagram." </p>
        
            <p>Her husband is from a super-wealthy family and had dreamt of "this enormous brave existence in the American west," she says. </p>
        
            <p>"It's very old-fashioned and romanticising of the old-fashioned lifestyle." </p>
        
            <p>The reaction to her article has been "so polarised it's extraordinary," says Agnew. </p>
        
            <p>It came out amid the current conversation in the US about childless people and whether they have a stake in the country or not; vice-president Kamala Harris being described as a 'childless cat lady' by the Republican V-P nominee J.D.Vance; and heated arguments about reproductive freedoms. </p>
        
            <p>"That was transplanted onto this," she says. </p>
        
            <p>"It's really personal. It just comes down to choice really - one half saying just because you've made this decision to live this life it doesn't mean it's a decision of freedom, you're still oppressed in some way. And the other side saying, 'no no, I did choose it, and that in itself is a feminist free act.</p>
        
            <p>"It has at times been a vicious debate."   </p>
        
            <p>The Detail also speaks to Kathryn Jezer-Morton who writes about family life for New York Magazine, and has a PhD in sociology studying 'momfluencers'.</p>
        
            <p>She says these influencers don't talk politics - it would be terrible for their brand - but it's just there under the surface all the time. </p>
        
            <p>"The family planning stuff, the no-abortion stuff, the traditional gender role stuff ... these are really important parts of the alt-right and in some ways bubbling into the more conservative party system in the United States. </p>
        
            <p>"Even if it's not talked about overtly, all of the little markers are legible, and you can't deny that they're there."
