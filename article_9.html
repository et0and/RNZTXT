        <h2>At The Movies: Let The Dance Begin</h2>
        <p>
Argentinian romantic drama Let the Dance Begin finds the one-time "Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of Tango" get back together for a road trip full of surprises and secrets revealed. Video, Audio

            <p>I like Argentinian films. Particularly the landscape, which is strangely familiar somehow, once you get outside big cities like Buenos Aires.</p>
        
            <p>All that blue sky, those hills and bush – it looks like Central Otago. No wonder they’re so keen on rugby.</p>
        
            <p>But the people are still Latin American – and the sound of Argentina is the tango, played on a jazzed-up accordion, the famous “bandoneon”.  </p>

            <p>The tango conquered the world in the 1930s and 40s, and thereby hangs the tale of Argentinian romantic drama Let the Dance Begin.</p>
        
            <p>It’s the story of long-retired tango dancers, Carlos and Marga. Once they played to crowned heads and political leaders. </p>
        
            <p>Since they split up, Carlos got married and moved to Spain, where he’s now a successful TV soap star. As for Marga, she effectively disappeared.</p>
        
            <p>Then one day Carlos gets a phone call.</p>
        
            <p>It’s his old bandoneon-player Pichu, with bad news.   Marga has been found dead in her rundown Buenos Aires flat.  </p>
        
            <p>Carlos is horrified.  How has it come to this? He drops everything and rushes to Marga’s funeral, where he gets a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>The first of many surprises, in fact. Marga’s not dead.  She and Pichu just faked it for her own purposes.  </p>
        
            <p>And she has news for the stunned Carlos. It seems they have a son he had no idea about.  A son who lives a two-day drive away.</p>
        
            <p>Carlos is skeptical. And he’s got no intention of getting into Pichu’s rundown old van on some wild goose chase. </p>
        
            <p>But Marga and Pichu apply the guilt and invoke the old days...   And anyway, if he didn’t weaken there’d be no movie.</p>
        
            <p>Let the dance begin, in other words - three old friends – in the case of Carlos and Marga, two old lovers – in a van. In Argentina, the appeal was seeing three popular stars at work.</p>
        
            <p>Standout is Dario Grandinetti as the pompous Carlos, the would-be European sophisticate with his perfect English pronunciation. The more earthy Marga thinks it’s hilarious.</p>
        
            <p>There are lies and secrets behind the lies. Even Pichu, the rough-diamond musician has his fair share of surprises up his sleeve too.   </p>
        
            <p>He and Marga are each keeping things from Carlos, but they’re obviously waiting till they think he’s earned their confidences.</p>
        
            <p>A running gag is Marga and Carlos’s constant fear of being recognised.    </p>
        
            <p>Marga, after all, has just pulled off a completely fraudulent funeral, while Carlos is worried the tabloids will reveal his scandalous love-child.</p>
        
            <p>But you suspect they’re more concerned that the one-time Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of Tango may have been totally forgotten all these years later.</p>
        
            <p>Let the Dance Begin is clearly a love letter from writer-director Marina Sereseski to tango, to old stars and, in a way, to Argentina.  </p>
        
            <p>It’s a delightful film, if you’re not expecting too many surprises. Apart from one. This is the first Argentinian film I’ve seen for years that didn’t star Ricardo Darín.  I like Ricardo, but it’s nice he passed the ball to someone else this time.</p>
