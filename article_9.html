        <h2>'Having native flora and fauna back on the property is really exciting'</h2>
        <p>
Capital Kiwi - a project bringing kiwi back to the Wellington region - has partnered with the owners of Terawhiti Station, a historic coastal farm. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>By Gianina Schwanecke, producer</p>
        
            <p>Established in 1843, Terawhiti Station has seen many changes over its 180-year history - the most recent being the re-introduction of kiwi to the hills surrounding this 4800-hectare property on Wellington's southwest coast.</p>
        
            <p>The kiwi release is the culmination of a project several years in the making.</p>
        
            <p>It's here that the first of 138 kiwi were released in 2022 as part of the Capital Kiwi Project. </p>
        
            <p>There are over 1000 traps on the farm - just part of the 4600 or so set across the 24,000-hectare stretch of land which underpins the project. </p>
        
            <p>It's a partnership between private landowners, tangata whenua and local communities determined to do their bit for New Zealand's national bird.</p>

            <p>Michael Grace, a shareholder and director of Terawhiti Station, had known the project's founder Paul Ward for many years.</p>
        
            <p>When first approached with the idea, his reaction was one of surprise. "Who wouldn't want kiwi in their backyard?" </p>
        
            <p>Grace, a descendant of James McMenamen who took over the farm in 1847, grew up on the property near the rural Wellington settlement of Mākara.</p>
        
            <p>"Having native flora and fauna back on the property is really exciting because we want to leave the property in a better space than I grew up with ... and the reintroduction of kiwi is a good step towards that."</p>

            <p>He's proud of the project's progress within a short time frame - the first kiwi chicks hatched on the farm late last year. </p>
        
            <p>"In four, five years, we've got a burgeoning population. In the kiwi conservation world that is lightspeed."</p>
        
            <p>Farm manager Guy Parkinson admits he was sceptical at the start, though he and his wife, Carolyn, have always been "environmentalists at heart".</p>
        
            <p>He believes the kiwi aren't the only things to have benefited from the project; the swathes of regenerating bush on the steep hills are good for other bird life, too.</p>

            <p>Parkinson says having kiwi on the property has been "pretty seamless", fitting in with the farm operation.</p>
        
            <p>"When I started here 15 years ago, it was almost like a blank canvas." </p>
        
            <p>"Cattle here were virtually a feral mob of wild cattle and we only had about 270 wild sheep when I started. So, yeah, it's completely different, a complete transformation."</p>

            <p>Back then, stock-proof fencing was non-existent and there were no serviceable yards or woolshed. Parkinson reckons he helped put in about 90km worth of fencing, and clear about 2000ha of scrub weeds.</p>
        
            <p>Livestock - some 850 cows and 2000 Wiltshire sheep - now graze alongside the regenerating bush. There are also hundreds of feral goats on the property, which are mustered up and sold off.</p>
        
            <p>
The kiwi avoidance training session is run through a small section of bush where dogs are tested on their interest in kiwi through senses like scent and sight.

            <p>It's part of a diverse farm operation, with nine income streams including carbon farming, tourism, beekeeping, diving and rental accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge advantage to us," Parkinson said. "Not only does it give us a very diverse income ... it really helps with the cashflow. We have income coming in throughout much of the year."</p>
        
            <p>The wind farm - the catalyst for the farm's redevelopment - makes up a significant part of the farm's income.</p>
        
            <p>"It blows most of the year round and [the area is] well-known for its wind. The wind farm is great - not only the income from it, but it's given us a good road network which helps with the farming."</p>
        
            <p>The roads have also helped with setting and maintaining the trap lines and are part of the farm's "low labour input" strategy.</p>
        
            <p>The property is able to be run just by Parkinson and his shepherd, Ross Johnston.</p>

            <p>The arrival of kiwi means a bit more coordination with other people on the property as part of conservation efforts, and also kiwi avoidance training for farm dogs, which seems to be working "really well".</p>
        
            <p>"There's a bit of coordination with that, but really the kiwi look after themselves," Johnston said.</p>
        
            <p>Originally from Scotland, he says it's a privilege to be on a property with so much going on.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] pretty special to be down in a gully on the farm, moving stock, and then all of a sudden you hear a kiwi cry out."</p>
