Series Classification: G (General Audiences)</p>
        
            <p>Join IllumiNgāti as they drop in to the barber shop to perform one of Aotearoa/New Zealand's most beloved waiata: a cover of 'You're Magic' written by Dave Para, memorably performed by Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi during his maiden speech in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Raiha, Hōrihi, & Hāne (Ngāti Hine) are the lead vocalists of IllumiNgāti, an 8-piece reggae band hailing from Te Tai Tokerau. Raised in Kawakawa, the siblings come from a family deeply devoted to sharing their knowledge and experience of te reo Māori with others.</p>
        
            <p>Sitting down for a Kawakawa tea thoughtfully prepared by Chop, they delve into the profound impact Māori songs have had on their lives and their aspirations to uplift the spirits of future generations.</p>
        
            <p>"When we were children, we were not exposed to the Māori world or concepts. Therefore, through Māori songs, we learned our language and history. These songs are what first brought us together as a whānau."</p>

            <p>Notable among IllumiNgāti's creations is their original waiata, 'Illusion', a bilingual track penned by Raiha & Hāne, with a powerful message urging Māori to stand up against the systems that have stripped them of their sovereignty.</p>
        
            <p>"It encourages the Māori people to never forget our inherent power, our Māori autonomy, and to resist oppression."</p>
        
            <p>While the group has garnered a fanbase across the north as a covers band, captivating audiences at pubs, clubs, and festivals most weekends, it is their venture into original music that will truly resonate with listeners in a way Aotearoa hasn't experienced for many years.</p>
