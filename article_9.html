            <p>EJ Barnes - daughter of Jimmy - is looking forward to having "a good, hard crack" at singing Led Zeppelin classics at three tribute shows around Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>On stage with the New Zealand supergroup Come Together this month, she'll keep in mind the advice of fellow musician Neil Finn.</p>
        
            <p>"He says 'If you're going to try something, do it with gusto. Even if you got a bit of self-doubt, you want to block that out and just go for it full-force."</p>

            <p>At shows in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland, Barnes will be part of a line-up that includes the "amazing" Julia Deans and hard rock vocalist Jennie Skulander.</p>
        
            <p>She'll perform 'Whole Lotta Love' - which her dad's band Cold Chisel used to cover in their early days - and is also hoping to sing another of her Led Zep favourites - the JRR Tolkien-inspired folk duet 'The Battle of Evermore'.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't actually been assigned it in the show but I'm going to try and muscle my way in to be the Town Crier [originally sung by Sandy Denny] ... I was a big Lord of the Rings fan so this song really spoke to me."</p>
        
            <p>Barnes who has sung all her life, says she's usually more comfortable doing backing vocals but learnt to wail at a young age, singing along with her dad.</p>
        
            <p>"I would just try and sing as loud as I possibly could, probably hurt my throat in doing so."</p>
        
            <p>Later in a duo with Liam Finn, Barnes had the opportunity to explore some "screamy vocal moves".</p>
        
            <p>"That's probably where I truly tapped into my ability to wail."</p>
        
            <p>At the Come Together shows, Barnes will perform the Led Zeppelin tracks 'What Is and What Should Never Be' and 'Misty Mountain Hop' - another of her favourites.</p>
        
            <p>Next week, after the first two shows are done, she'll switch gears and join her dad Jimmy onstage for his Hell Of A Time Tour.</p>
        
            <p>Next January, Barnes will return to New Zealand to perform with Cold Chisel.</p>
        
            <p>"Who knows if they'll ever tour again. It's pretty morbid but I'm really excited. Yeah, it's always a great show."</p>
