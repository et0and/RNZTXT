            <p>For Wellington musician Jason Parker, pop songs are a place to say things he wishes he'd said in real life.</p>
        
            <p>In his new single 'The Bright Side', Parker communicates some things he didn't express in a post-breakup "after chat".</p>
        
            <p>"'The Bright Side' was my way of like, asking the questions I should have asked back then… but also dancing," he tells The Tahi's Evie Orpe.</p>
        
            <p>Jason Parker, with support from Isla Noon, performs at Auckland's Ponsonby Social Club on 15 June.</p>
        
            <p>A post shared by TAHI (@tahi_fm)</p>
        
            <p>Parker says he hasn't always felt as liberated as he does today.</p>
        
            <p>Once a confident teenage music theatre student in eyeliner - "so fierce" - Parker withdrew into himself during his 20s and only "broke free" again, he says, when he began releasing music.</p>
        
            <p>A good part of this self-liberation, Parker says, was realising that it's fine if he's not for everyone 'cause not everyone else is for him.</p>
        
            <p>"The people that I am for, I love so much. Bringing a room of people together at a gig who are just like all on the same vibe, just want to dance and feel like the best version of themselves for 40 minutes, the fact that I can have the power to bring those people together? I'm for those people … Nothing feels better than a room full of people screaming the same lyrics."</p>
        
            <p>For Parker, pop music is not only a "safe space" where he can be fully and freely himself, but it also helped him discover who that was.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to have pictures of Christina Aguilera all over my bedroom and I was like 'Oh my God. This woman is so hot', which is true, but like… I don't want to be with her. That realisation really changed a lot for me."</p>
        
            <p>Pop music is a very male-dominated industry, Parker says, and he's grateful that his creative circle - which includes producer Maude Minnie Morris and fellow pop artist Isla Noon - features many queer people.</p>
        
            <p>"I love a man but I love the girls."</p>
        
            <p>At Parker's upcoming Ponsonby Social Club gig, the musician will be impressively dressed as always, but uncharacteristically stationary due to the recent aggravation of a fractured collarbone.</p>
        
            <p>"I was actually doing dips at the gym and it just went. It's actually a rugby injury. Like, people get this from playing rugby. My dad has never been prouder."</p>
