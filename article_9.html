            <p>There are four shining stars on screen in the new joyous and heartfelt Aotearoa New Zealand film The Mountain - the directorial debut of acclaimed actor Rachel House. </p>
        
            <p>The first is the majestic mountain itself, Taranaki Maunga, in all its moods. The other three are Aotearoa's latest movie stars - and they're only 12 years old. </p>
        
            <p>The Mountain is about three tamariki's mission to find healing with the help of the mountain, discovering friendship in their adventures and many challenges along the way.</p>
        
            <p>Culture 101's Mark Amery brought all three young actors together again, beaming in from their respective hometowns, ahead of the film's world premiere on Tuesday, 19 March in Ngāmotu New Plymouth, Taranaki. </p>
        
            <p>For each it's their screen debut. </p>
        
            <p>Elizabeth Atkinson, from Kirikiriroa/Hamilton, plays the fearless Sam. Raised outside her Māori culture, the character Sam is determined to connect with her mountain in the hope it can help in healing her from cancer. </p>

            <p>Along the way Sam meets Mallory, played by Reuben Francis. Mallory, like Francis, lives in Taranaki and like his character has had to adjust as a young person to a new life there. </p>
        
            <p>And then there is Terence Daniel from Tauranga, playing free-spirited Bronco, a boy rarely seen off his BMX, 'Black Beauty'.  </p>

            <p>Elizabeth, who has strong connections to Taranaki (Te Āti Awa, Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama) says her character Sam has a warrior spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"She's battling cancer and she is fighting through it. And she's also Māori and Pākehā, being Māori she thinks that Taranaki is her maunga.</p>
        
            <p>"We went over the story with Rachel. Like a story that Māori used to believe that before you start a battle, you climb your maunga, your tūpuna, for strength, and she is climbing her what she thinks is her maunga, she doesn't quite know yet, for healing for cancer."</p>
        
            <p>Reuben, who has recently returned from the UK, says he could definitely relate to Mallory.</p>
        
            <p>"He's quite shy at first, when he gets there, he's very unadventurous. He's just come from a new place. Doesn't have any real friends here."</p>

            <p>Terrence says he didn't know Rachel House before filming started but did some research with his mum.</p>
        
            <p>"She was really cool to work with. Because I didn't know who she was at the start of the film. But then me and my mum were just watching her movies. I seen her in Boy, she's the aunty."</p>
        
            <p>Although he's never acted before Terence has been active in kapa haka, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like acting, not standing in front of a camera but performing in front of heaps of people."</p>
        
            <p>Bronco loves to escape on his bike, Terence says.</p>
        
            <p>"He loves his bike Black Beauty, and he wants a friend, and he doesn't really like his Dad."</p>
        
            <p>Mallory is also having struggles, Reuben says.</p>
        
            <p>"His mum's just died of cancer and so his dad is in shock. And Mallory himself, in my opinion, I bet he's probably pretty bummed out as well.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, what happens is his mum really pushed him to be adventurous. And so, Mallory took that into his heart as she died.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, he's been trying to be adventurous with his dad, but his dad's kind of blocked out the world."</p>
        
            <p>All three have caught the acting bug, they say.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely going to carry on in the film industry. I love acting. It's just so much fun because you get to be someone you're not, like playing around as a little kid with your friends, playing different roles with your friends," says Elizabeth.</p>
