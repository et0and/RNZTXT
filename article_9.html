            <p>As a young architecture student, Deidre Brown was told to "leave Māori architecture on the marae where it belongs".</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland professor  (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kahu) is the first academic and the first Māori woman to receive the NZ Institute of Architects' 2023 Gold Medal.</p>
        
            <p>Deidre Brown is also co-director of the Māori and Pacific Housing Research Centre MĀPIHI, which works towards creating healthy, affordable and sustainable homes for Māori and Pacific whānau.</p>

            <p>In May and June, Professor Deidre Brown will deliver a series of free public lectures on contemporary Māori architecture around New Zealand. You can register a place through Eventbrite on the NZIA website.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Brown tells Kathryn Ryan it's both an honour and also "really humbling" to receive an award previously bestowed on people she has worked with and whose work she teaches.</p>
        
            <p>Growing up she was intrigued by the distinctive architecture of Ratana churches, which her great-grandfather Hapeta Renata helped to establish in the 1920s.</p>
        
            <p>With their distinctive twin bell towers, these buildings are very different to whare whakairo - the meeting houses Māori carved in wood.</p>
        
            <p>"I found that really intriguing, particularly when I was an architecture student. I wondered what was the link between the two? What was the history there? But no history had been written.</p>
        
            <p>"That kind of set me on this path of trying to investigate the story of Māori architecture - what underpins it, who practices that and how we can perpetuate it into the future."</p>
        
            <p>Before the arrival of European settlers, early Māori adapted architectural ideas from the Pacific to the local environment, Professor Brown says.</p>
        
            <p>Over time, Māori architecture is characterised by this kind of adaptability, she says, to the environment, to the materials to hand and to the people to hand.</p>
        
            <p>In response to stressors introduced by colonisation, a "self-determined" form of Māori architecture developed, she says, in the form of whare whakairo.</p>
        
            <p>Other approaches, such as the Ratana building style, appropriated technologies and ideas from Pākehā culture and adapted them to suit Māori needs and purposes.</p>
        
            <p>After World War II, the whare whakairo style became dominant, but Professor Brown says in recent decades a "bicultural architecture" has been born.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa is a great example of this, she says, with its experimentation in how concepts and volumes, rather than decoration, can be used to represent ideas of Māori space.</p>
        
            <p>Now, with Māori architects working as consultants, we can also see aspects of indigenous design incorporated in schools, tertiary campuses, prisons and secure mental health units.</p>
        
            <p>Alongside that, a "self-determined Māori architecture" is taking shape, Professor Brown says, and can be seen in the design of community buildings such as Tūhoe's Te Kura Whare and papakāinga around Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an architecture which is influenced by a number of different building styles, but fundamentally the concepts behind it, the tikanga behind it, the way that these buildings are used, is fundamentally Māori."</p>
