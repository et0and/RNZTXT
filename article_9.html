            <p>A luxury Auckland kitchen inspired by traditional Indian culture has been named New Zealand's best kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>'Oceanside Residence', designed to meet the needs of an inter-generational Indian family, wowed judges at the 2024 NKBA Excellence in Design Awards announced on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Designer Leonie Hamill took inspiration from the family's focus on traditional Indian culture and cuisine, creating a multi-functional room where food preparation and hosting guests could co-exist with ease.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a strong emphasis on a well-organised storage system for the heavy use of spices and other ingredients. Daily meals are prepared by Mum and Grandma, and it was therefore important for the layout to reflect how the pair like to work," Hamill said.</p>
        
            <p>
Judges said the Oceanside Residence kitchen "looks great from every angle".

            <p>"It is beautiful and it looks great from every angle. The designer hasn't missed any detail… it is visually stunning. They have designed a superb kitchen that works very well for multiple cooks. It is clever, clean, modern and the main island is just exceptional. We love it."</p>
        
            <p>'Parisian Stay' - a luxury ensuite designed for a new build in Christchurch - took out the Supreme Bathroom Award.</p>

            <p>Designer Georgia Langridge of Modi Design made the most of artificial and natural light to create a bathroom that felt light and bright during the day and moody at night. 'Parisian Stay' features a large double shower, a marble-topped his-and-hers vanity, bath and bidet toilet.</p>
        
            <p>Judges said the bathroom was "a lovely space" that successfully allowed for "communication and solitude".</p>
        
            <p>"This designer has a very good understanding of bathroom design, they know how to define a space and we applaud the technical design."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland designer Alina Cuchiliuc won Designer of the Year, with judges praising her "clever and elevated thinking".</p>
        
            <p>Cuchiliuc won the 2024 Kitchen Distinction Award (for kitchens costing $120k+), the Residential Spatial Innovation Design Award and the DNKBA Bronze Kitchen Design Award.</p>
        
            <p>
Cuchiliuc said being involved early in the Maramarua holiday retreat project was crucial to its success.

            <p>The $120k+ kitchen, created for a property developer's Maramarua holiday home, was designed to balance style and practicality, Cuchiliuc said.</p>
        
            <p>Judges said they were impressed with her high calibre of design execution.</p>
        
            <p>"Alina has produced some lovely details and the delivery of beautiful and creative spaces. She has used play on scale to intrigue and encourage guests to ask, 'what is beyond?' This is a designer with clever and elevated thinking."</p>
