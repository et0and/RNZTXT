            <p>Grace DuVal has taken out the Supreme WOW Award with Curves Ahead - a garment made from reflective construction signs and a striking road-cone headpiece.</p>
        
            <p>DuVal says her inspiration for Curves Ahead was witnessing the strength and resilience of the rebuild efforts following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquakes on a road trip around Aotearoa several years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The hand-sculpted garment - which is made from vinyl road signs and held together with 3D-printed components - reflects the juxtaposition DuVal observed between natural landscapes and the neon signage and garb of Kiwi road crews.</p>

            <p>On the Curves Ahead skirt, she added plastic mesh and barrier fencing to create a ruffle "of celebration".</p>
        
            <p>"Curves Ahead promises a colourful future beyond devastation and leads the charge to rebuild what once was and what is yet to be," says DuVal, who has a Masters in Fashion, Body and Garment from Chicago's School of the Art Institute.</p>
        
            <p>"Curves Ahead is visually electrifying, vividly beautiful and a cohesive, compelling concept. It commands your attention, and up close you observe the phenomenal technical skill involved in bringing it to being," the 2024 WOW judges said.</p>
        
            <p>WOW's class of '24 made the judges' task very difficult, head of competition Sarah Nathan said, with finalists demonstrating phenomenal quality of construction and concept in their creations.</p>
        
            <p>"Finalist garments in the 2024 WOW Competition are not only a feast for the eyes but each comes with fascinating narrative and inspiration. Love was an overwhelming theme this year - love for whānau, love for the planet, aroha for Aotearoa, love for diversity and acceptance, aroha for tīpuna and even for love lost.</p>
        
            <p>"The unbridled imagination of designers who breathe garments to life with exacting skill and ingenuity never fails to inspire us."</p>
