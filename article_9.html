            <p>“We really wanted to pay homage and find our own way with it."</p>
        
            <p>Listening back to the OMC album was poignant for her, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s such a great album, it brought back so many memories. ‘Land of Plenty’ and ‘On the Run’, really ground-breaking amazing stuff.”  </p>
        
            <p>There’s an element of tragedy in the song, she says.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s a beautiful song, and actually quite tragic, and a little whimsical.”</p>
        
            <p>Reb Fountain is about to go on tour with Voom and Vera Allan.</p>
