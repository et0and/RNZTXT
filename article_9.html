            <p>This year, activists launched a campaign to get Hamilton City Council to rethink its coat of arms.</p>
        
            <p>The current design has two p큰keko besides a shield with oxen heads on it. It is topped off by a crown made of stone bricks to represent the fortress that the city was during the New Zealand Wars.</p>
        
            <p>Jahvaya Wheki, a Hamilton resident campaigning for a new coat of arms, wants to see a new design that includes a M훮ori perspective, according to Newsroom. She started an online petition, which almost 500 people have signed.</p>
        
            <p>"The current emblem was introduced in 1946 and represents the colonial history of our city as a settler military post in the 19th century," Wheki, wrote in the petition. "It does not align with the Treaty of Waitangi and M훮ori representation in our current emblem is non-existent."</p>
        
            <p>Spoiler alert: They were not successful. Hamilton mayor Paula Southgate nixed the redesign idea.</p>
        
            <p>Genealogist and heraldry expert David Jack told Afternoons he thought the mayor should reconsider.</p>
        
            <p>"Are we going to remain colonial or are we going to become our own New Zealand? We need to have that debate and I believe that maybe rather than a coat of arms, we adopt a logo or a crest, something that is free-spirited and not tied up by rules and regulations."</p>
        
            <p>Coats of arms are typically made up of a shield that has "supporters" on either side. In the case of Hamilton's design, the p큰keko are in the supporter position.</p>
        
            <p>A helmet, wreath, motto and a crest were design elements that could be placed above the shield.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to abide by the rules, the heraldic laws and traditions that govern heraldry."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand designs had historically been submitted to the College of Arms in England for approval. The Court of Lord Lyon played a similar role for coats of arms that were associated with Scotland.</p>
        
            <p>Jack said he was denied by both organisations in his efforts to formalise a Jack family coat of arms.</p>
        
            <p>He planned to submit his family's design to an American coat of arms registry.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton is not the only city in New Zealand to have a coat of arms. Jack's personal favourite is Timaru.</p>
        
            <p>"We have two sea horses on either side [of the shield] and in heraldic terms, it is called the hippocampus. They are half fish and half horse with a 'T' hanging around their necks for Timaru."</p>
        
            <p>Piled on top is a knight's helmet, a crown similar to Hamilton's and a kiwi sitting in sunshine.</p>
        
            <p>Artist Dick Frizzell, who was also interviewed on Afternoons, said coats of arms were "weird, traditional and old school."</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, Porirua had managed to catch his eye as an interesting coat of arms.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got the massive pile-up going," Frizzell said, describing the elaborate images on top of the shield that includes a boat and a whale.</p>
        
            <p>Afternoons host Jesse Mulligan invited listeners to submit ideas for the show's official coat of arms. The winner will receive an Afternoons tote bag and a spot on the show's Facebook page.</p>
