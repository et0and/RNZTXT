        <h2>Tinā - the Samoan film that's a hit with palagi</h2>
        <p>
Tinā will make you laugh and cry, but if you're Samoan like its star, maybe also despair just a little.

            <p>New Zealand has another funny/sad hit film on its hands, nearly 10 years after the last big one, Hunt for the Wilderpeople. </p>
        
            <p>Tinā has cinema audiences in floods of tears, and also makes them laugh.</p>
        
            <p>It's heading for $4 million at the box office, which is huge for a home-grown effort.</p>
        
            <p>You can still see it at the cinema, and you should - freelance critic and entertainment podcaster Kate Rodger says the shared experience packs an emotional punch.</p>
        
            <p>"It has tragedy and trauma, but also picking yourself up and dusting yourself off, but knowing that you need others to help you do it," she says.</p>
        
            <p>It's no spoiler to say it's about a Samoan teacher who loses her daughter in the second Christchurch earthquake. She ends up teaching at an elite school and starts a choir.</p>
        
            <p>It does have flaws, with gaps in the narrative that were left on the cutting room floor for time reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Rodger says on repeated watches those fade away.</p>
        
            <p>But it's a fillip for the kiwi film industry after a post-Covid drought, and possibly a sign that we're back on track after one of the flattest years of content we've ever seen.</p>
        
            <p>"No one was expecting it to be this much of a barn-stormer," says Rodger. "It's now tracking as the number one film this year of any release."</p>
        
            <p>Part of the reason for that is the exceptional soundtrack.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have a story that is rooted in choral music and set in a school, it's going to have that kind of appeal," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"It appeals to every single age group.</p>
        
            <p>"And the word of mouth on this film - like I don't think I've been stopped on the street for ages ... [people saying] 'oh I've just seen Tinā' or 'I hear Tinā is great and I need to go and see it'. And it markets itself that way."</p>
        
            <p>Spinoff editor Madeleine Chapman, who is Samoan, wrote a review of Tinā in which she argued with herself about its merits.</p>
        
            <p>"I had really high hopes - I just have really high hopes for any local film or TV show because I just hope it succeeds all expectation, but I think particularly with this one being Samoan-led and a Samoan story I did sort of think this could be the movie that brings Pacific stories through into the mainstream.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when I came out of it I realised I was in a very difficult position because I really wanted people to go and watch the movie for so many reasons but I also didn't like it as much as I thought I would."</p>
        
            <p>Chapman says wanting people to go see a film would usually mean writing a very positive review. But she adjusted her expectations after watching the trailer, and realising it was still a majority European cast.</p>
        
            <p>"I was not expecting it to be so premised on the students who are all non-Samoan ... the students' experience as opposed to Tinā's experience. So already I kind of went, this could be a movie where it's a Pacific story but it's for palagi audiences.</p>
        
            <p>"I can totally understand where the film makers came from ... and it's amazing that it's done really well.</p>
        
            <p>"But even doing really well it will likely be the only big Pacific feature film funded for a while, so then you kind of go, well if there's only going to be one, every once in a while, do you need to be trying to go for the broadest audience possible or can you kind of get into the community stories a bit more? Which I don't know.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately it's still a huge success so you cannot fault it on that front."</p>
