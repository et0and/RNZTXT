            <p>The story of Badjelly the Witch, who can turn children into sausages, policemen into apple trees and bananas into mice, has been much loved in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Badjelly was the brainchild of British comic genius Spike Milligan, who made up the story for his young children.</p>
        
            <p>It was published in print and Spike Milligan recorded an audio version which become a major hit on children's radio in New Zealand - making Badjelly more famous here than in the UK.</p>
        
            <p>Now, 50 years later, Badjelly the Witch is back on bookshop shelves in a special anniversary edition.</p>
        
            <p>Spike's daughter, actor Jane Milligan, told RNZ First Up she found it strange Badjelly was more popular in New Zealand than anywhere else.</p>
        
            <p>"She was played on the radio every weekend [in New Zealand] for a whole period of time, so a lot of people became very familiar with her - listening to the story as opposed to reading it.</p>
        
            <p>"We never had that here. Of course I did, because he wrote it for his kidsâ€¦ But you guys over there are proper fans of Badjelly - it's great," Jane said.</p>

            <p>For her, Badjelly was one of many wild stories her father came up with at bedtime.</p>
        
            <p>"You grow up with your dad, your dad does stuff for a living and [I was] probably about eight or nine when it sort of registered that it wasn't like a standard dad or normal," Jane said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was always giving us those beautiful stories as children, which we were very privileged to hear at bedtime.</p>
        
            <p>"Very lovely, magical times, as a small child, he would come back from his office and if I was still awake, he'd come upstairs and we had a blackboard on the end of the nursery wall, and he would illustrate as the story progressed.</p>
        
            <p>"So he'd chalkboard, he'd do drawings of dragons or witches or whatever it was.</p>
        
            <p>"A kind of better than TV situation really, you know, live."</p>
        
            <p>Jane had a hand in the publication of Badjelly the Witch, with an illustration she made at the age of six appearing inside the cover.</p>
        
            <p>Spike had a good vision of life, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He'd say, 'Milligans will kick the stable to pieces, but we'll always win the race'.</p>
        
            <p>"He said, 'When you look at a sunset, you don't just see it just like a blob in the sky. You see all those beautiful colours'."</p>
        
            <p>As well as writing numerous books, Spike was co-creator of British radio comedy The Goon Show,.</p>
        
            <p>Jane described him as "ahead of his time".</p>
        
            <p>"Compassionate, in love with his planet, in love with the people on the planet, maybe not all of them, but, you know, a defender of the planet.</p>
        
            <p>"He passed on that compassion to his kids, so I'm very grateful to him... He was a very special dad."</p>
        
            <p>Many elements of the Badjelly story are personal, including Fluffybum the cat, which was the real name of the Milligan family pet, Jane said.</p>
        
            <p>With the 50th anniversary edition of Badjelly the Witch out now, Jane hopes readers continue to find pleasure in the silly story.</p>
        
            <p>"It's medicine for the brain."</p>
        
            <p>And her message for all the young new Kiwi readers of Badjelly: "Stinky-poo to all of you!"</p>
