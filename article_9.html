        <h2>Everything we know about the 2025 Met Gala</h2>

            <p>The theme and hosts for one of the biggest fashion events, Met Gala, have been revealed by Vogue.</p>
        
            <p>The Met Gala, traditionally held on the first Monday in May every year, is a fundraising benefit with an exclusive dinner for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.</p>
        
            <p>Bringing in the biggest names in entertainment, fashion, and sports, next year's event on 5 May is being labelled as "history making" by media outlets as the all-Black male co-chairs and theme inspired by the style of Black men are unveiled.</p>
        
            <p>Louis Vuitton is the lead sponsor for the exhibit and Met Gala, with additional funding coming from Instagram, the Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation, Dr. Precious Moloi-Motsepe and Africa Fashion International, and The Perry Foundation.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's event was a hot topic for the Blockout movement, an online social media campaign which encouraged people to block or speak up on the accounts of celebrities who attended the event in light of the Gaza-Israel conflict.</p>

            <p>Joining Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has chaired the event since 1995, will be The Color Purple actor Colman Domingo, Formula One star Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, singer Pharrell Williams, alongside honorary chairperson and NBA star LeBron James.</p>
        
            <p>This will be James' first time attending the Met Gala, and Williams' second time serving as co-chairperson.</p>
        
            <p>Their roles mean they are likely to have helped choose the theme and dress code for the evening, which will inspire the outfits worn, and will help curate the guest list, food, and decor. And of course, they will be using their influential platforms to promote the event since it is a fundraiser.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all men who aren't afraid to take risks with their self-presentation. They take advantage of classic forms, but they also remix them and break them down in really new ways," Met Gala curator in charge Andrew Bolton told Vogue. "I think Black men and Black designers are very much at the forefront of this new renaissance in menswear."</p>
        
            <p>Last year's hosts included actress Zendaya, singer Jennifer Lopez, rapper Bad Bunny, and actor Chris Hemsworth.</p>

            <p>Each year's event celebrates the theme of that year's Costume Institute exhibition, which is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        
            <p>This year, Vogue revealed the theme would be in line with the Costume Institute's new exhibition, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, which will be on view 6 May through 26 October, 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Drawing inspiration from Monica L. Miller's 2009 book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, the exhibit will feature garments, paintings, photographs, and more-all exploring the indelible style of Black men in the context of dandyism, from the 18th-century through present day," Vogue wrote.</p>
        
            <p>The author, who is also a professor and chairperson of Africana Studies at Barnard College, Columbia University, has also been chosen as guest curator.</p>
        
            <p>This will be the first menswear-focused Gala since 'Men in Skirts' in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>An official dress code, which is more specific, will not be announced until early 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the Gala went with a different theme than the exhibition, called 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion', inspiring stars to adorn floral arrangements and patterns on their outfits.</p>
        
            <p>"Dandyism" derives from the word dandy, which refers to a person who cares about dressing well.</p>

            <p>The Met Museum said dandyism was initially imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe as the Atlantic slave trade and an emerging culture of consumerism created a trend of "dandified" servants.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Vogue, Miller described Black dandyism as "a strategy and a tool to rethink identity, to reimagine the self in a different context. To really push a boundary-especially during the time of enslavement, to really push a boundary on who and what counts as human, even".</p>
        
            <p>The history of Black dandyism that the exhibition showcases will "illustrate how Black people transformed from being enslaved and stylized as luxury items, acquired like any other signifier of wealth and status, to autonomous self-fashioning individuals who are global trendsetters".</p>
        
            <p>"I wanted to stage a show on race that could use our collection to tell a story that had been absent from the conversation both within the museum and outside," Bolton told The New York Times. "This is a first of its kind."</p>
        
            <p>It's not clear how this year's red carpet event will be aired for people, but last year's event was hosted exclusively by Vogue and broadcast live across its digital platforms as well as TikTok and YouTube.</p>
        
            <p>The event usually hosts about 450 attendees, including celebrities, young creatives, and influential personalities.</p>
        
            <p>The guest list for next year is unknown for now, but those who have showed up in the past include Taika Waititi, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Rihanna, Ed Sheeran, Pamela Anderson, Shakira, Demi Lovato, Dua Lipa, Gigi Hadid as well as fashion designers like Michael Kors, Tom Ford and Tommy Hilfiger.</p>
