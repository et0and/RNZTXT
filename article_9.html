        <h2>Two fabulous summer salads</h2>
        <p>
Julie Biuso shares her recipes for White Peach Salad and Sweet Corn Salad. Audio

            <p>Julie Biuso of Shared Kitchen has two fabulous summer salad recipes to share. </p>
        
            <p>Serves 4 

Black garlic gives this dish a sweet, earthy umami flavour.</p>

Sweet Corn with Red Pepper salad

</p>
        
            <p>1. Remove husks and silks from corn cobs and slice off the kernels with a sharp knife.</p>
        
            <p>2. Put butter or oil in a large frying pan and add corn, red pepper and onion. Set pan over a medium heat and stir vegetables until butter melts or until coated with oil. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring often, by which time the corn will be shiny and moist, and has softened slightly. Season with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 5-10 minutes more, or until the corn is just starting to take on a little golden colour.</p>
        
            <p>3. Stir in the garlic and tarragon, taste to check the seasoning, and serve piping hot.</p>
        
            <p>Recipe Notes
If black garlic is not available, there’s no need to make a substitution as you’ll find the dish is still delicious to eat without it.</p>
        
            <p>Serves 4-5 as a salad, or 2-3 with added protein as a main, or 4-5 with a roast chicken.</p>
        
            <p>Serve for a summer lunch. If there are a few more mouths to feed, add an extra peach and tomato, or double the recipe (it is delicious!).</p>

White Peach Chicken Salad

</p>
        
            <p>2-3 Tbsp lime juice
4 large white peaches (or 2 large peaches and 3-4 nectarines)
2 medium vine tomatoes
8 makrut lime leaves
1-2 hot red chillies
3 Tbsp chopped mint
3 Tbsp chopped coriander
Flaky sea salt
2 Tbsp caramelised shallots</p>
        
            <p>1. Put lime juice in a large bowl. Peel peaches and chop flesh, adding to bowl with lime juice as each is prepared. Toss well to prevent browning.</p>
        
            <p>2. Chop tomatoes and drain in a sieve for 5 minutes. Finely chop lime leaves, discarding the spines. Finely chop chillies, discarding seeds for a milder chilli hit. Add everything except caramelised shallots to bowl of peaches, including a few generous pinches of salt. Toss well and taste. If the salad is a tad sweet, sharpen with more lime juice, and if it lacks punch, add a little more salt and chilli.</p>
        
            <p>3. Dish salad into bowls and top with caramelised shallots. Serve immediately.</p>
        
            <p>No limes? Lemons will do, but makrut lime leaves are essential. The salad needs a decent chilli buzz to balance the sweetness. Leave seeds in and chop finely, then add chopped chilli a little at a time until you get the right heat.
To serve as a main for 2-4 people, slice the flesh from 2-4 skinned and boned, pan-fried or barbecued chicken thighs and toss with salad.</p>
        
            <p>To serve as a platter for 4-5, dish salad onto a platter and top with a just-carved, roasted chicken, spooning over all the juices (cool a cooked chicken for 45 minutes before carving). The salad also works with pork (try coconut pork patties or skewers) and sweeter shellfish like crab.</p>
