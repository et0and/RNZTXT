        <h2>WATCH - What do you want for Christmas?</h2>
        <p>
Kiwis share their Christmas wishes on What's Your Story.
</p>
        
            <p>Every week, RNZ's What's Your Story asks everyday Kiwis for their thoughts about their world and their experiences. We hope to give a snapshot of what it means - and what it's like - to be living in New Zealand today.</p>
        
            <p>This week we asked: what are you hoping for this Chirstmas?</p>
