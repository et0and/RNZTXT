            <p>Georgia Nott is best known as one-half of the electronic pop-duo BROODS (with her brother Caleb).</p>
        
            <p>After a few years living in Los Angeles, she is now based in Wellington and producing music solo as Georgia Gets By.</p>

            <p>Georgia Gets By plays Auckland's Whammy Bar on Friday 1 March and Wellington's San Fran on Saturday 2 March.</p>
        
            <p>It's a "spiritual experience" to both play and see a live music show, Georgia tells Jesse Mulligan, but post-pandemic many musicians can't afford to tour.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just like really expensive to put on a good show. You're hiring a lot of equipment, you're paying a lot of people. People don't want to spend more than $25 on a ticket so you don't want to exclude people from shows by making your tickets ridiculously expensive ... I just have to think of it as an investment and I never regret a tour."</p>
        
            <p>For Georgia, songwriting is a way of processing things that also helps balance out "how chaotic life is".</p>
        
            <p>"Even on the chill days, it's a lot and it's very over-stimulating. I think [music] puts you back in your body.</p>
        
            <p>"It kind of taps into something that my brain can't always fathom in the moment of my emotions. It's been my therapy since I was like 10."</p>
        
            <p>In rehearsal for her upcoming Georgia Gets By shows, Georgia felt like her heart was swelling.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though these songs are kind of from a place of like 'What the hell is going on?', playing them live is like a way of just transmuting it into this euphoria that's really cathartic."</p>
        
            <p>As a woman in the music industry, she's often felt a "quite stressful" expectation to prove yourself, but these days has a bit more confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"I just feel but the stats are in and clearly I'm supposed to do this so I'll just relax a bit.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not competing with anybody but myself anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Gets By was the product of unstructured days at home during the pandemic, Georgia says.</p>
        
            <p>"I was living with my partner at the time and we just like spent all day experimenting because we couldn't do anything [else] … By the end of it, we were like 'Oh, we've got a new project'.</p>
        
            <p>"I like the idea of having variety and being able to experience new things and try new things and feel like a beginner all the time because it becomes pretty boring if you don't put yourself out of your comfort zone."</p>
        
            <p>After "solidly just like cranking it out for a decade" with BROODS, Georgia says it's nice for she and Caleb to have a break.</p>
        
            <p>"Both of us are having time to work on our own projects and develop a sense of self outside of one another, seeing as we were basically babies when we started.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been really, really fun to like watch one another go down our own roads and clearly see what's at the core of one another.</p>
        
            <p>"When we come back and write another record, I think we'll better for it, you know."</p>
