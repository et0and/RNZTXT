            <p>An organiser behind an unofficial Wellington hospitality awards says the sector needs celebrating now more than ever.</p>
        
            <p>The just-announced awards night - to be held in early December - comes after the industry's annual Felix Wellington Hospitality Awards were pushed back a year.</p>
        
            <p>Felix organisers said after a challenging year in hospo, it made the sad and difficult decision to postpone the awards night until 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington restaurateur Dominique Fourie-McMillan said the Felix Awards were a "complete and utter celebration" of the industry, something that was needed now more than ever.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the run that Wellington has had, this wasn't the year to cancel our awards."</p>
        
            <p>She said the new 'Welly Hospitality Awards' would give the sector what it deserved - acknowledgement of all the good things, "despite the doom and gloom".</p>
        
            <p>Fourie-McMillan said the group behind the 'Welly Hospitality Awards' were aiming to host the ceremony in early December, with voting and nominations rolling out in a similar format to the traditional Felix Awards.</p>
        
            <p>"The hospo industry can expect a night of pure celebration and camaraderie and community. A night that they truly deserve."</p>
        
            <p>She said the response from the sector had been overwhelming positive, with people recognising the symbolism of an industry awards night.</p>
        
            <p>She said an award feels hollow without a celebratory night.</p>
        
            <p>"So, this will be that night. IIt hasn't been the easiest year for Wellington hospitality.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to change the narrative, focus on what's happening that's really amazing, instead of what's happening that's ... sad and scary."</p>
        
            <p>Fourie-McMillan, who co-owns restaurants Floriditas and Loretta on Cuba St, said in addition to highlighting talent and hard work, an awards night gave an industry credibility - something hospitality had historically struggled with in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a tough gig trying to keep talented people in hospitality.</p>
        
            <p>"We're always at risk of this industry not being taken seriously as a career choice.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can put on an event that makes people want to get dressed up, and makes them want to attend and get excited about being nominated and voting for their peers ...</p>
        
            <p>"All those little things make the industry a little more enticing for people to join."</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Restaurant Association said while it was aware of the unofficial awards, it did not have sufficient information to comment.</p>
        
            <p>The association reiterated that it had been a difficult decision to postpone this year's Felix Awards, but due to financial pressures, it was in the best interest of both sponsors and hospitality attendees.</p>
