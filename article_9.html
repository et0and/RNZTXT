        <h2>Grammys: All the looks from music's biggest night</h2>
        <p>
The sombre tone of LA after the fires might have contributed to the noticable all-black theme.

            <p>The Grammy Awards are kicking off in Los Angeles with some stars striking a sombre note in all-black outfits.</p>
        
            <p>Amid the devastating wildfires which destroyed thousands of homes, the show will be reimagined to put the spotlight on first responders and also will include a charitable component, CNN reported.</p>
        
            <p>Comedian Trevor Noah will host for the fifth time in a row. Beyonce leads with 11 nominations, followed by Billie Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven nominations each. Taylor Swift has six nominations and will present one of the night's awards.</p>
        
            <p>The awards kicks off about 2pm (NZ time), but there's no streaming available for New Zealanders. Some videos and clips, including the red carpet livestream, will be available via the Recording Academy's YouTube account.</p>
        
            <p>The Cut fashion writer Morgan Evans told the Associated Press the sombre tone of LA after the fires might have contributed to the noticable all-black theme for some of the outfits the stars wore on the red carpet.</p>

            <p>Jaden Smith, wearing black alongside sister Willow Smith, arrived in a Louis Vuitton outfit, but it was his castle headwear that captured most attention.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first mind-boggling kind of 'what is going on?' look of the night, but I love it. Willow [his sister] is standing next to him in what looks like dedazzled lingere and a long blazer which I also kind of love."</p>

            <p>The sheer look appeared to be one of the biggest that kept coming back every season, Evans told AP.</p>
        
            <p>"The nearly naked dress, sheer sleeves, sheer tops, sheer skirts, capes, all of it, and I think the Grammys is also another award show where you can pull off the nearly-naked sheer look. I mean, that's always fun too.</p>

            <p>Evans said British actress Cynthia Erivo's dress emphasised her "fashion innovator" status as showcased by her Wicked press tour outfits. She reportedly had said her nails took five hours to complete. Erivo told the Recording Academy her outfit and her (moon and stars) nails are a clue as to what she would be performing - Fly Me To The Moon.</p>

            <p>American singer Chappell Roan, known for her camp and drag queen-influenced aesthetic, took things up a notch with a seemingly artist-inspired look.</p>
        
            <p>In Evans' words, it is a "a lot of glam", but the vintage 2003 Gaultier spring couture dress and hat paired with long nails, opera-style gloves and impactful make-up is "fashion forward".</p>
        
            <p>"Normally, people would say 'oh there's a lot going on' ... one of the ballet Dega paintings on the dress, I love it. It kind of gives me vibes of Zendaya's 2017 Met Gala look - the really over-the-top Dolce and Gabbana ball gown and this is very, very similar," Evans said.</p>
        
            <p>"Her make-up also just effortlessly co-ordinates with the entire look, I mean she is also the queen of make up. I feel like on red carpets, make up gets some spotlight every here and there, but it's people like Lady Gaga and Chappell that really take make up to the next level and actually use make up to complete their looks."</p>

            <p>American country pop singer Kelsea Ballerini's black and white contrasting outfit was in line with the trend of vulominous sleeves and capes this season, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Also we're seeing the opera length gloves coming back, they were really, really popular on the red carpet last season."</p>
