        <h2>Getting ready for the last Christmas at Smith & Caughey's</h2>
        <p>
For 18 years, the department store has been putting on "mammoth" Christmas displays - but the writing is on the wall.
</p>
        
            <p>For more than four decades, Kevin Broadfoot has been the creative mind - and hands - behind Smith & Caughey's much-loved Christmas displays on Auckland's Queen Street.</p>
        
            <p>A Christmas enthusiast, Broadfoot first started working in the store in 1980.</p>
        
            <p>"I love Christmas, it is as simple as that. My own family used to make a big thing of Christmas, with getting together with the wider family, so it's always been part of me."</p>
        
            <p>When Broadfoot first began at the store, Christmas displays were simple.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in those days ... we didn't really do too much with Santa. There was ... a small-scale thing. Nothing on the level of what we do now, and we had a very, very small Christmas shop. It's developed over the years."</p>

            <p>His first grand Christmas display for Smith & Caughey's was in 2007. It was modest, reusing a recycled Christmas set adapted to fit the Auckland store's windows, testing his team's ability to bring the public something special.</p>
        
            <p>"We realised with the interest and more families coming to see the windows, that what we were doing was really not cutting it."</p>
        
            <p>Over the years, the display has evolved into a fully fledged Christmas wonderland featuring a high-tech animated window, a dedicated Christmas shop, and a magical journey through Santa's enchanted forest on the sixth floor.</p>
        
            <p>Today, visitors experience "a bit of magic" through Broadfoot's work.</p>
        
            <p>"We pick up on what the trends might be with kids and what they're interested in," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Broadfoot's devotion has extended to his own family, with his grandson joining the small team of three people including himself.</p>
        
            <p>"He used to come here when he was little, like three years old or so. Now he is here with me, helping make the magic happen. It's a family legacy."</p>
        
            <p>The "mammoth task" kicks off in August, Broadfoot says.</p>

            <p>"Watching the joy, not only on children's faces but anybody at any age, across any walk of life ... that's what makes it all so worthwhile.</p>
        
            <p>"The kids... as they're getting to the escalator knowing that they're coming up to see Santa, I'm sure most of them are convinced that this is the real Santa. They get dressed up in fancy costumes, we see families in their pyjamas for their photo ... that's what makes it all so worthwhile."</p>
        
            <p>Broadfoot's love for the season extends to his own home, which he begins decorating in mid-November.</p>
        
            <p>"It takes me about three days to get the house the way I like it," he says, adding that some of his decorations are more than 40 years old.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess you call them vintage these days," he laughs.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of them go way back to when our children were tiny, and if for some reason I don't have those on the tree when they come around for Christmas, they're not very happy.</p>
        
            <p>"So, even though they've got children of their own and they do their own thing with their own Christmas trees, we've offered to give them their favourite pieces for their trees. But they insist that it's on the family tree at home, which is really lovely."</p>

            <p>On decorating styles, he leans towards "lots of greenery and berries ... lots of candles, predominantly red and green with a touch of gold".</p>
        
            <p>And no tinsel.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people like it, some people don't, it is controversial. I guess it comes and goes every Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>In May, Smith & Caughey's announced it would close the store after nearly 140 years of operation.</p>
        
            <p>However, a last-minute lifeline would allow it to continue operating a scaled-down version of the store, focusing on the ground floor of their Queen Street flagship and their online platform.</p>
        
            <p>The reduction means the Smith & Caughey's Christmas experience, as Auckland has known it, may be coming to an end.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad," Broadfoot said.</p>
        
            <p>"Christmas has always been my passion job ... and very fortunately, the company asked if I would like to continue doing Christmas after I retired, so I was thrilled to be able to do that.</p>
        
            <p>"But this year it is touched with sadness to think that this could be the last Christmas [at Smith & Caughey's] as we've been doing it for the last 18 or more years.</p>
        
            <p>"There are hundreds of thousands of kids and families out there who've all got lifelong memories of visiting Santa at Smith & Caughey's, and that will never leave them. So, I think that's something that I have to keep hold of and amongst the sadness of this could be the last one."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ got the first look at Smith & Caughey's Christmas set-up this year. The animated window display, opening to the public on 1 November, draws on the charm of The Adventures of Hutu and Kawa, a 1950s children's classic by New Zealand artist Avis Acres.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lovely story I've been holding for quite some time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a story that I grew up with in my family when my younger brothers still believed in Christmas. It was a book that was in my household, and I've shared it with my own children too."</p>
        
            <p>The story follows two tiny pōhutukawa babies, Hutu and Kawa, who live in an ancient pōhutukawa tree between the forest and the sea.</p>
        
            <p>As always, the sixth floor is home to Santa's enchanted forest. The temperature drops and snow-white decorations hang from the ceiling. Dozens of Christmas trees fill a magic forest illuminated by thousands of fairy lights, with Santa's sleigh and festive music.</p>
        
            <p>Families can meet Santa in intricately decorated rooms, adorned with items from Broadfoot's personal collection and sourced vintage pieces.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of them are from my own collection, some from Trade Me, some from other staff who donated to us.</p>
        
            <p>"It all makes the experience more real for children and also their parents."</p>
