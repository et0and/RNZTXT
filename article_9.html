        <h2>In defence of slouching</h2>
        <p>
The idea that there is a "universal good posture" that will protect us from back pain is not supported by science, says physical therapist and writer Beth Linker. Audio

            <p>A straight spine is so prized in our culture that megastar Taylor Swift is currently performing in a NZ$300 posture-supporting bra.</p>
        
            <p>Yet the idea there is a "universal good posture" that will protect us from back pain is not supported by science, says  Beth Linker, the author of Slouch: Posture Panic in Modern America.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an imaginary hope that we will somehow be able to, a) have perfectly controlled posture, and b) that it somehow leads to or prevents back pain or ill health in a meaningful way," she tells Susie Ferguson.</p>

            <p>The idea of a "poor posture epidemic" kicked off in the early 20th century, Linker says, building on Charles Darwin's theory that standing up straight is what sets humans apart from animals.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists and physicians grew concerned that the trappings of civilisation - motorised travel, children sitting at school desks and the demise of manual labour - were leading our species towards de-evolution and poor health.</p>
        
            <p>Based on the idea that people with a more upright posture have better breathing and digestion, the American Posture League was established in 1914.</p>
        
            <p>The moral judgement of slouchers - as opposed to an "an upright citizen is somebody who is disciplined, who follows orders and who maintains their own strength" - began to creep in at this time, too.</p>
        
            <p>We see a person who slouches and then we assume all of these other things</p>
        
            <p>Fast-forward to 2024 and we still see a lot of stigma and moral judgement placed on people who don't have what's considered good posture, Linker says - even women who, through no fault of their own, have a stoop due to osteoporosis.</p>
        
            <p>"We see a person who slouches and then we assume all of these other things about not only health but their ability to think, their ability to do good work - all of that stigma is attached to [posture] in a really biased way."</p>
        
            <p>The fear of slouching itself has racist and classist origins, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Historically, it's usually been educated white people who've spent a lot of time worrying about poor posture as a negative byproduct of so-called civilisation.</p>
        
            <p>Their study of indigenous people - who supposedly have perfect posture and no back pain - to find ways of bettering non-indigenous bodies is highly problematic, Linker says. </p>
        
            <p>"There's been a long history of underestimating pain in non-white people, so to insist on this 'paleo posture' or return to nature and to the way our spines were originally meant to be used can do a kind of violence. It strips indigenous people of their own claim to bodily pain and it idealises and romanticises their way of life."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to developing back pain, a person's housing, education, diet and health insurance is a better predictor than if they slouch, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Even if maintaining a ramrod-straight spine for all of our waking hours was a physical possibility, this wouldn't act as protection.</p>
        
            <p>"There isn't really solid scientific evidence to show that if you are otherwise pain-free and you have a tendency to slouch you're going to have more of a chance of back pain than the person who has supposedly better posture."</p>
