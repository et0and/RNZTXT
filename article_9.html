            <p>Food is usually a no-no in a science lab, but this lab at the Auckland University of Technology is different. </p>
        
            <p>One fridge is labelled ‘beer research’. There’s a drawer full of stick blenders, and a coffee machine. </p>
        
            <p>“Well, it is a food lab,” says senior lecturer Dr Rothman Kam. “It would be quite sad if you do experiments and were not able to eat the food that you make.” </p>

            <p>Rothman and his food science lab group are interested in turning food waste into high value products (a process called ‘food waste valorisation’).</p>
        
            <p>For example, tonnes of avocado seeds are a waste product of making avocado oil. Rothman and his team have set their sights on transforming seeds into snacks. </p>
        
            <p>They’ve worked out a method of blending the seeds and processing them to make them fit for human consumption, resulting in an avocado seed powder.</p>
        
            <p>This powder can then be added to breads or biscuits, or used with other grains to make puffy snacks.  </p>
        
            <p>A second project, led by PhD candidate Edward Quach, is investigating the use of fish waste products to create artificial skin. This skin can be loaded with drugs to help burn victims heal faster.  </p>

            <p>While the method of using fish gelatine in this way isn’t new, Edward is trying a novel technique that bypasses the need to extract the gelatine, and instead goes straight from the freeze-dried ground-up fish waste to the jelly-like skin.  </p>
        
            <p>The lab’s ‘beer research’ focuses not on the alcoholic drink, but on the spent grain generated in the beer brewing process.  </p>
        
            <p>PhD candidate Ha Minh Quoc uses a freeze-drier to remove any moisture from the brewer’s spent grain. Once he has dried out the grains, and ground them to a powder, he adds bacteria in. The bacteria (and the enzymes they contain) chop up proteins found in the grain, producing molecules with bioactive properties.  </p>

            <p>These bioactive molecules are small bits of protein (peptides) that can carry out many different important functions in our cells. For example, bioactive peptides might help fight off germs, reduce high blood pressure, lower blood fats, act as antioxidants, or help ward off obesity, diabetes or ageing.  </p>
        
            <p>Bioactive peptides are found naturally in fermented foods such as tempeh, yoghurt and whey protein – but they are also added to different food or pharmaceuticals to enhance them. Early investigations done in the lab have shown that some useful bioactive peptides can be made using the brewer’s spent grain.  </p>

            <p>Why do somethings taste good together, and others not so much? Listen to Justin Gregory’s The recipe for food pairing to find out.  </p>
        
            <p>Eating is a sensory experience, as Alison Ballance learned in How sound influences the taste of food.  </p>
        
            <p>Bioengineers at the University of Otago are also using 3D bioprinters to investigate how to promote wound healing.  </p>
