            <p>Four award-winning authors are in the running for New Zealand's biggest fiction prize.</p>
        
            <p>This year's finalists for the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards include former winners Laurence Fearnley, Kirsty Gunn and Damien Wilkins, alongside Commonwealth Writer's Prize winner Tina Makereti.</p>
        
            <p>The four authors are competing for the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction, worth $65,000.</p>
        
            <p>Fearnley's At The Grand Glacier Hotel tells the story of Libby, a woman recovering from cancer who is separated from her partner Curtis during a storm at the titular South Island hotel. Fearnley won the prize in 2011 for her novel The Hut Builder.</p>
        
            <p>This year, Kirsty Gunn is nominated for her short story collection Pretty Ugly, after previously winning Book of the Year in 2013 with The Big Music.</p>

            <p>The Mires by Tina Makereti follows three neighbours with differing backgrounds and histories living in a coastal New Zealand town as they grapple with extremist views in their community.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether set in the Scottish Highlands, at the Fox Glacier, or on the Kāpiti Coast, each of these finalists evoked a visceral and often lyrical sense of place," convenor of judges Thom Conroy said in a statement announcing the finalists.</p>
