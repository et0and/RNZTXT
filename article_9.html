        <h2>High blood pressure and no time to exercise? Try wall squats</h2>
        <p>
A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests isometric exercises like wall sitting (or wall squats) help reduce blood pressure more effectively than other forms of exercise. Audio

            <p>According to the Stroke Foundation one in five New Zealanders has high blood pressure, putting them at increased risk of strokes and other conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Smoking, obesity and poor diet can all raise your blood pressure - but you don’t need to exercise to excess to get it down.</p>
        
            <p>According to research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, isometric exercises like wall squats can tackle it more effectively than other forms of exercise – including weight training, high-intensity intervals (HIIT), and simple aerobic movements.   </p>

            <p>One of the study’s authors is Jonathan Wiles. He told Sunday Morning that isometric exercise is activity that generates tension in the muscle without changing its length.</p>
        
            <p>In everyday life this might be carrying two heavy shopping bags at arms length; at the gym it would be wall squats, or wall sitting.</p>
        
            <p>So why are wall squats so effective?</p>
        
            <p>In isometric exercises, there is a constant force in the muscle that restricts blood flow and oxygen delivery over a sustained period of time, Dr Wiles says.</p>
        
            <p>“We normally perform two-minute bouts of isometric exercise. So … as the muscle oxygen-levels drop, our brain desperately tries to send more blood to the muscle to stop it fatiguing.</p>
        
            <p>“However, the blood delivery is obstructed like water trying to flow through a flattened hose pipe. So as soon as the isometric exercise or the isometric contraction ends, not only is the restriction released … but our bodies are very clever and the blood vessels actively widen, allowing a big rush of blood to the area that's been exercising to help it recover.</p>
        
            <p>“And since we've only got a certain amount of blood in our bodies, suddenly sending more of it to a large area like the legs - in the case of the wall squat - causes a transient [short-term] drop in our blood pressure.”</p>
        
            <p>When that sequence is repeated regularly, it's thought to be the best way to achieve long-term blood pressure reduction, he said.</p>
        
            <p> The research stemmed from observations of people whose jobs had a high isometric component but were less likely to have high blood pressure.</p>
        
            <p>To benefit from squats, you didn’t need to be leaning at a 90-degree angle either, he says.</p>
        
            <p>“What we recommend is that people just lean in against the wall in an upright position and then … if people just squat halfway between being upright and 90 degrees - approximately 135 degrees - and [then] drop just enough to make it uncomfortable.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably about 2cm more - and it's that little 2cm extra drop - the halfway plus - that makes the difference and gets you about the right height.”</p>
        
            <p>Wall squats or similar exercises could have benefits for people who couldn’t – or wouldn’t – do the recommended 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“It’s 24 minutes of exercise a week in total… I think you can appreciate there's a huge difference between those two amounts of time investment.</p>
        
            <p>“So when we've looked at unmedicated, pre-hypertensive – that’s those  people who are heading towards having clinically high blood pressure - we've seen reductions of 12mm of mercury systolic and 6mm of mercury diastolic following about four weeks of training.”</p>
        
            <p>Such activity was arguably better than blood pressure drugs, but without the potential side effects. You don’t even need special gear or clothing for squats, he added.</p>
        
            <p>“All you need is a stable wall with a bit of space, enough to fit your back against it, and then basically you need a non-slip floor or non-slip shoes and nothing else other than that to be able to perform a squat.”</p>
