            <p>The Brutalist, Wicked and low-budget indie Anora won big at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Awards were given out in 24 categories. The best picture went to Anora, which was made with a $10 million budget, a sliver of the money used to create the other nominees. Adrian Brody won for Best Actor for his work in the Brutalist and Mikey Madison won Best Actress for Anora, denying Demi Moore who was expected to win for the Substance.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some of the blink-and-you-will-missed-it moments that made the Oscars:</p>
