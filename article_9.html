        <h2>Do you really need a top sheet in bed?</h2>
        <p>
As long as you wash your duvet cover regularly, microbiology professor Rietie Venter says it's pretty much just as hygienic to go without.

            <p>Sometimes I think I'm conflict-averse but then someone says there's no need for a top sheet and suddenly I'm ready for battle.</p>
        
            <p>Call me a traditionalist, but as a Queenslander, I like my top - or flat - piece of linen, to cover me on those (many) hot nights.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond personal preference, we asked experts if there were any benefits to using a top sheet when it came to hygiene, and how often you should clean your sheets.</p>
        
            <p>Most of us use top sheets, according to our scientific study (aka Instagram straw poll).</p>
        
            <p>Of 3042 votes on the ABC Lifestyle account, 72 percent said they used one.</p>
        
            <p>Users said a flat sheet helped keep their doona or duvet cleaner for longer, was a good light cover on hot nights, and was a "hygienic" practice.</p>
        
            <p>Those against a top sheet in bed cited reasons including tangling, extra items to wash, and a longer time spent making the bed.</p>
        
            <p>"Pointless," wrote one user.</p>
        
            <p>Our stats are in line with what Kate Croukamp has observed when making beds. She owns a cleaning business in Australia's Gold Coast/Yugambeh language region and is pro-top-sheet for her own bed.</p>
        
            <p>"I see more people with top sheets than not."</p>
        
            <p>Croukamp believes top sheets came about out of necessity because washing a doona is not always as simple as taking the cover off.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in the day, it was the whole doona or blanket you had to wash. To avoid that, a top sheet came into play."</p>
        
            <p>Croukamp said in cooler parts of Australia, you might see less of a desire for top sheets.</p>
        
            <p>"I lived in the UK and [many] don't do top sheets because it's always cold."</p>
        
            <p>Rietie Venter is an associate professor and head of the microbiology laboratory at the University of South Australia.</p>
        
            <p>She doesn't use a top sheet.</p>
        
            <p>"I really don't like them - for non-microbiology reasons. They just get tangled and in the way."</p>
        
            <p>But Venter said there may be a "slight benefit" to using a top sheet.</p>
        
            <p>"It's another layer between you and the duvet.</p>
        
            <p>"It's true sweat and [bacteria] could get through to the duvet itself, but like in my case I just prefer to wash the duvet cover as frequently as I would have washed a sheet."</p>
        
            <p>She said most of the germs living in our beds are normal skin microbiomes that keep us healthy anyway.</p>
        
            <p>"Those things tend not to make you ill unless you are immunocompromised.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing that is more troublesome is microbiomes like fungi."</p>
        
            <p>Venter said if there is dampness or wetness, such as sweat, in sheets, fungi can grow and make spores, which can spread and make people ill.</p>
        
            <p>"But in general, it's not a problem."</p>

What you wear to bed might also affect how often you should wash your sheets.

            <p>Ashley Franks, a professor of applied and environmental microbiology at La Trobe University in Melbourne, likes a top sheet.</p>
        
            <p>"I prefer the feeling of a sheet on me, rather than being completely open to the air [when it's too hot for a doona]," Franks said.</p>
        
            <p>He said in hot and humid climates, bacteria is more likely to grow in our beds but this isn't a real danger to most people.</p>
        
            <p>How often you wash your top sheet or doona cover comes down to climate and other things, like whether you shower at night, said Venter.</p>
        
            <p>"For most people who don't sweat hugely, once a week or every two weeks should be fine."</p>
        
            <p>Franks said what you wear to bed might also affect how often you should wash your sheets. A nude sleeper, as opposed to someone who wears pyjamas, might find their linen needs changing more frequently.</p>
        
            <p>He said your body will usually show signs if your washing frequency is an issue.</p>
        
            <p>"If you get rashes or skin conditions, that will tell you something is going on.</p>
        
            <p>"But a lot of people don't bother [washing their bed linen regularly] and nothing happens. You might be in filth, but it's your own filth."</p>
